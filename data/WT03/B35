N.J. EXPANDS PSE&G STANDARD OFFER PLAN TO 150 MW FOR 1996-97, AT AVOIDED
COST

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has voted to continue Public
Service Electric & Gas' ``standard offer'' program, and has expanded the
offering for 1996-97 (Docket No. EE95090415).
   Under the plan, PSE&G makes blocks of capacity available for energy
savings and pays its avoided cost to demand-side management projects. The
program began in 1993, when the utility opened a 150-MW block through 1995,
and in its recent order, the BPU expanded that to 185 MW for projects
submitted by Jan. 2, 1996. For its 1996 DSM plan, PSE&G had proposed
opening a new one-year, 75-MW block (DSR, 12 Oct '95, 1), but the BPU
expanded that to 150 MW for 1996-97.
   The new 150-MW offer will be broken into three 50-MW blocks, which will
provide declining payments, since additional capacity will reduce the value
of savings to the company, and thereby, its avoided cost. That figure now
stands at $5.45/kW/month for capacity and about 2.6 cents/kWh for energy.
However, the first 50-MW block of the new standard offer will set prices
27% lower, while the second block will be priced 33% below Standard Offer
No. 1 and the third block will be set 38% below it.
   Although Standard Offer No. 2 is set at 150 MW, the BPU made allowance
for a fourth block with no defined MW size, at prices that would be 44%
lower than Standard Offer No. 1. In addition, there will be a 15-MW
residential ``carve-out,'' with at least half of that reserved for
low-income residences. For those projects, prices will be set 14% higher
than Standard Offer No. 1 for the first half of the contract period, and
33% lower for the second half.
   Further, PSE&G will accept up to 10 MW of fuel-switching projects, but
only at government-owned facilities. It will also accept up to 1 MW of
projects that displace electric air conditioning in summer with chillers
powered by waste heat from cogeneration plants. These must involve existing
cogeneration facilities that exceed 50% efficiency, and they must not
result in incremental fuel use or emissions.
   If New Jersey opens up retail competition, PSE&G will continue to make
standard offer payments to projects whose hosts choose an electric supplier
other than the utility. However, that pledge would only apply if PSE&G is
still allowed to recover its standard offer payments through some type of
system benefits charge. DSM advocates in many states are lobbying for such
charges on distribution services, to maintain efficiency programs in the
face of retail access.
   In the standard offer program, projects are accepted on a first-come,
first-served basis, though they must be qualified by PSE&G for technical
merit and savings potential. They may be installed by users themselves, or
by energy service companies. One ESCO that is active in the program is
PSE&G's own subsidiary, Public Service Conservation Resources Corp.
(PSCRC), which works with customers on standard offer projects and provides
financing.
   In pushing for the continuation of its standard offer program, PSE&G
argued that the market-based approach fits well in the rapidly deregulating
industry. It told the BPU that ``given the right information, price signals
and product and service options, consumers are in the best position to make
decisions about how they should use and conserve energy.''
   It added that the ``decentralized decision-making of a market economy''
would stimulate innovation and reduce costs.
   There is no set budget for the standard offer program, since it will
depend on how much savings PSE&G purchases. However, the BPU approved a
$33-million, two-year budget for the utility to continue some ``core''
programs, such as rebates for lighting and air conditioning retrofits.
   PSE&G's plan was applauded by DSM advocates, including the Mid-Atlantic
Energy Project and N.J. Public Interest Research Group, who also praised
the utility's willingness to work with them. ``PSE&G's DSM plan, and the
process by which it was developed, should serve as a model for other
utilities in New Jersey and around the country,'' stated Daniel Rosenblum,
director of the Mid-Atlantic Energy Project.

CALIF. RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL CALLS ON LAWMAKERS TO ENACT DSM SURCHARGE

   The California Public Utilities Commission called on the California
Legislature to enact a nonbypassable ``public goods'' surcharge on retail
electricity sales to fund energy efficiency and research and development
programs in a competitive electric industry.
   The PUC made the recommendation in its final restructuring order issued
December 20. The commission also recommended that the Legislature adopt a
separate universal surcharge to fund low-income weatherization programs
currently funded through utility demand-side management budgets.
   The commission gave the Legislature, Governor, stakeholders, and the
public 100 days to comment on its decision while the PUC establishes a
``road map'' for implementing restructuring in California. ``Given the
Legislature's role in creating these programs, we do not view it
appropriate to alter them significantly without Legislative guidance,'' the
PUC stated.
   The PUC plans to adopt a funding level, establish an independent
administrator for the DSM and R&D funds, and work out other details during
the implementation phase of restructuring. However, the PUC suggested that
the public goods surcharge should be equal to three percent of total
revenues from electricity sales in California.
   The PUC noted that while support for a nonbypassable surcharge to fund
energy efficiency and conservation programs remained strong, stakeholders
disagreed on the types of programs that should be funded and the
appropriate funding levels.
   The PUC specified that funding for energy efficiency programs should
focus on activities not provided by the competitive market that are in the
broad public interest and designed to transform the energy efficiency
market. The commission conceded that delineating between competitive and
other DSM activities will be difficult.
   ``We do not intend for the surcharge to collect funds to pursue energy
efficiency activities that the competitive market will provide on its
own,'' the PUC said. However, the commission observed that ``many programs
with a market transformation, information, or education focus are not
likely to be provided by the competitive market.''
   While acknowledging that there are various definitions of market
transformation activities, the commission concluded that it was appropriate
to use public funding to ensure that consumers have information about
managing their energy use. Residential and small business customers
generally have a greater need for these public programs than large
customers, which have greater resources available to manage their energy
use, the PUC noted. Moreover, financial incentives to develop the market
for energy efficient products and services, such as the Super-Efficient
Refrigerator Program and manufacturer rebates for fluorescent light-bulbs
and high-efficiency motors should continue, the PUC suggested. ``We expect
that public funding would be needed only for specified and limited periods
of time, to cause the market to be transformed,'' the PUC said.
   The PUC adopted a two-track approach to continuing DSM funding in a
competitive industry. In the short-term the commission plans to utilize the
utilities' expertise in administering DSM programs. However, after a short
transition period, the PUC plans to establish an independent, nonprofit
organization to collect the surcharge and allocate the funds competitively
to ensure equal opportunity for non-utility energy service companies.
   The PUC anticipates that by January 1, 1997 DSM costs will no longer be
embedded in electric rates but will be collected as part of the public
goods surcharge on retail electricity sales. Initially, the surcharge
should be a line item on utility bills corresponding to each utility's
authorized DSM funding in their service area. In time the PUC intends for
the same surcharge to be applied consistently throughout the state.
   The commission plans to hold workshops to provide guidance on
establishing the DSM programs that will be funded through the surcharge,
the details of the independent administrator and transition period, and how
utility expertise can be utilized.
   ``This guidance should be considered a starting point and not final,''
the PUC said. ``If the workshops flesh out the two tracks in more detail
and identify areas where public funding should be expanded or limited, we
will consider modifying our decision.''
   The PUC noted that the California Energy Commission is also
deliberating--through its Energy Services Working Group--how best to
promote energy efficiency in a competitive electric industry. The CEC
working group has recommended a surcharge to fund DSM and energy efficiency
R&D beginning January 1, 1996 while supporting more market-driven funding
approaches. The working group recommended that the PUC continue to oversee
utility DSM expenditures until 1998 while market structure details are
worked out.

MANY STATES REJECT EPACT STANDARDS ON DSM, IRP AND EFFICIENCY IN SUPPLY

   Many states have rejected the efficiency guidelines set down in the 1992
Energy Policy Act (EPACT), saying they conflict with existing state
regulations, according to a recent survey.
   St. Louis consulting firm Brubaker & Associates Inc. (BAI) polled state
commissions and found that almost twice as many states rejected the EPACT
standards as adopted them. However, most commissions took no action,
explaining that they were already in compliance with the standards before
EPACT was passed by Congress in 1992.
   In Section 111 of the act, Congress stated three efficiency standards
(7,8 and 9): integrated resource planning (IRP) should be employed by each
utility, and plans should be updated regularly, providing for public
participation; investments in conservation and demand-side management
should be at least as profitable as supply-side resources, giving
consideration to reduced sales, and should be monitored and evaluated;
energy efficiency investments in power generation and supply should be
encouraged by providing incentives for better maintenance and investments
in efficient generation, transmission and distribution.
   EPACT called for states to consider these guidelines and determine
whether adopting them would be consistent with state law. States were also
told to determine whether adopting the standards would advance conservation
and maintain equitable rates to electricity consumers. The act set a
deadline of Oct. 24, 1995 for these investigations.
   In its survey, Brubaker found that 12 states rejected the IRP standard,
seven adopted it and most others said they were already in compliance (some
had not yet ruled). Similarly, 12 states rejected the criterion for
investments in DSM, while 7 states adopted it and others either said they
were already in compliance or had not yet addressed the issue. On
efficiency in generation, 12 states rejected while only five adopted.
   States that rejected all three standards are: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas,
Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia. Those that adopted all three standards
are: Florida, Idaho, Oklahoma and Wyoming. However, several others adopted
the IRP and DSM standards, while rejecting or reaching no decision the last
one, including Colorado, Connecticut and Indiana. Those states that said
they were already in compliance with all standards are: Georgia, Hawaii,
Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina and Vermont.

PS COLORADO OFFERS GAS DRYER REBATES

   Public Service Colorado has inaugurated a natural gas dryer rebate
program that provides $70 to first-time buyers or those replacing an
electric clothes dryer.
   The two-month program expiring Dec. 31, 1995 is part of the company's
demand-side management efforts to help customers use energy wisely.
   ``Customers can dry almost three loads of laundry in a natural gas dryer
for what it costs to dry one load in an electric dryer,'' said Kathy
Worthington, marketing program leader at PS Colorado. The offer is
available only to residential customers of the company.

PEPCO PROVIDES $250,000 TO NON-PROFITS

   Potomac Electric Power spent $250,000 in 1995 to help subsidize the
weatherization of homes belonging to low-income and senior customers. Over
the past 12 years, the utility has helped weatherize more than 20,000
homes, working in conjunction with charitable groups.
   Under its Community Conservation Program, the company awarded contracts
worth $250,000 in 1995 to non-profit, community-based organizations to do
the work. Matching funds from private organizations brought the total
budget up to about $1-million for the year.

N.Y. ALJ BACKS SYSTEM BENEFITS CHARGE TO FUND DSM AS COMPETITION OPENS UP

   An administrative law judge at the New York Public Service Commission
has recommended imposing a mechanism to fund demand-side management as the
state opens up competition. She also emphasized wholesale, rather than the
retail competition that DSM advocates fear would encourage cheap, dirty
power.
   ALJ Judith Lee issued her proposed decision in the PSC's Competitive
Opportunities case (No. 94-E-0952). In it, she stated that ``Retail
competition has the potential to benefit all customers by providing greater
choice among their electricity providers, as well as increased pricing and
reliability options. But retail access brings with it significant risks and
requires considerable caution, and should be provided only if it is in the
best interests of all consumers.''
   With that note of caution, she urged the PSC to establish wholesale
competition first, ``with an eye toward adding retail access as rapidly as
possible once a market is established and reliability is ensured.''
However, she offered no time frame for the transition, and retail wheeling
advocates--such as large industrials--bitterly condemned the decision,
saying it gives utilities veto power over moves toward retail access.
   In earlier comments in the case, DSM advocates joined the utilities in
endorsing a wholesale pool, rather than retail access (DSR, 9 Nov '95, 7).
They argued that deregulation ``must protect the long-term economic and
environmental health of the state, and not focus entirely on short-term
price considerations.'' With a wholesale pool, they said, regulators would
have more control over resource choices, and could insist that distribution
utilities acquire a certain amount of DSM and renewables. They could also
impose a ``system benefits charge'' on retail rates to fund DSM and
renewables.
   But even if retail competition were allowed, distribution utilities
would still deliver power from outside producers, and regulators could
impose the system benefits charge or ``wires charge'' on those deliveries,
the efficiency groups said. In her proposed decision, Judge Lee opened the
door for the option: ``Any restructuring model should include a mechanism
for recovering costs required to be spent on environmental and other public
policy considerations.''
   The ALJ ruling was praised by David Wooley, executive director of Pace
Energy Project, at the Pace University Center for Environmental Legal
Studies in White Plains, N.Y. He said Judge Lee was ``appropriately
cautionary'' about the transition to retail competition. Further, ``She has
clearly endorsed a system benefits charge, and that was one of our main
objectives,'' he told Demand-Side Report.
   Wooley foresees a system benefits charge of 1.5-2 mills/kWh, which he
said would have a minimal rate impact. The funds could be administered by a
non-profit entity, a ``quasi-governmental'' entity whose board would
contain representatives of all customer sectors. Wooley does not rule out
utilities overseeing DSM efforts, but he fears any link between the
distribution company and its generation affiliate, which might oppose DSM.
``It's not impossible to erect barriers, but we're concerned because the
generating company would see DSM as competition, just it would see other
generators as competition,'' he said.
   Wooley is skeptical of the argument--often advance by retail competition
advocates--that in an open market, energy service companies would
proliferate to replace utility DSM programs. ``It's not at all clear that
ESCOs would arise to take over the conservation efforts,'' he said.
``Especially during a transition period, you need mechanisms to jump-start
the market.''
   Eventually, the system benefits charge could shrink, Wooley said, but he
added, ``There will always be a place for this to bring new technologies to
the market.'' He said the 1.5-2 mills/kWh surcharge is a ``reasonable''
proposal that could benefit everyone if it is administered well.
   On that note, Wooley dismissed the notion put forth by large users that
they are non-participants in most of the programs. ``Anyone who buys
commercial lighting has benefited from DSM efforts,'' he said. ``The market
has advanced, and what is standard now is very different from what was
standard a few years ago.'' To continue that market transformation, DSM
funds could go to equipment manufacturers, as well as users, to subsidize
efficiency upgrades in their product lines, he said.

UTILITIES MUST SHIFT INDUSTRIAL DSM TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, REPORT ADVISES

   Although utilities are under pressure to cut costs in the competitive
market, they must view industrial demand-side management as a means of
retaining these customers in that same tough environment, according to a
recent report.
   However, DSM must be shifted from a ``resource procurement'' strategy to
a customer-service approach, says IRT Environment Inc.. The Basalt, Colo.,
information and consulting firm surveyed manufacturers and utilities and
found that they are far apart on what industrial DSM should include.
   The problem is urgent, IRT says, because industrials are utilities'
``least captive'' customers, with options for fuel switching, cogeneration,
and shifting loads to other regions. Most of them are unhappy paying for
DSM in the first place, and say they do not even get much for these rate
hikes. Many large manufacturers have been pursuing energy conservation for
years, IRT notes, and they condemn rate-based DSM as a subsidy for
others--including competing industrial firms that have not taken the same
initiative. ``Utilities have been regarded by many industrial customers as
vestiges of a socialist system, monopolies used to deliver not only
electricity but public policy,'' IRT says.
   Part of the problem is that utility DSM programs are often rigid,
providing audits and rebates for motors and lighting, but not improving
processes, the report notes. This type of work is much more difficult
because processes can differ greatly from industry to industry, and even
from company to company within an industry. Process improvements demand the
kind of customized services that utilities must provide in the more
competitive market, according to the report. These should transcend energy
efficiency, and also focus on productivity improvements and pollution
control, IRT advises. However, utilities are still likely to encounter
hostility. In interviewing industrials, IRT found that some doubt utilities
are capable of providing effective energy services, since they have no
entrepreneurial skills. They think utilities should just get out of the way
and stop hiking rates for programs that are unwanted. At best, utilities
can promote efficiency through information, cost-based rates and financing,
some firms said.
   To overcome industrial skepticism, some utilities are contracting with
existing energy service companies or even acquiring existing ESCOs. They
may offer energy services outside of rate base through unregulated
subsidiaries. Others are using consultants with expertise in particular
industries to help their customers.
   Another approach is taken by Niagara Mohawk Power in New York, which
allows industrials to opt out of DSM rebate programs and avoid the rate
impact. However, the utility will link these customers with private ESCOs,
and will help them line up financing for efficiency projects. Meanwhile,
Detroit Edison has made efficiency part of the long-term supply contracts
it has signed with the ``Big 3'' automakers. The utility will provide 38
on-site energy managers, and has already seen $1-million in savings at
several facilities in a limited test of the program.
   The report, ``Industrial Efficiency Programs: Building Strategic
Partnerships,'' is available for $100 from The Results Center, IRT
Environment Inc., P.O. Box 2239, Basalt, Colo. 81621; (970) 927-3155.

NRDC PUSHING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PLAN IN LONG ISLAND LIGHTING RESTRUCTURING

   The Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups are lobbying the
Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) to emphasize energy efficiency in its
restructuring of Long Island Lighting.
   Concerned by the utility's high rates--averaging 15.3 cents/kWh--and
their impact on the economy, New York Gov. George Pataki has called for the
dismantling of the utility. He recently proposed a plan that calls for LIPA
to take over LILCO's distribution system, auction off its generating
plants, and shop around for the cheapest power in the wholesale market.
   However, NRDC, the Long Island Citizens Advisory Panel (CAP) and other
DSM proponents stress that the governor's plan only predicts 12% rate
reductions, which will not nearly bring rates in line with regional or
national averages. The only way to help businesses and residences is to cut
their bills by aggressively pursuing DSM, they argue (DSR, 7 Dec, 3).
   Presenting the breakup plan, neither Gov. Pataki nor LIPA chairman James
Gill mentioned energy efficiency. However, Ashok Gupta, senior energy
economist for New York-based NRDC, told Demand-Side Report that he has
gotten a good reception at LIPA and has further meetings planned for early
in the new year.
   In an outline of its Long Island Energy Efficiency Initiative, NRDC
notes that the State Energy Plan estimates the savings potential on Long
Island at $400-million per year, but ``without technical and financial
assistance, these economic investments appear difficult, risky and
expensive,'' it warns. Some subsidies are needed because ``High transaction
costs, scarcity and cost of capital, lack of expertise, split incentives
and other related hurdles stand in the way of private-sector investment in
energy efficiency.''
   To overcome those hurdles, NRDC has proposed a fund that would financed
through through a 0.2 cents/kWh rate surcharge. That would raise
$32-million per year over five years, or $160-million, which could be
administered by LIPA and the New York Power Authority (NYPA). However, all
energy services and products would be delivered by private energy service
companies.
   Incentives would serve as a marketing tool for ESCOs, and these would be
made available on a first-come, first-served basis, so that ``energy
service companies will in essence race to enroll new projects, generating a
quick market upsurge,'' NRDC predicts. LIPA, or whatever entity takes over
LILCO's distribution system, would let ESCOs collect payments from
consumers through their monthly electric bills.
   Part of the efficiency fund could be used to guarantee loans by private
lenders, to make capital more accessible and hold down interest rates,
according to the plan. The financial institutions could collect these loans
through electric bills, and payments could be timed so that users pay them
off through energy savings.
   In addition, LIPA could provide ``energy savings advances.'' Under this
scheme, when consumers sign contracts with ESCOs, they would be given
interest-free advances of 10% of their total investment, to be repaid
through future bills.
   The initiative would also provide coupons to cut the cost of purchases,
such as efficient lighting, refrigerators and other appliances. ``Though
purchases of such equipment often pay for themselves out of saved energy
costs, their higher up-front cost often deters consumers,'' NRDC notes.
Some coupons could be given to landlords, to encourage efficient purchases,
since renters usually have no say in their appliances, even though they pay
the bills. Other funds could be used to support design assistance for
architects and builders, and to accelerate the introduction of new
technologies.
   Overall, NRDC sees the initiative providing an additional 10% reduction
in energy bills, as well as stimulating private-sector investment worth
$1-billion, helping businesses become more competitive and creating jobs in
energy services and construction.

CONSULTANTS SEE NEED FOR UTILITIES TO RETHINK TRADITIONAL BUSINESS

   ``Electric utilities are dead,'' according to Mitch Diamond, vice
president, energy group, at Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc., the New York
City-based consulting firm.
   In their stead are a number of distinct businesses that traditional
investor-owned utilities can choose to participate in or not as the
industry restructures, Diamond said. Whereas utilities now vertically
integrate generation, transmission, distribution and customer service,
these and other business functions will evolve into separate business
enterprises, in the form of power production companies, regional network
operators, bulk power traders, distribution system operators and retail
power marketers.
   Diamond made his remarks at the ``Competitive Analysis and Benchmarking
for Power Companies'' conference last month, sponsored by the Boston-based
Center for Business Intelligence in Washington D.C. The conference brought
together a number of consultants and utility executives to talk about the
integration of competitive intelligence techniques into the utility
industry as restructuring and deregulation progresses.
   Diamond said utilities should concentrate on organizing themselves to do
better in the future what they have already done in the past. To accomplish
this, a lot of analysis and hard thinking will be required, he said. He
suggested that executives decide which parts of the business they are best
at and concentrate on them, leaving the parts that they are weakest at to
other companies.
   He cautioned against a strategy pursued by several major utilities in
the industry: going overseas to build power plants in developing countries.
``Your business is not to go build plants in Argentina,'' he said, ``but to
be better in the business you're now in, here in the states.''
   To back up his claim, he presented data suggesting that the best
performers in different industries consistently outperform by wide margins
the average performance within those industries. In effect, he said,
pursuing international development opportunities may provide short-term
windfalls, but to the possible detriment of the work necessary to excel at
home.
   And to excel in the native market, he said, utilities must become more
customer-sensitive and willing to tailor their services to individual
customers' needs. In his company's analysis, he said it was discovered
that, across a variety of industries, customers switch providers as much,
if not more so, because of poor service as because of price differences. He
said the way to ensure the least amount of customer flight is to treat
customers as individuals, learn their individual needs and respond to them.
That way, when a new supplier woos them, the bond of loyalty and
recognition will be harder to break.
   Also speaking at the conference was Sanford Cohen, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch, who presented a regional analysis of how 50 utilities stand in terms
of their industrial power prices.
   In the mid-Atlantic region, Merrill Lynch found that Allegheny Power,
with ``among the lowest price and cost structures in the nation,'' was
strongest, with Baltimore Gas & Electric, Pennsylvania Power and & Light,
DQE and PECO Energy also strong. The analyst forecast that PECO Energy,
Public Service Enterprise Group and DQE would soon bring their current high
prices ``in-line with regional averages.'' Most at risk because of
competition in the region were General Public Utilities and Public Service
Electric & Gas.
   The Midwest, Merrill Lynch said, is ``another area that is primed for
competition.'' It noted Ohio Edison, Detroit Edison and DQE as expected
good performers. Most at risk is CMS Energy.
   In the Northeast, the analyst firm found no utilities in good
competitive positions. ``By national standards,'' it said, ``all of the
utilities in the Northeast have high prices. These price levels are not
going unnoticed by customers in the region. More than any other region, the
problems of the Northeast are homogeneous and it is in each utility's
interest to stall retail wheeling as long as possible.'' It picked
Northeast Utilities as the utility with the greatest chance to improve its
position.
   In the Southeast, Merrill Lynch picked Carolina Power & Light as most
likely to improve, although it is currently ``the weakest of regional
competitors. Improvements in nuclear performance coupled with large
reductions in O&M budgets over the next several years should help improve
the company's cost structure. Prices will also decline dramatically due to
the expiration of riders for nuclear investment recovery, as well as
expected discounting for industrial customers.'' It picked Southern Company
and Duke Power as presently best equipped to handle competition.
   In the region including Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the analyst found
that Entergy is showing the greatest improvement. It said its analysis in
this region was otherwise incomplete.
   And in the West, the analyst found that California utilities are highly
at risk because of power-purchase contracts and commitments to costly
nuclear facilities, a situation not likely to improve, despite ``heroic
efforts...to reduce price levels,'' because of the huge interconnected grid
in the West availing customers of cheaper supplies from Canada and Mexico
and elsewhere in the region.

COINCIDENT PEAK RATES HELP N.C. MUNI LOWER ITS WHOLESALE POWER COSTS

   The municipal utility in Greenville, N.C., said that
coincident-peak-based rates it charges all large industrial, commercial and
institutional customers has helped the muni realize significant savings in
its wholesale power costs, which are based in large part on Greenville's
peak demand each month.
   The Greenville Utilities Commission, as the muni is known, also said it
hopes to trim peak-period demand even more with a residential time-of-use
rate available beginning this month to 200 partipants in a pilot test.
   Roger Jones, general manager of the Greenville muni, said all muni
customers that demand 750 kW or more now pay one of three coincident peak
(CP) rates: An ``A'' rate for those whose energy use must be relatively
constant; a ``B'' rate for those with more flexibility; and a ``C'' rate
for those willing and able to make significant reductions in their energy
use during coincident peaks.
   Under each rate, the customer pays a basic monthly charge of $440, plus
a relatively high per/kW rate for its demand during the 60 minutes each
month when the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency (NCEMPA)--the
muni's wholesale supplier--experiences its highest systemwide demand.
   The customer also pays a much smaller per/kW charge for difference
between that coincident-peak level and its highest demand for all that
month, plus energy charges.
   For instance, under the ``C'' rate, a 3-MW customer that reduces its
coincident-peak demand to 1 MW pays a $440 basic charge, plus demand
charges of $21.34/kW on the 1-MW coincident-peak demand and $2.86/kW on the
2 MW above that level. The customer also pays an energy charge of 3.323
cents/kWh.
   Jones said that the muni's 750-kW and higher customers together account
for about one-quarter of Greenville's total energy use, and that the CP
rates have encouraged them to reduce their peak-period demand by 15 to 20%
from what it typically would have been without the CP rates.
   He noted that reduction translates directly into savings in the
wholesale power costs paid by Greenville to NCEMPA, which buys most of its
power from Carolina Power & Light.
   The magnitude of reductions in coincident-peak demand varied widely from
customer to customer, the muni manager said. Some are able only to trim
their demand slightly, while others have been ``very aggressive'' and have
slashed peak-period demand by more than 50%.
   One large industrial customer that typically demands about 8 MW reduces
its demand to between 1 and 1.5 MW during coincident peaks, Jones noted,
saving both the customer and the muni thousands of dollars in monthly power
costs.
   The residential time-of-use rate program Greenville is now pilot-testing
also is aimed at reducing peak-period demand and wholesale power costs.
   Jones said the pilot requires that participants sign up for the muni's
``Beat-the-Peak'' load-management program, under which load-control
switches are placed on customers' heat pumps, electric furnaces, central
air conditioners and electric water heaters, and those devices are remotely
switched off during peak periods.
   The TOU program sets on-peak and off-peak energy-use hours for three
different times of the year. On-peak hours are 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. during the
months of January, February, March, November and December; 1 p.m. to 7 p.m.
in May, June, July, August and September; and 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
to 7 p.m. in April and October.
   Participants pay a basic customer charge of $13.09/month, plus 6.449
cents/kWh for off-peak energy and 17.402 cents/kWh for on-peak energy. The
standard residential rate, in comparison, features a basic customer charge
of $8.09/month, plus energy charges of 9.473 cents for all kWh used from
July through October, and 8.257 cents for all kWh used the rest of the
year.
   Jones said he expects the residential TOU pilot to make at least a
slight contribution to lowering Greenville's peak-period demand, and
anticipates that after a year-long test and perhaps some adjustments, a
residential TOU rate is likely to be offered on a much wider scale in
1997.
   He added, however, that unlike the CP rate for large energy users, the
muni ``for the foreseeable future'' is likely to give residential customers
a choice between standard and a TOU rates.

SDG&E RETROFITS LIGHTS AT 175 SCHOOLS; SAVINGS ESTIMATED AT
$1.8-MILLION/YEAR

   San Diego Gas & Electric has completed an $11-million lighting retrofit
project at 175 schools in the San Diego Unified School District and
officials expect an annual savings of $1.8-million in energy bills.
   The utility said the project, largest of its type on the SDG&E system,
is expected to conserve 16.2 million kWh each year. Under SDG&E's
demand-side management incentive program, shareholders will receive about
$2-million more in earnings, the company said.
   The installations in each school included energy-efficient fluorescent
lamps, ballasts and fixtures in offices and classrooms. Also, occupancy
sensors in classrooms ensure lights are automatically turned off when not
in use. Exit signs also are saving energy with light-emitting diode kits.
   Gregg Lawless, SDG&E marketing account executive who served as team
leader for the lighting retrofit, said employees working on the project
used faster and better approaches.
   ``We broke some rules,'' Lawless said. ``The project's one-year time
line may seem long at first, but not when you recall that there are 175
schools. That's two days per school for the retrofits of all classrooms and
offices--to get done without disrupting classes.'' Lawless said, ``We
moved fast, took risks and emphasized a high level of teamwork, both
internally and with our contractors and the school district.''
   As an example, he said, SDG&E's procurement agents ``moved us through
the selection of contractors and bidding very quickly. It can be a
cumbersome process, but they did it in less than 60 days.'' Another key
factor in the project success, Lawless said, was excellent communication,
especially by SDG&E's team of energy consultants led by Kraig Akers.
   Lawless said, ``Akers and his team completed the audits for all 175
schools, they calculated the estimated energy savings and they determined
our incentives for the customer.'' On this project, he said, each energy
audit involved a representative of SDG&E, the school district and the
school district's energy consultant.
   ``The complexity of this approach,'' Lawless said, ``increased the need
for good communication. Throughout the project, we've made a point to keep
everyone up to date at all times, on all matters. It helps us to stay
focused.''
   Mike Lorch, principal of Kearny High School, said, ``There's a dramatic
change in the quality of light in classrooms and it's had a very positive
impact on morale at our school. Some teachers were so fired up, they went
out and bought supplies and painted classrooms on their own time.''

LOAD RESEARCH PROJECT SEEN MAXIMIZING DSM EFFORT FOR N.C. MUNICIPAL AGENCY

   North Carolina Municipal Power Agency No. 1, which arranges power for 19
municipal utilities in western North Carolina, said a far-reaching
load-research project it is undertaking should help the agency maximize the
effectiveness of its extensive demand-side management effort.
   Mark Otersen, NCMPA-1's supervisor of demand-side operations, said the
$250,000 project will involve the installation by this spring of new,
modified metering equipment at the agency's largest wholesale power
delivery points, as well as equipment to monitor the loads of ``well over
50'' of its munis' largest retail customers.
   The delivery-point meters--combined with telecommunications and computer
equipment to transmit and compile the meter data--will enable NCMPA-1 to
measure the demand of its muni members on a real-time, minute-by-minute
basis, he said. The customer-load monitors, in turn, will let the agency
gather information on customer demand and chart customer load
``shapes''--or patterns of demand.
   That data, Otersen said, should help NCMPA-1 design a menu of
innovative, DSM-related rates for industries with common load shapes, and
help its member munis convince large energy users of the benefits of using
such rates.
   He noted that relatively few of the large retail customers served by
munis in western North Carolina currently participate in load-management
programs that provide incentives to those who agree to let their utility
curtail or interrupt power during peak periods, or who agree to run
peak-shaving standby generators.
   With the customer-load data and newly developed rates in hand, Otersen
said, NCMPA-1 and its members ``will be able to say to a large customer,
`Here is where you are now, and here is how much you might save if you
could shift this much demand.' ''
   Also the new delivery-point meters and customer monitors could be used
to give NCMPA-1 precise data on the impact individual elements of its
overall DSM effort have on demand. For instance, he said, a muni might
implement only its load control program for standby generation, or for
residential water heaters, and be able to measure the MW difference between
demand just before controls were implemented and just after.
   In the future, with that information in hand, Otersen added, it might be
possible for NCMPA-1 and its munis to determine on some days that they only
need to implement a portion of their overall DSM effort--perhaps only
residential air-conditioner load controls--to meet their load-reduction
goals.
   Otersen and Woody Adams, the agency's power-supply manager, noted that
optimizing NCMPA-1's DSM effort really is only a side benefit of the
$250,000 load-research project, which is being undertaken primarily to
enable the agency know with considerable accuracy how much surplus energy
it has available each hour for possible sale to others on the wholesale
market.
   That knowledge will become increasingly important through the late
1990s, when the agency expects to have increasing amounts of surplus energy
available as Duke Power buys back less and less of NCMPA-1's 850-MW
entitlement to Duke's 2,200-MW Catawba nuclear power station in Clover,
S.C.

PORTLAND GENERAL TO LIMIT LIGHTING REBATES; SETS `SITE-BASED' INCENTIVES

   Portland General Electric has proposed an ``Earth Smart'' program to
provide incentives for energy-efficient commercial design; the utility will
limit its lighting rebates; and it plans to initiate ``site-based''
incentives that provide different incentives based on the sized of a
customer's facility.
   The changes to its non-residential program are not as dramatic as
expected, given that PGE has said its demand-side management target would
drop significantly in 1996, according to Lynn Plamondon, an Oregon Public
Utility Commission staff member. The company said earlier it would
make the transition from a target of 20 MW to a ``threshold goal'' of 6 MW,
which means the threshold is only a bare minimum (DSR, 28 Sept '95, 8).
   Plamondon noted that PGE's least-cost plan, which includes the proposal
to lower DSM goals, has not yet been ``acknowledged'' by the Oregon PUC.
   ``The company's goals will be controversial. Their target is up to 6 MW.
I am not sure we will go for that. I have seen the higher targets push them
to do more. If they have target of 5 or 6 MW, I am not sure they will be
pushed to do that.''
   In it proposed changes to its nonresidential programs, PGE wants to
begin the Earth Smart commercial program. ``The goal of the program is to
encourage construction of commercial buildings with the highest level of
cost-effective energy efficiency and environmental sensitivity,'' says a
commission memo.
   Earth Smart is expected to save 1.2 average megawatts annually at a
total resource cost of 2.2 cents/kWh and a utility program cost of 1.4
cents/kWh. The cost-effectiveness limit is 3.1 cents/kWh, according to the
memo.
   It will be offered at two levels: one, the ``gold'' option applies to
buildings that produce energy savings at least 30% above the Oregon Energy
Code. The ``green'' option applies to buildings yielding savings at least
20% above the code.
   Customized financial incentives for architectural design assistance, an
integrated package of energy efficient building and equipment measures and
building commissioning will be included, according to the staff memo.
Customer incentives plus other program costs are limited to either 50% of
the project's incremental costs or 2 cents/kWh, whichever is lower.
   In addition, PGE wants to revise its lighting program rebates to reflect
changes in equipment costs, practices, equipment availability and new
energy efficiency lighting measures. Lighting rebates will only go to
commercial buildings and industrial facilities of less than 20,000 square
feet. Customized incentives for lighting and other energy efficiency
measures will be available to owners of facilities larger than 20,000
square feet based on the economics of the project, according to the staff
memo.
   PGE also wants to implement different incentives based on the size of
the facility. ``The purpose of the program is to allow PGE more flexibility
in delivering energy efficiency to different target markets,'' said the
staff memo.
   Owners of buildings that are 20,000 square feet or smaller will continue
to receive incentives of up to 25% of the incremental cost for measures not
available under other demand-side management options.
   But PGE proposes to increase the minimum simple payback period from 1 to
1.5 years for measures that qualify for incentives.
   Incentives for facilities larger than 20,000 square feet will be
customized based on the economics of the project, but will not exceed 2
cents/kWh saved. ``The focus of this incentive option is on the energy
efficiency of the overall facility for proposed new construction or
retrofit projects,'' said the staff memo.
   The site-based incentives program is expected to save up to 1.4 average
MW annually. The total resource cost will be 2.9 cents/kWh and the utility
program cost will be 1.1 cents/kWh.
   The proposals are expected to be approved by the commission and go into
effect Jan. 1, 1996.

PACIFICORP OFFERS FREE EFFICIENCY MEASURES FOR ORE. APARTMENT OWNERS

   PacifiCorp has offered to provide $2.5-million in free energy-saving
measures to 10,000 apartment owners in Oregon as part of the Environmental
Technology Leadership Challenge, a national program that will be launched
in Portland, Ore., where the utility is based.
   Under the program, businesses, government organizations and non-profit
groups issue challenges designed to improve environmental quality.
   The project is sponsored by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Foundation and
funded by a number of businesses, said Curt Nichols, senior energy program
manager for the Portland Energy Office.
   The first 10,000 apartment owners who sign up will receive the free
energy-saving measures, said a spokeswoman for PacifiCorp.
   That is expected to save 2.5 MW in 1996. It is a follow-up of an earlier
program that provided free energy-saving measures to owners of multi-family
units, she said.
   In addition, PacifiCorp is working with the Portland Trail Blazers
basketball team to challenge facility managers to install state-of-the-art
energy technologies, said Nichols.
   And Philips Lighting in Portland asked public and private companies
using florescent lamps to switch to ``Econowatt'' florescent tubes that use
mercury technology.
   The lamp is said to be the first mercury florescent lamp with low
enough mercury levels to allow for non-toxic disposal.
   Similar programs will be launched in Chicago, Orlando, Fla., Chula
Vista, Calif. and Baltimore in a few weeks.

SESCO PETITIONS REGULATORS ON PG&E'S PLAN FOR OVER-COLLECTED DSM FUNDS

   SESCO Inc., the Lake Forest, N.J.-based energy service company, has
filed a protest with the California Public Utilities Commission over
Pacific Gas & Electric's proposal for distributing $23.4-million plus
interest of over-collected demand-side management funds from 1993 and
1994.
   PG&E has filed an ``advice letter'' (Document 1555-E) with the CPUC,
noting that it underspent its 1993 and 1994 electric DSM budgets by a total
of $106.9-million. The commission has already required that $83.5-million
be returned to ratepayers (Decision 94-12-047). The number was an estimate
and the CPUC directed the utility to notify it of any significant changes
in its 1994 year end balances. PG&E said it has closed out its accounts for
those years and has an additional $23.4-million in over-collected funds,
for a total of $106.9-million.
   The utility now proposes to retain the final $23.4-million and reserve
it for eventual payment to contractors participating in its ``integrated''
bidding solicitation. The pilot integrated resource bid effort is being
conducted by PG&E at the request of the CPUC to test how well supply-side
and demand-side resources can compete for the same block of capacity (DSR
13 April '95, 2; 19 Jan, 3).
   The utility maintains that if the integrated bidding contract payments
exceed the amount retained, any future unspent DSM funds would be reserved
to cover the spending. PG&E is currently engaged in contract negotiations
with 13 winning DSM bidders, representing 37 MW, at a cost of
$28.9-million, to be paid over the seven to 10 years of any completed
contracts.
   In its advice letter, PG&E said it had unsuccessfully asked the CPUC to
suspend integrated bidding because it was ``very concerned'' about entering
into long term, pay-for-performance DSM contracts at a time when the
California electric utility industry is restructuring. The utility said
that any agreement to pay for energy savings over a multi-year period could
result in an increase in stranded costs for PG&E.
   SESCO says that, while it supports the need to develop a way to deal
with the issue of long term DSM commitments under restructuring, ``we
definitely believe this advice letter is not the appropriate vehicle.'' It
notes that the utility should ``leave restructuring issues to the
restructuring docket,'' which the CPUC is considering.
   SESCO also believes that PG&E's proposal does increase rates. It also
says if a transfer of funds proceeds, the utility should provide for a
residential set aside.
   The unspent funds should be allotted at the same ratio as originally
intended, says SESCO. Residential customers provide about 35% of PG&E's
revenues, so should receive a similar portion of the unspent budget amounts
credited, says the firm. SESCO contends that the advice letter and
procedure will ``result in continuing damage to the interests of
residential customers.''
   SESCO says the 1993 and 1994 programs and budgets were approved by the
CPUC to meet needs of all ratepayers. It notes, ``instead of the transfer
of funding to an untested and unreviewed set of programs that largely
exclude residential customers, we propose that funding go to support
existing programs that have received full regulatory review and do not
discriminate against PG&E's residential customers.''

NIPSCO NEGOTIATING WITH UNNAMED PARTNER TO DEVELOP RESIDENTIAL ENERGY
SERVICES

   Northern Indiana Public Service is negotiating with an unidentified
company to develop and provide a variety of energy efficiency programs for
residential customers within its service territory.
   ``We want to give people the tools to help them manage their energy,''
said a NIPSCO spokeswoman. The Hammond-based utility has been criticized by
some consumer advocates for its less-than-enthusiastic support for
demand-side management.
   ``There's a reason for that,'' the spokeswoman told Demand-Side Report. 
``Traditional demand-side management programs, as we see them, have not
been effective.'' Consequently, if the current negotiations produce a
partnering agreement, ``we're calling it energy efficiency, not demand-side
management.''
   Whatever it is called, NIPSCO is looking to launch a pilot program in
its service territory later this year that would help residential customers
learn more about their energy usage in exchange for information about that
usage. The program would involve ``taking data you would get off a meter
and helping residential customers identify what their energy usage is,''
the spokeswoman said.
   The utility hopes to develop a ``pre-paid metering'' service it can
market to customers as well as a host of other programs, including
residential energy management. The spokeswoman declined to identify its
prospective partner except to say the company is not another utility or
utility vendor. ``We're talking about partnering with hardware and software
companies,'' she said.
   NIPSCO recently signed a five-year agreement to provide meter-reading
services to the city of Elkhart, Ind., following the completion of a
successful pilot program. Though not a DSM program, the program is an
example of how much emphasis NIPSCO is placing on meter reading, something
the utility believes it does very well.
   NIPSCO also is negotiating with other investor-owned electric utilities,
rural electric membership corporations, municipal electric systems and
water utilities to provide them with meter reading services also.

1994 SHAREHOLDER INCENTIVES APPROVED FOR SOCAL ED, PG&E, SDG&E AND SOCAL
GAS

   The California Public Utilities Commission December 20 approved
shareholder incentives for 1994 demand-side management programs of Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and
Southern California Gas. The 1995 annual earnings assessment proceeding
constitutes the first application of the PUC's new ex post protocols to
utility DSM earnings claims. Beginning with this proceeding, the PUC
implemented a more stringent framework for evaluating savings from utility
DSM prgrams, linking new comprehensive measurements to utility earnings
from DSM shareholder incentives.
   In accordance with the new rules, utility total earnings' claims will be
based on the prior program year's achievements, with per-unit savings
measured over a 7 to 10 year period after implementation of the programs.
Utilities may recover those claims in four equal installments in rates in
the first, second, fifth, and tenth years of the proceeding.
   The PUC authorized Edison to recover $7.2-million of total shareholder
earnings from its 1994 DSM programs in four equal installments over a
10-year measurement period, with recovery of 25% or $1.8-million in 1996.
Edison estimated that its 1994 DSM programs would yield $129-million of net
benefits before earnings for $99.2 million of related program
expenditures.
   Similarly, the PUC awarded PG&E $19,317,000 for its 1994 DSM shareholder
incentive earnings to be recovered in four installments over a 10-year
measurement period. The PUC authorized PG&E to recover $4,344,038 in 1996
for its electric programs and $485,213 for its gas programs. PG&E
forecasted $202.6-million of net benefits before earnings for
$158.2-million worth of DSM program expenditures in 1994.
   The PUC awarded SDG&E $8,966,100 for its 1994 DSM shareholder incentive
earnings. As with the other utilities, the PUC authorized San Diego to
recover the total amount in four installments over a 10-year measurement
period, with recovery in 1996 of $2,189,930 for its electric programs and
$183,228 for its gas programs. SDG&E forecast $64-million in net benefits
before earnings for $30.2 million of DSM program expenditures in 1994. The
PUC likewise authorized SoCalGas to recover $2,898,000 for its 1994 DSM
shareholder incentive earnings in four installments over a 10-year
measurement period, with recovery of $714,582 in 1996. SoCal Gas projected
that its 1994 DSM programs would yield $14.8-million of net benefits for
$42.8-million of program expenditures. The PUC also approved SoCal Gas'
request to recover $7,254,000 in 1996 revenue requirements due to changes
in federal and state corporate income tax liabilities as a result of 1993
federal tax reform legislation.
   The PUC directed the utilities when feasible to consider non-price
factors along with price factors in their resource procurement. To the
extent that non-price factors developed for supply-side resources in state
resource plans affect DSM programs utilities should include them in
cost-effective analyses. Non-price factors should be included in the Rate
Impact Measure test. The PUC also directed electric utilities to publish
information on transmission and distribution costs for the purpose of
quantifying avoided costs.
   Moreover, the utilities will be required to confer with the PUC's
Division of Ratepayer Advocates and other interested stakeholders to
determine the appropriate avoided costs in their annual forecasts.
   The PUC directed the utilities to utilize the avoided cost calculation
in their annual forecasts to determine benefits and related earnings for
each DSM program.
   In other action, as part of PG&E's general rate case the PUC authorized
PG&E to spend $129.42-million for DSM programs in 1996, including
$99-million for energy efficiency programs, one-third less than the
$150-million PG&E spent on conservation programs in 1994. PG&E spent an
average $155 million-a-year for conservation programs between 1990 and
1994, and an average $123-million-a-year between 1980 and 1994. The PUC
ordered PG&E to spend $5-million for programs designed to transform the
market for energy efficient residential appliances, industrial motors, and
commercial air conditioning. PG&E had opposed spending money on market
transformation programs, arguing that the benefits were difficult to
measure and noting that the PUC has not yet developed appropriate policy or
measurement protocols.
   The PUC denied the utility's plan to spend $6.5-million in expenses plus
$12-million in capital costs to install 40,000 time-of-use meters to enable
customers to take advantage of off-peak rates. The PUC determined that the
meters would likely be rendered obsolete by technological advances
following electric restructuring because they lacked the ability to provide
real-time information and cannot be read remotely.

Biomarkers Trace
Oil Spill Sources

Biomarker compounds have long been used to identify petroleum
deposits, fingerprint the sources of oil spills, and monitor the
oil weathering process. However, in highly degraded oil, many oil
components such as the n-alkanes, branched alkanes, and PAHs can be
lost and unavailable as biomarkers.

Working with the Minerals Management Service (Washington, DC; Tel:
202/208-3983), Zhendi Wang and Merv Fingas of the Emergencies
Science Div. (Environmental Technology Centre, Environment Canada,
3439 River Road, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0H3, Canada) have developed
a method of using biomarker compounds such as triterpanes and
steranes, compounds which are highly resistant to weathering. The
analytical methods were designed to identify, characterize and
quantify oil samples having various forms, natures and
concentrations.

The researchers noted that using biomarkers to track the source of
spilled oil and to monitor weathered oil has several advantages as
compared to other approaches, including the following:

    Each oil type has a different compound distribution

    Triterpanes and steranes are highly resistant to degradation

    Triterpanes and steranes are accurately measured using gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry

    Biomarker compounds are often more abundant in highly
weathered oils

    Ratios of certain biomarkers can more accurately indicate the
extent of biodegradation than the traditional methods

The study showed that sources of oil spills could be tracked by
comparing the distribution patterns of biomarker compounds and the
relative ratios of selected paired hopanes in spilled oil samples
with reference oils. The researchers found that the relative ratios
of C29-hopane to C30-hopane were more resistant to degradation than
other ratioed pairs of hopanes.

C29-Hopane and C30-hopane were often the most abundant hopanes,
allowing the most accurate measurements. Comparing the ratios of
C29-hopane to C30-hopane in weathered and unweathered oil samples
resulted in a more accurate value for the degree of biodegradation
than traditional aliphatic-isoprenoid hydrocarbon ratios.  For more
information, see "Using Biomarker Compounds to Track the Source of
Spilled Oil and to Monitor the Oil Weathering process," in LC GC
[13, No. 12, 1995].

Skylab's Reversible
Transformation

Guy I. Z. Kalocsai of Skylab International Ltd. (Valletta, Malta)
has developed a method for reversibly transforming organic
compounds into a phase more suitable for subsequent handling but
from which the original organic compounds can be readily recovered.
The invention is particularly suited for the recovery and re-use of
liquid hydrocarbons, either naturally occurring or synthetic,
and/or their derivatives, and it is expected to be especially
useful in the recovery of hydrocarbons from an oil spill and for a
variety of other applications.

Traditional methods of attempting to clean up oil spills include
(1) the use of oil-skimming boats and containment booms; (2)
bombarding the floating oil with chemical dispersants; and (3)
bioremediation, whereby oil-consuming bacteria are dumped on the
oil. However, none of these current methods are considered
satisfactory as significant quantities of the oil spilled cannot
seemingly be recovered or dispersed by any of these methods and
pollution of the environment can continue for many years
afterwards.

Kalocsai found that if a hydrocarbon(s) is contacted with one or
more particular reagents, an absorbent can be produced which
absorbs substantially all of the hydrocarbon(s). The elasticity of
the product which is formed can readily be controlled from elastic,
through viscous liquid to plastic or brittle solid in an efficient
and rapid manner. The original hydrocarbon can be readily recovered
from this product.

By using this method (U.S. Patent 5,468,261), a spilled hydrocarbon
is modified to produce an elastic compound which can be readily
retrieved from a body of water by towing, pushing or skimming the
elastic material from the surface of the water or by using spiked
rollers connected between two vessels which, on rotation, can roll
up the elastic material.

The method can be used to treat only the perimeter of an oil spill
to produce a containment barrier for the remaining, untreated
hydrocarbon,  eliminating the need for artificial booms and
barriers. A system using this method can be carried on vessels or
housed on site to prevent serious oil or similar spillage or leaks
and to be used in the neutralizing and clean-up or salvage of
hydrocarbon leaks or spills.

The hydrocarbon may be a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved or
trapped in a suitable medium. The hydrocarbon may be soluble or
insoluble in water, with best results obtained for hydrocarbons
which are insoluble in water. Preferred hydrocarbons include
ethers; petroleum based liquids including kerosene, petroleum,
crude oil; aromatic compounds, for example, toluene; ketones such
as methyl iso-butyl ketone; natural and refined animal, mineral and
vegetable oils, for example, sunflower oil. Preferably, the first
reagent to be used should be an organic or inorganic acid, salt or
base which is insoluble in water but soluble in the hydrocarbon or
its derivative.

Preferably, the organic acid is a fatty acid (stearic, oleic,
palmitic and levulinic acids, etc.). The preferred choice for the
second reagent depends on the end product required. An alkali
(ammonia, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate or
organic alkaline reagents) should be used for a granular product.
A solution of an elastomer or a latex should be used for a semi-
elastic product, and for a more elastic product a solution of an
elastomer or a latex is followed by the addition of an aqueous
acetate solution should be used. Any organic or metal acetate can
be used, such as ammonium acetate and zinc acetate.

This method for the reversible transformation of hydrocarbons can
also be applied for a wide range of purposes which include
manufacturing solid or viscous liquid compounds for plastics
production, storing and/or transporting volatile, unstable,
environmentally sensitive or toxic hydrocarbons, effectively
absorbing liquid hydrocarbon compounds, and sealing leaking or
damaged containers of liquid hydrocarbon compounds.

It might also convert volatile liquid hydrocarbons to less
volatile, more manageable compounds or be used to quell oil well
fires by converting the oil to a candle-like consistency which
burns at a much lower temperature than the untreated oil and which
is thus much easier to extinguish.

Persian Gulf:
Where's the Oil?

During the war with Iran, millions of gallons of oil spilled on
land and at sea. Following the war, scientists surveyed the Persian
Gulf to track the impact of the massive oil spill. Researchers have
found that both land and sea are recovering through the help of
naturally occurring microbes.

Oil pollution along some shores has rapidly disappeared while
simultaneously microbial mats, thick layers of microbes, were
growing on top of the oil. To understand how the microbial mats
were absorbing and breaking down the oil, the Dept. of Defense is
funding a study of the microbial mats at Northwestern University
(Evanston, IL).

"All we know at this point is that sunlight seems to enhance the
activity of the mats in breaking down the oil," reports David A.
Stahl, associate professor of civil engineering (McCormick School
of Engineering and Applied Science, Northwestern Univ., Evanston,
IL; Tel: 708/-491-4997). "It may be that the microbes that use
photosynthesis are doing the job, or it may be that their
byproducts are being used by another microbe in the mat community,
making it possible for them to do the job," he said.

Stahl receives new microbial mats every few months, which he tests
using the latest molecular biology methods. Stahl says that
probably far less than 1% of the microbial world has been
identified, making his research largely that of finding and
characterizing new forms of microbial life.

Samir Radwan of the University of Kuwait (Safat, Kuwait) reports
that wild flowers are growing in the oil soaked desert. While the
shoots of the plant have an oil stained ring at its base, the roots
are oil free and healthy. Radwan believes that the roots
"recruited" oil degrading microbes naturally found in the soil.
Radwan and his team cultured bacteria and fungi found in the oil
sand and found many well known oil degrading microbes consisting of
Arthrobacter bacteria. Just 1 cm away from the roots was a
completely different community of oil degrading bacteria and fungi.


Laboratory experiments replicated what was observed in the desert.
Radwan believes that rich nutrients such as sugars, available
oxygen, amino acids and vitamins attract petroleum-degrading
microbes.

The researchers recommend that suitable plants be densely
cultivated in polluted desert areas for bioremediation. This
approach may also be applicable in polluted areas in other parts of
the world.

Non-Cryogenic N2
Production Units

Generon Systems Inc. (400 W. Sam Houston Pkwy. South, Houston, TX
77042; Tel: 713/978-3100, Fax: 713/978-3185) provides on site
nitrogen generation for the oil and gas industry. Over 200 oil and
gas wells have been drilled over the last two years using Generon's
GenisisTM nitrogen production units (NPUs). These units work with
existing oil field air compression equipment and can provide from
500-3,000 standard cubic feet per minute of gaseous nitrogen in
purities from 90-99.5% oxygen free.

"Generon also sells smaller NPU systems and we have had several
requests for these systems in Texas to evaluate their use for
nitrogen flooding for enhanced oil recovery," John Koenst, product
manager for Generon, told EERN.

The Generon membrane module contains polymer hollow fiber membranes
which separate gas components of the compressed air stream. Each
membrane fiber is about the size of a human hair with a round bore
through the center. Dry, clean, compressed air passes through the
fiber bundle. It is the varying rates of permeation of nitrogen and
oxygen molecules that form the basis of Generon membrane separation
technology. "Fast" gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water
vapor diffuse through the membrane walls more quickly than
nitrogen, which is concentrated inside the fibers and delivered as
the product gas. The nitrogen product exits the end of each module
and is collected at the outlet manifold for delivery.

Nitrogen from a GENISYS NPU, used with traditional air drilling
equipment, can provide lower drilling costs, reduce the use of
drill mud and mud chemicals, and lessen the surface damage and
environmental impact often associated with other drilling methods.
Similar to air drilling operations, GENISYS systems deliver an
extremely low density drilling "fluid" that can significantly
reduce drilling time because of improved rates of penetration. The
inert, non-reactive nature of gaseous nitrogen is such that it will
not support combustion. Because of this, any risk of down hole
fires, explosions and associated tool damage are virtually
eliminated when using GENISYS NPUs. GENISYS systems are self
contained, incorporating the Generon nitrogen producing, hollow
fiber membrane modules and systems.

A benefit of GENISYS Nitrogen Production Units (NPUs) is that they
will reduce the risk of burnoffs commonly encountered when drilling
with plain compressed air. As little as 5% probability of a burnoff
is high enough to justify the use of a GENISYS NPU. The cost of a
GENISYS NPU in a typical West Texas area drilling location adds
about $0.88 per drilled foot. This is in contrast to the $2.00 per
foot added for extra water, chemicals, bit wear and the unknown
cost of a burnoff due to mud rings.

Coiled tubing operations with nitrogen from Generon's GENISYS
product line may reduce well costs and maximize recovery, all at
once. Oil and gas well completions and workovers with coiled tubing
are a proven method of reducing total well costs and maximizing
recovery from the reservoir. High pressure GENISYS nitrogen is
introduced continuously to the tubing instead of more costly,
delivered liquid nitrogen.

Experience with GENISYS NPUs has shown that using nitrogen in place
of misted, compressed air is a safer and more economical method of
drilling. Drilling with mist is slower than drilling with nitrogen
and 30% more compressed air is required for the "misting up." This
increased capacity results in the need for additional or larger air
compressors to do the job, adding costs to the drilling operation.
Using nitrogen from Genisys will result in as much as a 50% cost
savings on most wells.

At the close of 1995, Dow Chemical announced that it would sell its
Generon subsidiary to MG Industries Inc.  MG, part of the Hoechst
Group of companies, is a mid-sized industrial gas firm.

WAG Project Success
in Salt Creek Field

At the recently held Permian Basin CO2 Conference (December 4-5,
1995) in Midland TX, Abel Salazar of Mobil Oil discussed the case
history of the Salt Creek water-alternating-gas (WAG) project and
shared the key lessons learned from the project.  "The Salt Creek
Field phase 1 area has been a very successful WAG using CO2," said
Salazar. "The WAG project began two years and one month ago and
more than 50% of the current oil production of 27,000 bbls/day are
attributed to CO2 injection."

The Salt Creek Field covers 12,000 acres and is located in Kent
Co., TX, approximately 90 NE of Midland, TX. The field contains 178
active producers, 57 WAG or CO2 injectors and 78 water injectors.
When the project started, 18,500 bbls/day were produced. Less than
one month later, the field began to respond and one year later the
production peaked at 30,000 bbls/day. A total of 7.2 billion bbls
of oil have been produced over the two years of CO2 flooding as
part of the WAG treatment.

"Without CO2 injection, many of these wells would have been
uneconomical," said Salazar. "The biggest challenge at Salt Creek
Field is managing the producing gas oil ratio, and WAG is the
cheapest and quickest method to do this." He said that Mobil was
very happy with the WAG results and that Mobil will expand into the
phase 2 area as of March 1996 and will continue expansion into the
phase 3 area through the year 2001.

"Salt Creek Field is very dynamic and needs continuous
surveillance," Salazar explained. "The key to the success of the
CO2 injection is management. A detailed pattern analysis is
necessary, as are team work and having good communication with
field personnel."

Salazar offered some specific guidelines based on Mobil's
experience with the field. He counseled to use maximum available
carbon dioxide supply rate as long as possible from pipeline and
gas plant capacities and vary WAG ratios on a pattern by pattern
basis. WAG/breakthrough problems can be identified by watching cash
flow per producing well and not allowing the cash flow to go
negative. Apply same waterflood workover procedures during carbon
dioxide flood. Exception is for high GOR wells which require
increased mud costs. Supplement fuel may be necessary to insure
proper carbon dioxide flare operation.

Another guide is that all surface systems should be planned for
flexibility.
Remember that the vendor/engineering contractor community knows
very little about metering carbon dioxide streams at either high or
low pressures.

DOE Program Aids
Smaller Producers

Independent producers today account for nearly 40% of the nation's
domestic oil supply, but virtually none of these companies have the
technical capability or resources to try untried or unfamiliar
technological approaches that potentially could improve their
economic viability. As a result, with oil prices remaining
relatively low, many of these companies are on the verge of
abandoning much of the nation's remaining oil resource. To help
meet this need, the Dept. of Energy (DOE) (1000 Independence Ave.
SW, Washington, DC 20585; Tel: 202/586-5000) is assisting several
of the nation's smallest independent oil producers in applying
innovative technologies that could help maintain the viability of
an increasingly important segment of the U.S. petroleum industry.

DOE, working through its National Institute for Petroleum and
Energy Research (NIPER, 220 N. Virginia, Bartlesville, OK 74003;
Tel: 918/336-2400, Fax: 918/337-4339) is providing nearly $400,000
in technical assistance contracts to eight independent producers.
The producers and their project partners provide more than $500,000
in private sector cost-sharing and in-kind contributions. By
providing a small amount of federal cost-sharing, $50,000 or less
per project, the DOE is encouraging the producers to experiment
with the higher-risk approaches that could mean the difference
between maintaining production from an oil field or shutting it in.
The program is directed at companies with less than 50 employees or
contractors who have no affiliation with a major oil company.

The eight companies, and others added to the program in the future,
will be the focus of an extensive technology transfer effort to be
conducted by the DOE and BDM-Oklahoma, the operator of NIPER.
Through workshops, technical reports, and the use of expanding DOE
and industry electronic networks to the petroleum industry,
techniques and results from the trial projects will be disseminated
to other small producers.

This effort differs from the larger Reservoir Class Field
Demonstration Program that DOE initiated in 1992.  The Reservoir
Class program, now underway in 14 States, involves full-scale field
tests that, in most cases, are demonstrating multiple techniques
for maintaining production from fields threatened by near-term
abandonment.  The smaller effort is pinpointing specific production
problems and attempting to demonstrate lower-cost remedies, often
focusing on an individual well or group of wells.

The DOE technical assistance program remains open for independent
producers to submit proposals.  Since BDM-Oklahoma announced the
start of the small producer program last March, independent oil
field operators have submitted 37 proposals.  Those not selected
remain eligible for further consideration, and additional proposals
are being accepted.  DOE has just over $240,000 in remaining funds
set aside for this effort, and additional project selections are
expected approximately every three months through next May. :

TRRC Amends Its
Inactive Well Rule

Texas Railroad Commissioners (TRRC, Box 12967 Austin, TX 78711-
2967; Tel: 512/463-7288) have approved a rule change designed to
help more inactive oil and gas wells qualify for a state severance
tax exemption approved by the legislature. Chairman Carole Keeton
Rylander and Commissioners Barry Williamson and Charles R. Matthews
expanded provisions of the current program which encourages
operators to bring wells that have been inactive for at least three
years back on production, thereby qualifying them for up to a 10-
year exemption from state severance tax on the oil or gas they
produce.

Under the rule change, the Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) will be
able to certify an eligible well as a "three year inactive well"
without it having to be brought back into production at the time of
certification. This will give the operator of a certified well the
leeway of bringing it back on tax-exempt production anytime during
the 10 years following the certification date. The new procedure
requires the operator of a certified well to file a test report
showing productive capability with the Commission before applying
to the state comptroller for the tax incentive.

"Texas is a true leader in the area of tax incentive development
and implementation," Commissioner Williamson said. "This particular
rule change will extend the life of thousands of Texas wells,
creating jobs and tax revenue and developing natural resources that
would otherwise be lost to the state."

The Three Year Inactive Well Incentive program has been an
unqualified success. Since its beginning in 1993, almost 5,500 oil
and gas wells, capable of producing 16.4 million barrels of oil and
153.8 billion cubic feet of gas a year, have been certified. The
Commission estimates the value of that production at $584 million
and the positive impact on the Texas economy at $1.7 billion.

Differing Views
on Compliance

Petroleum producers and refiners are vitally interested in the
quality of water that they can legally discharge and equally
interested in the quality of water available for their use.  An old
saying is "Don't inject any water into your well that you wouldn't
drink." Injected minerals and microbes can have disastrous effects.


The EPA's goal of maintaining and protecting surface water quality
has led the EPA to set some very low limits for a variety of
pollutants. The demanding EPA requirements for testing and
reporting have prompted some contrasting reactions.

While Anna Rule (Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Virginia Beach,
VA; Tel: 804/874-1287) exposes the impracticalities and
inadequacies of compliance testing, Darrell R. Wilder
(Environmental Services Lab, Eastman Chemical Co., Kingsport, TN
37662-5054) sees compliance testing and waste minimization as
opportunities for self-directed efforts to eliminate sources of
pollution and reduce the burden of testing.

Writing in Water Environment & Technology [7-11, 31-34, 1995] Rule
points out that the minimum concentration at which a chemical's
presence can be determined by a specific method is an exceedingly
minute but imprecise quantity which has nevertheless become a
regulatory goal and performance standard. A method detection limit
(MDL) is the minimum concentration of a substance which can be
identified, measured, and reported with 99% confidence that its
concentration is greater than zero. The EPA bases MDL on the
standard deviation of a set of replicate determinations.

The EPA has set water quality criteria for some substances at or
below MDLs without considering the limits of analytical technology.
Compliance with permit limits set below MDLs or at zero is
problematic because measurement errors, variability, and
uncertainty. Measurements at ultradilute levels are consequently
anything but absolutely true and exact determinations.

Rule indicates the flaws in deriving a confidence interval from a
set of determinations and suggests that prediction intervals or
tolerance intervals are more appropriate for estimating the range
of future multiple measurements and the probability that a given
percentage of them attain a given MDL. Rule points out that it
introduces a bias to treat results at or below an MDL as zero or
nondetectable while accepting higher values as true and accurate.

"All measurements, at any level, include defined and unavoidable
imprecision. Analytical and sample variance, or relative standard
deviation of measurements (RSD) is not constant throughout the
concentration range but gradually increases as the results approach
the lower or upper end of the analytical range. . . . The practice
of eliminating low-level data by reporting 'less than' or 'zero' is
called left-censoring and is regarded as an unnecessary loss of
valuable information." While it is statistically valid to use low-
end data, this approach often conflicts with setting regulatory
limits.

Rule favors the calibration curve method as an alternative for
estimating measurement detection limits. This method finds
tolerance intervals for assessing future performance and uses them
to define uncertainty bands on the calibration curve. The analyst
may then compute and define minimum concentrations that have an
acceptable level of confidence with a predetermined RSD. The
calibration curve method is the basis of a proposal presented to
EPA by a Detection/Quantitation Workgroup representing the
regulated community. Other concepts of MDL may be appropriate, but
the problem is the validity of low-end results. Carefully developed
and documented protocols should allow a more effective validation
and define more appropriate uses although at a higher cost.

Working the higher end of compliance testing, Wilder accepts
compliance testing as a fact of life for environmental discharges
in the chemical industry. Now that the NPDES program has entered a
phase of diminishing returns, the EPA is encouraging a "front end"
approach to pollution control that encourages proactive waste
minimization and pollution prevention.

Government initiatives and voluntary programs have created
financial incentives for chemical companies to go beyond routine
compliance by developing environmental strategies that reflect
environmental responsibility. Writing in Analytical Chemistry [25-
2, 77-89, 1995] Wilder presents a review of some new measurement
technologies for preventing pollution and cutting waste.

Wilder considers technologies for measurement of wasteload
concentrations, flow measurements, monitoring specific waste
components, monitoring networks, process control of activated
sludge treatment systems, and measurement of air emissions. Wilder
believes that internal and self-directed efforts by chemical
companies in all these areas give analysts scope for ingenuity and
creativity in identifying and eliminating sources of toxic
contaminants. Successful results could reduce the burden of
compliance testing.

Improved Gels for
Oil Field Brines

Gelled or crosslinked water-soluble polymers are used in enhanced
oil recovery and other oil field operations to change formation
permeability, enhancing the effectiveness of water flooding
operations. Generally, polymers along with an appropriate
crosslinking system are injected in an aqueous solution into the
formation and permeate into and gel in the regions of highest water
permeability. By using a produced brine as the aqueous solution
carrier for the polymers, operators can avoid the environmental
concerns as well as cost for disposing of a produced brine. It also
saves the cost associated with acquiring and pre-treating fresh
water for use as the aqueous solution.

Most produced brines are hard brines, defined as having a salinity
of greater than 2% total dissolved solids, basically inorganic
salts. Chromium(III) carboxylates such as chromium acetate are the
only known crosslinkers which can be used to produce stable gels in
produced brines for near-wellbore treatment. Although a
chromium(III) salt is not as toxic as a chromium(VI) salt, it is
still not desirable in the environment. Its use may require
additional costs to assure the integrity of the injection wells to
avoid contamination of ground water sources.

Ahmad Moradi-Araghi of Phillips Petroleum Co. (16 Phillips Bldg.,
Bartlesville, OK 74004; Tel: 918/661-6600) has found a more
environmentally suitable gelling composition that can form stable
gels in produced brines. It has the benefit that the gelling
composition does not crosslink too fast (i.e., gel times longer
than 2 hours) so that individual components of the composition can
be injected simultaneously into the wells. The composition consists
of a produced brine; a water-soluble polymer (i.e.,
polyacrylamide), a crosslinker (i.e., a complexed zirconium
compound), and optionally a complexing ligand (i.e., lactic acid).
The composition can be used for either in depth treatment of an oil
field or near-wellbore treatment such as water shutoff, gas
shutoff, and zone abandonment.

More specific information is included in U.S. Patent 5,478,802. The
patent says that it is desirable to delay the rate of gelation so
that the components of the composition can be injected at the same
time without plugging up the injection or producing wells.  A
produced brine having a salinity of from 4-25% generally produces
better results.

Suitable polymers are those which are capable of gelling in the
presence of polyvalent metal ion crosslinking agents. Polymers
capable of gelling in the presence of crosslinking agents within a
gelation pH range, include biopolysaccharides, cellulose ethers,
and acrylamide-based polymers. The preferred biopolysaccharides are
polysaccharide B-1459 and xanthan gums which are biopolysaccharides
produced by the action of Xanthomonas campestris bacteria.
Preferred cellulose ethers include carboxymethylhydroxyethyl
cellulose (CMHEC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Preferred
polymers which contain acrylamide as well as 0.5-5 mole % of
pendant carboxylate (acrylate) groups are the partially hydrolyzed
polyacrylamides possessing pendant carboxylate groups through which
crosslinking can take place.

The crosslinker is a metal compound selected from the group
consisting of a complexed zirconium compound, a complexed titanium
compound, and mixtures of these. These compounds are commercially
available.

A suitable complexing ligand to retard the rate of gelation may be
chosen from the group consisting of lactic acid, neutralized lactic
acid, citric acid, ammonium, potassium or sodium citrate, isocitric
acid, ammonium, potassium or sodium isocitrate, malic acid,
ammonium, potassium or sodium malate, tartaric acid, ammonium,
potassium or sodium tartrate, triethanolamine, malonic acid,
ammonium, potassium or sodium malonate, and mixtures of these. Due
to their ready availability and low cost, the presently preferred
complexing ligands are triethanolamine, citric acid, lactic acid,
tartaric acid and salts of these.

The composition of the invention can be prepared by mixing the
individual components together employing conventionally well-known
mixing means. The order of adding individual components does not
change the characteristics of the composition.

The concentration of crosslinker in the composition depends largely
on the concentration of polymer in the composition. Lower
concentrations of polymer require lower concentrations of
crosslinker. Further, it has been found that for a given
concentration of polymer, increasing the concentration of
crosslinker generally substantially increases the rate of gelation.
The concentration of crosslinker in the injected slug varies
generally over the broad range of 25-5,000 ppm, preferably over the
range of 100-2,000 ppm based on Zr or Ti concentration.

The concentration of the complexing ligand in the composition also
depends on the concentrations of the water-soluble polymer in the
composition and on the desired rate of gelation. Generally, the
faster the gelation rate, the lower concentration of the complexing
ligand is required. Generally, the concentration of the complexing
ligand varies broadly in the range of about 25-5,000 ppm,
preferably in the range of about 50-3,000 ppm, and most preferably
in the range of 100-2,000 ppm.

PDVSA Is Now a
Mature Corporation

Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA, Apartado 169, Caracas 1010-A,
Venezuela) recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. PDVSA has
moved from its initial role of being "a simple coordinator" of 14
subsidiaries to "a mature and powerful corporation, with clarity of
objectives, and holding a first class national and international
position," said PDVSA president Luis Giusti. "Today, PDVSA is a
strong and solvent corporation holding an excellent position on the
main world markets, with a modern production and refining
infrastructure and a first class technical team."

PDVSA has confirmed that the Orinoco Oil Belt contains reserves of
heavy and extra heavy crudes and bitumens estimated at
approximately 1.2 trillion barrels, of which some 270 billion
barrels are recoverable with the use of today's technology. Those
massive reserves of hard to market heavy crudes and bitumens in the
Belt have posed a major challenge for PDVSA. The corporation has
approached development in two ways: negotiating strategic
associations with foreign oil companies to exploit and upgrade the
recoverable resources and embarking on an ambitious project
converting bitumen into Orimulsion, a unique boiler fuel used in
plants that generate electricity.

Maraven, one of the PDVSA Group has worked out two major
development projects in partnership with several international
companies. Along with Conoco Inc. (P.O. Box 1267, Ponca City, OK
74602-1267; Tel: 405/767-3456), Maraven will produce approximately
120,000 barrels per day of extra-heavy crude from the Belt.

That crude will be upgraded in Venezuela to a lighter synthetic
crude using Conoco's delayed coking technology. A similar
production and upgrading project involving Maraven, Total (Cedex
47, 92069 Paris la Defense, Paris, France), Itochu (1-3 Kita-
Kyutaromachi, Osaka OSK0541, Japan), and Marubeni Corp. (5-7
Honmachi, 2-Chome, Osaka OSK0541, Japan) are also ready to go
onstream.

Letters of intent already have been signed for a third development
project in the belt that will bring Corpoven, a member of the PDVSA
group, and ARCO International Oil and Gas Co. in a strategic
association to produce some 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of medium
grade crudes, and a fourth project involving a partnership between
Lagoven, a member of the PDVSA Group, and Mobil Oil Corp. (3225
Gallows Rd., Fairfax, VA 22037; Tel: 703/846-3000) to produce
100,000 bpd from the eastern region of the Belt.

The corporation hopes those four projects will generate a combined
output of between 400,000-500,000 bpd of synthetic crude by the
turn of the century. Those joint venture deals follow a series of
operating agreements between PDVSA subsidiaries and several private
foreign companies for the reactivation of marginal or inactive oil
fields which now are producing an additional 58,00 bpd of crudes.
PDVSA expects to exceed 430,000 bpd by the year 2000.

PDVSA subsidiaries have made a series of operating agreements with
private foreign companies for the reactivation of marginal or
inactive oil fields which are now producing an additional 58,000
barrels per day of crudes. That figure is expected to exceed
430,000 bpd by the turn of the century.

PDVSA has begun an ambitious plan to manufacture and export
Orimulsion. Orimulsion exports have grown from about 1.7 million
metric tons in 1992 to approximately 2.43 million metric tons in
1994. The plan projects Orimulsion exports at approximately 20
million metric tons by the year 2000.  Bitumenes Orinoco, S.A.
(BITOR), the subsidiary of PDVSA responsible for the manufacture,
transport and marketing of Orimulsion, has already signed a supply
contract agreement with Canada's New Brunswick Power, which adapted
its Dalhousie power plant to burn Orimulsion fuel, and with Florida
Power & Light which will use Orimulsion in its Manatee, FL plant.

BITOR is negotiating with electric facilities in Europe and Asia.
BITOR has shipped significant test volumes of Orimulsion to
potential clients in Portugal, Italy and Germany. A supply contract
has been signed with SK-Power of Denmark for the purchase of up to
1.5 million metric tons a year of the product, for two years, which
began in 1995.

Suncor Scales
Up in Australia

In Australia, Suncor Inc. (P.O. Box 38, 112 4th Ave. SW, Calgary,
Albert, Canada; Tel: 403/269-8100) will scale up and apply Taciuk
processor technology. Taciuk processor technology was originally
developed by the Alberta Oil Sands Technology Research Authority
(AOSTRA), the functions of which are now part of the Alberta Dept.
of Energy (5th Floor, 801 6th Ave. SW, Calgary, Alberta T2P 3W2,
Canada; Tel: 403/297-3380). The Taciuk processor combines the
extraction, upgrading and energy-generating processes of
traditional oil sands/shales projects and requires less capital and
equipment.

"Suncor was the first in the world to pioneer the commercial
development of the oil sands," said Suncor president and CEO Rick
George. "We are uniquely positioned to apply our expertise in oil
sands development in other parts of the world."

Suncor has reached an agreement with two Australian companies,
Southern Pacific Petroleum NL (Lufthansa House, 143 MacQuarie St.,
Sidney, NSW 2000, Australia) and Central Pacific Minerals NL
(McFarlane House, 127 George St., Brisbane, QLD 4000, Australia),
to begin development work to demonstrate the commercial viability
of producing oil from Australian oil shale using the Taciuk
process.

Suncor will invest $7 million to conduct preliminary engineering
and complete commercial negotiations to build a shale oil plant in
Gladstone, a port city on the east coast in Queensland, Australia.
The agreement covers the development of the Stuart oil shale
deposit which is estimated to contain the equivalent of three
billion barrels of shale oil.

Development work is expected to take six to nine months to
complete. After that the partners will decide whether to proceed
with the 4,500 barrel a day plant. The project is estimated to cost
about $200 million, of which Suncor would contribute up to an
additional $65 million over the next two years. At that point,
Suncor would earn a 50% interest in the project.

If the project is successful, Suncor and its partners have plans to
develop a second and third stage, which could ultimately result in
an 85,000 barrel a day commercial operation over a 10 year period.
In addition, Suncor has the right to acquire an option for $3.5
million to purchase a 22.4% interest in Southern Pacific Petroleum
and Central Pacific Minerals. This option can be exercised any time
up to six months after the shale oil plant begins operations.

George said the project fits strategically with Suncor's growth
plans. "Our core businesses continue as the foundation of our
growth," said George. "To create additional shareholder value, we
are pushing the boundaries of our existing businesses and looking
for new yet related energy opportunities." Suncor plans to
diversify in stages through a series of modest investments.

Suncor has plans to spend more than $1 billion over five years to
increase production at its Oil Sands and Resources groups. Suncor
plans to invest approximately $475 million on capital and
exploration programs in 1996, up about 20% from 1995. Of the $475
million, approximately $260 million will be directed to the oil
sands, $160 million will go to the conventional oil and gas
division and $55 million will be spent at Sunoco, Suncor's refining
and marketing group.

"The increased spending supports our plans to expand our
conventional exploration and production and oil sands operations,"
said Rick George, Suncor president and CEO. The Oil Sands Group
capital program includes projects to expand production, plan a new
mine site, reduce sulfur dioxide emissions and make other
environmental and sustaining capital investments.

At Resources Group, capital will be spent on increasing reserves
and production through exploration, development and acquisitions.
Suncor also plans to spend approximately $17 million on a project
to test a new technology at its Burnt Lake heavy oil property. In
its downstream operations, Suncor will increase spending to
approximately $55 million to improve environmental, energy and
operating efficiency at its refining and Sunoco retail operations.

ChevronMoves
Toward Its Goals

Chevron Corp. (P.O. Box 7753, San Francisco, CA 94120-7753; Tel:
415/894-4440) chairman Ken Derr told a meeting of financial
analysts that Chevron has made great strides in the second half of
1995 toward improving shareholder value and reducing the company's
already competitive cost structure. He noted that Chevron's stock
hit an all-time high during December 1995 and that Chevron has had
its most productive year of oil discoveries in 15 years, based on
the projected reserves from a number of key wells.

One promising area is a new discovery in the Congo, Moho Marine 1,
which is one of Chevron's largest discoveries in West Africa. The
field appears to be geologically similar to nearby N'Kossa. The
N'Kossa field is on track to begin production in mid-1996, with
peak production of 110,000 barrels per day (bpd) expected in late
1997. Chevron's share is 30%.

Several promising areas are in Northwest Australia, where Chevron
and partners have made major discoveries and added new production.
Last month, the Wanaea and Cossack fields began production and are
scheduled to reach design capacity of 115,000 bpd in the first
quarter. Huge gas discoveries at Chrysaor and Perseus were also
announced in the past year.

"One of Chevron's enduring strengths is our ability to find oil and
gas, and we are completing an exceptionally good year of new
discoveries," Derr said. "In addition to this, we expect to replace
more than 110% of our worldwide proved reserves when final 1995
figures are in."

Also in the exploration and production area, Chevron announced in
December 1995 a major alliance with Maraven of Venezuela to further
develop the huge Boscan oil field and supply heavy crude oil to
U.S. refineries (see article in foreign Industry News, this issue).

Several company businesses in December 1995 have announced
restructuring to reduce costs, improve efficiency and to meet
strategic intents, Derr noted, including:

Chevron Chemical Co., which announced a restructuring along
geographic lines, forming a new International Group as well as a
U.S. chemicals division. The action supports the chemical company's
strategic intent to improve competitive financial performance while
developing attractive opportunities for growth, Derr said. The
former Aromatics and Olefins divisions, both headquartered in
Houston, will be combined to form one U.S. Chemicals Div., to
remain in Houston.

A new international group, eventually to be based in San Ramon, CA,
will help Chevron focus specifically on growth markets in key
regions around the world.  Chevron Chemical's other major division,
the Oronite Additives Div., based in San Ramon, already operates
internationally and is unaffected by the reorganization.

U.S. products marketing announced a consolidation of regional
offices and support functions, reducing costs $8 million per year
and supporting greater customer focus. U.S. refining also has a new
management team charged with achieving incident free operation
while reducing costs. The business activities of Chevron
International Oil Co. are being reorganized, as announced early
this month. As part of the change, the company's international
lubricants business will be consolidated with the U.S. business
into a new Global Lubricants unit.

Another major step was taken by Caltex, Chevron's 50-50 joint
venture with Texaco, which is a major refiner/marketer in Asia.
Caltex recently announced the $2 billion sale of its 50% interest
in a refining company in Japan, where markets are mature, in order
to focus more on growth areas such as China and India. The action
supports the strategy of growing Caltex in attractive markets,
while achieving superior competitive financial performance.

Beta Well to Sell
Kazakstan Interest

The Board of Directors of Beta Well Service Inc. (Calgary, Alberta,
Canada; Tel: 403/290-0660) has approved a conditional agreement in
principle to sell its 50% interest in the Zhetybay-Quest
partnership, two well servicing rigs and related equipment, all of
which are located in Kazakstan, to a large oil and gas company.  It
is proposed that the transaction's effective date and closing date
will be March 31,1996. If the sale is completed, the consideration
would be approximately $12 million in cash 91 days after closing,
and deferred payments totaling $30 million contingent upon
Zhetybay-Quest's profitability.

A company spokesman said that if the transaction can be completed,
it would be a positive development for all interested parties.
"Beta would have the opportunity to realize a significant return on
its Zhetybay-Quest investment.  The financial strength of the
prospective new owner would assure its Kazak partner and the
government of Kazakstan that the Zhetybay field would be developed
on a timely basis."

Chevron, Maraven
Form Major Alliance

Chevron (6001 Bollinger Canyon Rd., San Ramon, CA 94583; Tel:
510/842-1000) and Maraven S.A. (Apartado Postal 829, Caracas,
Venezuela 1010-A;  Tel: 58/2 908 3096) have formed a multi-faceted
alliance which will further the development of the Boscan oil field
in Venezuela and provide for supplies of heavy crude oil to Chevron
in the U.S.

The alliance covers an initial period of 20 years with an optional
10 year extension. Chevron will operate Venezuela's Boscan heavy
oil field, and anticipates a $2 billion investment over a 20-30
year period.  Maraven will become Chevron's joint-venture partner
in a West Coast asphalt business, and will also supply crude for
Chevron's refinery at Pascagoula, MS, and for the company's asphalt
plants at Perth Amboy, NJ, Portland, OR, and Richmond Beach, WA.

For the Boscan Field, Chevron and Maraven have structured an
Operating Service Agreement to assure continued development of the
50-year-old Boscan field, discovered by Chevron in 1946.  "We plan
to increase production from 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 115,000
bpd during the next three years," said Richard Matzke, president of
Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., who signed the agreement.

Independent studies confirm the Boscan field contains 1.6 billion
barrels of proven reserves.  Chevron will be responsible for
operations and production, while Maraven will be responsible for
marketing. Through the new arrangement, Chevron becomes the first
international oil company since 1975 to be responsible for such a
high level of production in Venezuela.  "We're encouraged by
Maraven's demonstration of trust in our technical expertise,"
Matzke said. He noted that the work to be done, albeit challenging,
will result in major economic enhancements for the Venezuelan
economy.

"Boscan crude, with an API gravity of 10 degrees, is an excellent
asphalt feedstock," explained Dave O'Reilly, president of Chevron
U.S.A. (CUSA) Products Co., who signed the downstream agreements.
"This new alliance provides an opportunity for Chevron and Maraven
to collaborate on both upstream and downstream ventures," O'Reilly
said.

Affiliates of Chevron and Maraven will also form a partnership to
acquire and process feedstock into asphalt and other products for
marketing in the Western U.S. The new joint venture, to be named
Chevron Ven Asphalt Alliance, will have a processing and service
agreement with CUSA Products which will retain its West Coast
asphalt refineries and perform supply, processing and marketing
functions on behalf of the joint venture.  "This venture should
increase asphalt production and offer new marketing opportunities,"
said O'Reilly.

Occidental Expands
Ecuador Operations

Occidental Petroleum Corp. (10889 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA
90024-4201; Tel: 213/879-1700) and Canadian Occidental Petroleum
Ltd. have reached an agreement with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian
state oil company, to increase exploration and development
activities on Block 15 in the prolific Oriente Basin in eastern
Ecuador.

The agreement calls for Occidental as operator to conduct an
exploration program in the 97% of the block that has yet to be
explored.  In exchange, Occidental receives improved contract terms
regarding new discoveries, including a minimum extension of seven
years to develop new discoveries.

Occidental acquired the 494,000-acre block in 1985 under a risk-
service contract with Petroecuador. To date, six fields have been
discovered, and four of those have been developed and are producing
approximately 24,000 barrels of oil per day.  The 20-year
exploitation period under the contract began in 1992. Occidental
has an 85% interest in the block with Canadian Occidental holding
the remaining 15%.

Pennzoil in China
Joint Venture

Pennzoil Products Co. (Pennzoil Place, P.O. Box 2967, Houston, TX
77262-8200; Tel: 713/546-6100) has acquired a 50% equity share in
a new lubricant manufacturing and marketing joint venture between
Pennzoil and Lithcon Petroleum Inc. in Tianjin, China.

William E. Welcher, group VP, products marketing, said that
Pennzoil and Lithcon have purchased land and an existing, new
building in Tianjin which will be utilized for a lubricating oil
blending plant and a sales and marketing office complex. "The
existing facility is strategically located close to one of China's
largest ports in the Tianjin Economic Technological Development
Area," said Welcher.  "It is also located in the Bohai Bay area,
China's second largest economic zone."

Welcher said that owing to Bohai Bay's natural and labor resources,
large market and technology, this area is expected to become the
nucleus of the northeast Asia's economic belt which spans north and
north-east China, South Korea, Mongolia, Siberia and the Far East.
The total lubricants requirement within the five provinces located
around Tianjin together with the municipalities of Beijing and
Tianjin is approximately one-third of China's total lubricant
demand.

Making Well Info
More Accessible

Obtaining data for an oil or gas producing property is a time
consuming and difficult task, limiting the producer's effectiveness
to make sound business and engineering decisions. The data are
located in a variety of places, some of which are inaccessible to
the average user. Independent producers would like more effective
access to this crucial information to expand their business
options. Major oil companies with properties in which production is
no longer justified would like more effective access to facilitate
the sale of any properties that independents might see as viable.
Government agencies would like to see more effective access for the
independents to avoid the abandonment of wells that might be
productive.

Sam Coleman (Tel: 510/422-4323) and Jeff Wagoner (Tel: 510/422-
1374) of Lawrence Livermore National Lab (Univ. of California, P.O.
Box 808, L-156, Livermore, CA 94551) are developing a database of
existing oil field data for California and Texas. These states,
like many other states, provide public access to oil and gas
production data, and other types of well information. Much of the
data is centrally located. However, the data are in a format that
is difficult to search and retrieve with access mechanisms which
are ineffective, tedious, and expensive to maintain.

The Oil and Gas Data Infrastructure Project is designing,
implementing, and integrating inexpensive, standards-based,
mechanisms for online access to data from Texas, California, and
other states. The project will combine database, Internet, and
World Wide Web technology to make existing Oil and Gas data readily
available for online analysis.

Cost-effective access will be available through the existing
Internet infrastructure using de facto Internet tools. Data will be
displayed on the user's personal computer or downloaded for
analysis by a variety of existing commercial applications. The
project will deliver a demonstration system that will serve as a
prototype for use by government agencies and private corporations.
It is anticipated that cost effective analysis of data will
facilitate the transfer of petroleum leases to independent
producers, slow the abandonment of wells, enhance the production of
existing fields, and increase the efficiency of drilling
activities.

The California Div. of Oil and Gas and Geothermal Resources and the
Texas Railroad Commission maintain a great deal of information on
each well. This includes applications to do work, permits issued,
drilling and exploration histories and maps.

The information has been available to the public and industry, but
interested parties must come to the regional offices, identify and
locate information they need, and request or create hard copies of
any desired information. Both California and Texas government
agencies are interested in providing electronic systems for well
records to improve public access and reduce operating expenses.

Short Radius-Curved
Borehole Apparatus

W. James Hughes, James W. McCabe, and Owen L. Marks, Jr. of
Maverick Tool Co. (211 Beeline Dr., Bensenville, IL 60106. Tel:
708/860-5632) have developed a new method and apparatus to drill a
short radius curved boreholes portion of a horizontal or
directional well. This technique can achieve a radius of curvature
of less than 20 ft.

A tight radius of curvature is rotary drilled by use of flexible
composite drilling pipe or other common flexible pipe which
terminate within an eccentric collar on the final drill string
section. The eccentric collar is equipped with a retractable and
grooved compression pad which expands outwardly to hold the
eccentric collar (which is also grooved on its opposite side)
against the side of the well bore to prevent the eccentric collar
from rotating during the rotary drilling process. The final drill
string section connects to a lower drill bit collar and rotary
drill bit through a driving ball and socket connection. The
eccentric collar on the final drill string section that engages the
well bore forces the deflection of the drill bit about the ball and
socket connection and holds this orientation as the rotating drill
proceeds forward.

The short radius required for lateral or horizontal drilling has
been a difficult drilling process to control. In the past, a
whipstock was employed to drill short radius horizontal holes below
a vertical cased well bore. This technique limits the smallest
curvature radius for surface drilling to 19 feet which is 3 of
deflection per foot over 30 ft. of linear drilling to produce a
horizontal drainhole at depths greater than 2,000 ft.

Although others have achieved some degree of success in drilling a
tight radius or curvature, Maverick's new patented (U.S. 5,467,834)
apparatus addresses the problems of the inconsistent radius of
curvature, the weakness of ball/pin flexible joint which could fail
under normal operating conditions, and the difficulty in
maintaining the desired orientation of deflection. It overcomes the
inability to accurately determine the direction and correct for
errors and the multiple problems caused by constant engagement of
spring-loaded blades ranging from misorientation to sticking in the
hole.

Energy BioSystems
Better Biocatalyst

Energy BioSystems Corp. (4200 Research Forest Dr., The Woodlands,
TX 77381; Tel: 713/364-6100, Fax: 713/364-6110) has made a major
advance in the performance of the biocatalyst which drives the
company's proprietary biocatalytic desulfurization (BDS) system.
Application of recent discoveries has lead to a six- to eightfold
increase in the specific activity of intermediate reactions
critical to BDS economics.

"In the last few months we have applied the discoveries reported in
September," said Dr. Daniel J. Monticello, VP of R&D at Energy
Biosystems. "The resulting improvement exceeds our expectation of
a three- to fivefold increase. We are now significantly closer to
the performance level needed for commercialization of BDS, but
additional development is required on a dinal reaction to produce
the prototype biocatalyst necessary for pilot plant demonstration
runs," he continued. Further improvements are expected in early
1996 which should lead to the biocatalyst performance required for
commercial demonstration of BDS technology.

Energy BioSystems announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office has issued two new process patents to the company. "We
continue to improve the process design of BDS as well as the
biocatalyst," commented Dr. Monticello, "and we continue to pursue
strong patent protection for these improvements in order to enhance
our competitive position as we move toward the commercialization of
BDS."

The first patent (U.S. 5,472,875) claims a new reactor design
involving the introduction of air or oxygen-enriched gas into the
oil prior to treatment with the biocatalyst. The second patent
(U.S. 5,468,626) claims a method by which a biosorption agent
preferentially adsorbs sulfur-containing compounds from petroleum.
Such a process design could reduce the size of the bioreactor by
concentrating on those compounds requiring desulfurization, thus
reducing capital equipment cost.

Exxon Upgrades
Steam Cracker Tars

Researchers at Exxon Corp. (1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
NY 10020) have discovered a process for the production of gaseous
mono- and di-olefins, particularly ethylene, propylene and
butadiene. The advantage of the process is that it prevents or
mitigates reactions of asphaltene precursors to form asphaltenes.

The patented process (U.S. 5,443,715) involves first introducing a
hydrocarbon feedstock stream into a high temperature thermal
cracking zone to produce a high temperature cracked product stream.
The cracked product stream is quenched to stop the cracking
reactions. At least one HDD (hydrogen donor diluent) such as
hydrotreated steam cracked tar oils is injected into the cracked
product stream at or downstream of the point at which the reaction
is quenched, so as to prevent thermal degradation reactions of the
steam cracked liquids.

Normally gaseous olefins are recovered from the cracked product
stream, and a liquid product stream is recovered which contains a
diminished asphaltene content. In this manner, the process upgrades
the tars that are formed during the production of gaseous olefins.
The inventors are Dane C. Grenoble, Roy T. Halle, Martin L.
Gorbaty, and Harold W. Helmke.

Solvent, Steam
Soak Promising

Researchers at Maraven (Apdo. 829, Caracas 1010-A, Venezuela) have
evaluated using various additives to enhance oil recovery and
improve the economics of steam soak projects. Initial results are
encouraging. Solvent injection with steam resulted in initial oil
rates 50% higher than steam alone. The steam soak process can be
efficient and economical, but in western Venezuela its
effectiveness is linked to formation compaction, the main
production mechanism. To optimize the effects of the steam soak
process, various additives were tested to improve the cycle
behavior.

The additives used in the tests included surfactants to increase
vertical steam distribution and improve the flow of the heated oil,
solvents to increase oil mobility and steam stimulation followed by
a slug of natural gas to increase the heated area and reactivate
the solution gas drive mechanism.

It was concluded that steam soak with solvent coinjection was the
most feasible approach, since solvent additives are abundant and
cost less than the other additives used in this study. Further
observation and evaluation of this approach was recommended. The
results were first presented at the Unitar International Conference
on Heavy Crude and Tar Sands held in Houston, TX.

SUPERPHENIX TO SHUT DOWN IN EARLY 1997 FOR REFURBISHMENT

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Superphenix prototype nuclear plant will be shut down for five months
in early 1997 for modifications to its fast breeder reactor, which will
henceforth be used for research, local authorities announced on October
11. The modifications, announced during an information meeting with the
officials, will mainly involve the replacement of some subassemblies in
the reactor's core and the installation of experimental sub-assemblies
"with a higher plutonium content or containing radioactive waste with a
long half-life, such as neptunium". The Superphenix plant, located at
Creys-Malville, in France's Rhone-Alpes region, has encountered many
problems since it was opened in 1986 and has actually operated very little
since that date. Back on line in August 1994, the plant is now running at
60% capacity. Its management expects authorisation for an increase to 90%
shortly, but will not ask permission to turn Superphenix up to 100% power,
given the short time remaining before the shutdown.

In its annual report, the French Court of Auditors has estimated the total
cost of Superphenix at 60 billion French Francs. A spokesman for the plant
said that this calculation was based on a shutdown in 2000, while the
programme provided for operation until 2015. The representative also
indicated that the 51% of the fast breeder reactor's costs were being
assumed by EDF and 49% by Italy and a consortium of several other
countries. He said that the reactor could make a "decisive" contribution
to research into energy options for the year 2025 and beyond.

PAPOUTSIS CALLS FOR PRE-COMPETITIVE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY POLICY.

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

"This is an opportune moment to define a Community-wide policy for
pre-competitive activities in the field of energy technologies, with the
main objective of meeting the urgent needs of EU industry and society at
large", said Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis during a conference on
October 11. He warned that while EU firms are among the world leaders in
the manufacture and supply of clean and efficient energy technologies, the
European Union has been less successful than the United States and Japan
in the diffusion of research and the development and marketing of proven
technologies. A future initiative for energy technologies must focus not
on the development of technology per se, he explained, but rather on its
use to meet the immediate needs of the market and the citizen. It must
also contain activities dealing with all the stages in the technological
development process, including R&D and market commercialisation.

COMMISSION LAUNCHES JOULE PROJECT SELECTION INVESTIGATION.

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commission has decided to launch a detailed inquiry to ensure
that the procedural rules governing EU funds for Joule projects of
research into renewable forms of energy are obeyed without exception,
Research Commissioner Edith Cresson has responded in answer to a
Parliamentary question about the falsification of Joule programme expert
reports. The Commission has already publicly denied and demonstrated to
the European Parliament that these accusations - the latest appearing in
the Austrian magazine Sonnenzeitung - were false, the Commissioner said,
and it "vigorously refutes" any unjustified allegations made against the
Ezio Andreta, the Director responsible for research and technological
development projects concerning energy. However, Commissioner Cresson
confirmed that another Commission official involved, Wolfgang Palz, has
been assigned to other duties - with his consent - while awaiting the
results of the inquiry.

VAN MIERT SEEKS "CLARIFICATIONS" OVER ELECTRABEL ACCORDS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has written to the
Belgian Government asking for "clarifications" over plans by the power
utility ELECTRABEL, to force local authorities into long-term electricity
supply contracts, it was revealed on October 22. In March this year,
Electrabel, which is privately owned, offered the Belgian intercommunales
(joint ventures between municipalities for electricity distribution) the
chance to buy stakes in the company in return for signing 30-year
electricity distribution contracts. Mr Van Miert has repeatedly said that,
under EU rules on free and fair competition, he will not accept contracts
lasting more than 15 years.

The Commissioner is now reported to have asked the Belgian authorities for
a clearer explanation of how much freedom the local authorities will have
to end the contracts with Electrabel and choose to go to another supplier.
An EU source said that although the Commission had recently received a
letter from Leo Peeters, Flemish Minister for Home Affairs, agreeing "in
principle" to the 15-year contracts, Mr Van Miert was concerned about
recent indications that the parties to the agreements might be planning a
U-turn over commitments made in May for a definite reduction in their
duration.

EUROPE'S LARGEST WIND ENERGY PLANT OPENS IN WALES

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The largest wind energy plant in Europe began operating on October 23,
according to NATIONAL POWER, the British electricity production company.
Located in Carno, Wales, the plant is capable of producing enough energy
to meet the needs of 25,000 homes. The plant, equipped with 56 turbines
and able to generate up to 33 megawatts of electricity, cost National
Power GBP26 million (about USD41 million). According to Hugh
Babington-Smith, Executive Director of the British Wind Energy
Association, 10% of the UK's electricity could be produced by wind by
2025. If the Government adopted this goal, 13,000 new jobs could be
created in wind energy production. Currently, about 150,000 people in
Britain get their electricity from 31 wind energy plants. "We have 40% of
Europe's total wind resources, but we risk falling behind the rest of the
world in wind energy development", Mr Babington-Smith added. The County of
Powys, a rural area of Wales, will now obtain 40% of its electricity from
four wind-powered generating plants.

FRENCH PETROLEUM INDUSTRY EXPANDS DURING 1996

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The French upstream oil industry is expected to see a slight increase in
turnover during 1996, to about 49 billion French Francs from 48 billion in
1995, according to an annual survey by the French Petroleum Institute
(Institut Francais du Petrole - IFP), the Committee on Oil and Marine
Studies (Comite d'Etudes Petroli
res et Marines - CEPM) and the Groupement
des Entreprises Parapetroli
res et paragazi
res (GEP) published on October
22. Next year also looks promising, with three-quarters of the companies
surveyed (accounting for 65% of turnover in the industry) expecting their
business to grow. Service providers were particularly optimistic. Despite
strong international competition, the French oil industry has once again
managed to play an important role on the world market, according to
figures provided by the IFP, CEPM and GDP. The world oil exploration and
production market is estimated at between USD110 and 120 billion,
including the countries of the former Soviet Union. France claims a 6%
market share. In 1995, turnover in the upstream oil industry, at 48
billion Francs, was 6% higher than the year before. The increase was
particularly marked in the offshore sector, which had a 32% rise in
activity, followed by a slight slump in 1996. More than 80% of turnover is
generated outside the country and climbed from 25 to 40 billion Francs
between 1990 and 1995. The share of business in the rest of Western
Europe, outside France, is estimated at FF13 billion. The UK, Norway and
the Netherlands are major customers, but Germany and other European
countries are also valuable markets. French firms conduct nearly
one-fourth of their foreign business in Africa. However, they are minor
players in North America and particularly the United States.

BRITISH ENERGY TO SHED 1,460 JOBS OVER THREE YEARS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

BRITISH ENERGY, which owns and operates Britain's eight most modern
nuclear power stations has rocked the trade unions by unveiling plans to
shed 1,460 jobs over the next three years. The workforce of the company
privatised in mid-July will be reduced to 4,800. British Energy's Managing
Director, Robert Hawley, lays claim to a clear and simple strategy to
reduce costs and improve efficiency in order to ensure the nuclear energy
company can continue to compete effectively with conventional electricity
generation. Mr Hawley has reiterated the company's promise to never
compromise its total commitment to safety, insisting there would be little
point in reducing staff numbers if safety standards could not be
maintained. The plan is expected to secure wage cost savings of about
GBP50 million per year. British Energy will, however, need to offset
restructuring costs of about GBP100 million, which will be covered by
existing funds and spread over three years.

The restructuring at British Energy is part of a general trend of job cuts
in the privatised energy sector. By the year 2000, British Energy will
have reduced its 1992 workforce by 40%. POWERGEN and NATIONAL POWER,
Britain's leading traditional generators, will have reduced their
workforces by 71 ands 63% respectively.

FOREIGN INVESTORS FLOCK TO GAZPROM

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

GAZPROM will enter international markets at the relatively high price of
USUSD1.57 a share, with foreign investors queuing up for a share of the
jewel of Russian industry. However, analysts are still questioning whether
Gazprom, which holds a quarter of global gas reserves, is really a good
deal or rather an over-weight monster that will always be tarnished by the
stigma of the Soviet era. The company has announced profits of USD3.5
billion for 1995, but accounts will only be published according to
international standards from this year, providing a more accurate
barometer of its health.

The conglomerate has announced that Gazprom shares will begin trading on
international stock markets on October 28, at USD15.75 for batches of ten
shares. Company Chairman Rem Viakhirev, has indicated that the share issue
is heavily over-subscribed despite the fact the price is three times
higher than on internal stock markets (about USD0.6 a share). Gazprom will
issue 23.7 million batches of ten shares -American Deposit Stocks (ADS)-
representing a little more than 1% of the company. This initial sale is
expected to raise USD400 million, with Gazprom planing to float a further
8% of capital on the international markets. The share price values the
conglomerate at USD38.5 billion, a fairly modest sum, given that Gazprom,
a giant even by monopoly standards, sells nearly USD8 billion worth of
natural gas to the West each year. A brochure published by Gazprom at the
beginning of the year, estimated the company's real value at closer to
USD5 a share. Despite being Europe's leading gas exporter, with a
workforce of 230,000 employed in 40 subsidiaries, and 145,000 kilometres
of gas pipelines throughout the former USSR, Gazprom nonetheless remains a
high risk enigma for foreign investors.

ON-SHORE BUSINESS SHAVES 7% OFF NORSK HYDRO PROFITS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Norwegian group NORSK HYDRO (oil, gas, chemicals, petrochemicals,
fertilizers) has announced a 7% fall in pre-tax profits over the first
nine months of the year, blamed on a decline in "on-shore" activities
which higher than anticipated oil prices have been unable to offset. At
8.403 billion Norwegian Krone (USD 1.292 billion), profits are NKr 450
million short of analysts' forecasts, and compare with a profit of NKr
9.023 billion over the corresponding period last year. Norsk Hydro
turnover is up 6% from NKr 59.464 billion to 63.121 billion (USD 9.710
billion), with operating profits down 9% to NKr 7.899 billion.

The company is blaming the fall in profits on a decline in revenue from
on-shore activities. High prices for aluminium and petrochemical products
last year have fallen back this year. In addition, the group has been
forced to tap operating profits to pay higher taxes brought about by an
increase in the proportion of revenue from the oil and gas sectors. Norsk
Hydro Chairman Egil Myklebust claims this varied picture again illustrates
how the company's diverse activities have a balancing effect on our
revenue. He believes the group's avowed goal of securing an operating
profit of NKr 10 billion for the year as a whole is still within reach.

The oil and gas sector has seen a 96% increase in operating profits to NKr
4.291 billion (USD 660.1 million) over the first nine months of the year,
thanks to the high price of hydrocarbons and increased production, up 17%
to 3.4 million tonnes oil equivalent. The average price of crude oil has
risen 32% over the third quarter to NKr 136 (USD 20.9) per barrel. In 1995
the group posted record pre-tax profits of NKr 11.089 billion (USD1.706
billion).

SHELL THREATENS TO PROSECUTE ROMANIA'S CRP

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

Anglo-Dutch oil multinational ROYAL DUTCH SHELL is threatening to bring
charges against the state-controlled Romanian oil company CRP, which it
has accused of discriminating against private clients. In an open letter
dated October 15 and signed jointly with the Italian oil company AGIP,
Shell argues that the creation of CRP this Summer threatens to represent
"a step backwards" with "disastrous consequences" for the Romanian oil
industry. If CRP wants to take a step forwards it must respect two
fundamental principles: profitability and non-discrimination. However
recent practices have, according to Shell, highlighted flagrant violations
of these principles. The company claims that refineries controlled by CRP
tend to discriminate against independent distributors, and in favour of
other clients that have close ties with the company, despite being "bad
payers". A CRP spokesman has rejected these accusations, insisting that
Shell has enjoyed the same treatment as other clients. Since moving on to
the Romanian market two years ago, the Anglo-Dutch giant has established a
chain of service stations around Bucharest and plans to extend its network
throughout the country. Shell warns that if the current situation
continues, CRP will have to answer in court for the abuse of its dominant
market position, and indeed violation of the Energy Charter that Romania
signed. The World Bank, which has granted Romania a USD175 million loan to
regenerate the oil sector, recently condemned the creation of the CRP as
"contrary to market deregulation".

ELF OFFERS OUTLETS FOR QATARI GAS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The French oil company ELF AQUITAINE has highlighted access to outlets as
part of its bid to participate in liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar.
Speaking on October 17, on the sidelines of an international gas
conference in Abou Dhabi, Bruno Karcher of Elf's gas division indicated
that the French oil group believes it can guarantee outlets in Europe for
LNG from Qatar, which has the region's second largest gas reserves,
estimated at 7,000 billion cubic metres. Mr Karcher indicated that this
offer has been passed on to the Qatari Government. The state-run
conglomerate Qatar General Petroleum Corporation (QGPC) is the majority
shareholder in three LNG export projects, one of which, Qatargas, should
be operational by the end of the year. The other two, Rasgas and
Enron/QGPC are still at the planning stage. The foreign partners in
Qatargas are MOBIL (United States), TOTAL (France) and the Japanese
companies MITSUI and MARUBENI, and outlets have already been secured in
Japan for all Qatargas production. Rasgas, in which Mobil has a 30% stake,
has thus far placed only a quarter of maximum projected production in
South Korea. Finally, the American company ENRON and QGPC are expected to
finalise an agreement to build a third gas liquefaction plant later this
year. Enron plans to market production in Israel, Jordan and India.

INAUGURATION OF THE MAGHREB-EUROPE GAS PIPELINE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline will be opened at the end of October or
the beginning of November, Algeria's Energy Minister Amar Makhloufi
announced on October 14, indicating that final tests are progressing
according to plan. Begun in 1994, the pipeline will link Algeria's Hassi
R'Mel gas field to the Spanish city of Seville, via Morocco and the
Straits of Gibraltar. 1,265 km long and with an initial capacity of 8
billion m3/year the pipeline will initially supply the Spanish and
Moroccan markets, and later Portugal, France and Germany, as capacity
increases to 20 billion m3/year about the year 2000. With the entry into
service of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, the second structure linking
Algeria to Europe, after the Transmed pipeline laid at the beginning of
the 1980s between Hassi R'Mel and Italy, Algeria expects to double gas
exports by the beginning of the next millennium.

GREEN LIGHT FOR ELF NEGOTIATIONS ON NEW DEPOSIT IN AZERBAIJAN

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Azerbaijani President, Gueidar Aliev, has authorised the French oil
company ELF AQUITAINE to finalise negotiations on becoming the principal
operator of an major exploration zone in the Caspian Sea. Announced on
October 11, the Presidential green light coincided with the French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette's visit to Baku, on the last stage of a
three-day tour of the Caucuses that took him from Armenia to Georgia and
finally to Azerbaijan. ELF is now free to pursue negotiations with the
Azerbaijani oil company SOCAR, and draw up a definitive agreement for the
exploration and exploitation of the Leninakan offshore field, which may
contain up to 50 million tonnes of oil. The agreement will leave ELF
controlling the field with a 75% stake in operations.

Joel Bouchaud, Elf's Director for the Orient, the CIS and Latin American,
explained that the company's objective will now be to finalise an
agreement before President Aliev's the official visit to France on January
13. Mr Bouchaud indicated that once contracts have been exchanged, Elf may
surrender a part of its stake. In April 1995 ELF missed out on an
important contract for the exploitation of the Chirag-Azeri-Gunshli field,
now operated by the Americans. In June, Elf secured a 10% stake in the
exploration of the Chahdeniz field controlled jointly by BRITISH PETROLEUM
and the Norwegian company STATOIL. Azerbaijani oil reserves are estimated
at about a billion tonnes. 8 million tonnes are currently extracted
annually, compared with 40 million tonnes during Azerbaijan's Soviet
period.

COAL USE AND OUTPUT IN WESTERN EUROPE STILL FALLING

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

With coal use in Western Europe expected to continue its decline as more
and more energy efficiency and ecological control measures are
implemented, the urgent application of clean coal technologies will be
essential in asserting a role for coal in sustainable energy development,
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) reported on
October 10. In a survey of coal developments in Eastern and Western Europe
in 1995/1996, the ECE says the future of coal will increasingly depend on
the electricity industry as demand from other sectors, such as
coke-making, is forecast to continue declining. Some 85% of the hard coal
and virtually all of the brown coal consumed in the ECE region (which
covers both East and West Europe) was used for heat and electricity in
1995, compared with only about 12% of ECE hard coal output used for
coke-making. Coal provides close to 40% of the ECE region's electricity,
and after oil and natural gas is the area's most important source of
primary energy.

The UN/ECE notes that the decline of coal production in Europe has
accelerated since 1990, with hard coal output falling about 30 million
tonnes (or 5%) in 1995, taking it to 19% of global output as compared to
25% in 1990. While a temporary stabilisation of output is forecast for
1996, further reductions are planned for the 1996-2005 period, especially
in Germany, France, Poland and Russia. Overall European coal exports have
also declined from some 80 million tonnes in 1990 to 70 million in 1995;
Western European exports have virtually ceased.

EU PETROL AND HEATING OIL PRICES UP ON OCTOBER 21

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

All categories of EU fuel and heating oil prices rose between October 7
and October 21, according to figures from the European Commission's Energy
Directorate-General (DGXVII). Continuing a four-week trend, the average
price of premium-grade petrol rose slightly from ECU 216.92/1,000 litres
to ECU 220.61/1,000 litres, Euro-super unleaded premium-grade was up to
ECU 232.46/1,000 litres from ECU 227.30/1,000 litres, and motor diesel
jumped to ECU 251.14/1,000 litres from ECU 238.60/1,000 litres. Heating
oil prices increased to ECU 221.41/1,000 litres from ECU 219.50/1,000
litres (and rose as high as ECU 225.58/1,000 litres on October 14), and
residual fuel oil prices were up to ECU 123.99 from ECU 119.83 per 1,000
litres on average.

ELECTRICITY: EUROPEAN PRODUCTION BELOW OECD AVERAGE IN JULY

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

European electricity production increased by 3.1% in the first seven
months of 1996 as compared to the same period last year, while output in
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development region as a
whole rose 3.6%, the International Energy Agency announced in its monthly
electricity survey published on October 10. By way of comparison,
increases of 4.6% were registered in the United States, 3.3% in Japan,
1.7% in Canada and 1.2% in Australia.

Electricity output in OECD Europe increased by 1.4% to 187.8 terawatt
hours in July 1996 compared with twelve months before, and nuclear and
thermal electricity production increased by 6.4% (to 60.7 TWh) and 3.7%
(to 88.6 TWh) respectively. In contrast, hydro-electric power generation
fell, for the second month in a row, by 10.0% to 38.5 TWh

US electricity output declined by 1.3% (to 288.9 TWh), due primarily to a
drop in thermal and nuclear power generation of 2.2% (to 199.8 TWh) and
1.7% (to 61.0 TWh) respectively and a 6.6% rise in hydro-electricity
production (to 28.2 TWh).

Electricity output in Japan increased by 4.7% following an 8.3% rise in
nuclear production, a 7.3% rise in thermal electricity output and a drop
of 14.2% in hydro -electricity generation.

Canada also saw an increase in electricity output; but only of 1.5%,
resulting from a rise in hydro-power generation of 10.9% and a fall in
nuclear and thermal electricity production of 15.6% and 8.0% respectively.

NORWAY EAGER TO SELL GAS TO POLAND.

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Bjorn Tore Godal, has indicated that his
Government would support the sale of gas to Poland. Accompanying King
Harald V on an official visit to Warsaw on October 15, Mr Godal's
declaration came after a meeting with his Polish counterpart Dariusz
Rosati. The two Ministers nevertheless agreed that the conclusion of
concrete agreements should be left to specialised companies. Mr Rosati
claims that Polish companies have long been interested in purchasing gas
from Norway, as Russian gas supplies will be insufficient to cover demand.
Moreover, the Minister is aware that Poland would do well to diversify its
supply sources, in order to guarantee energy security. At the end of
September, Poland signed an important contract with Russia covering the
supply of 250 billion m3 of Siberian gas over 25 years. The first three
billion m3 should reach Poland in 1997, with supplies rising to 14 billion
m3 per year by 2010.

TAXATION/EXCISE DUTIES: COMMISSION SOON TO PROPOSE TAXES ON ALL ENERGY
SOURCES

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commission is expected to come up with a proposal before the
end of November for an increase in minimum excise duty rates on mineral
oils and the inclusion of other energy sources - electricity, natural gas,
coal and perhaps even biofuels - in the excise duty system. If the
proposal is approved by the full team of Commissioners and the Council of
Finance Ministers (which could be more difficult), excise duties on
mineral oils would gradually be increased, particularly in those Member
States that currently have the lowest taxes. With the proposed energy/CO2
tax stalled for the past four years, the Commission's main goal is now to
win acceptance for the principle of some kind of tax, no matter how small,
on all energy sources. The proposal, which puts more emphasis on the
principle than actual tax rates, has already created "very serious
tensions" within the Commission, according to well-placed sources.

Since January 1, 1993, the Member States have been required to set excise
duties rates on mineral oils above a Community minimum rate (expressed in
ECU) for each product and its particular use (heating oil, lead-free
petrol, etc.) under Directive 92/82/EEC governing excise duties on mineral
oils. The same excise duty system covers tobacco and alcoholic drinks too
(although the Commission does not intend to modify the rates for these
products at the moment). A closer convergence of duty rates among the
Member States within the Single Market to prevent distortions of
competition was one of the Commission's and the Member States' objectives
in adopting this system. Some current minimum rates are listed below.

* Heavy fuel oil: ECU 13 per 1,000 kg

* liquefied petroleum gas and methane for industrial use: ECU 36/1,000 kg

* leaded petrol: ECU 337 /1,000 litres

* lead-free petrol: ECU 287/1,000 litres

Commission sources say that minimum rates should now be increased, not
only to keep pace with inflation, but also as a first step towards a
closer approximation of rates (setting a minimum rate tends to be
ineffective, since market forces push rates downward, according to
experts). This approximation of rates would discourage cross-border
shopping and would incorporate environmental concerns into policies in
other areas, now that the specific proposal for an energy/CO2 tax has
foundered. New rates should be high enough to create an incentive, but not
so high as to ruin the proposal's chances of adoption by the
Commissioners, informed sources explain. To soften the psychological and
practical impact of these measures, the increase would be gradual.
Commission experts speak of raising rates by about 30% over five to ten
years, but this is only theoretical. Several Directorate-Generals - DG III
(Industry), DG XXI (Taxation), DG XI (Environment), DG XV (Internal
Market) and DG XVII (Energy) must still consult among themselves.

Most of the Member States apply taxes at levels well above Community
minimum rates. But others (Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg)
impose rates on certain products (some types of mineral oils) that are
equivalent to or only slightly higher than the minimum. These Member
States would eventually be required to raise their minimum rates to comply
with the new European minima (and for this reason are likely to oppose the
proposal in Council). The rise would also concern those States whose rates
are already well above the minimum rates. "This increase would give Member
States with high excise duty rates more room to manoeuvre, making excise
duties higher everywhere", says an expert on this issue, also bringing up
the concept of shifting taxes on labour to other bases, preferably with a
positive impact in terms of environmental protection.

These are exactly the arguments that have spurred the Commission to
broaden the scope of application of the Directive on excise duties to
include other energy sources such as coal, natural gas and electricity.
The Commission's first concern seems to be winning acceptance for the
principle of taxation of these products, regardless of the rate, as a
first step towards compensating for the failure of the energy/CO2 tax
proposal. As mentioned earlier, even biofuels could be include in this
proposal, which would thus supersede Directive 92/81/EEC on the structure
of excise duties on mineral oils, that on excise duty rates (92/82/EEC)
and the draft Directive on excise duty reductions for biofuels (still held
up in the Council).

AUSTRALIA LIFTS EMBARGO ON URANIUM SHIPMENTS TO FRANCE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Australian Government announced on October 21 that it would lift the
embargo on new deliveries of uranium imposed in 1988 in protest of French
nuclear tests in the Pacific. This decision came in response to France's
signing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Australian Minster of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, Tim Fischer. The embargo covered new uranium contracts,
but not those signed before it took effect. Mr Fischer emphasised that
France's accession to the Treaty marked the fulfilment of promises it made
on January 29 to stop all nuclear testing. Australia's uranium export
policy prohibits sales of uranium for other than peaceful uses.

During the crisis sparked last year by French nuclear tests on Mururoa
Atoll, Australia's Labour Government refused to impose a total embargo on
shipments of uranium to France, explaining that such a measure would cost
Australia more than France. The decision to lift the embargo was
immediately condemned by environmentalists, who claimed that France had
not promised not to use Australian uranium for military purposes. "The
fact that the Australian Government seems ready to do anything to sell
Australian uranium is unfortunate", said Jim Downey, head of an Australian
conservation association, adding that France had not yet proved its good
faith on nuclear issues.

Australia originally imposed an embargo in 1983, lifted it in 1986 and
reapplied it in 1988. According to the Australian Uranium Information
Centre, Australia currently has orders for AUSD11 million (eight million
US Dollars) worth of non-enriched uranium, representing only 3% of
France's needs, but accounting for about 10% of Australia's exports.
Uranium Miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) sells 272 tonnes of
concentrated uranium oxide to France each year, at AUSD40,000
(USUSD30,400) per tonne, under a long-term contract with Electricite de
France (EDF). ERA's Director, Phillip Shirvington, indicated that the door
was now open for new exports, but that extensive negotiations were still
required. "This decision allows us to extend our contract with EDF when
the current one expires in the next century and to sign other contracts",
Mr Shirvington added.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION: ENERGY SECTOR PLANS UNDER 1997 WORK PROGRAMME

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

"1997 will be a watershed year marked by three major events: the
Inter-Governmental Conference, Economic and Monetary Union, the financial
package for post-1999 and enlargement", Jacques Santer told the European
Parliament, meeting in plenary in Strasbourg on October 22. The President
of the European Commission was presenting his institution's work programme
for 1997, along with a report on the implementation of the 1996 programme.
While the Commission's main priorities as the turn of the century nears
are growth and employment, development of a European model of society and
closer relations with third countries, actions are also foreseen in the
energy and environment fields. Mr Santer's presentation did not sway the
Parliament, however, which gave the programme a critical reception and
accused the Commission of legislative inertia.

Among the measures proposed specifically for the energy sector are a
proposal on the promotion of clean coal technology (CARNOT) and
communications on a renewable energy strategy, a cogeneration promotion
strategy, on the role of energy management in regions, cities and on
islands, on the part played by technology and strategy for energy RTD, and
on the harmonisation of nuclear transport conditions. The Commission also
plans to engage in negotiations on radioactive waste and Euratom accession
and revise legislation on compulsory oil stocks and on the price
transparency of crude oil and oil products. (See the list of planned
Commission actions below.)

I>"The Single Market has taken shape but it remains incomplete", the
Commission notes in its Work Programme. It therefore plans to work right
throughout 1997 to win the Council's agreement on several pending pieces
of legislation, including that on opening up the internal market for
natural gas. The Commission will put more pressure on the Member States to
speed up their transposition of Directives needed for the proper
functioning of the Internal Market. Rules on state aid will be assessed in
terms of their impact on employment. The Commission will also continue its
efforts to simplify legislation.

The Commission plans to propose measures to make companies better able to
compete, particularly in high-tech sectors; defend its Fifth Framework
Programme for Research and Technological Development; and take initiatives
to stimulate innovation at the conclusion of the process of consultation
on the Green Paper it unveiled this year.

As concerns the environment, apart from the revision of the Fifth Action
Programme - Towards Sustainable Development, the Commission wants to be a
"driving force" in preparations for the Conference to be held in 1997 as a
follow-up to the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.

List of planned Commission actions in the energy, environmental protection
and research and development areas in 1997:

CEDEC CRITICISES ELECTRICITY DIRECTIVE COMMON POSITION

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The EU Council of Ministers' June 20 common position on the internal
electricity market Directive cannot be defended from an economic, social
or legal point of view, and it compromises the rights and interests of
distribution companies, the European Confederation of Public Communal
Energy Distributors (CEDEC) says. "The existing version of the Directive
leads to a division of the single electricity market in two: on the one
hand, a privileged group of 'eligible clients' that can freely choose
their supplier in Europe and negotiate their prices, and on the other
hand, clients that will remain tied to their current distributor and upon
whom prices will be imposed as in the past", CEDEC argues in its October
newsletter.

"In fact, it would be economically and socially inadmissible that the
advantages of liberalised electricity production and sales on European
markets benefit only large industrial consumers of electricity", while
small consumers are excluded from the advantages that increased
competition will bring, CEDEC continues. CEDEC groups national communal
energy distribution associations in Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and
Austria.

EU/VENEZUELA: EUROPEAN BUSINESSES ENCOURAGED TO INVEST

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

Venezuela is reforming its economy and European companies are welcome to
invest in several industries, including those in the energy sector. This
is the message the country is sending out through a series of seminars on
"Doing Business in Venezuela" being held this month in Amsterdam,
Brussels, Madrid, Milan and Padova as part of an effort to diversify
sources of investment and enhance the country's access to new markets.
"Venezuela is the best kept secret in Latin America", Luis Xavier
Grisanti, Ambassador to the EU, Belgium and Luxembourg told Europe Energy
on October 16. But with opportunities for foreign investors abounding and
seminars like the one in Brussels on October 14 attracting 115
participants from the financial, industrial and international services
sectors, the secret may not remain concealed for long.

The Ambassador said that potential investors are being attracted primarily
by the country's extensive privatisation programme and other open market
reforms such as the abolition of exchange and price controls - including
petrol and electricity price rises - liberalisation of interest rates and
the reduction of the fiscal deficit. These are being implemented as part
of a global macro-economic stabilisation programme, called "Agenda
Venezuela," that aims to help the country get fully back on its feet after
a serious financial crisis in 1994.

A long list of assets and companies up for privatisation by early 1997
includes several electric power systems, including the Nueva Esparta State
Power System, Energia Electrica de Barquisimeto (Enelbar) in the state of
Lara and the Enelven-Enelco power system in the state of Zulia. The gas,
petrochemical, coal and oil sectors are also being opened to foreign
investment; a first round of tenders for "share-risk contracts" in new
areas of oil exploration has already taken place, and bidding for
operational contracts for marginal wells is to be held in 1997. With
USD1.3 billion spent in 1994 on purchasing materials and equipment for the
oil industry, opportunities for companies providing goods and services
also exist.

The seminars, in which high-level officials such as Venezuela's Planning
Minister Teodoro Petkoff, Deputy Minister of Energy and Mines Evanan
Romero and Bank Deposit Guarantee Fund President Esther de Margulis have
participated, are being sponsored by the Government of Venezuela, the
European Commission and the National Council for Investment Promotion
(CONAPRI). A series of similar meetings is taking place in the United
States.

COMPETITION: VAN MIERT CONSIDERS FUTURE OF OIL SALES COMPETITION
EXEMPTIONS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commissioner for Competition, Karel Van Miert, is considering
a proposal for a two-year extension of rules - which are due to expire at
the end of 1997 - that exempt exclusive supply and distribution agreements
in the oil and beer sectors from European Union competition rules under
Article 85.3 of the EU Treaty. The Commission said on October 16 that the
proposal was to avoid a "legal vacuum" that could occur if the existing
"block exemptions" from EU competition rules were to expire before
consultations on the Commission's Green Paper on the long-term future of
exclusive supply and distribution agreements, due to be published by early
1997, were concluded. The Green Paper, also known as the vertical
restraints paper, is already a year overdue.

The Regulations at stake cover tens of thousands of agreements by which a
supplier, on the one hand, appoints a reseller as his exclusive
distributor in a given area (Regulation 1983/83), and on the other hand, a
reseller agrees to buy all his products from one supplier only (Regulation
1984/83). These exemptions from normal EU competition rules currently
allow oil companies to make exclusive supply agreements with petrol
stations.

The Green Paper is expected to call for the review of agreements within
the oil, beer and perfume sectors and also to address the issue of
franchising, covered by a separate block exemption which expires at the
end of 1999. One solution which could be put forward in the Green Paper
would be to carry on with sectoral block exemptions. Another would be to
base exemptions on the market share of the company operating the
restrictive agreements. In the meantime, when Mr Van Miert makes a formal
proposal for the extension of the rules, his decision must be approved by
the full team of Commissioners.

The European oil industry, represented by Europia, is especially concerned
that if the block exemptions were rescinded, petrol distributors which now
benefit from acceptable exclusive purchasing or supply agreements could
suffer in a climate of increased uncertainty. In informal talks with the
Commission's Directorate-General responsible for Competition on the
preparation of the Green Paper, the industry has already indicated that
while it would like the legal certainty provided by Regulation 1984/83 to
continue, the regime could be improved. Europia suggested that the new
regime should allow a duration of 10 years or more for the exclusive
purchasing agreement, which would lead to adequate return on capital
employed, and the inclusion within the exclusive purchasing regime of
lubricants, company fuel card schemes and all-convenience store goods.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO CREATE ENERGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commission is likely to adopt by early November a Decision to
create an Energy Advisory Committee, as called for in its December 1995
Energy Policy White Paper, as part of an effort to establish an informal
but institutionalised dialogue with the energy sector and ensure its
support when new areas of action in the energy field are chosen. This
Committee will be expected to assist in identifying energy policy areas
where Commission action is deemed to be necessary, provide advice on the
means needed to implement Commission proposals and give opinions on these
proposals before they are finalised.

The Committee is to be composed of 31 representatives of energy producers,
distributors, consumers, unions, and associations dealing with the
protection of the environment. During the preparation of the White Paper,
all these interested parties had indicated to the Commission the priority
they place on dialogue and transparency in the formulation of EU energy
policy.

COGENERATION: NEW POLITICAL SUPPORT EXPRESSED AT CONFERENCE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

In a special report on the recent conference on Prospects and challenges
for Europe's cogeneration markets, freelance journalist Steve Hodgson,
writing for Cogen Europe, looks at how a new political momentum is
building toward a new cogeneration strategy, what elements Cogen Europe
thinks this strategy should contain, and what cogeneration's prospects are
in a liberalised electricity market.

Prospects for an EU cogeneration strategy have received a major boost from
Peter Scholten of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. Speaking at
Cogen Europe's annual conference in Brussels on October 10-11 (see last
issue of Europe Energy), Mr Scholten announced that the proposed strategy
will be on the agenda for the May 1997 Energy Council under the
forthcoming Dutch EU Council Presidency if the Communication from the
Commission on the subject is presented in time.

Earlier during the conference, Joanna Tachmintzis, a member of Energy
Commissioner Christos Papoutsis' Cabinet, said that Europe's cogeneration
industry is entering "a new phase in its development," and that new
cogeneration capacity will be an essential element of efforts to curb
Europe's CO2 emissions in the coming years.

She added that the prospects for cogeneration will boosted by both the
proposed internal electricity market Directive and by the Communication on
cogeneration from the Commission, which is due to be published early in
1997. This strategy will be framed to take account of both EU
environmental and energy policy objectives and could, said Ms Tachmintzis,
include an EU target for cogeneration, something for which Cogen Europe
has long been calling.

As well as setting a European target for cogeneration, Cogen Europe
believes that the strategy should also:

*provide ongoing monitoring of market barriers to cogeneration in each
country,

*prioritise cogeneration's position within the EU's carbon reduction
programmes, and

*establish cogeneration support programmes for central and eastern Europe.

Another major conclusion from the conference was that the liberalisation
of electricity markets currently taking place in Europe will aid the
development of decentralised cogeneration plant but may harm prospects for
existing city-wide cogeneration/district heating systems. Many national
electricity markets are already moving towards more competitive and
transparent structures, a trend which helps cogeneration and which Cogen
Europe supports.

The amount of cogeneration used in each country is a function of its
history, climate and level of industrialisation, but also of the
prevailing legal/regulatory/market framework. While only some 7% of
Europe's electricity is generated by cogeneration, three countries - the
Netherlands, Denmark and Finland - generate more than 30% in this way.
Cogen Europe suggests that a 30% share could be achieved across the
continent by 2010, providing ECU 140 billion of investment opportunities,
new jobs and massive CO2 cuts.

Announcing the preliminary results of a major Cogen Europe study at the
conference, UK and Danish consultants Ilex and Ramboll said that
liberalisation helps cogeneration in industry, buildings and small-scale
district heating schemes by allowing energy users to self-generate their
own power and by removing a number of market barriers. City-wide systems
may need protection in a more competitive environment.

Equally importantly, liberalisation promotes more progressive utility
thinking as well as structures, said Ilex/Ramboll, and increases customer
choice. Thus the UK energy markets, perhaps the most liberalised in the
EU, have helped cogeneration grow by 50% since the electricity industry
was first privatised in 1990.

Cogen Europe believes that, to be helpful to cogeneration, national
frameworks should include greater competition in electricity generation,
more open access to the transmission system and a service-oriented
distribution system. If these measures were accompanied by moves to
reflect environmental costs in energy prices, this would help cogeneration
begin to meet its enormous potential in Europe, both East and West.

Over 230 delegates attended the conference to learn about the latest moves
from Brussels and to hear presentations on the prospects for cogeneration
within 13 countries, among them 10 EU Member States, Hungary, Poland and
the Czech Republic. Cogen Europe was able to report that it now has 117
members, including a network of 11 national promotional organisations.

GADONNEIX TO PRESIDE OVER GDF AFTER FRENCH TOP JOBS RESHUFFLE

Pierre Gadonneix has been appointed president of Gaz de France (GdF)
following the sudden move of his predecessor, Loik le Floch-Prigent, to
take over running the state railway company, SNCF. Employees of the
latter provided the backbone to the recent wave of strikes in France
(EER 449/15): le Floch-Prigent was chosen by Paris because he manages
to combine socialist politics with managerial competence.

Gadonneix, who was appointed the general manager of GdF in July 1987,
had already been passed over for the top job twice. In 1988, when
Jacques Fournier left, it went to Francis Gutmann. In 1993, Gadonneix
saw le Floch-Prigent appointed over his head.

It remains to be seen how far Gadonneix will pursue the
internationalist and market-oriented policies of his predecessor. He
must renegotiate the company's charter with the government, which
defines its activities. In its home market, GdF faces challenges from
both electricity and fuel oil, and could also face an assault on its
monopoly of gas distribution.

Internationally, Gadonneix must manage those GdF assets already
acquired in Canada, Uruguay, and the US. Eventually, he will also have
to face pressure from Brussels to deregulate, even if the European
Commission has concentrated on electricity in the first instance.

In a spell at the industry ministry, Gadonneix worked with liberally
inclined ministers such as Michel d'Ornano, Rene Monory, and Alain
Madelin. But he will face fierce opposition from the country's trade
unions to any liberalisation. The unions had already designated 4
January as the next day of action to defend French-style public
service.

In fact, le Floch-Prigent's plans to exchange shareholdings with the
Russian gas company Gazprom were always likely to cause problems if he
had got anywhere near putting them into practice. The fact that cur-
rent industry minister Franck Borotra favours selling minority stakes
to Elf or Norway's Statoil, or to individuals, will do Gadonneix no
favours.

The appointment of Gadonneix contrasts with the recent politically
motivated parachutage of Edmond Alphandery (EER 449/2) at the head of
Electricite de France (EdF). But like Alphandery, Gadonneix will take
part in nominating his deputy, thereby strengthening his authority,
though there was no awkwardness between Gadonneix and his former
president, as there was under the 'ancien regime' at EdF.

Among the names being mentioned for the general manager's post are the
current deputy general manager Jean Balazuc, as well as the director of
the industry ministry's energy department, Claude Mandil.

ITALY UNVEILS PLAN FOR ENEL SALE AND LIMITED DEREGULATION

With shares in hydrocarbons conglomerate ENI now trading on
international stock exchanges (EER 488/7), Italy has begun to firm up
plans to divest state power utility Enel.

The Enel sell-off will not, however, take place as rapidly as some,
including budget minister Rainer Masera, had hoped for. Instead,
premier Lamberto Dini opted for the more cautious approach favoured by
industry minister Alberto Clo: the privatisation will take place over
the next two to three years and will be accompanied by power sector
reforms.

There may be further changes in the Enel sell-off arrangements, not
least due to the uncertain governmental situation, with Dini having -
as promised - submitted his resignation at the start of the year only
for it to be rejected by Italy's president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

In the meantime, the administration said the government stake in Enel
could be lowered to less than 51%, even though this was the level
suggested by parliament.

In his losing arguments, budget minister Masera had pushed for speedier
and more comprehensive privatisation, saying that the government needed
to send "strong and clear-cut signals" to potential investors and that
Enel's fragmented sale would be "a grave error".

The government outlined a plan for a three-phase privatisation. The
first stage calls for the sale of a certain amount of Enel shares - the
figure of 30% has been mentioned - within the first few months of 1996,
coupled with changes in Enel's accounting and management, including
production, distribution and transport.

The second phase will involve the flotation of a second tranche and a
new government policy on electricity. The third part of the process
will see the sale of the last segment of shares to be sold, with the
state losing overall control but hanging on to a substantial interest.

Despite its privatisation, however, there seems little doubt that Enel
will continue to be the dominant force in Italian electricity, even if
in private hands. After the necessary go-ahead from the government's
anti-trust authority, which is now studying the Enel case, the utility
will retain certain exclusive rights, particularly in distribution.

Despite the proposed liberalisation, the government reaffirmed the
principle of the "single rate" and, among other guidelines, the
"universality of electric services".

As for production, this will be open to competition only for additional
energy supplies deemed necessary, including from abroad "on the basis
of reciprocity" and within EU regulations. Other producers can either
sell their energy to Enel or negotiate directly with "qualified
consumers", meaning large agencies or concerns.

Nationwide, Enel will be designated the 'single buyer' responsible for
distributing electricity from producers to distributors and users. High
voltage transmission will also be handled by Enel to some 70 municipal
utility companies.

Enel described such stipulations as "important because, while
substantially maintaining the unity of Enel, they open the market to
competition in harmony with EU regulations."

But the plan drew mixed reactions from observers. Some lauded the
cautious sell-off approach and the accompanying reforms, while others
said the scheme did not go far enough and fell some way short of full
liberalisation. The municipal utilities of the larger cities,
accounting for about 7% of electricity consumed in Italy, were
particularly critical. Enel accounts for about 79% of power used.

COMMISSION HOPEFUL ON POWER

The European Commission is still hoping to reconcile member states to a
single agreed text for deregulating the electricity market.

Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert recently told a conference
organised by the Les Echos newspaper in Paris that the Commission could
wait to see whether a consensus was possible in the New Year.

Elsewhere, Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis insisted that there
was no blockage, and that all contentious questions would be resolved.

When member states' industry ministers held their delayed Council
meeting on 20 December, they unsurprisingly failed to agree, but
promised to restart negotiations in the New Year. Furthermore, the
Commission pointedly failed to invoke Article 90-3 of the Treaty of
Rome, which allows it to impose directives.

The Spanish energy minister, who presided over the meeting, said that
all the difficulties were surmountable, and that all of the conditions
were in place to reach agreement in the coming months.

The Commissioners appeared to be taking the view that it was the
strikes and demonstrations in France that were impeding agreement,
since the French government needed to prove that it was serious about
defending 'public service'.

One possible structure of a compromise could be to designate power
distributors among those consumers allowed to choose where they bought
their electricity. This should provide a measure of freedom for the
supporters of liberalisation, led by Germany but including the UK and
the Nordic countries, while allowing France enough leeway to leave
Electricite de France largely in control of its electricity
distribution.

French industry minister Franck Borotra reiterated his claim that
France was happy to let large industrial consumers benefit from
competition, provided that it could continue to organise its market
around the idea of public service, which meant security and continuity
of supplies, along with equal prices and equal access.

CO2 TAX SCHEDULE IN JEOPARDY

The resignation of Austria's finance minister Andreas Staribacher on 2
January will likely postpone introduction of the country's proposed
energy/CO2 tax on gas, coal and electricity. The tax had been intended
as a companion measure to the levy on mineral oils and fuels which went
into effect last May (EER 431/8).

Staribacher had been under considerable pressure to impose the extended
tax as part of a programme to resolve an unbearably large budget
deficit projected for this year. State industry minister Viktor Klima
has now been named as his successor.

The energy tax concept was originally proposed to reduce CO2 emissions
in line with Toronto targets; when it became clear that the Toronto
goals would not be met, the tax as applied to petroleum reverted to a
general income source.

Arguments have been flying back and forth over the amount of the tax to
be applied to gas and electricity (EER 444/9), one factor which has
delayed extension of the levy to energy sources beyond petroleum.

In addition to Staribacher's resignation, federal chancellor Franz
Vranitzky is faced with the challenge of forming a new government
following elections last month. That factor, plus the ministerial
change, as well as renewed debate over the size of the tax and its
utilisation - restricted or general - will probably postpone any
possible introduction of the levy until after mid-year at the earliest.

NESTE SELLS SOVEREIGN INTEREST TO UK REC NORTHERN ELECTRIC

Neste Corporation, the state-owned Finnish oil and gas company, has
signed a letter of intent to sell its 50.5% stake in Sovereign
Exploration to Northgas, a subsidiary of the UK regional power
distributor Northern Electric, Neste confirmed.

In February 1994, Neste and Northern Electric formed an upstream gas
company based on Neste's Southern Gas Basin interests and including the
Victor Gas field. As well as Victor, Sovereign Exploration also holds
interests in the Schooner field, which is scheduled to start production
at the end of 1996.

The sale of Sovereign Exploration marks Neste's latest phase in
divesting non-essential oil production and exploration holdings. The
company had earlier sold its UK oil assets to Sweden's Sands Petroleum
in a deal worth FM899m ($207m), as well as its oil and gas exploration
interests in the US.

Instead, Neste intends to re-focus on its upstream activities on the
Norwegian continental shelf, according to Neste's E&P planning manager,
Jyrki Haapio.

"We will also concentrate on upstream activities in the Middle East and
Russia," said Haapio. "This re-focusing of operations will result in
Neste moving its international business unit, responsible for our
Middle East operations, from London to Dubai."

STATOIL PLANS 1996 OUTPUT BOOST

Norwegian state-owned oil company Statoil expects to produce an
estimated 480mbbl of oil in 1996, the company's in-house magazine
Weekly Status said. Statoil produced 448mbbl in 1995, down from 460mbbl
in 1994.

This year's expected increase was attributed to the Heidrun and Yme
fields. Heidrun is now pumping at capacity and Yme will begin
production in a few weeks, the magazine said. Heidrun produced
218,491bbl on 1 January, thus achieving the goal of 200,000bbl/d at
year-end by a wide margin, Statoil added.

But the publication said an increase in production at Statfjord
satellites and the start of output at Heidrun in 1995 was not enough to
offset a considerable decrease at the old, giant Statfjord and Gullfaks
fields. It said production at Statfjord and Gullfaks would continue to
fall in 1996.

Norway, which pumped more than 3mbbl/d in November, is second only to
Saudi Arabia in the world's league of oil exporters.

* Norwegian oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production hit a new
record in November, according to analysts Wood Mackenzie. Output
averaged 3.19mbbl/d, 1,000bbl/d higher than the average level produced
in October, Wood Mackenzie said.

"Output from Heidrun continued to come onstream averaging 87,000bbl/d
for the month and production from Troll oil increased to 187,000bbl/d,"
said Wood Mackenzie in its December report on North West Europe. But
production from the Snorre, Gullfaks and Statfjord fields, loaded
offshore, fell slightly.

Danish oil and NGL production, meanwhile, fell by 4% to 182,000bbl/d in
November due to lower output from the Gorm and Skjold fields, said Wood
Mackenzie. Dutch oil and NGL output rose to 45,000bbl/d during
November, up almost 10% from October's 41,000bbl/d.

STATOIL REPORTS MAJOR FIND

Norwegian oil company Statoil appears to have made the biggest oil
strike in the Danish North Sea sector since the Skjold field was
discovered in 1977.

Preliminary reports indicate that the Siri-1 field, which lies only 6km
from the border with the Norwegian sector, contains as much as 150mbbl
of oil - sufficient to meet Denmark's oil requirements for three years.
The find is worth an estimated DKr15bn ($2.7bn).

Statoil reckons production at Siri-1 can start as early as 1998 because
the oil is in comparatively easily accessible strata. The find was made
2,200 metres underground in an area where the sea depth is 60 metres.

Denmark's energy minister Svend Auken expressed satisfaction that the
find was made so quickly after the recent granting of new exploration
rights in the fourth Danish round of concessions.

The interests in the fourth round licence in which the find was made
(6/95) are as follows: Statoil (operator) 50%, Enterprise Oil 20%, Dong
20% and Denerco 10%.

RECORD OUTPUT PREDICTION

UK North Sea oil figures due for release this month are expected to
reveal record output levels, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland
Oil and Gas Index. Analyst Mark Shea said figures for November and
December last year were expected to show peak production.

He said oil output for November was likely to have equalled or beat the
previous peak of 2.82mbbl/d recorded in January 1985. But figures for
December were expected to be even higher.

Shea went on: "We are expecting this peak because we know which oil
fields have come on stream and what production levels are likely to be.
However, we cannot guarantee peak output will be achieved."

Shea said the increasing production was down to a number of major
factors, such as advancing technology and cost-cutting by the oil
companies. "We are now seeing fields producing oil long after they were
forecast to run dry . . . These figures, despite the current low price
of oil, highlight how healthy the industry is and how important UK
investment is to the rest of the world."

SPAIN PLANS $200M REFINERY PIPELINE LINK BY 1997

A Pta25bn ($203m) oil pipeline will link Repsol's Puertollano and
Cartagena refineries in 1997, the industry and energy ministry said
last December.

Puertollano, in the central Spanish province of Ciudad Real, is the
only refinery in Spain not situated at a port and is the best placed to
meet rising demand for oil products in central Spain.

The 350km link will improve supplies of crude oil to the refinery, and
lead to an increase in capacity from 7mt/yr to 7.5mt/yr. The project
will receive Pta10bn ($81m) from the EU under the European Regional
Development Fund programme.

The port of Escombreras, Cartagena, is currently undergoing work which
will allow it to admit 125,000cm capacity tankers initially intended to
allow greater entry of liquefied natural gas to the Cartagena
regasification plant. The link to Puertollano opens up greater
possibilities for Cartagena as a point of entry for crude oil.

* The Banco Bilbao Vicaya (BBV) has increased its interest in Repsol
from 4.5% to 5.13% to gain fiscal advantages offered to groups
controlling a more than Pta60bn of share capital in another. The move
takes BBV ahead of Pemex (4.99%) as number two institutional Repsol
shareholder behind the Spanish state (21%). Madrid is expected to sell
around 7% of Repsol before the upcoming March general election.

CEPSA SET TO BEAT SALES RECORD

Cepsa, Spain's largest private oil refiner, is expected to surpass the
Pta1bn ($8m) sales mark for 1995. Up to November, the company reported
consolidated sales of Pta960bn, and gross profits of Pta29.18bn, 19.9%
up on the same period for 1994.

Stronger domestic oil product sales, up to 17.2mt (0.6% up) and
improved refinery margins gave added impetus to a strong chemicals
performance registered earlier in the year.

The company invested Pta46bn over the first 11 months of 1995, with the
main priority being the company's RKF and ORD blocks in the Algerian
Sahara. The company expects the first of these to produce 12,000bbl/d
later this year, rising to 30,000bbl/d by the start of 1997.

Cepsa has countered speculation in local press reports of 600mbbl of
reserves in the ORD block, saying that further research is necessary
before it can comment on volumes.

ESSO SAYS IT WILL STOP LEADED PETROL MARKETING THIS YEAR

By mid-1996 demand for high-grade leaded petrol should be so low in
Germany that Esso will stop marketing it. The warning came as Esso
unveiled plans to rationalise its retail petrol network.

According to Herbert Kirchhoff, head of the oil company's filling
station business, the share of leaded super in total petrol sales fell
to 6% last year, from more than 30% as recently as 1990. In 1996 it
will reach only 2.5%, Esso says.

Kirchhoff estimates that 5% of all cars registered in Germany - just
under 2m vehicles - are still in the market for leaded super. To offer
them an alternative, Esso - like its competitor Shell - has launched an
erosion protection additive which must be added to each tankful of
unleaded. Some 70 Esso filling stations are already no longer selling
leaded super.

Meanwhile, the concentration process in the filling station business
has continued unabated in Germany. In the 25 years to 1994, the total
number of filling stations plummeted by 60% - from 44,600 in the former
West Germany to 18,300 in unified Germany, 2,000 of which are located
in the east.

In the case of Esso this means that it cut the number of its own
stations from 5,560 to 1,627. Thanks to the restructuring, average
petrol and diesel sales per station jumped - from 470,000 litre/yr to
2.5m litres/yr.

With an 8% share in the German filling station market, Esso accounts
for 12% in total motor fuel sales. The company points out that with
3.6m litres/yr per station, Esso's own sales exceed the average annual
figure by one-third, giving a turnover of DM7m/yr ($4.9m/yr) per unit.

Due to estimated investments of DM400,000 per station in additional
environmental protection measures needed to comply with new
legislation, the total number of filling stations in Germany is bound
to shrink further.

Esso's own plans foresee the closure of about 250 stations, with the
construction of 50 new ones, predominantly in east Germany, also
envisaged. This would leave the total number of Esso stations at around
1,400, with 150 of them in eastern Germany.

In its survey of German energy consumption in the past year, Esso
points out that the German refineries are once again losing money. It
complains that while crude imports into Germany in 1995 dropped by 4%
to 101.9mt, oil product imports rose by the same percentage rate to
42.8mt. As a result, average refinery utilisation dropped to 92.2% from
95.5% in 1994.

Combined with high German production costs, this led to losses in the
downstream sector, surpassing those recorded a year earlier. Thus, two
refineries closed down last year. Consequently, overall distillation
capacity dropped to 111.9mt/yr from 113.1mt/yr in 1994. At the same
time, the sector invested in additional conversion capacity at the
remaining refineries which led to an increase of 2% to 47.5mt/yr.

With deliveries of 20.7mt, the CIS was Germany's largest supplier of
crude last year, despite the fact that the volume was down 9% on 1994.
A close second was Norway, which upped its crude exports to Germany by
4% to 20.3mt, followed by the UK which raised them by 11% to 18.5mt.

Deliveries from Libya dropped 3% to 11.4mt. As a result, German crude
receipts from the North Sea (38%) surpassed those from OPEC countries
(35%) for the first time.

Sales of oil products in the German market were up 1% to 127.3mt last
year. Petrol consumption rose only 1.7% to 30.3mt, although motor
registration figures showed an increase of 2% to 40.7m vehicles. Sales
of unleaded jumped by 1mt to 28.6mt.

Thanks to the ongoing construction activity in east Germany, and
Germany's increasing role as a transit country, demand for diesel
expanded by 4.1% to 26.6mt. By contrast, demand for LFO continued to
fall, despite lower temperatures at end-1995 compared to a year
earlier: sales dropped 2.8% to 35mt.

Against that, HFO sales rose 2% to 7.7mt, thus registering growth for
the first time in two years. However, Esso does not see any expansion
potential in this line in the long run, due to ever stricter
environmental provisions.

IPIC IN OMV SHAREHOLDER SPAT

Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC), a 19.6%
shareholder in OMV, and the government's holding corporation OIAG, are
sparring over possible changes to OMV's shareholder base.

OIAG is seeking to sell off at least 24 percentage points of its
present 49% OMV stake; unless IPIC boosts its holding, an OIAG sell-off
could trigger clauses in the syndicate agreement running to 2010 under
which Abu Dhabi bought into OMV in 1994 (EER 412/5). The agreement
guarantees government buyback of the IPIC holding should OIAG's share
fall below 30.1%.

OIAG to date has failed to convince IPIC to boost its holding to a
controlling 25.1%. At the same time, the Austrian group has failed to
agree to an IPIC representative on the OMV board; the syndicate
contract called for two board seats.

An alternative further privatisation via public sale on the Vienna
stock exchange has been discounted by OIAG due to the depressed market.

Difficulties on the IPIC-OIAG shareholder level notwithstanding, OMV
has hopes of winning an opportunity to participate in a $1bn
polyethylene plant to be built in Abu Dhabi. The emirate expects
Western investors to take up 35% of the project.

OMV is experienced in polyethylene production through its plastics
subsidiary and rates its chances in Abu Dhabi "at over 50%", according
to OMV general director Richard Schenz.

HELSINKI TRIGGERS PROTESTS WITH REMOVAL OF PRICE SUBSIDY

Finland's largest industrial users of Russian-sourced natural gas are
lobbying Neste to maintain prices at 1995 rates this year. The action
follows the Finnish government move, on 1 January, to discontinue the
provision of subsidies aimed at increasing the competitiveness of gas
imported from Russia, and which was worth around FM20m/yr ($4m/yr).

The removal of the state gas subsidy, triggered by the ongoing
harmonisation of Finnish economic provisions with EU measures, caused
an automatic rise in the price of natural gas.

With industrial companies opposed to paying the extra charges, Neste is
being asked to absorb the cost differential left over following the
expiry of the subsidy. The state company has refused to take on the
added cost.

The industrial protest group is headed by forest companies Enso,
Ahlstrom, Kymmene and the power distribution company Etela Suomen
Voima. Gas supplies are handled by Gasum, the joint venture company 75%-
owned by Neste and 25% by Russia's Gazprom. Finland imported Russian
gas worth FM1.3bn in 1994.

The dispute is currently in arbitration and could yet end up in the
country's marketing court. Obstructing the way to a solution is a 10-
year price and supply contract, signed in 1990 and not due to expire
until the end of the decade.

Industrial companies claim that this contract constrains Gasum to
adhere to a set price strategy over the 10-year period to 1999. Gasum
argues that the 1990 contract did not take into account Finland's
membership of the EU in 1994, which was regarded as a remote
possibility when the contract was signed.

TRANSGAS CANDIDATES MULTIPLY

British Petroleum Portuguesa and Petrogal, Portugal's state-controlled
oil company, have added their names to the list of international energy
companies interested in buying a stake in Transgas, Portugal's natural
gas utility, when it is privatised in a process expected to begin in
1996.

Petrogal's interest in the acquisition of a holding has reportedly been
welcomed by Jose Penedos, the secretary of state for energy in the new
Socialist government.

Penedos has said that the previous government's plans to sell a
dominant stake in Transgas to a strategic partner are being

COMPLAINTS OVER 'HIGH' PRICES

German industry pays more for its gas purchases than industry in any
other EU country other than Portugal, according to the VEA association
representing the interests of industrial energy consumers.

According to Eurostat figures for January 1995, the average price of
gas in the EU is 22% lower than average prices in Germany if Portugal,
which currently uses only town gas at very high prices, is left out of
the picture. Industrial customers in the UK pay the lowest prices,
followed by Spain, France and Luxembourg.

This regrettable state of affairs lays a heavy burden on German
industry, says the VEA. Countless jobs have been shifted abroad on
grounds of cost, and if something is not done about reducing the price
of energy to industry, "further considerable damage will be done to the
domestic industrial sector".

The VEA puts the blame on lack of competition in Germany. The
demarcation and concession contracts which give the gas companies their
own monopoly supply areas must be abolished, it demands. At the same
time, the VEA stressed its support for the so-far unsuccessful
proposals for a liberalisation of the energy markets made initially by
the federal economic affairs ministry some two years ago.

EVN SUCCESS IN HUNGARY

Among Austrian bidders for a share in Hungary's gas privatisation (EER
449/12), only regional utility EVN managed a successful offer.

Jointly with Germany's Bayernwerk, EVN now holds 50% plus one share in
Koegaz, a regional gas utility serving about 190,000 customers in a
southwestern region encircling Lake Balaton and extending to the
Slovenian and Croatian borders. The consortium joint investment amounts
to $67m, up $20m from its first bid.

EVN will have few immediate gains from the deal; the service territory
does not border on Austria, as would have been the case had EVN gained
a hold in other Hungarian gas utilities for which it had bid.

Nevertheless, EVN's success is unlikely to induce much pleasure with
Austria's state-controlled gas monopoly, OMV, which failed in its
Hungarian bids.

EVN's deal further strengthens its ties with the German utility, with
which it shares major stakes in Austria's private gas and oil producer
RAG. OMV and the 51% state-owned electricity authority Verbund have
felt themselves threatened by Bayernwerk, which has made offers on
several Austrian privatisations.

DRAFT DOMESTIC LICENCE DETAILS

The deregulation of the UK's domestic gas market was set to draw a few
concrete steps nearer as EER went to press with the government expected
to publish the requirements it will impose on interested companies
within days.

With the first, limited stage of the liberalisation to take place in
the West Country from April, the department of trade and industry was
to publish draft proposals for gas supply and shipper licences.

Parties interested in competing with British Gas (BG) in the 18m
residential consumer market will require a supply licence, while those
that want to transport gas through BG's pipeline grid will also need a
shipper's licence.

The eagerly anticipated licences were expected to offer an insight into
the type of liberalised market the government has in its sights.

GERMAN IMPORTERS PREDICT 10% SLUMP IN 1996 SALES

The German coal importers federation says it expects coal sales to
suffer a decline of 10% in 1996.

Purchases of fresh coal are expected to be postponed as major consumers
use up the "comfortable" coal stocks which were accumulated during the
'Jahrhundert' contract, which expired at the end of 1995. Sales of both
German and imported coal are expected to be affected to the same
degree.

It is all the more ironic that import coal prices will probably remain
at their current low level during 1996, assuming no significant shifts
in currency rates take place - "proof of the continuing value for money
of imported coal", stresses the importers' association.

In the first 10 months of 1995, imported steam coal prices averaged
DM76/t ($53/t) hard coal equivalent (hce), while German steam coal cost
virtually four times as much at DM291/t hce before subsidies took
effect.

CDF STRIKE SETTLED QUICKLY

A strike by miners at the Charbonnages de France (CdF) subsidiary
Houilleres du Bassin de Lorraine ended quickly after miners obtained
concessions, notably an increase in wages. The minimum salary for 1995
was increased from FFr81,000 gross for the whole year to FFr85,000
($17,125), with a bonus of FFr550 per man offered before the end of the
year.

Earlier, some 4,000 miners had clashed with CRS riot police in front of
the company's offices at Freyming-Merlebach (in the Moselle
department). The miners, armed with pick-axe handles, bolts, and hoses,
confronted some 200 CRS officers, and 500 mobile gendarmes. Some 50
persons were injured, of whom two seriously.

Workers at three of the four mines belonging to the company - Reumaux,
Simon and Wouters - went back immediately after the offer. But the
Houve mine at Merlebach held out a little longer, the local branch of
the CGT union not wishing to give the impression of giving in to the
management too quickly.

RWE VOWS TO FIGHT ON TO BRING MUELHEIM-KAERLICH BACK ON LINE

RWE Energie, the operator of the 1,300 MW Muelheim-Kaerlich nuclear
power station off-line since 1988, is adamant that it will continue the
legal battle to bring the reactor back on stream (EER 448/17).

The dispute has already turned into the longest and most costly battle
through the courts in the history of German jurisprudence, according to
Klaudia Martini, head of the environment department in Rhineland-
Palatinate where the reactor is located.

The energy concern announced that it has decided to appeal to the
federal administrative court. This is in defiance of a recent verdict
from the superior district court in Koblenz finding that the first
partial construction licence for the unit, overhauled in  1990, was
invalid and that there was no appeal against this ruling.

But RWE Energie claims that the oral verdict contained a faulty legal
evaluation and that therefore an appeal was justified. Furthermore, a
damage claim filed by RWE - which might amount to half the reactor
construction costs of DM7.8bn ($5.4bn) - is still pending with the
federal supreme court.

Martini has, meanwhile, suggested to RWE that it re-equip Muelheim-
Kaerlich for electricity generation from another primary energy source.
At the same time, she turned down a motion for the opening of formal
reactor closure proceedings, tabled by the Greens in the state
parliament.

Martini argued that such a step would open a can of worms, with RWE
bound to fight every inch of the way for the subsequent partial
construction licences which were all in force. Martini assumed that
this state of affairs would not change, even if RWE were granted an
appeal and tried, for the third time, to get a "new" first licence. It
was now up to RWE "to set a sign of reconciliation in the region by
renouncing a continuation of the legal fight for a first partial
construction licence."

REACTOR SABOTAGED BY SALT

About the time of the first moves by French trade unions to defend
their concept of public service in early December, employees at the
Blayais nuclear power station at Braud-et-St-Louis, in the Gironde
department, were suspected of putting sodium chloride (table salt) into
the secondary cooling circuit of the plant's number three unit.

According to the director of the power station, Martine Griffon-Fouco,
the act could only have been committed by someone with clearance for
access to the site. The management asked the local police to
investigate.

The salt did not present any great danger to the plant, but could, in
due course, have damaged the cooling circuit. Furthermore, there were a
number of other incidents in preceding days, such as unexpected turbine
stoppages. These various incidents were described as "malicious acts",
some way short of sabotage.

NORDIC MARKET BEGINS TRADING

The world's first market in international power trade began operations
on 2 January with Norwegian and Swedish players trading electricity for
NKr28m ($4.4m), officials said.

"Volume was relatively good," said a spokesman for Statnett Marked,
Norway's domestic electricity bourse company. "A gradual escalation is
expected." The joint power pool is based on the same floor as the
Norwegian domestic electricity market, which started regular trading
last spring.

The spokesman said 180 GWh were traded, including 160 GWh by telephone
and 20 GWh by telefax. This compared to 85 GWh on 29 December, before
Swedish traders entered the market, but dealers attributed the rise to
the prevailing cold spell.

Norway and Sweden removed border tariffs on electricity from 1 January,
allowing producers and consumers to trade power freely between the
neighbouring states. The jointly owned wholesale power pool is seen as
a starting point for a much wider market encompassing Finland and
Denmark.

In 1994, Statnett traded 25% of total Norwegian electricity
consumption, amounting to NKr5bn in turnover. This year trade is
expected to total one-third of consumption.

The exchange offers a day ahead, or physical, market, and a weekly or
futures market.

Meanwhile, against the backdrop of the liberalisation of Sweden's
electricity market, Finnish state energy company Imatran Voima (IVO)
signed an electricity supply agreement with Sweden's TelgeKraft worth
FM348m ($80m).

The contract covers the supply of 300 GWh over the three-year period
1996-1998, with first deliveries scheduled to begin as soon as 24
January.

"The agreement with IVO is significant, and was based on an open
competition where the best price pitched won," said TelgeKraft's CEO
Kjell Hasslert.

Under the agreement, IVO is contracted to supply electricity produced
using renewable energy resources "whenever feasible". This portion of
the contract will require IVO to source power supplied to TelgeKraft
from hydro and biofuel-fired power plants.

Founded in 1993, TelgeKraft is controlled by some of Sweden's largest
industrial groups, including Ericsson, Telge Energi, Scania and Astra.
The company concentrates on the purchase and distribution of energy to
its shareholders, and is forecast to purchase 1.5 TWh of electricity
from Nordic suppliers in 1996.

DISTRIBUTION CONTRACTS DISPUTED

Belgian power utility Electrabel has defended its ongoing negotiations
for 18-year distribution contracts with local authorities, saying they
are needed to ensure long-term investments and are to the benefit of
consumers.

Freddy Willockx, a Belgian Socialist member of the European parliament,
has claimed Electrabel's efforts to tie part-local authority-owned
companies to 18-year distribution contracts threaten EU liberalisation.

Electrabel restarted talks with local authorities in November over the
18-year contracts, which would be made in exchange for the authorities
taking 5% stakes in Electrabel production units, Willockx said.

An Electrabel spokesman said: "The European Commission is interested in
the interests of consumers, and a free and open market is not the
bible. The most important aspect is the interest of the consumer."

"We pledge ourselves to have investments with municipalities in inter-
municipal distribution companies," the spokesman continued, "but we
will not make long-term investments if we are in short-term contracts."
Willockx was "blind to the economics of the investment", the spokesman
added.

The Electrabel spokesman confirmed the contracts are linked to the
municipal authorities buying Electrabel shares, which will take place
during the first half of the year. The 2,577,256 Electrabel shares,
representing about 5% of the company's capital, are currently retained
by holding company Tractebel, although they were acquired by Electrabel
in 1992 as part of an acquisition, he said.

The shares were subsequently transferred to Tractebel, which holds a
substantial stake in Electrabel, to meet demands from the Belgian
banking and finance commission regulator, he said.

Under the transfer agreement, Electrabel will receive any capital gain
or loss made when the shares are sold to the municipalities, which will
be made at a market price, he said. The shares were acquired at a
valuation of BFr5,600 ($188.74), he said.

GEC, CEGELEC BUY AEG ASSETS

French concerns GEC Alsthom and Cegelec, both linked to Alcatel
Alsthom, have signed a preliminary agreement to buy what remains of
Daimler-Benz's electrical business, AEG. The price was not disclosed.

GEC Alsthom is to take over the transmission and distribution (T&D)
businesses of AEG, which should boost its turnover in this field by
some FFr7bn ($1.4bn), bringing it to FFr18.5bn/yr. It will also give
the company coverage of 35 countries against 24 previously, and make it
the largest company in T&D, ahead of ABB and Siemens.

For Cegelec, taking over AEG's industrial process control business will
boost its turnover in Germany to the equivalent of FFr6.5bn from the
current FFr1.4bn (which compares with worldwide turnover of FFr16.4 bn
for the whole of 1994).

In addition, the takeover will give Cegelec a higher profile in Central
Europe, the Americas (north and south), and in South Africa, as well as
some fresh clients in the petroleum industry.

AEG will retain 49% in the holding company that is to be established to
run these businesses, while GEC Alsthom will get 51%. One consequence
of the restructuring that will follow the takeover is likely to be job
losses. In the meantime, however, Daimler-Benz was still negotiating
the possibility of contributing financially to some of the changes.

EVS/BADENWERK HYDRO TAKEOVER

A consortium of seven Baden-Wuerttemberg power suppliers, headed by EVS
and Badenwerk, is to take over Neckar, the utility operating 24 hydro
stations on the river Neckar between Mannheim and Plochingen.

Up to now Neckar has been owned by the federal government (63.5%) and
by the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg (35%), which are parting with their
shares "for financial reasons".

The consortium will pay DM138.3m ($96m) for 99% of the shares. Neckar
generated 582.7 GWhe in 1994. According to EVS, this is twice as much
as it produces itself from hydro power, and equals 3.7% of its total
electricity generation.

EVS' own power sales reached the record level of just under 21 TWh in
1995. This was an increase of 5% against a year earlier. It was due
chiefly, according to chairman Wilfried Steuer, to a steep rise in
electricity deliveries abroad - up 33%.

EVS also pitched in and helped temporarily with the tight supply
situation of French power giant Electricity de France (EdF), hit by the
recent strike. At the time, EVS supplied roughly 5 GWh per day.

But it could only generate part of the overall volume itself. For the
rest it depended on purchases from east German supra-regional power
supplier Veag.

However, even without the booming foreign business, EVS sales would
have gone up. Power consumption in its own supply area also rose last
year - by 2.3% against 1994. Due to the flagging economy, Steuer
expects deliveries to EVS' own supply area to increase by 1-2% only in
1996.

HUNGARIAN POWER STAMPEDE

Following VEW and Ruhrgas' successful entry into the Hungarian gas
market - via participations in a regional (DDGAZ) and a municipal
(Foegaz) gas supplier (EER 449/20) - other German energy concerns have
hastened to make sure they will play a role in Hungary's electricity
privatisation.

RWE and its junior partner, southern German regional concern EVS,
bought 46.15% of Elmu, a distributor serving the greater Budapest area
with sales of 7.8 TWh/yr, and 48.8% of Emasz, serving the northeast
with sales of 4.7 TWh/yr.

The grouping also acquired a 38% stake in brown coal producer Matra,
consisting of an 800 MW power station and two opencast mines. The group
was granted the option to increase its stakes in all companies to 50%
and one share by end-1997. It is planning to invest around DM1bn
($693m), chiefly in Matra, over the next few years.

Bayernwerk won a majority stake in southwestern supplier Dedasz (sales
of 3.6 TWh/yr), while upper-Bavarian regional utility Isar-Amperwerke -
which Bayernwerk is striving to take over - acquired 49.23% of eastern
Hungarian supplier Titasz (sales 3.1 TWh/yr), together with the option
to raise its stake to 50.1% by end-1997.

RAINS BREAK HYDRO DECLINE

Spain's plunging hydroelectric production spiral finally bottomed out
in November last year after significant rainfall broke the drought.

According to figures published in December by Spain's network company,
Red Electrica de Espana (REE), the sector registered a fresh record
minimum for daily generating output before mid-month rainfall led to
the first notable production lift since March last year.

Rains in the second week boosted the daily producible power figure to
154 GW for 16 November, the first time this figure had overcome the 150
GW mark since the first week in March 1995. This improvement came just
over two weeks after REE reported the new record output low at 13 GW on
1 November. This was 2.27 GW lower than the previous minimum set on 22
October 1995.

Six months of announcing successive record-breaking lows for the
contents of Spain's hydro generating reservoirs also ended in November
when REE said the water level nationwide had edged above the line
marking the previous November minimum, reaching 26.9% of their total
capacity.

This is the first time for six months that the water level in
reservoirs has not set a fresh monthly minimum record, having plummeted
since the end of January 1995.

The gap between the median figure and the real amount of collected
water has been widening steadily since February 1994. Indeed, over the
last three years, the real figure has been higher than the median for
only six months; this was in one single spell from September 1993 to
February 1994.

The disparity in reserves is echoed in REE's production figures for the
month of November as a whole: the 1. 255 TWh hydro-generated in
November 1995 was vastly lower than in the corresponding months of 1994
and 1993 - 42.7% and 62.9% less respectively.

While total production for the month, including all power producing
sources except autoproducers, was 3.7% up, coal and nuclear-generated
power made up the difference increasing output by 19.8% to 6. 97 TWh
and 7.5% to 4.65 TWh respectively.

The 12.571 TWh total November demand took the figure for the first
eleven months to 138.339 TWh, 3.9% higher than the same period in 1994.

Even heavy rainfall in December is unlikely to lift the total hydro
generation figure for 1995 any higher than the third worst hydro
performance in the last 25 years. The output total to the end of
November in Spain reached 19. 583 TWh, already more than Unesa's two
lowest readings, 19.511 TWh in 1992 and 18.671 TWh in 1989.

Meanwhile, Portugal's five years of drought also appear to be over,
according to meteorological officials, heralding a period of increased
hydroelectric production.

Rainfall in the southern Alentejo region, the area worst hit by
drought, was greater in November and December than in the previous four
years and several regions of Portugal continue to risk flooding.
Agriculture accounts for more than 75% of all water consumption in
Portugal, compared with 14% for industry and 7% for domestic
consumption.

* Strike action in France led to strong power exports from Spain to
France in November 1995, peaking at hourly readings of 1.3 GWh in the
last days of the month, said REE. While Spain's power relationship with
Electricite de France (EdF) is hugely weighted in favour of imports,
43.65 GWh went to France in November, 72% more than in October.
November power imports from France totalled 439.25 GWh. REE signed a
"support agreement" with EdF on 1 November which caps Spanish power
exports at 200 GWh, equivalent, said REE, to 400 hours at a maximum of
500 MW. The agreement covers the period November 1995 to March 1996.

MADRID IMPOSES TARIFF SQUEEZE

Madrid has taken measures to rein in Spain's power sector profits for
1996, freezing tariffs for the first time since 1973 and introducing
tougher controls on sector income.

Acting on advice from the national electricity systems commission
(CSEN), the industry and energy ministry said the moves passed on the
benefits of economic recovery and technological advances to the
consumer.

Between Christmas and New Year, the treasury's superior pricing board
accepted the ministry's recommendation for an average "zero increase"
in electricity charges, justified by estimates of a 3.5-4% demand lift
throughout the year.

This level of confidence foresees a return to the degree of sustained
growth last witnessed during the mid-1980s. The "zero increase" is to
be applied to across the board to all tariff scales; domestic,
industrial and the large-scale industry rate. Last year, tariff scale
alterations produced an average 1.48% increase, well below inflation at
4.3%.

The decision to freeze tariffs followed approval by Madrid's commission
for economic affairs of a revised legal framework reducing recognised
costs borne by the sector by Pta29bn ($236m), 1.42% of the total 1995
tariff.

These alterations would appear to signal an end to the long-running
debate between the CSEN, the major utilities and the industrial
grouping which represents their interests, Unesa (EER 448/19).

Of the seven alterations to the recognised costs borne by the sector,
only two went in favour of the utilities. Worth a total Pta10.28bn,
these are increased allowance for costs brought about by the ongoing
drought, and by the enforced changes to billing methods.

The new arrangements for adjusting the effects of the drought,
calculated in terms of replacing 'lost' hydro-generated power by
increased fossil fuel firing, recognised Pta9.58bn in costs.

The remaining Pta702m will pay for a new billing structure intended to
show consumers how much of their electricity bill will go toward paying
off Pta730bn over 25 years to cover assets lost in the now-permanent
nuclear moratorium, as well as funds that subsidise the coal industry.
These percentages, 3.54% of the bill for nuclear debt pay-off and 5%
for the coal industry, will remain the same in 1996.

The five considerations on the minus side for the utilities subtract
Pta39.39bn from recognised costs: this includes some Pta4.159bn less in
the allowance to pay off generating assets; a reduction of 2-3
percentage points below the retail price index from operating and
generating costs reflecting improved efficiency, totalling Pta10.24bn
next year; some Pta23bn deducted from 'structural' costs; and a further
Pta2bn off as the first step in removing the subsidy for the utilities'
"employee electricity rate" from the tariff.

This is the first time Spanish consumers will not subsidise the
employee rate, a next-to-nothing Pta0.15/kWh, which has remained
unchanged since it was introduced in 1944 when the domestic rate was
Pta0.45/kWh.

Some 66,000 power sector directors and employees, including retired
staff, benefited from this rate last year. The CSEN recommended
employees lose this perk on a gradual scale up to 2001.

ENDESA'S LATIN AMERICA SPREE

Endesa, Spain's 65%-state owned utility, announced Pta35bn ($285m) of
investment in Latin America at the end of December: Pta15bn in Peru and
Pta20bn in Argentina.

Through its 72.5% interest in the Peruvian company Generalima, the
company won 60% control of Eetvensa, proprietor of the 200 MW
Ventanilla power station, close to the city of Lima. Endesa beat off a
competitive bid from American Energy Systems. The remaining 40% of
Etevensa remains in state hands.

Endesa will be responsible, through Generalima, for adding another 100
MW of generating capacity, installing two gas-fired turbines. The
utility also secured a 30% interest in the Lima and Chancay
distribution company, Distrilima, which has 650,000 customers.

In Argentina, Endesa paid some Pta20bn for 19.46% of the Buenos Aires
distribution company, Edenor, lifting its share to 36.46%. Edenor
distributes half of the power sold in the Buenos Aires region.

Also in December, Iberdrola, Spain's biggest private power utility,
bought 100% of two Bolivian distribution companies, La Paz and Oruro,
from Compania Boliviana de Energia Electrica and Bolivian Power Systems
respectively. The investment cost Iberdrola Pta6bn all told, and gives
the Spanish company control of 45% of Bolivia's power distribution
market.

This is the first Iberdrola move outside Spain as a majority
shareholder. It also has a 20% interest in the 250 MW Guemes power
station project and 26% of the Gas Litoral distribution company (both
Argentina).

NO NEW CAPACITY BEFORE 2000

Madrid has said no new power stations will be commissioned up to the
year 2000. The industry and energy ministry has calculated that none of
the potential demand scenarios make additional generating installations
necessary.

Instead, the ministry introduced changes to the current national energy
plan (PEN) for 1991-2000. Chief among these are move to angle
generating policy toward substituting fuel oil as a generating input
with natural gas and biofuels, lengthen the life of existing power
stations, boost renewable energy funding and promote energy saving
initiatives.

The first step toward the achievement of these objectives was the
promise of a January invitation to tender for contracts to convert
1,400 MW of current fuel oil-fired generating capacity to natural gas-
firing. This represents 18.1% of Spain's existing fuel oil-fired
installed power base.

PORVOO REFINERY POWER PLAN

Neste's board of directors has approved plans by the Neste oil refinery
at Porvoo to invest FM72m ($17m) in 1996 to build two to three 70-110
MW gas-fired power plants, Neste Porvoo's general manager Jouko
Huumonen said.

The plan, which was first proposed in June 1994, would involve the
phased development of on-site power generation capacity to supply oil
and petrochemical refining units at Porvoo.

According to Huumonen, Neste hoped to develop the small station concept
and have plants with a total generating capacity of 500-800 MW on site
by the year 2002. Excess production would be channelled into the
national grid.

POWERGEN'S REFINERY CHP DEAL

PowerGen's CHP division has been awarded a contract to supply the
electricity and steam requirements of Conoco's Humber refinery. The
contract will involve the construction of a new gas-fired CHP unit
rated at 24 MWe and over 90 MWth.

The #23m ($35m) plant will feature four independent gas turbines with
back-up systems to ensure continuous running even when the primary gas
supply is unavailable.

To coincide with the plant construction, a connection between the
refinery and the existing Theddlethorpe-Killingholme gas line will be
installed by Kinetica, the PowerGen/Conoco joint venture.

PowerGen CHP managing director Bob Kennett claimed, "We have broken new
ground in meeting the requirements of Conoco for efficient but flexible
plant. Both parties can be confident that the energy supply will
support the refinery's demands in future."

OFFER AMENDS REC LICENCES

UK electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild has published proposals to
modify the licences of regional electricity companies (RECs) SWEB and
Eastern Group following their recent takeovers.

The modifications deal with financial ring-fencing of the electricity
businesses, restrictions on activities, availability of resources,
disposal of assets, and provision of information to Offer. They have
already been agreed by Southern Electric International, now the
majority shareholder in SWEB, and Hanson, the majority shareholder in
Eastern Group, and will be applied to other merged companies in due
course.

Littlechild explained that the "licence modifications will allow me to
continue to regulate effectively and to ensure that customers continue
to be fully  protected."

STEEL AUTOPRODUCER BUYOUT

Electricite de France (EdF) and Edison have completed the purchase of
75% of the independent Italian electricity producer Ilva Servizi
Energie (ISE) for a total of L370bn ($232m).

The deal was initially agreed at the beginning of 1995, but was subject
to conditions which were not met until towards the end of last year.
The purchase was made through a joint company called Finel, in which
Italian firm Edison has 60% and EdF 40%.

ISE is building a 500 MW thermal power station at Taranto (in Puglia),
which will be fired with gases from the blast furnaces of the local
steelworks. It will use combined cycle technology to generate both
electricity, which will be sold to state power utility Enel, and steam,
which will be used by the steelworks.

The project is due to come into operation in the second half of 1996.
ISE already has overall capacity of some 600 MW, including a thermal
power station at Taranto, two at Piombino (in Tuscany), and a hydro
power plant at Terni (in Umbria).

EdF commented that it viewed this as an important step in developing
collaborations with other power generators in countries which wanted to
encourage independent electricity producers.

HEALTHY YEAR FOR VERBUND

A 3% increase in total electricity consumption as well as high water
flows through hydro generating plants have assured a good year in 1995
for Austria's Verbund. At the same time, the federal electricity board
has noted the impact of two major cogeneration plants which have come
on stream, trimming industrial electricity usage.

No specific figures have as yet been released, but the Verbund notes an
export surplus in its electricity trading for 1995. Higher exports to
Germany, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary have been registered, although
these in part have been achieved at below-cost prices in order to work
down growing coal stockpiles (EER 449/13).

On the financial side, the Verbund experienced costs of some Sch400-
500m last year when its long-term borrowings in Swiss francs had to be
revalued to reflect exchange rate differences. About a fifth of Verbund
bonds are denominated in francs.

TARIFF RULING TO STAY IN PLACE

The Swiss federal government will maintain its SFr0.16/kWh ($0.14/kWh)
tariff recommendations for autoproducers, which were due to end on 31
December, for a further three years. The move follows an official
evaluation report, which also urges that autoproducers be better
informed about the federal recommendations and legal situation.

After the two and a half years that the federal tariff recommendations
have been in force, the situation is that the recommendations are
applied "almost entirely" by electricity companies in less than a third
of Swiss cantons (eight).

They are followed only in part in nine cantons, while five other
cantons refused to provide any information for the evaluation, and the
recommendations are entirely ignored in the principal hydro cantons of
Graubuenden, Ticino and Valais, where the difference between the
production cost of about SFr0.04/kWh and the SFr0.16/kWh recommended
for autoproducers is simply considered too great.

The authors of the evaluation report note that while the promotion of
decentralised energy production is an objective for the country as a
whole, this does not justify forcing the three hydro cantons to accept
conditions which would immediately result in local tariff increases.

Martin Renggli, who heads the Federal Energy Office (FEO)'s energy
policy service, told EER that the SKr0.16/kWh average tariff paid to
autoproducers who use renewable energy sources is the equivalent of the
long-term marginal cost. "Switzerland is virtually the only country to
apply such a tariff, which parliament has limited to non-fossil fuel
producers," said Renggli. "The main beneficiaries are small hydro plant
operators, industrial autoproducers being relatively unimportant in our
country".

Since the recommendations took effect, 80% of small hydro plants (less
than 300 kW) surveyed have seen the prices paid for their energy rise
and profitability improve.

* Switzerland's ombudsman has secured an agreement with five major
regional electric companies for a freeze of tariffs for the next three
years. The five companies are BKW, NOK, Atel, CKW and EOS. Announcing
the agreement, the ombudsman's office in Berne said it was made
possible by the regional utilities' "good, and in some cases very good,
1994 results".

SWITZERLAND ORDERS REDUCTION IN CAR FUEL CONSUMPTION

A new federal ordinance aimed at reducing the specific fuel consumption
of automobiles came into force in Switzerland on 1 January, despite
objections by Swiss car importers. The new ruling is designed to reduce
the average specific consumption, in litres per 100km, of all newly
licensed automobiles by a total of 15% within five years (1996-2001).

The ordinance is designed to make it easier to achieve the objectives
of the federal Energy 2000 programme, and in particular to reduce CO2
emissions attributable to automobiles.

"This reduction rate (of 3% per annum) is technically possible,
economically sustainable, and essential from the standpoint of both
energy and environmental policy," according to a statement by the
Federal Energy Office (FEO).

The FEO points out that automobiles which consume less than 5 litres
per 100km are already available on the market and manufacturers are
already engaged in a process of further improving energy efficiency.
German manufacturers have already announced plans to market 3
litre/100km cars by the year 2000, the FEO notes.

The ordinance makes it mandatory, in particular for car importers whose
role is especially important in Switzerland, to do everything possible
over the next five years to achieve the new "average consumption
threshold values", and thus to contribute to more economic and rational
energy utilisation.

The FEO says this will require a major marketing effort by Swiss
importers, assisted by the federal government. The question of a
special label to distinguish the most energy-efficient cars in the
showroom is currently under consideration.

"This will considerably help the federal Energy 2000 programme,"
according to the FEO. The E2000 objectives include stabilising the
consumption of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions at their 1990 levels by
the year 2000, and thereafter reducing them.

GAS-DRIVEN BUS TRIAL IN BRISTOL

Greener public transport moved one step closer for Bristol when the
UK's first purpose-built gas-powered bus was unveiled by transport
minister, Steven Norris.

The bus, which has been specifically designed to use natural gas,
rather than being converted from diesel power is the result of a five
company partnership - FirstBus Transit Developments, British Gas,
Cummings, Plaxton Coach & Bus and Dennis Specialist Vehicles - and will
be operated by FirstBus.

The spark ignited engine runs off the gas stored in six tanks held in a
specially designed pod on the roof of the bus. The bus will serve the
Temple Meads, city centre, Redland and Clifton areas of Bristol.

Speaking at the launch, Norris said: "Government is aware of public
concern about air quality and the introduction of this new gas bus is
an excellent initiative to help reduce vehicle emissions in an urban
area."

LITTLE CHANGE IN GERMAN INPUTS SEEN BUT CO2 PLANS QUERIED

Primary energy consumption in Germany is expected to remain more or
less constant over the next 25 years, thanks to massive increases in
energy productivity through energy saving and technical progress,
according to a report by Swiss consultants Prognos for the German
federal economic affairs ministry.

The primary energy matrix will only shift marginally during this
period, the report states - the shares of coal, lignite and nuclear
power will shrink, to the benefit mainly of gas, which will increase it
share from 16.8% today to nearly 24% in 2020.

According to the consultancy, oil should maintain its market position,
while renewable energy sources will manage to increase their share from
currently 2.3% to 3.6% by 2020 - low prices for fossil fuels will
prevent a more significant expansion.

CO2 emissions will fall by only around 10.5% by the year 2005 compared
with 1990 levels, with a further drop of just 3% expected by the year
2020.

The drop predicted by Prognos is less than half of the 25% reduction
which the German government has pledged to achieve by the year 2005.
Thus the study casts considerable doubts on the ability of Bonn to make
any real progress on climate protection measures.

Federal environment minister Angel Merkel criticised the Prognos CO2
findings, claiming the effects of new energy and environment policy
measures had been ignored by the Prognos experts.

But the consultants have retaliated sharply, pointing out that all the
significant instruments - such as the new insulation regulations,
amendments to heating boiler regulations, small combustion plant
regulations, support programmes for renewables and voluntary measures
by industry - were indeed taken into account.

Electricity generation in Germany is forecast to continue rising to the
year 2020 by a total of 18% compared with 1992. Gas will play an
increasingly significant role: a net increase in electricity generating
capacity of 13,500 MW will be necessary over the next 25 years, of
which 61% will be gas-fired.

At the moment, installed gas-fired capacity totals 18,750 MW; by 2020
this will have reached 27,000 MW, says Prognos. Some 3,700 MW of new
gas-firing capacity will be constructed in western Germany and 5,100 MW
in eastern Germany, mainly by the new municipal utilities which have
been founded since German unification .

Gross electricity consumption will also rise, by 23% between 1992 and
2020, with consumption in eastern Germany alone expected to rise much
more steeply - by 52%. This reflects the recovery and expansion of
industry now starting to take off after the economic difficulties
experienced following unification.

In western Germany most of the existing power station capacity will
have to be replaced by the year 2020, states Prognos, but the
consultancy finds it impossible to say at this point what the fuel
structure will be.

For example, between 2005 and 2009, nearly 6,500 MW of the total 22,500
MW nuclear capacity will have to be replaced, assuming a plant lifetime
of 30 years, followed by a further 4,800 MW between 2010-2014 and 9,900
MW between 2015-2020.

It is currently an open question whether the plant will be replaced
with nuclear power stations and if so, which options will be chosen,
says the report - for example, extending the lifetime of old plant, or
use of a new reactor type such as the EPR being developed by Siemens
and Framatome.

SPECIAL REPORT - SPANISH GAS

With the arrival of natural gas from North Africa now imminent, EER
assesses Spain's state of readiness.

The $2.6bn Maghreb-Europe pipeline is 160km away from completion,
sources at Spain's Gas Natural told EER at the end of December.

The news provided an end-1995 boost for the company, already buoyant
after the return to service of the Valle de Escombreras regasification
plant (Cartagena, Murcia) and the announcement of plans to increase its
output by a factor of 12.

Even with three regasification plants in operation this year, the
1,376km pipeline, to be operated by the EMPL venture, will be the
leading gateway for natural gas imports to Spain from the second
quarter, providing logistical support for a 24-year, take-or-pay deal
with Algerian state hydrocarbons company, Sonatrach, to import 1,439bn
thermies up to the year 2020.

Two of the four sections which make up the Algeria-Spain link are
complete: the Algerian stretch and the seabed link under the Strait of
Gibraltar. The 48-inch diameter, 520km Algerian section, laid by
Sonatrach, runs from the Hassi R' Mel gas field to the Moroccan border
via the towns of Mecheria and El Aricha.

Two parallel, 22-inch, 46km lines, which will take natural gas under
the Strait of Gibraltar, link Cape Spartel, on the Moroccan coast west
of Tangiers, and Zahara de los Atunes, on the Spanish coastline west of
Tarifa.

Pipeline company ownership

EMPL is 27%-owned by the Spanish company Sagane, in turn 91% controlled
by Madrid and 9% held by Spain's sole natural gas sourcing company,
Enagas. Portugal's Transgas owns the remaining 22% of EMPL.

Between the Algerian and Strait of Gibraltar sections, EMPL has laid
410km of the total 540km projected for the Moroccan stretch of the
pipeline. The 48-inch line will link the Moroccan border city of Ain-
Beni-Mathar to Cape Spartel, the two points in the entire pipeline
where compression stations will be sited.

The section running from Zahara de los Atunes to Cordoba, managed by
the Al Andalus company (70/30 Enagas and Transgas), has so far 240km of
the total 274km, 48-inch pipeline in place. This final section
completes what Madrid's industry and energy terms the "first phase" of
the Maghreb-Europe pipeline. Initial capacity will allow an annual
throughput of 10bncm/yr.

In practice, however, Madrid has put the initial annual volume coming
into Spain at 6bncm/yr, of which 2.5bncm/yr will go to Portugal where,
according to Gas Natural, the 371km pipeline linking Setubal and Braga
is now complete. The relationship between the two Iberian neighbours is
a key element in planned extensions to the regional natural gas
transport network in the northwestern quarter of the peninsular.

Interconnection with Portugal

The Spain-Portugal 'interconnection', as Madrid terms the plan, is
designed to allow both countries to benefit from their respective
geographies. Portugal will receive natural gas from Algeria via the gas
hub in Cordoba. By extending the northern Portuguese network,
meanwhile, Spain will be able to pipe natural gas to Galicia and
Asturias, currently without piped natural gas west of Aviles.

The new Portuguese pipeline will start in Braga going northwards across
the border to Tuy and on to Pontevedra, La Coruna, and Villalba (all
Galicia), terminating in Oviedo.

The "circuit" in western Spain will be completed by adding a pipeline
branching northwards to Asturias through Extremadura and Castilla y
Leon from the $180m trunk line link from Cordoba to Campo Maior close
to Badajoz on the Spain-Portugal border. The Cordoba-Campo Maior
pipeline is the responsibility of the Gasoducto de Extremadura company
(51% Enagas and 49% Transgas) and is made up of 192km of 32-inch
pipeline and 64km of 28-inch pipeline.

The EU's REGEN II Ecu500m finance initiative, aimed at supporting cross-
border gas and electricity links between member states, has agreed to
support the Cordoba-Campo Maior and Braga-Villalba pipeline projects to
the tune of Pta12.72bn ($103m), equal to 40% of the Pta31.8bn total
estimated spend. The Villalba-Oviedo extension is not supported by
REGEN II since it is not a border-related link, but it will receive EU
funding under the European Regional Development Fund.

In the last quarter of 1995, Madrid reaffirmed four key natural gas
infrastructural initiatives, which as part of the current (1991-2000)
national energy plan (PEN) will ensure the arrival of natural gas in
the following regions: Castilla La Mancha, Valencia, Andalucia, Murcia,
Castilla y Leon and Extremadura.

The most significant is a pipeline proposal termed the 'second phase'
of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline. It envisages 36- and 30-inch diameter
pipelines, still under study according to Gas Natural, running 320km
northeastwards from Cordoba, forking at Motilla (Castilla La Mancha
region). One branch is to run 260km northwards to Caspe, Zaragoza
province, and the other, 150km eastwards to Sagunto, on the
Mediterranean coast 30km north of Valencia.

Possible link to France?

The Caspe link is designed to open up possibilities of a connection
through Aragon or Catalonia to France. This second phase of the Maghreb-
Europe pipeline could lead to the pipe doubling its initial throughput
capacity to 20bncm/yr using the two Moroccan compression facilities.
This second phase would involve another major pipeline construction
initiative from Cordoba to northeast Spain capable of transporting
"large quantities (of natural gas) towards northern Europe", the
ministry of industry and energy said.

The other fork at Motilla would take Algerian gas to the 'Mediterranean
Arc' pipeline (Barcelona-Cartagena) at Sagunto. Both Motilla lines
would offer natural gas to areas of Castilla La Mancha, Aragon and
Valencia, currently not connected to the natural gas network.

Until the Maghreb-Europe pipeline comes into service, Spain will
continue to depend on its regasification plants to support national
demand. LNG produced some 77% of the 81.10bn thermies Enagas bought in
1994 and 84% of the 42.77bn acquired in the first half of 1995. The
reopening of the Valle de Escombreras plant at the Mediterranean port
of Cartagena, one of the modifications to the original PEN, brings the
total of regasification facilities in Spain to three, alongside those
at Palos de la Frontera (Huelva) and Barcelona.

Regasification investment

Enagas said it would invest Pta13.2bn in boosting the current
Escombreras output capacity of 50,000cm/h (equivalent to 3.5bn
thermies/yr) to 600,000cm/h in five years. The spend is part of the
regional gas plan for Murcia announced last spring, with  global
investment of Pta38bn. The company is aiming at a target of 50,000
domestic and 100 industrial customers in Murcia by the year 2000.

Enagas has divided the expansion plan into two phases. The first,
scheduled to run up to the middle of 1997 will increase emission
capacity to 150,000cm/hr, at a pressure of 72 bars using the plant's
existing storage capacity. The second phase, with two sub-stages, aims
to build two additional storage facilities holding 105,000cm each and
docking structures capable of receiving 125,000cm LNG tankers by 1998.
Enagas said the plant would reach its the final output goal of
600,000cm/h in 2000.

The opening of both the Cartagena plant and extensions to the
northwestern pipeline network have led the industry and energy ministry
to suspend the original PEN project for a new regasification plant at
the port of El Ferrol (Galicia).

Basques' separate course

Meanwhile, the autonomous Basque government is still reported to be in
negotiations with the US and Japanese gas companies, Enron and
Mitsubishi, on its proposed regasification plant for the port of
Bilbao. The plan, aimed at exclusive supply for the Basque region has
been costed at Pta28bn in the region's budget for 1996. None of this
will come from Madrid, which has emphasised the plan's exclusion from
PEN.

Only one other gas aim from the 1991 PEN proposals has yet to be
carried out: a 100km pipe-line connecting Aranda del Duero and
Valladolid.

Approved additions to PEN are: a 570km pipeline linking Almendralejo
(Extremadura) and Oviedo (Asturias) with a compression station;
extending the Aranda-Valladolid line to a junction with the
Almendralejo-Oviedo link at Zamora; and increasing the diameter of the
planned 220km pipeline linking Valencia, Orihela and Cartagena from 20
to 30 inches. Enagas has said it is studying a further 175km extension
to this pipeline to Almeria, which would cost an estimated Pta10.32bn.

Also in Andalucia, Gas Natural said last November that infrastructural
investment in the region would top Pta120bn by the year 2000. This sum
includes laying the Andalucian section of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline,
the Cordoba-Jaen-Granada pipeline and pipelines to take Algerian gas to
Cadiz, Malaga, Jerez de la Frontera and Campo de Gibraltar.

It also includes work carried out at the docking facilities at the
Palos de la Frontera regasification plant. Gas Natural expects
Andalucia to consume 12.8bn thermies/yr after 2005.

Power utility Sevillana has meanwhile awarded a Pta2bn contract to the
industrial group Babcock Wilcox to convert the 540 MW second generating
group of the company's Bahia de Algeciras power station to gas.

SWEDISH ENERGY COMMISSION REPORT ON NUCLEAR PHASE-OUT

One of Sweden's 12 nuclear reactors can be closed before the next
general elections in 1998, but all 12 cannot be phased out before 2010.
This is the somewhat unsurprising conclusion of the national energy
commission that has been studying the matter.

That Sweden can manage on 11 reactors is proven by the fact that
Sweden's oldest reactor, the 400 MW Oskarshamn 1, has been standing
idle for over three years. But on the very same day that the commission
published its report, the Swedish nuclear inspectorate gave Sydkraft
the go-ahead to restart the reactor.

The energy commission has not fulfilled its stated task of solving
Sweden's nuclear power problems once and for all, but it has produced
600 pages of background material for political bargaining on how to
fulfil the parliamentary decision from 1980 to phase out nuclear power.

Political commentator Anders Isaksson called the energy commission's
document "another meaningless report in an over-studied question, a
politically bespoke tailoring that has been run from the government,
whose conclusions are based on - for the moment - politically correct
assumptions."

The last part of Isaksson's comment refers to the fact that, just a few
weeks ago, the commission majority believed that two reactors could be
closed by 1998. The change has been explained by the assumption that
the government wanted space to negotiate.

Political make-up

The political majority of the commission is constituted by the
Christian Democratic Party, the Liberals and the ruling Social
Democratic party. The conservative party is openly pro-nuclear these
days, while the environmentalists and the leftists are too anti-nuclear
for the agreement.

The government also wants the Centre Party to join the agreement, but
there will be a price to pay. The Centre is an anti-nuclear, pro-
biomass farmer's party with a long-standing environmental reputation to
defend. It does, however, accept slightly increased use of natural gas
to make up for the loss of energy production when nuclear power plants
are closed, but the party does not want to abolish 2010 as the final
year for nuclear, and wants to phase out two - not one - reactors
before 1998.

The real negotiations are expected to start in March, when the Social
Democrats will elect a new leader to follow outgoing premier Ingvar
Carlsson.

The only candidate - finance minister Goeran Persson - has declared
that he has the same views on energy as the current premier, which
means respecting the 1980 referendum decision to phase out all nuclear
power by 2010 without harnessing more hydro resources, while keeping
CO2 emissions at the 1990 level and maintaining internationally
competitive electricity prices.

Persson says it will be hard to meet these goals. But all his promises
are currently being viewed with doubt, since he was still steadfastly
denying that he would stand as party leader only hours before he
officially accepted the offer from the election committee.

Half nuclear, half hydro

Sweden currently uses 140 TWh/yr of electricity, of which half is
nuclear, half hydro. The energy commission contends that Sweden will
need 159 TWh electricity by 2010, and that 15 TWh of the requirement
can be reduced by energy efficiency, while another 10 TWh can be
covered by conversion to other forms of energy.

Hydro power is projected to account for 64 TWh, roughly the same as
today. Current wind power, cogeneration in industry and district
heating will yield 13 TWh. New wind power and cogeneration plants could
provide 11 TWh, which leaves 46 TWh of the electricity requirement
still to be covered.

Energy minister Joergen Andersson says that natural gas could provide
12-30 TWh of electricity and new hydro sources 27 TWh if all streams
and rivers were harnessed, which he himself does not believe to be a
realistic possibility.

The commission does not see natural gas as a large-scale alternative,
and believes that if the gas network is to be expanded from Gothenburg,
where it ends today, to Stockholm and on to Finland, it will be because
other nations have interest in the gas - either to sell Russian or
Norwegian gas or to consume it. In fact, Gazprom has offered to build a
grid through Sweden, which is seen as a means of securing an
alternative route for Russian gas to the European market. Sweden only
uses about 9 TWh/yr of natural gas.

It will cost some SKr70-90bn ($10.6-13.6bn) to replace nuclear power
with natural gas-fired plants, and possibly twice as much if biomass is
chosen as a fuel, according to the energy commission, which believes
that electricity prices can increase to an acceptable level if the
phase-out is allowed to be a slow process.

The free market for electricity introduced from the start of 1996 will
keep prices down, according to the commission. The high voltage price
in Sweden currently is SKr0.20/kWh, while electricity from new natural
gas-fired plants would cost Skr0.25-0.30/kWh and from biomass over
SKr0.40/kWh.

Three phase-out guidelines

The commission has set out three main possible guidelines for the phase-
out:

* 1) a law that would prohibit nuclear power. This could mean paying
compensation to the power utilities and tough negotiations. The
utilities claim they have a right to total compensation and insist that
it should be in the form of new production facilities.

* 2) taxation of nuclear power plants. The tax should increase with the
age of the reactor. This would make nuclear power less competitive
since the owners also need to invest in maintenance of the plants.

* 3) subsidies to energy sources that are favourable for climatic and
environmental reasons.

A cold snap over the Christmas holiday season served to help
concentrate minds on the matter of electricity supply. Some 24,000 MW
was needed each day between Christmas and New Year, 4,000 MW more than
usual at this time of the year. Sweden's total capacity is over 33,000
MW, but grid problems reduce the available capacity to 29,000 MW.

The nuclear inspectorate has meanwhile given permission to restart
Sweden's oldest nuclear reactor Oskarshamn 1, after over three years of
standstill.

Problems at Oskarshamn

The inspectorate ordered the closure of Oskarshamn 1 and four other
reactors in September 1992 after a near-accident with the emergency
cooling water system in the Barsebaeck 2 reactor. While repairs were
being made other deficiencies were found and Oskarshamn 1 was given a
total renovation. Only the reactor tank has not been altered. The
reactor was started in 1972.

Oskarshamn 1 has been given a provisional permit until summer, when the
inspectorate will decide on prolonging the permit, at most until the
summer of 1999.

The renovation of the reactor is something of a model for the demands
on other reactors when they grow older, according to the inspectorate.
New methods for analysis have shown the weakness in some of the older
constructions, e.g. safety systems against fires and flooding should be
improved. The utilities' ambitions for improvements have not been high
enough in earlier plans, says the inspectorate.

* Meanwhile, a trade union dispute is taking place at the four reactors
in Oskarshamn. Electricians have refused to be undergo drug tests for
alcohol and narcotics: other unions have agreed to random checks, but
the electricians do not believe them necessary for safety reasons.
There was no problem in starting tests at the Ringhals nuclear plant.
The tests were introduced after a woman was killed: her brother was
suspected of committing the crime and had worked at the nuclear plant,
although he had previous convictions for narcotics crime and illegal
possession of weapons.

FORMER EDF HEAD AVOIDS OIL JOB

Former Electricite de France (EdF) president Gilles Menage has
successfully resisted the presidency of the Institut francais du
petrole, which was being offered to him as a consolation prize for his
sacking. Menage did not have any obvious qualification to head the
research body, and did not want the post. Indeed, the institute, which
brings together the French oil companies Elf and Total, as well as Gaz
de France and the motor manufacturers Peugeot/Citroen and Renault, will
be better off with Pierre Jacquard, who has spent over 25 years in
house. Jacquard, who has been general manager since 1988, was elected
unanimously to be both president and general manager. His election
marks an effort by the institute to become more independent of the
government.

BAVARIAN/CZECH OIL LINK ON LINE

A 340km oil pipeline from Ingolstadt in southern Germany to the Czech
Republic has just come on stream. The joint Bavarian/Czech venture will
become fully operational in April this year. The DM725m ($503m)
project, dubbed 'Mero', is to help towards making the Czech Republic
independent of Russian crude. It will transport up to 15mt/yr of crude
from Western to Eastern Europe. Mero is the first oil pipeline linking
Germany with a central European country. At the same time, the
construction of a 600,000cm oil storage facility near Prague was
concluded.

OMV EYES ADRIATIC RETAIL EXPANSION

Now that a degree of peace has reached the area, Austria's state-
controlled OMV energy concern has moved quickly in the Adriatic states
to gain market share before the expected arrival of major multinational
oil companies. Via its 50%-owned distributor Slomin Holding Druzba (EER
427/10), OMV last year combined its retail activities in northern
Italy, Slovenia and Croatia. From a starting base of 79 filling
stations, the Slomin Holding outlets have expanded to 94, with the
newest station opened in Maribor, Slovenia, last month. Slomin Holding
last year retailed 560,000t of mineral oil products, with 1995 sales
topping Sch2bn ($197m), a gain of 13.2% over 1994 on a 4.5% increase in
product volume in tonnes. Investments totalling Sch422m are planned for
1996.

WINTER WEATHER EXPOSES BG TO CRITICS

British Gas (BG) admitted it had been "caught out" by the severity of
the UK's Christmas weather and had been unable to fulfil its commitment
to all its customers with service contracts. Thousands of people with
'Three Star' contracts were reportedly left without heating during the
holiday period - some for several days - after engineers failed to turn
up to repair central heating faults. Under the "peace of mind" service
scheme, customers are promised that a gas engineer will be despatched
within 24 hours of the problem being reported. Spokesman Andrew Davis
said: "In some areas we were caught out . . . We will look at what
happened to make sure that we learn from this next year." He said that
conditions were so extreme in Glasgow, for example, that the diesel
fuel in service vans froze.

GERMAN MINI-CHP INTEREST BOOMS

Although supplying only a niche market, small unit-type CHP stations
are becoming ever more popular, according to the results of a survey by
the German utilities' association, VDEW. By the end of 1994, 1,577 of
the mini-CHP plants, owned by industry and municipalities, were in
operation, some 37% more than in 1992. A further 75 were under
construction and 33 planned. Almost 90% of the plant had an electricity
generating capacity of under 1 MW. By end-1994, total capacity had
risen to 872 MWe compared with 577 MWe two years previously.

CALIFORNIA BACKPEDAL
Air Resources Board Favoring Five-Year Delay in ZEV Mandates
In Accord with the Voluntary System Proposed by Automakers

Watch for a delay in zero-emission vehicle sales mandates in
California with two percent in 1998 effectively replaced by
10 percent -- in 2003.
     CARB has ordered its staff to develop a scheme to
replace the original 1998 deadline for meeting a 2-percent
ZEV sales mandate.
     CARB will instead float a plan to have automakers meet
a 10-percent ZEV sales mandate by 2003.
     This approach, to be formally proposed by March,
effectively gives automakers a five-year breather before
meeting ZEV sales goals.
     But the plan will also encourage ZEV introductions as
early as this year, by giving automakers credits, toward the
2003 mandate, for ZEVs brought to market before 1998.
Credits will also be given to ZEVs that use advanced battery
designs.
     Automakers, for their part, pledge to have capacity in
place to make 5,000 EVs in 1996 and 1997, and 14,000 per
year from 1998 until 2003's 10-percent mandate kicks in
(figures spread over the "Big Seven" -- Chrysler, Ford and
General Motors; and Honda, Mazda, Nissan and Toyota).

FEDERAL MILLIONS
ARPA Largesse Expected for Electric Pickup;
$5mm Project by Composite Firm, Partners

Developers of a composite-bodied electric pickup
truck will match expected government funding of
$2.5 million, making for a $5-million overall
effort, says Kerry Hitt, president of Advanced
Composite Products, of Harrisburg, Pa., lead
designer of the vehicle.
     ACP is a composite race car developer. The
new truck is known as the UEV, for utility
electric vehicle.
     Hitt and his partners, including Pennsylvania
Power & Light and other utilities coordinated by
the Pennsylvania Electric Transportation Council
(PETC) now await the formal award of money from
the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Westinghouse Drive

     The prototype UEV includes an electric drive
train from Maryland's Westinghouse.
     ACP plans to build three or four UEVs for
crash testing, hoping to take a crash-certified
final design to an OEM -- "preferably a
Pennsylvania OEM," says Hitt -- for volume
production.
     The UEV chassis is formed by a rectangular
tube structural member which also serves as the
battery storage area. "The reinforcements used in
the chassis area include carbon fiber, chosen for
its structural properties, and glass fiber,
selected for structural and dielectric
properties," ACP says.
     Other composite EV developers, says Hitt,
have "merely substituted materials," using
composites instead of metals. "We have designed
our vehicle around composite materials, around
what they are and what they do," he told F&F.

Shown in Atlanta

     ACP's competitive edge is highly accurate and
consistent fiber orientation, Hitt says. The
company will employ a proprietary fabrication
process, including resin transfer molding, to
build the UEV. The RTM-based process, which
involves dry fiber preforms that approximate the
shape of finished parts, "will cut labor intensity
by up to 80 percent." The UEV design employs epoxy
resins to consolidate the high-strength fibers and
includes both foam and honeycomb core materials.
     The prototype UEV was shown at December's
electric vehicle infrastructure meeting in
Atlanta.

ON LINE AND FOR SALE
Westinghouse Launches Manufacturing
Of EV Drives, Controllers and Chargers

Westinghouse says it's begun series production of
electric vehicle drive trains and related
components, including chargers.
     The company makes 100- and 230-horsepower EV
drives. It numbers Georgia's Blue Bird and China's
Yuanwang Bus Group among its customers for the
larger system, and Ford and Chrysler, for Ranger
pickups and the new Epic minivan (F&F, October 30;
also Chrysler-Epic story on following page of this
issue) for the 100-horsepower system.
     The Chrysler and Ford vehicles will also
employ a 6.0-kilowatt Westinghouse onboard
charger.
     Westinghouse also offers a 135-kilowatt rapid
charge system that uses knowhow from Georgia's
Electronic Power Technology, Inc. (EPTI).
     "Existing prototype systems can recharge
large transit-style electric buses to 80 percent
of capacity in under one hour," Westinghouse says.
     EV component business is organizationally
part of the Westinghouse defense and electronics
businesses that were put up for sale following the
corporation's acquisition of the CBS television
network.

POWER CONTROL
More Federal Support for SatCon:
EV Power Controllers and Flywheels

SatCon Technology Corporation has new federal
support for its ongoing efforts to perfect power
control and flywheel energy storage technology.
New funding is coming from the Advanced Research
Projects Agency and via the ARPA-supported
Electricore, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle
Consortium.
     Massachusetts-based SatCon has a Phase I ARPA
contract valued at $100,000 to develop next-
generation modular power controllers for electric
drives and some $200,000 from Electricore for
power management and flywheel-based storage
system.
Leveraging Other Projects
     The Electricore contract carries a total
cost-shared value of $427,000, as SatCon can apply
matching funds of as much as $227,000 from other
development projects.
     Thermal management is the key to SatCon's
power controllers. SatCon has "developed ways to
densely compact these modules and take the heat
out," spokesman Bill O'Donnell told F&F, partly
through the use of advanced materials but also via
proprietary engineering approaches.

IT'S EPIC, BUT WHEN?
Everything But the Release Date
As Chrysler Promotes Fleet Van

"It's aimed at the fleet market," says Chrysler,
and what's more represents "the next logical step
in the development of electric vehicles." The
automaker said at last month's EV infrastructure
meeting in Atlanta that it is ready to build the
Electric Powered Interurban Commuter -- the Epic
-- minivan in Canada, with California a prime
market target.
     But the timetable is a secret.

'Supplier Issues'

     "There are several final supplier issues that
need to be worked through, so we're not ready to
give an exact launch date," Chrysler electric
minivan program executive engineer Bob Feldmaier
said in a statement in Atlanta. But "we've made it
clear," Feldmeier said, "that this vehicle would
be available by the 1998 model year, and that has
not changed."
     Demand is a key factor in establishing a
specific launch date, Chrysler says. "Cost and
range are the two critical market issues that will
shape fleet customer demand," the automaker added.
It is predicting a modest per-charge range of
about 60 miles for the vehicle under "ideal
conditions." The company also says that its
onboard charger will require as much as eight
hours for a complete "fill-up."

Horizon Batteries, Westinghouse Drive

     Chrysler has confirmed that it will use the
lightweight Horizon lead acid battery from
Electrosource in the Epic van, and elsewhere at
the Atlanta gathering endorsed an onboard
conductive charging system that would allow an
electric vehicle to be plugged in for charging
almost anywhere. The new EV is also to employ a
Westinghouse drive train, with a 100 peak-
horsepower AC induction motor, and have a 6.0-
kilowatt Westinghouse charger.
     Chrysler says it's ready to build the Epic
van at its Windsor, Ont. assembly plant "as part
of regular production. No conversion is
necessary." The EPIC model designation will be
applied to both Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager
EV models.
     "Because the minivan is by far our most
successful vehicle, and because it has the unique
ability to work as either a commuter vehicle or a
utility vehicle, this platform made the most sense
to us for electric power," Feldmaier said in
Atlanta.
     "The large flat floor also gives us plenty of
room to store batteries, and more importantly, to
change battery types as new technologies are
developed.
     "Right now we're able to get 27 modules at
about 1,600 pounds onboard of the advanced
[Electrosource Horizon] lead-acid battery. We
anticipate a range of about 60 miles under ideal
conditions with that amount and type of battery."
     The cost and price of the vehicle have also
not been finalized, although Chrysler warns that
"the low-volume componentry and the cost of
batteries" will make the vehicle "significantly
more costly than a comparable gasoline minivan."
Pricing will not be announced until the release
date of the vehicle has been established.
     Chrysler says it will target fleet and
utility customers that have previously purchased
its electric and compressed natural gas vehicles.
     The front-wheel drive Epic van will have a
gross weight of 5,900 pounds with 27 kilowatt-
hours of power, enough for 60 miles without
accessories (the vehicle will include power brakes
and power steering, an AM-FM radio and heat pump
air conditioning and auxiliary electric heating
system, and a rear defrost).
     The Epic minivan will also have a battery
management system and an onboard charging system.

CHARGER SPLIT
Ford, Chrysler Differ with GM
On Conductive Versus Inductive

Detroit's Big Three have another reason to say
that electric vehicles aren't yet ready for market
-- Chrysler and Ford have endorsed direct metal
contact conductive charging couplers while General
Motors prefers the Hughes-developed inductive
paddle connector now marketed by Delco.
     Ford and Chrysler unveiled a prototype metal-
to-metal connector in Atlanta, and said they were
giving meeting participants "a look into the
future."

GM Inductive Deal with Toyota

     GM, meanwhile, has notched an agreement
whereby Toyota gets a license, including
manufacturing rights, to the Delco paddle coupler.
     Ford and Chrysler say they've taken a step
toward needed standardization in the EV industry.
"With EV infrastructure, the goal is to avoid the
VHS versus Beta problems we saw with early video
tape technology," Ford EV program director John
Wallace said in a joint statement.
     "We believe conductive charging is safe and
the most efficient and cost-effective method of
charging," said Chrysler executive engineer Bob
Davis.
     The prototype unveiled in Atlanta was
produced by SCI Systems, described as "the world's
largest contract manufacturer of electronic
assemblies and products." The design, which is to
available to other charger and coupler
manufacturers, is said to have been made to the
specifications of Chrysler and Ford, "five other
major auto manufacturers," the California Air
Resources Board and the Infrastructure Working
Council sponsored by the Electric Power Research
Institute.
     GM-Delco, for its part, claims the support
not only of Chrysler and Ford but of Honda, Mazda,
Nissan and Toyota behind the issuance of a
Recommended Practice for Electric Vehicle
Inductive Charging via the Society of Automotive
Engineers a year ago (F&F, February 6, 1995).

'No Plug-and-Socket'

     "Inductive charging is known for its safety
features and simple operation," says a Delco
release. "The inductive charger has no
conventional metal plug-and-socket connection.
Instead, the user inserts a lightweight,
waterproof plastic paddle into a vehicle's charge
port. This simple action transfers power through a
magnetic field."
     Ford and Chrysler say that their coupler is
safe in all weathers, too.

VOLUME BATTERIES IN FRANCE
It's an Industry Now, Say the French,
As Saft Sets Up Bordeaux Battery Plant

Saft has inaugurated "the world's first plant to
produce electric vehicle batteries in volume" at
Bordeaux in southwest France.
     The big customers for the company's nickel
cadmium batteries are the French automakers PSA
and Renault for the Citroen AX, the Peugeot 106,
and Renault's Clio and Express EVs.
     The $20-million plant will be able to produce
batteries for 5,000 vehicles per year. "Extensions
are planned to meet market growth," says a release
from Saft America (Valdosta, Ga.).
     The French car companies and Saft have had an
agreement on ni-cads since 1992. Saft claims a
service life of 60,000 miles for the advanced
batteries.
     "Ongoing research is focused on nickel-based
batteries for current generation electric vehicles
and lithium-based batteries for vehicles in the
next century," Saft says. "Incremental increases
in battery capability are planned to increase
vehicle range to two-and-a-half times what it is
today."

PSA Peugeot Citroen may be plotting a return to
the U.S. market, according to remarks by chairman
Jacques Calvet reported in The Wall Street
Journal. "He said Peugeot would consider such a
move only if there was a niche his company could
fill," the Journal said on December 19. "[Calvet]
declined to say whether that niche could be an
electric car."

VOLUME BATTERIES IN TEXAS
$80 Million Seen as Potential Value
To Electrosource of Chrysler Order

An order by Chrysler for its Epic electric minivan
will allow Electrosource to ramp up to full OEM
supplier status, the Austin, Texas-based supplier
of Horizon brand lightweight lead-acid batteries
said in Atlanta.
     The Production Purchase Order could lead to
business exceeding a cumulative $80 million over
the next three years, Electrosource says. The
Chrysler PPO also provides cost and delivery terms
for Horizon battery packs for the Epic van. The
first of an expected series of build orders has
already been filled.
     The Horizon battery saves weight by using a
lead-plated glass fiber mesh in lieu of lead
plates. Electrosource claims "the highest peak
power of any battery technology currently
available," noting that independent testing has
pegged specific energy at 44.2 watt-hours per
kilogram, about 50 percent better than that of
traditional lead-acid batteries.

Quick-Charge Capable

     And, "with proper equipment, the Horizon
battery can be recharged as quickly as 30 minutes,
which effectively extends the vehicle's range,"
the company says. Chrysler is believed to favor
the Norvik quick-charge system, though slow-charge
will be standard for the first of the Epic vans.
     "Electrosource has met all of the technical
requirements to qualify the advanced Horizon
battery for use in our electric minivans," Bob
Feldmaier, a Chrysler executive engineer in charge
of the electric minivan program, said in the
Electrosource release.
     "Electrosource's technical staff has helped
our program improve performance by contributing
insights into battery management systems and
advanced charging profiles," Feldmaier said.

NEWT GINGRICH TO THE RESCUE?
Clinton Administration Ducks the LNG Excise Tax Issue
So the NGV and Gas Industry Takes its Case to Congress

It's falling to Congress to save vehicle users of LNG from
taxes that make the clean-burning fuel more expensive than
diesel. The Clinton administration has refused to go to bat
for the NGV industry following an adverse 1995 excise tax
ruling by the Internal Revenue Service (F&F, October 16).
     The American Gas Association and its affiliated Natural
Gas Vehicle Coalition are actively working the problem --
not via the President, as had been planned, but through
Congress.
     "Clinton doesn't want to take on the IRS," says one
industry observer in Washington. And, he says, the overall
government goal of deficit reduction looms as a major
obstacle to reversing the ruling. "The Treasury is not
interested in finding new ways to decrease revenues. The
Treasury wants to tax anything it can get its hands on."
     The NGV advocates' sole ace? Clean-burning LNG would
allow truckers to meet 2004 standards for emissions now, and
the transportation industry could arguably could save money
by doing so if the tax were readjusted.

INSIDE TRACK
EDO Gets a Leg Up with Japanese OEMs
As Fiber Supplier Toray, Sumitomo Buy In

Composite CNG tankmaker EDO Canada has snatched a
major marketing advantage with the huge Japanese
auto sector. The company has notched a deal
making Sumitomo the exclusive distributor of
EDO's LiteRider brand tanks to Japanese OEMs,
worldwide.
     In return, for an aggregate $5,000,000
Canadian (some $3.6 million U.S. at current rates
of exchange), two Sumitomo units and EDO's carbon
fiber-supplier Toray Industries have taken a
combined 16.4-percent stake in EDO's compressed
natural gas cylinder manufacturing operation in
Calgary.

EDO Still Holds the Majority

     The deal modifies the EDO Corporation-
Province of Alberta 60-40 joint-venture ownership
of EDO Canada to give Sumitomo 6.6 percent and
Toray 9.8 percent of the company. New York City-
based EDO Corporation retains the majority share.
     EDO Canada makes LiteRider brand CNG tanks
in Calgary, using polyethylene liners overwrapped
with carbon fiber. Its principal fiber supplier
has been Toray for high-strength T-700 material,
although EDO is working with at least one other
manufacturer, believed to be Hercules.
     [Toray is distinguished in the materials
world as the supplier of toughened epoxy
composite material, made with T-800 carbon fiber,
for the tail and floorbeams of Boeing
Commercial's new 777 widebody jet. The 'triple-7'
is the first American transport aircraft to be
built with composite primary structures.]

Japanese in U.S. the 'First Target'

     The initial EDO Canada deal with Sumitomo
makes Japan's Sumitomo Corporation's Osaka
Machinery Department and New York City's Sumitomo
Corporation of America the exclusive distributors
of LiteRider cylinders to Japanese automotive
manufacturers. Those with car or truck
manufacturing operations in the United States
"are the first target," says EDO Corporation
president Frank Fariello.
     Honda, for example, is promising a natural
gas-powered car for the 1998 model year. And
although the vehicle is to be built in Ohio,
component decisions are expected to be made in
Japan.
     [Prototype Honda NGVs use a two-tank
configuration using all-composite cylinders from
Lincoln Composites. Honda has indicated that it
will shift to one larger cylinder for the
production vehicle.]
     EDO may eventually grant LiteRider
manufacturing rights to its Japanese partners,
although according to Fariello, the establishment
of an NGV industry in Japan awaits regulatory
changes and the building of a fueling
infrastructure there.
     Japanese LiteRider manufacture "is not part
of this deal," the EDO chief told F&F. "That is
subject to additional negotiations."
     "At this time there are no plans for
Sumitomo to manufacture the CNG cylinders in
Japan," says a Sumitomo spokeswoman in New York.
"However, we are leaving our options open for the
future."

A Tank Technical Task Force Too

     The latest arrangement, publicized last
month, establishes a strategic alliance between
EDO, Sumitomo and Toray designed to "accelerate
and expand the alliance's presence in the U.S.
and international NGV market."
     The two Japanese firms get an EDO Canada
board seat. The Toray deal further

 --> sets up an EDO-Toray technical task force
aimed at improving composite CNG tanks with the
primary thrust of "increasing the overall cost-
effectiveness of NGV fuel storage;" and

 --> maintains Sumitomo as the sole distributor of
LiteRider cylinders to Japanese OEMs worldwide.
     "For years, the principal applications of
carbon fiber have been in the aerospace and
sporting goods industries," Toray Advanced
Composites GM Kichi Fujisawa said in an EDO
release.
     The LiteRider cylinder, Fujisawa said,
"presents us with an opportunity to expand these
applications."
     Fujisawa is now a director of EDO Canada.

LNG at LAX
RFP in Preparation for Permanent Station

The Los Angeles International Airport board has
authorized LAX to float a request for proposals
for a permanent liquefied and compressed natural
gas fueling station in support of LAX vehicles.
     The turnkey LNG/CNG fueling station on
airport property near the intersection of
Imperial Highway and Main Street will also be
available to airport and other fleet operators,
and to the public.
     LAX has 14 LNG-powered shuttle buses, with
eight more expected for delivery beginning in
January 1996. The Airports department also
operates 33 CNG-powered utility trucks, pickup
trucks and sedans.
     LNG fuel for the LAX buses is currently
supplied by a temporary station. CNG comes from a
Southern California Gas station on United
Airlines' leasehold.
     The new station "will help the department
meet California's State Implementation Plan as it
applies to civil airports, which is expected to
mirror the federal plan that calls for a major
shift to low-emission vehicles," said executive
director John Driscoll.

FIRST-EVER REBATE
Payment to New York, New Jersey Port
For Three New Vans and a Conversion

New Jersey's Public Service Electric & Gas has
determined its first natural gas vehicle rebate,
a payment of $1,000 per vehicle for four NGVs
placed in service by the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey.
     The Port has bought three new Chrysler NGV
minivans and converted an existing jeep to
natural gas fuel. "The Port Authority's move to
natural gas vehicles is a good business decision
that will eventually save us money by cutting
maintenance and fuel costs," says Port project
manager Sal D'Angelo. The Port will put more NGVs
in service this year.
     The Port uses New Jersey's first public-
access CNG station, a facility put in service
near the Holland Tunnel to New York City as a
joint venture of PSE&G and Shell (F&F, May 15,
1995).
     The PSE&G rebate will be available through
August 1997.

HEAVY HALF DOZEN?
Big Rigs May Make Big Year for LNG
Half a Dozen Truckmakers Offer NGVs

The current excise tax situation has made for
uncertainty (see page 1), but big-rig trucks
represent one alternative fuel vehicle market
that may not be dependent on forced fleet buys or
fuel subsidies, as operators eye economic
advantages to clean-burning liquefied natural gas
fuel.
     Nigh-on half a dozen U.S. manufacturers are
expected to offer dedicated natural gas-powered
medium- and heavy-duty trucks for model year
1996.
     They include Volvo GM, Freightliner, the
affiliates Kenworth and Peterbilt, and possibly
Navistar. The vehicles will be outfitted with
natural gas engines from Navistar, Cummins and
Detroit Diesel.

'Products that Have Been Missing'

     "These new vehicles will give customers the
natural gas products that have been missing from
our portfolio and will play a pivotal role in
boosting NGV industry efforts to more
aggressively target high-fuel-use, medium- and
heavy-duty markets," said Gas Research Institute
product manager Dan Kincaid.
     "The availability of OEM-produced trucks is
a significant development for GRI and the gas
industry, which has cofunded development of NGV
engines," Kincaid said in a GRI statement.
     But "Vehicle manufacturers believe the
success of these trucks will depend on definitive
legislation, customer demand, cost acceptance and
fueling infrastructure," the GRI man cautioned.

NAVISTAR
Navistar, for one, says it's too early to promise
NGVs or natural gas engines for 1996 due to an
absence of federal standards on fuel systems,
particularly for liquefied natural gas. The
Chicago-based company has worked with Detroit
Diesel on modification of Navistar's T444E engine
for natural gas, but says its Class 6-7 Model
4700 truck with a T444NG powerplant isn't quite
ready for market. "Right now it's only available
with the T444E clean diesel," says a Navistar
spokesman. "We take a very conservative
approach," says another company source.
     The T444 is available for natural gas
operation through DDC as the 30G engine.
     [Navistar is also working with other
alternative fuels, including dimethyl ether,
which has been tested in a T444E engine and
according to Navistar "can eliminate exhaust
smoke and greatly reduce other exhaust pollutants
while reducing engine noise. Navistar is working
DME with Amoco and with Haldor Topsoe of Denmark
and AVL List of Germany. Topsoe has a process for
making DME from natural gas, coal, or renewables,
Navistar says.]

KENWORTH
Kenworth Truck Company (Kirkland, Wash.) has the
Class 8 Model T800 and the Class 7 prototype T300
configured for LNG operation. "After the first of
the year is when we really expect to make an
introduction," says Kenworth's Evan Campbell.

VOLVO GM
Greensboro, N.C.-based Volvo GM Heavy Truck is
offering a refuse hauler, the "Xpeditor," with a
Cummins L10-300G natural gas engine available in
LNG and CNG versions. The NGV Xpeditor was
unveiled in mid-1995 making "Volvo GM Heavy Truck
the first Class 8 truck manufacturer to offer
natural gas engines as a factory option."
Volvo GM, Dave Schrader, 910-393-2847; fax 393-

FREIGHTLINER
Freightliner Corporation of Portland, Ore. also
unveiled a natural gas-powered vehicle in mid-
1995: the FL 60 business class truck with a
Cummins B5.9G (5.9-liter) engine.
     The company now offers an even wider range
of LNG-powered trucks, including the Class 5
FL50, the Class 7 FL70, and the Class 8 FL106,
FLD112, FLD112SD, FLD120, and FLD120SD models.
     Engine options include the Cummins B5.9G and
L10G and the 50G and 60G from Detroit Diesel.
     Freightliner Custom Chassis (Gaffney, S.C.)
offers the Class 3 Model MT-12FNG with a Hercules
3.7-liter or Cummins B5.9G engine.
     The MT-12FNG is designed for the postal
service, which according to GRI may buy as many
as 500 of the CNG-powered units this fiscal year.
Freightliner, Bill Thomas, 503-735-8896
Freightliner Custom Chassis, 803-488-8604

CUMMINS
Besides the well known L10G and B5.9G, Cummins
late last year promoted its first 8.9-liter
natural gas-fueled engine, the C8.3G, with
availability this first quarter of 1996. The 250-
horsepower C8.3G is available with torque ratings
of 660 and 750 pound-feet at 1,400 rpm. The six-
cylinder engine is aimed at bus and truck
markets.

CLEAN FUEL CORRIDOR
Diverse Groups Team in California
For Clean Vehicle Fueling Facilities

A California consortium is claiming to be the
first in the nation to offer private motorists a
Clean Fuels Corridor stretching across two big
southern counties: San Bernadino and Riverside.
     Fuels covered at 15 sites include CNG and
LNG, as well as electric vehicle charging.
     New natural gas fueling sites in Ontario,
Riverside, Temecula and Joshua Tree will
supplement some 77 CNG sites, about half of them
public, currently in service in Southern
California.
     Consortium members include Southern
California Gas, Southern California Edison,
United Parcel Service and local governments.
     The project has just under $750,000 in
vehicle registration funds and nearly $1.2
million from private parties including consortium
members, Applied LNG Technologies, Mesa Pacific,
Amendt Oil and Lapis Energy.

Worldwide Conversions is building a plant in
Kansas for the installation of electric drives in
the trucks (F&F, October 30). TDM is shooting for
Qualified Vehicle Modifier status, meaning that
Ford will warranty EV trucks from the Kansas

SunShine gets FERC nod to enter Florida market

     SunShine Interstate Transmission has received FERC's blessing
to build a 145-mile natural gas pipeline into Florida that will
interconnect with a proposed 570-mile intrastate pipeline to be
built by its affiliate.
     The commission also approved the pipeline's levelized rates. The
rates are based on the ultimate capacity of the project, even though
it will be at only half of its proposed capacity for three years. Since
the pipeline will be charging only the base rate, the lack of
capacity for the first few years will result in under-recovery of its
levelized cost of service. FERC will allow SunShine to spread the
recovery of the under-recovered costs over the life of the project.
     This rate design will provide new pipelines with the opportunity
to compete with already established pipelines, Commissioner
Donald Santa said. "It's a way to avoid the potentially time-
consuming debate on whether future expansion costs should be
rolled-in or incremental," he added.
     The pipeline will serve customers on the Florida peninsula, an
area that  has only one established interstate pipeline, Florida Gas
Transmission. The increased competition will benefit the Florida
consumers, Commissioner James Hoecker added.

NGSA says power study skims over gas benefits

     The Natural Gas Supply Assn. (NGSA) has challenged the
findings in a report by a coal industry-backed group that finds coal
as the fuel of choice for the next century's new baseload electricity
generation.
     The study "fails to factor in the full costs of technologies that
would make coal's exhaust stream as clean as gas exhaust and
assumes that the current bias in environmental regulations will
continue to permit higher pollution levels from coal than from gas,"
said Bruce Craig, NGSA's director of environmental affairs.
     Energy Ventures Analysis prepared the study, "Fuel Choice for
New Electric Generating Capacity in the Next Century: Coal or
Natural Gas," for the Center for Energy and Economic Development,
a coalition of coal companies and railroads. The report finds that
while natural gas-based technologies are the economical choice for
new peaking load power plant capacity, coal is the cost-effective
fuel of choice for baseload capacity units, says a recent study by
Energy Ventures Analysis.
     The report determines that natural gas technologies have lower
capital and nonfuel operating costs than coal technologies, but coal-
based technologies "offer a significant delivered fuel price
advantage over its natural gas-based competitors to virtually any
power plant location." For baseload units, fuel costs are the largest
element of operating costs, making coal the most cost-effective fuel
of choice, the study says.
     Craig countered, "There's no need to make 'either-or' judgements
about fueling future electricity generation. Gas, oil and coal will all
play an important role." He added that the energy industry should
focus on policies that create market incentives for higher
efficiency, environmental stewardship and new technologies to keep
this country competitive.
     The overall goal, Craig said, should be that consumers get the
best package of fuel, jobs and environmental benefits at the lowest
cost.
     The study says one reason coal is less expensive is because its
domestic supply is greater than the natural gas supply. At current
rates of consumption, the United States has about a 250-year
supply of recoverable coal reserves, which can be commercially
developed at current price levels, Energy Ventures Analysis
determines. For natural gas, reserves are more limited, possibly a
50-year supply, and are increasingly costly to develop, the study
says.
     However, NGSA said the study underestimates natural gas
reserves and fails to factor in the growing trend toward competition
in the electricity market.
     "The study inappropriately assumes that those working in the
electric generating field do not read market signals correctly and
do not use fuel supply, technology or market instruments that other
industries use," Craig noted.
     For an abstract or full text copy of the study, call the Center for
Energy and Economic Development office in Washington at 202-
628-5627.

May, June spot prices stay weak in light trading

     Many in the gas industry began stretching the three-day holiday
weekend into four days by taking off all or part of last Friday, so
trading was light for both May and June supplies.
     May prices in South Louisiana changed little for deals done
Friday morning, but prices in South Texas dropped into the mid- to
high-$1.50s into Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL), Koch
Gateway Pipeline, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Trunkline Gas.
     Very few deals were reported done Friday for June, but there
were no signs of a recovery in spot prices. One source reported a
sale into Texas Gas Transmission (TGT) in zone SL at $1.71. The gas
is baseloaded from Thursday through the rest of the month.
     All three nuclear plants operated by Arizona Public Service are
scheduled to be operating by tomorrow, but they will run at less
than full capacity for the rest of the year.
     Palo Verde Unit 3, which has been down for refueling, is
scheduled to start up tomorrow. All three of Palo Verde's 1,270 MW
plants will then be generating electricity.
     But the units won't run any higher than 86% of capacity because
of potential problems with the tubes that carry steam up through
the boilers. The steam turns turbines to generate electricity. Small
cracks have appeared in the tubes, said a source at the utility.
     During periods of peak electrical demand, the utility will burn
natural gas to generate electricity or buy power from other
companies, he said.

June market leaves many unanswered questions

     A lot of questions will begin to be answered today and tomorrow,
but weather will set the tone for prices throughout the month.
     How much gas was sold swing? How many buyers, particularly
the big guys, the LDCs, held off buying until after the first of the
month? How will the nuclear plants near Houston and Dallas
perform after being restarted?
     Not to mention shut-ins. Is gas being shut in because of price or
because of no market? Will producers voluntarily shut in enough
gas to have an impact on prices? And lastly, is it ever going to get
hot and muggy in Texas?
     Beginning with the last question, a couple of sources said TU
Electric in the Dallas area is expecting temperatures in North
Texas to move into the 90s this week and is asking suppliers to be
prepared to ship gas. Temperatures in Oklahoma, likewise, are
expected to move into the 90s today, if not yesterday.
     TU Electric also operates the Comanche Peak nuclear plant where
Unit Two is out of service to repair cracked welds. A two-week
delay in the restart date has been penciled in, indicating a restart
around mid-June.
     As reported, TU burns nuclear and lignite as baseload and uses
gas for peaking needs. But the lignite units are running at maximum
levels now, said one source, which is why TU is preparing to call on
gas if temperatures rise.
     Unit Two at the South Texas Nuclear Plant near Houston was
running at 12% of capacity last Friday morning and was expected to
put electricity onto the grid system on Sunday or yesterday. It
could be at 100% of capacity in the first or second week this month.
     Only one June deal was reported on Friday, a large package at
the Katy Interchange on an intrastate pipeline at $1.65, down a
penny on the low end from Thursday's range of $1.66-70.
     May intrastate prices fell below $1.60 in South Texas and below
$1.40 in West Texas. Producers had little fight left in them to
quibble over a few pennies for a period of a few days. They wanted
gas to flow and were afraid there'd be no market at all over the
light-demand holiday weekend.

Texaco to cut staff at Henry Plant

     Texaco will eliminate 32 of 70 jobs at its Henry Plant, near
Erath, La., and the Henry Hub, by the end of the year, the company
told Gas Daily.
     The reduction in the workforce is required because of changing
operations at the facility, a spokesperson said. Texaco will no
longer be processing liquids at the plant.
     The company said liquids extraction is unprofitable in the
current low-price environment for natural gas liquids. In addition,
gas delivered to the hub usually does not need processing.
     Operations at the hub itself are not affected, said Jagit Yadov,
president of Texaco's Sabine Pipeline, operator of the Henry Hub.

Midcoast to build New York pipeline

     Midcoast Energy Resources is staking out new turf, constructing
a natural gas pipeline in Bethlehem, N.Y., to serve the Owens-
Corning Del Mar plant.
     This 3 million cf system will be the first New York project for
Midcoast, a Corpus Christi, Texas-based company that has
primarily served industrial end-users in the Midwest and Gulf
Coast.
     The system is slated for completion by June 30, and will include
interconnect facilities with an existing pipeline owned by
Tennessee Gas Pipeline.
     "Midcoast continues to pursue significant opportunities to
provide gas transportation services to industrial customers at
substantial discounts from their present suppliers," Midcoast
President Dan Tutcher said.
     Fiscal year 1993 revenues for publicly held Midcoast were about
$16 million. Midcoast also serves the Owens Corning Fiberglass
Plant in Kansas City, Kansas.

     TransCanada PipeLines and Corporacion Gutsa, one of Mexico's
leading construction companies, have signed a letter of
understanding for joint efforts in a variety of projects in Mexico.
     "We intend to work together with Gutsa in the areas of power
generation facilities and the supply, distribution and
commercialization of natural gas in Mexico," said Gerald Maier,
TransCanada's chairman.
     The Mexican ambassador to Canada, Sandra Fuentes-Berain, said
the partnership is evidence of the success of the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
     TransCanada also has revised its 1995-96 facilities construction
application to the Canadian National Energy Board (NEB). The
pipeline is seeking approval to build 16.8 miles of line in Ontario
and Manitoba and a 28 MW compressor in Ontario.
     This is in addition to the 17.3 miles of line and 42.3 MW of
compression included in the earlier application. Total cost of all
the projects is estimated at C$189.3 million.
     If approved by the NEB, TransCanada plans to begin construction
in 1995 and put the facilities into service by Nov. 1 next year.
     The new facilities would add 88.8 million cfd of firm, long-haul
capacity to the pipeline.

Midcoast to build New York pipeline

     Midcoast Energy Resources is staking out new turf, constructing
a natural gas pipeline in Bethlehem, N.Y., to serve the Owens-
Corning Del Mar plant.
     This 3 million cf system will be the first New York project for
Midcoast, a Corpus Christi, Texas-based company that has
primarily served industrial end-users in the Midwest and Gulf
Coast.
     The system is slated for completion by June 30, and will include
interconnect facilities with an existing pipeline owned by
Tennessee Gas Pipeline.
     Fiscal year 1993 revenues for publicly held Midcoast were about
$16 million. Midcoast also serves an Owens Corning Fiberglass
Plant in Kansas City, Kansas. LM

Industry, FERC agree to keep recovery mechanism

     Industry and FERC apparently see eye-to-eye about keeping
intact the pricing differential mechanism that pipelines use to
recover gas supply realignment (GSR) costs.
     Industry participants assembled at a technical conference in
Washington last week to voice general approval of the recovery
mechanism. FERC commissioners seemed to agree that the two-year
recovery program should not be altered.
     Order 636 required pipelines to reform their contracts to
market levels or terminate them altogether. The rule provided for
recovery of the costs associated with realigning the bundled-sales
contracts. The commission determined last year, in various cases,
that it would permit pipelines to collect the difference between the
market price and the price established in their contracts as a
recovery mechanism for the GSR costs. The mechanism has been in
place for only 11 months of its proposed two-year period.
     Customer complaints that pipelines were taking advantage of the
pricing mechanism prompted the commission to take a look at the
GSR recovery option, despite Commissioner Donald Santa's concern
that the commission was considering a "mid-stream change." The
customers were concerned that pipelines were getting windfall
profits through the mechanism.
     But many of the complaints were squelched before the
conference took place, after pipelines helped their customers
realize that the pricing differential recoveries would cost them less
than federally ordered buyouts of the contracts.      Many of the
customers simply didn't realize the trade-offs that the pipelines
have made on their costs, a representative of the Natural Gas Supply
Assn (NGSA) said. Some pipelines have eaten many of their
transition costs, the representative added.
     Nicholas Bush, president of NGSA, said the pricing differential
costs are part of larger compromise agreements negotiated between
pipelines and their customers. "Altering these compromises would
upset the balance of interests achieved in those original settlement
agreements," he said. "A change in course before the expiration of
this limited period, as some have suggested doing, would send a
confusing signal."
     Many of the pipelines noted in comments on the issue that most
of their contracts would be terminated by the end of the two-year
period.

Coastal to sell Argentine operations

     Coastal is selling its 23.33% interest in five producing oil and
natural gas fields and related facilities in Tierra del Fuego
province of Argentina for $68 million plus contingent
considerations.
     The sale will be to other joint-interest owners in the venture,
Coastal said. The transaction is subject to certain approvals and
will be completed next month.
     "This sale gives Coastal an attractive return on its initial
investment," said David Arledge, Coastal's president and COO. "At
the same time, it provides additional funds for other opportunities
the company currently has under review."

Anadarko buys Hugoton reserves

         Anadarko Petroleum has signed
an agreement to purchase deep producing
oil and gas properties in the Hugoton
area of southwest Kansas.
         Anadarko would not say who it
was purchasing the properties from
because of an agreement with the
operator, but the $20 million deal is
expected to close by June 15. About 60%
of the reserves are crude oil.
         Anadarko expects average net
production of about 1.4 million cfd of
gas and about 500 barrels of oil per
day, to be marketed under short-term
contracts.

PG&E pursues first regional
electronic hub

         SAN FRANCISCO -- In what
could develop into the first regional
electronic marketing hub, Pacific Gas &
Electric (PG&E) is pursuing the
development of an electronic energy
marketplace (EEM) by as early as 1996
that would allow all segments of the
industry from Alberta to the Southwest
to come together and conduct business
on one electronic system.
         "It's in the conceptualization
stage," Kenneth Hamkik, PG&E's director
of strategic planning, told Gas Markets
Week. "That means what we're trying to
do is look at the long term in relation
to what's happening in 1993 with the
implementation of Order 636 and FERC
trying to push standardization," he
said.
         "It's a marketplace," said
Hamik, "and a marketplace implies that
you have multiple players that can come
together on a single log-in, in this
case, and have the ease of use to be
able to do business in a number of new
ways," he said.
         Along with Southern California
Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric, which
both agree with the concept of an EEM,
according to Hamik, PG&E may be
starting what could be called a local
distribution company (LDC) revolution
in the gas industry.
         Hamik said with all the
competition going on in the pipeline
segment of the industry with their
proprietary electronic bulletin boards
(EBBs), seeds are starting to be sown
with the LDCs to make sense of the
chaos. He said LDCs want to get in
front of EBB developments and form an
electronic marketplace where they get
full benefit of the business
opportunities out there.
         He said it will probably have
to start on the regional level and "the
LDCs should at least have a heavy-
handed influence to help shape this."
Hamik said pipelines won't be excluded
in the process, but LDCs will benefit
the most from regional EEMs.
         Hamik said the EEM will go
beyond the traditional posting systems
of EBBs, "Technology is not the
barrier," Hamik said, "There's a lot of
vendors that have already started to
present Windows-based products where
you don't have to know boo about
computers," he added.
         And one of those vendors
working on the West Coast EEM is
Interactive Images, headed by the
former manager of Enron's information
systems Robert Hadlow. Hadlow said with
the free market environment evolving
from Order 636, the West Coast natural
gas industry is going to need an EEM
that will serve as a common electronic
hub through which all segments of the
industry can conduct their daily
business. He said the system will need
to be quick, easy to use and users
should be able to work across multiple
companies.
         Hadlow said the EEM will
differ from EBBs in that it will
initiate and approve transactions
through the entire daisy chain of
transactions on behalf of all the
customers it serves. Through the EEM,
Hadlow said, from producer to end-user,
including futures and secondary market
players, all users will be able to
conduct business across multiple
companies as if those companies were
one.
         He said the EEM will not
replace each industry segment's
internal proprietary systems, but it
will replace their EBBs with a single,
common system for the West Coast
market.
         PG&E's Hamik said the first
phase of developing the West Coast EEM
was identifying the landscape. "What
are the baby steps or maybe even some
of the big leaps we need to start
taking now in order to bridge the
future with the present?"
          Hamik said when developing
the scenario for the implementation of
the EEM, PG&E looked at the banking and
airline industries as an example of how
fast the EEM could be developed.
         He said one company can't make
the EEM happen. It will have to be a
consortium. "The marketplace has to be
open or it's not going to work," said
Hamik. He said PG&E has talked to 20 to
25 different companies and the answer
it's received have been "yes" to the
EEM, but opinions differ on how it's
going to happen. Hamik said some
companies are "bearish" on the issue of
having the EEM up and running by the
end of the decade.
         "I don't get involved in
projects that don't happen within the
decade," was Hadlow's response. Hadlow
also said he is in the process of
estimating the cost of the project but
no firm figures are available yet.
         Hadlow proposed a possible
timeline for the implementation of the
West Coast EEM:
         % 1994: PG&E's system
operational for transactions;
         % 1995: Multi-company access
available;
         % 1996: Some cross-company
transaction capabilities;
         % 1997: West Coast EEM fully
operational;

Buyers position themselves for
cold weekend

         Prices were up everywhere on
Thursday -- Gulf Coast, Midcontinent
and West Texas -- as buyers wanted to
ensure they had a supplier for what was
expected to be a winter-like weekend.
         Sellers limited sales to one
day only in most cases, playing for
more time and more threats of chilling
temperatures to push prices up another
few pennies Friday through Monday.
         The exception was West Texas
where California buyers are having to
compete with gas going to Texas
intrastate markets and gas headed north
into the mouth of the cold front.
Buyers and sellers were negotiating
deals for Saturday through Tuesday, but
talks were in a very narrow range for
both swing and four-day deals.
         Sellers asked $2.02 and buyers
tried to keep the lid on at $2.00 even,
up from $1.91-95 Wednesday. A marketer
bought a four-day deal at $2.00, while
another marketer sold Saturday only
packages at $2.00-01 and was working on
wrapping up some four-day deals.
         Gulf Coast Louisiana prices
ranged from $2.32-34 for most sales
into Columbia, with a high of $2.35, up
from a high of $2.30 the day before.
There was only a penny spread between
equity sales and marketers' resales,
said one source.
         Texas Eastern at East
Louisiana was $2.30-33. A marketer sold
5 million at the Transco Station 65
pooling point at $2.30. A marketer
bought 50 million cfd on Texas Gas SL
at $2.35, up from a high of $2.30 a day
earlier.
         Midcontinent prices jumped to
$2.05-09 on Panhandle Eastern for
purchases, while sales topped at $2.10.
Wednesday's Panhandle gas topped out at
$2.02. One buyer turned back Panhandle
gas at $2.10, however, while a buyer on
Arkla resisted a $2.10 price and got
the seller to come down to $2.07.
Marketers bought a range of $2.06-09 on
Arkla, up from $2.04-08 the day before.
         Houston Ship Channel prices
jumped to $2.28 Thursday up from $2.22-
25 earlier in the week. Katy prices,
which had moved up earlier, stayed flat
at $2.20-24 Thursday, with one price
reported at $2.25.
         South Texas prices ranged from
$2.15-22 on Texas Eastern on the mid-
Gulf Coast. A package of 10 million cfd
was sold into Koch Gateway in the same
area at $2.24, competing with prices
into Houston Pipe Line at $2.19-20, up
from a previous high of $2.17. A
package in deep south Texas went for
$2.15, and packages were was sold into
Tejas Natural Gas near Agua Dulce at
$2.17-18.
         Meanwhile, Permian and San
Juan basin prices rebounded on at mid-
week from a low Tuesday of at least
$1.84 back to $1.90 and above for
Friday deals.
         Swing prices into El Paso
Natural Gas had dropped last Monday and
Tuesday for a combination of reasons. A
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) gas-fired
power plant went down early in the
week, causing some loss of gas demand,
although two smaller gas-fired units
were brought on line by the utility,
said a source, PG&E did cut 100
million-140 million cfd.
         The utility also picked up
some cheaper supplies out of Canada,
displacing more supplies out of the
Permian and San Juan. Another source
said PG&E had to turn back 70 million
of baseload gas because of an
operational problem. Southern
California Gas (SoCal) also cut about
80 million of swing last Monday, said a
source.
         But all that turned around
Wednesday, PG&E will be bringing the
big power plant back on line Saturday
and the baseload supplies will be
flowing again tomorrow, said a
marketer.
         A California utility on
Wednesday was trying to buy gas in the
Permian to flow Thursday through
Tuesday at $1.90 into El Paso. The
company apparently was trying to do the
five-day deals to lock up supplies
before a predicted cold front was
expected to swoop into Texas this past
weekend. A supplier said his company's
weather report had predicted
temperatures would drop to 35 in
Houston Sunday.
         "The smart seller will sell
his gas one day at a time starting at
$1.90-92 for Friday," said a supplier
late last week. "Then he'll get better
prices for Saturday through Tuesday."

First day of Order 636 operation
seen as smooth

         A number of pipelines
completed the transition to operating
under Order 636 last week and officials
were generally saying "so far, so
good."
         Officials at Koch Gateway
Pipeline, Pacific Gas Transmission,
Mississippi River Transmission,
Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia
Gulf Transmission and Northwest
Pipeline all said the transition was
going smoothly. Others scheduled to
implement Order 636 yesterday included
Northern Natural Gas, Viking Gas
Transmission, Southern Natural Gas,
Texas Gas Transmission and ANR
Pipeline.
         "Considering the number of new
services and the magnitude of the
changes that we've had to implement,
we've been pleased with the initial
month's nominiations process and
pleased with our first day operating
under Order 636," said a Columbia Gas
official. "We are experiencing the
typical minor bugs and startup problems
that you would expect under such a big
change, but there's nothing that we're
overly concerned about, that we won't
be able to work out," he added.
                  Joe Pollard, director
of transportation services for Great
Lakes, said the pipeline began its
capacity release and flexible receipt
and delivery point programs today, and
there's been no major trouble. There
have been a number of assignments,
releases and conversions as part of the
transition, but everything has gone
smoothly, he added.
         Pacific Gas Transmission (PGT)
had the fullest plate yesterday, as it
began operations under Order 636 and
began transporting expansion volumes.
According to a spokesperson, the
pipeline also started its electronic
bulletin board and had its first
capacity releases.
         The expansion allows PGT to
transport more than 2.4 billion cfd to
the Pacific Northwest and California.
Total PGT volumes were running about
1.6 billion cfd yesterday, and the
contracted expansion volumes of about
900 million cfd were about 70% full,
the spokesperson said. About 340
million cfd of the total system volumes
were moving under interruptible
contracts, he added.
         "We're very pleased to have
reached our goal on schedule," said
Stephen Reynolds, PGT president and
CEO. "Getting from blueprints to
reality on a project of this magnitude
required an incredible amount of
groundwork and follow-through."
         On a related note, Alberta &
Southern Gas ceased buying and selling
gas yesterday after more than 30 years.
Alberta & Southern transported about
9.5 trillion cf of gas through a long-
term contract with PGT to California.
         San Diego Gas & Electric
reported no problems so far early last
week getting its first volumes from the
PGT expansion.
         San Diego is getting about 54
million cfd of gas off the expanded
line from four Calgary suppliers: Bow
Valley Industries, Canadian Hunter
Marketing, Summit Resources and Husky
Oil Operations.
         The contracts range from eight
to 11 years, with prices indexed to the
market. According to SDG&E's latest 10-
K, future minimum payments under the
Canadian deals are forecast to be $6
million in 1993. $36 million in 199,
$38 million in 1995, $40 million in
1996, $42 million in 1997 and $281
million thereafter.
         For the remainder of its spot
gas for November, San Diego received
more than 180 bids from 45 companies
for a total 1.8 billion cfd.
         The utility accepted 15 bids
from 11 companies for a total of about
160 million cfd. About 85 million of
that came from the San Juan Basin on El
Paso Natural Gas, 27 million was bought
into Transwestern Pipeline in the
Permian Basin and the central zone at
station 8. Another 48 million was
bought at the border, and 10 million
cfd of spot gas came from Canada.
         As of the end of October, San
Diego's storage allotments were full,
the buyers added.

Centran creditors could be repaid
this year

         The old Centran has a new
name, a new parent and a new balance
sheet, and creditors of the
Minneapolis-based marketer might be
paid part of what they are owed by the
end of the year.
         Northern States Power (NSP)
christened the marketer "Cenergy" late
last month after acquiring most of the
assets Oct. 1. Cenergy "has had capital
infused" by the new parent, explained
Vice President Bruce Hoffarber, but
otherwise has its own relationship with
regional bank Norwest.
         It appears the financing of
Cenergy will have to be separate from
its parent. In general, public
utilities in Minnesota are not allowed
to finance their unregulated
subsidiaries, explained Bob Harding, a
rates analyst at the state Public
Utility Commission.
         NSP's creation of Cenergy and
acquisition of Viking Gas Transmission
will be examined by the commission in
the future, Harding added.
         Hoffarber said Centran was
marketing about 70 million cfd in
October, and Cenergy is doing 100
million cfd of business in November. He
added that Cenergy cannot do business
with NSP Gas.
         Meanwhile, the creditors
committee of Centran has hired a
liquidator, Jim Bartholomew, to dispose
of the estate of what is now a paper
entity. And sources said a plan to
divide the remaining assets is expected
to be filed with the federal bankruptcy
court in Minneapolis by next week.
         The assets would include the
purchase price of $2.2 million paid for
Centran, another $235,000 from the sale
of a gathering system, revenues from
the sale of a coal company and a grain
elevator and other cash. Also, NSP will
pay another $250,000 on Jan. 17 as part
of a "holdback" in the deal.
         Bartholomew's job is to
collect any accounts still receivable
by Centran and eventually make
distributions, said Charles Hofer,
credit manager at Trident NGL and
chairman of the creditors committee.
         Creditors and a judge have to
approve the plan before any
disbursements, but Hofer said he
expects most of the funds to be
distributed at year's end, some in
March 1994 and some a year later.
         He told Gas Daily that he
expects creditors to get 20-30 cents on
the dollar. "We did not leave the
decisions to the lawyers," he said. "We
were very aware of the costs that could
eat up a  bankruptcy and tried to limit
the administrative expense."
         One of the smaller creditors
that wasn't involved on the committee
said it expects to get $50,000 to
$60,000, but is not optimistic about
getting it soon.
         Centran was the first of a
number of marketers that filed for
court protection from creditors this
year.

Indiana utility fights 20-year cap

         FERC's order refusing Texas
Gas Transmission's proposed 10-year cap
on contracts with its customers is
unlawful, according to Indiana Gas.
         A cap maximizes the number of
years specific types of contracts can
be bargained for. The commission chose
to keep Texas Gas customer contracts
capped at 20 years.
         Indiana Gas said last month's
order is "unwise" and "highly
contradictory" considering commission
comments in a previous FERC order.
         FERC stated in July, "We
believe the 10-year cap proposed by
Texas Gas is a reasonable compromise
between the 20-year maximum and the
three to five-year caps proposed by the
commentors."
         The utility said the
commission's final decision was
"unsupported by substantial evidence of
record" and that 20 years is an
"excessive time period given the
dynamic nature of the gas market which
exists today."
         Indiana Gas noted that only
one commentor, Fuel Managers
Associates, opposed the 10-year cap,
and, to the best of Indiana Gas'
knowledge, no member of the association
is currently a Texas Gas customer. "It
would be unreasonable to shackle Texas
Gas customers with a 20-year contract
cap simply because someone alleges
potential future customers desire a
longer term."  (RS92-24).

SoCal gets active in refinancing

         Holders of SoCal Gas' Series X
first mortgage bonds will have to
accept a lower yield if they decide to
sell them back to the utility in an
offer announced last week. But the high
coupon bonds may have a limited life
anyway, since the utility can call them
Dec. 1, 1995.
         SoCal Gas will buy any and all
of its $120 million of 9.75% first
mortgage bonds due 2020, but the offer
expires Nov. 10. The purchase price for
the bond will be determined by using a
yield to the maturity of the U.S.
Treasury 5.125% notes due Nov. 15,
1995, plus 0.15% and accrued interest.

Gulf Coast indexes up 5-10 cents
for November

         Gas Daily's Monthly Contract
Indexes for November along the Gulf
Coast were up 5-10 cents while most
Midcontinent indexes dropped a penny,
setting the stage for what many sources
are expecting for next month -- higher
after-market prices.
         The November index for
supplies into Texas Gas Transmission
jumped 11 cents over the October index
to $2.08, the biggest increase this
month in south Louisiana. The index for
supplies into Columbia Gulf
Transmission finished at $2.11, up 7
cents.
         November indexes for
Midcontinent volumes into ANR Pipeline,
Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line and Natural
Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) each
fell a penny. The Panhandle and ANR
indexes finished at $1.90, while the
NGPL was $1.87 in Oklahoma. The index
for volumes into Northern Natural Gas
in the field climbed 3 cents, while the
indexes into Northern at Ventura and at
the demarcation point each dropped a
penny to $1.89. Firm transportation
rates under Order 636 allowed buyers to
pay higher prices in the field while
getting lower prices at Ventura and at
the demarcation point, sources said.
         The November index for
supplies into El Paso Natural Gas in
the Permian Basin was unchanged from
October to November, remaining at
$1.80. Those who sold baseload supplies
during bid week were probably
regretting that by the end of last week
as swing prices climbed above $2.

FERC commissioners get up to speed
on GISB

         Industry officials
representing the Gas Industry Standards
Board (GISB) took a seat before the
FERC commissioners yesterday to answers
questions on the board's progress
before its debut next September.
         The panel said the scope will
probably be narrow at first and the
target date for an up and running GISB
is Sept. 1, 1994.
         After a general rundown of
developments so far of GISB, FERC
Commissioner Donald Santa asked the
representatives to explain the
jurisdictional tie between the
standards the board may come up with
and FERC's responsibilities under the
Natural Gas Act.
         Marvin Clifton with Mobil
Natural Gas answered they didn't know
the answer to that question but the
board's attorneys could provide FERC
with the answer.
         On the same track as Santa,
FERC Chair Elizabeth Moler said issues
that GISB proposes to take up in its
second generation such as the
definition of gas day, notice
requirements, nominations and systems
balancing "are all directly FERC
jurisdictional items and will require
changes in FERC tariffs."
         "To the extent the FERC has
jurisdiction over something and the
pipelines are required to make tariff
changes obviously they would proceed
and FERC would act accordingly," said
Consolidated Edison's Steve Salese.
         "We hope that what we would be
doing though is coming to the
commission with something that the
industry has said 'This is going to
work for us' just like we've done in
the working groups," said Salese.
         When asked by FERC
Commissioner Vickey Bailey about the
make up and management of GISB, Mike
Bray with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
said the board has gotten past the
initial criticism of its make up. Chuck
Linderman with the Edison Electric
Institute said if anyone feels left out
of the process, the question should be
asked of them, "Where were you?"
         Another criticism Bailey said
was being voiced is that GISB is just
another level of regulation for the gas
industry.
         Mobil's Clifton said, "If that
is true, then I would like to withdraw
my support for GISB." He said the
purpose of GISB is to get the industry
together to develop industry solutions.
Clifton stressed that GISB is not meant
to add regulation to the industry.

Mining company doesn't get rights

         The Alabama Supreme Court
ruled recently that the rights to drill
for gas in coalbeds do not belong to a
mining company.
         In a blow to the already
financially strapped mining company,
Jim Walter Resources is not entitled to
develop and sell the coalbed methane
gas that accumulates in an area of the
mine that houses mining refuse, ruled
the Alabama Supreme Court.
         The court said Jim Walter
Resources (JWR) may develop the coalbed
gas that is within the coal seam,
which, in any event, must be ventilated
for safety reasons. But once the
coalbed gas migrates out of the coal
seam and into the gob -- underground
coal dumping area -- the gas then
belongs to the holder of the gas
estate, the court ruled last month.
         The gob methane gas production
represents 70% of the gas captured from
the operation, which is then sold.
         The case stems from two
appeals to gain title to coalbed
methane gas on property in Tuscaloosa
County, Ala. JWR sought title to the
gas it has been selling in a
partnership with Sonat Coal Gas and
others. The company sued NCNB Nations
Bank of Texas to gain title of the
methane gas, and the bank counter-sued.
         The land that JWR is mining is
subject to 1953 and 1954 deeds, which
conveyed the property owner's interest
to the coal to what is now JWR, but
reserved the property owner's interest
in "all gas." NCNB is the trustee of
the estate, and owns a 22.5% interest
in all the gas reserved by the deed.
         The court had to decide
whether the deed, which conveyed all of
the coal and connected mining rights to
JWR, but reserved the rights to all of
the gas to the property owner, also
reserved the rights of the coalbed
methane gas to the property owner.
         In a jury trial, the lower
court determined that all of the gas
produced from the property was coalbed
gas and that none of the gas resided in
a non-coal area before mining.
         The court said the language in
the deeds in this case is unambiguous.
The deeds specifically reserve "all of
the oil, gas, petroleum and sulphur in,
on and under" the areas where JWR mines
to the property owner.
         Neither JWR nor the bank
dispute that the coalbed gas is "gas,"
and the court said it could find "no
scientific or legal basis to support
the proposition that coalbed methane
gas should be treated as a resource
separate and distinct from other
natural gas."
         However, the court added that
property law cases indicate that the
ownership of the gas depends upon the
location of the gas at the time it is
captured or located.

Curtis nominated by president

         The first chairman of FERC,
Charles Curtis, will get the tap as
under secretary of energy, President
Clinton said.
         If confirmed, Curtis will be
in charge of science and technology
programs, waste cleanup, nuclear
weapons programs and energy policy.
Thomas Grumbly, assistant secretary for
environmental restoration and waste
management, has been acting under
secretary.
         "There are few Americans who
can match Charles Curtis' governmental
experience, or his knowledge of energy
policy," the president said in his
announcement.
         At FERC, Curtis solidified a
reputation as scholarly and fair.
Curtis had served as chief counsel to
the House Energy Committee for five
years when President Carter nominated
him to be the last chairman of the
Federal Power Commission (FPC) in 1977.
         Under a separate nomination a
month later, Curtis became FERC's first
chairman. The new commission took over
all the FPC tasks, with the addition of
oil pipeline rate regulation and
deciding appeals from price control
hearings in the Energy Dept. He has
worked at the Securities and Exchange
Commission,  and is now a partner in
the Washington law firm of Van Ness,
Feldman & Curtis.

Amoco sets up trading room in
Houston

         Amoco is hoping to have its
new gas trading room operating in
February, the major's new natural gas
vice president told reporters last
week.
         "We may not be first but we
hope to have the best" gas trading
room, Rebecca McDonald, Amoco
Production's natural gas vice president
said. Amoco has learned from the
mistakes of others, she added, which
have already set up trading-type rooms
at other companies, including Tenneco,
where McDonald headed the marketing
division before coming to Amoco.
         About 80 out of the gas
division's 200 employees will work in
the Houston trading room where futures
traders, cash traders, transportation
representatives and gas control people
will be centralized, said McDonald.
         The trading room is a result
of customer meetings initiated by
McDonald seeking to expand the services
offered by the major.
         The customers wanted more
creative solutions to contracting with
financial hedging instruments something
some wanted Amoco's help with, McDonald
said.
         McDonald's hiring signifies
the "cultural change" at Amoco, which
has realized that the business of
natural gas is different than the
business of oil, according to Bill
Benham, Amoco's vice president of
regulatory affairs.
         Amoco wants to make sure it
gets the most for its natural gas
assets, Benham added, with a shift to
gas marketing signifying the commitment
the major now sees for natural gas.
         She added that Amoco plans to
buy even more gas from third parties
this winter and next year. Amoco now
buys about 250 million cfd to 300
million cfd from independents to add to
the major's portfolio. Amoco is asking
some producers to "double and triple"
their sales to it, contending that
selling to Amoco adds value to the
independents' gas.          DM

Sluggish demand expected to slow
1993 growth

         NEW ORLEANS -- Producers
have now lowered their expectations
that gas demand will again be strong
this year, with the Independent
Petroleum Assn. of America (IPAA)
predicting gas use will rise only about
1% to "just kiss 20 trillion cf."
         Gas demand has risen for the
last couple of years by about 3% a year
with the expectation by most in the
industry that gas use would continue to
grow at those levels this year as well.
         But IPAA's latest short-term
supply and demand outlook released
yesterday at its annual meeting shows
that gas demand may not even rise by 1%
this year, with the outlook only
slightly more optimistic for next year
when demand is expected to increase
1.4% and finally top the 20 trillion
cf/year level not seen since 1979. Gas
demand last year was 19.78 trillion cf.
         Increased electric generation
using hydropower and nuclear power was
the biggest factor for lower gas demand
this year, members of IPAA's supply and
demand committee told reporters
yesterday. IPAA's forecast shows that
gas use for electric generation this
year will likely fall by 4.7% and is
predicted to drop another 1.4% in 1994.
IPAA uses figures released from the
Energy Information Administration for
the first two quarters of this year as
a basis to predict gas demand for the
remaining half of the year.
         In addition, oil prices,
including residual fuel, were
significantly lower than expected and
industrial fuel-switching customers
chose resid over gas this year, IPAA
said. Higher natural gas prices this
year also contributed to the lower than
expected demand, said Larry Hilgers,
market and risk assessment manager for
Oryx, the committee's chairman.
         IPAA had predicted last year
that demand would be up as much as 3%
this year. Despite "limited" gas demand
growth, demand for coal is expected to
rise by 3% this year even with the
Mississippi River floods and strikes.
Hydropower use is seen rising by 5%
this year and nuclear powered
generation is also expected to be up by
2% in 1993, according to IPAA.
         "As soon as gas demand last
winter didn't materialize, we began to
suspect that we may have been too
optimistic last year," said Hilgers.
         Increased use of hydropower in
the Northwest and the West probably
took about 200 billion cfd and 300
billion cfd of gas demand away, Hilgers
added.
         Gas imports from Canada are
expected to slow this year to only a 5%
increase over last year to about 2.2
trillion cf/year. Canadian gas imports
increased by about 10% last year. IPAA
attributed the slowing Canadian import
growth to increased competition driving
the market.
         IPAA also predicted slowed gas
exports to Mexico by 11% to 192 billion
cf this year due to the change in the
relative price between gas and fuel
oil.          DM

U.S. Natural Gas Supply and Demand
-- 1993 Forecast
Producers target SoCal fee

         More major producers are
calling Southern California Gas'
(SoCal) fee to access one of its
pipeline interconnections "illegal and
discriminatory."
         Shell, Mobil, Texaco, along
with Pacific Gas & Electric, are just a
few of the new supporters of Union
Pacific's original allegations of
illegal fees.  The original
complaintants were Union Pacific Fuels,
Amoco Energy Trading, and Petro-Canada
Hydrocarbons.
         These shippers/producers are
asking FERC to either declare this fee
null and void requiring a refund, or
regulate SoCal as an interstate
pipeline.
         Union Pacific claims the fee
is an intrastate rate designed to
recover costs associated with certain
SoCal downstream compression
facilities. And, the company said,
SoCal is charging this rate to shippers
delivering upstream of the intrastate
facilities.
         Union Pacific added that if
SoCal is permitted to collect this kind
of fee, there is nothing to prevent
other utilities from imposing tolls.
The fight appears to be yet another
extension of the ongoing jurisdiction
fight between FERC and California
utilities.
         Union Pacific and supporters
allege SoCal has "implemented an
illegal and discriminatory incremental
access fee" charged to interstate
shippers delivering to SoCal's Wheeler
Ridge interconnection. This connects
SoCal with Pacific Gas and Electric,
Transwestern Pipeline, El Paso
Pipeline, and the Kern River Gas-Mojave
system.
         Union Pacific said the fee is
a "burden on interstate commerce that
violates the constitution."
         SoCal admits the fee is an
intrastate rate designed to recover
costs from intrastate compression
facilities, and that it has been only
charging the fees to interstate
shippers and not intrastate shippers.
         In fact, it gives fuel credits
to intrastate shippers. It also
admitted it has told shippers that if
the fee is not paid, delivery of gas
into Wheeler Ridge will not be
permitted.
         What SoCal is denying is that
the fee is in any way illegal or in
violation of federal law. And it firmly
maintains the fee is approved by the
California Public Utilities Commission.
         SoCal explained the Wheeler
Ridge facility was built for interstate
purposes and that some opponents on
this issue rejected the construction
opportunity.
          SoCal also asserts this issue
is not under FERC jurisdiction and that
no precedence exists which addresses
jurisdiction over of an LDC
interconnection charge.

Arcadian, Southern agree to settle
on bypass

         Arcadian Corp. and Southern
Natural Gas are hammering out a
settlement that's expected to end much
of the regulatory and legal proceedings
surrounding the forced bypass of
Atlanta Gas Light (AGL) by Southern to
Arcadian's Augusta, Ga., plant.
         FERC last year reversed a
decision on rehearing and forced
Southern to provide a direct link to
the Augusta fertilizer plant, bypassing
AGL, which is Southern's biggest
customer. FERC found that Southern was
acting in a discriminatory manner when
it refused the Arcadian link after
providing a similar bypass for an Air
Products & Chemicals plant in New
Orleans. Arcadian started getting gas
directly from Southern in January, and
estimates the connection will save it
about $4.4 million per year.
         Southern, AGL and others
appealed the FERC decision in the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals, but the case
hasn't been decided.
         Before FERC granted the link,
Arcadian filed an antitrust suit
against Southern and AGL in U.S. court
in Georgia, charging them with a
"conspiracy" to protect the
distributor's "monopoly" hold on its
service area. Arcadian asked for
damages of $45 million plus court
costs. That case is still pending as
well.
         Announcement of the deal by
Arcadian last week was forced by the
companies' pending quarterly reports,
which mention the settlement, according
to Randall Saint Aubyn, Arcadian's vice
president, gas department.
         The settlement will result in
the withdrawal of all regulatory and
court action by all parties, to the
agreement, Saint Aubyn indicated.
         "The settlement also will
enable us to avoid the costs and
uncertainties associated with the
antitrust lawsuit and related
litigation and to establish a
beneficial, long-term commercial
relationship with Southern," said Doug
Campbell, president and CEO of
Arcadian.
         James Cleary, vice president
and general counsel at Southern, said
the pipeline's position would be known
once the settlement is filed at FERC,
which is expected to happen in the next
week.
         Some sources close to Arcadian
suggested there will likely be some
cash payment or discounted services by
Southern involved as well, but it may
not be disclosed by the companies. The
settlement also may address payment of
transition and take-or-pay costs to
Southern for which AGL is liable from
serving the Augusta plant.
         Another obstacle Arcadian
still faces is action by the Georgia
Public Service Commission (PSC) earlier
this year, which asserted jurisdiction
over negative imbalances on Southern's
system. The PSC, acting on a suggestion
from Atlanta Gas Light, contends that
any imbalance gas sold to Arcadian as a
result of an imbalance on Southern's
system is actually a retail sale and
subject to state jurisdiction. If the
PSC were to press the issue, it could
order Southern to stop transporting gas
to Arcadian until it applies for state
certification of such "sales." Saint
Aubyn said Arcadian expects this
problem to be resolved soon, since it
has asked for a summary judgement of
the issue.         SG

U.S. attorney seeks court order
against Iroquois

         A federal prosecutor has
sought to block Iroquois Gas
Transmission from taking testimony from
a long-time pipeline foe in a contract
dispute in order to protect the ongoing
federal criminal investigation.
         Craig Benedict, assistant U.S.
attorney for the Northern District of
New York, is seeking a court order from
a U.S. district court judge to prevent
Iroquois from taking a deposition from
Anne Mueser in a case brought by L.A.
Topsoil Co. seeking damages against the
pipeline. The disgruntled contractor
wants more than $3 million for failure
to pay for work contracted.
         Benedict is heading the
investigation that is a result of a
raid by the FBI on Iroquois' office
last year.
         Mueser has been the head the
GASP coalition, a group of landowners
originally opposed to Iroquois, and is
now working for a construction
contractor which helped build the
pipeline. As a long-time participant in
the environment and regulatory review,
she was in a position to know whether
or not permits were in compliance with
federal and state laws. She was witness
to some of the work performed by the
disgruntled contractor.
         The subpoena issued by the
court on behalf of Iroquois asks Mueser
to reveal her discussions with a list
of federal offices including the
Justice Dept. and the FBI, which have
nothing to do with the civil contract
dispute, the federal attorney told the
court.
         Benedict argues that Iroquois
is using the disposition to try to
uncover information in the ongoing
federal investigation into whether
Iroquois violated environmental laws in
the construction of the pipeline. "It
is important for the court to consider
whether the real motivation behind the
requested civil discovery is to obtain
improper criminal discovery," Benedict
told the court.
         In the motion seeking a court
order, Benedict also admits that the
case against Iroquois is now before a
grand jury.
         Benedict noted that the
federal government is not asking to
block all testimony in the civil case,
"only the prohibition of the taking of
a single disposition." Maybe the
parties "can resolve their contractual
disputes without impinging upon the
federal criminal investigation,"
Benedict added.
         Iroquois said yesterday that
Benedict's motion is just the first
volley of what is expected to be a
number of procedural legal motions in
ongoing suits against the pipeline.
         "There is nothing really
atypical to the action by Mr.
Benedict," an Iroquois official said.
         Mueser told the court that
besides the subpoena from Iroquois for
a disposition scheduled Wednesday,
Iroquois has asked to see all
information Mueser has accumulated on
the pipeline in the last seven years --
about 50 file boxes of materials.
         These boxes are now in the
"custody of the government," Mueser
said, and going through them for
Iroquois would be time-consuming.
         "Iroquois' tactics are a
transparent effort to seek information
that might be helpful in a pending
federal criminal investigation, as well
as an exercise calculated to harass and
cause undue hardship to a non-party
witness who successfully opposed this
company," Mueser told the court. A
legal assistant to the district court
judge said that a decision in the case
is likely by the end of the month.

Santa cites signficance of
gathering in policy

         How FERC handles the gathering
issue should be indicative of how the
entire range of "second-tier" Order 636
issues are dealt with at the
commission, said FERC Commissioner
Donald Santa.
         FERC's determination on how
much regulation is needed in areas
where competition can be shown --
possibly in the gathering issue, Santa
said.
         He said his preliminary notion
about gathering is to be as light-
handed as possible and realize that
gathering is not simply an extension of
transmission with its own set of
problems.
         "We ought to acknowledge this
half-slave half-free nature of
gathering" Santa said. FERC has
scheduled a technical conference in
February to discuss the gathering
issues. Santa outlined at the Natural
Gas Roundtable in Washington yesterday
the issues he sees as critical to
resolving the gathering issue.
          "First, let's get the facts
straight," Santa said about point
number one. "The commission does not
know much about gathering," Santa said.
"The first step is for the commission
to understand how gathering works in
real life."
         Santa noted the primary reason
for the upcoming public conference in
February is so the commission can "make
some well informed policy decisions,
based on fact."
         Second, the commissioner said,
FERC must find an "answer to the
threshold question; whether gathering,
nationally or locally, is a competitive
enterprise. Is regulation needed to
remedy market failure, and conversely
does the existing regulatory scheme
create a marketing failure?"
         Santa said the third basic
objective is to determine the
differences between pipeline, affiliate
and independently owned gathering
systems, and why or if they should be
regulated individually.
         The commissioner noted that
the pending Tenth Circuit Court
decision on Williams Gas Processing vs.
FERC, an argument of FERC jurisdiction
on gathering, may define "the
commission's ability to make some
distinction between pipeline- owned and
affiliate-owned gathering."
         The fourth point, Santa said,
is to answer the question, "does the
commission really need to regulate
gathering in order to satisfy its
statutory obligation?"          RR

Canada eyes NYMEX pricing

         Canadian marketers face the
same decision that their stateside
counterparts have already tackled: how
to use the NYMEX when it does not
reflect local fundamentals.
         NYMEX-based pricing crept into
one-year deals that started Nov. 1, and
many suppliers use it in at least a few
contracts. The next step, traders say,
would be to use it for monthly and
daily pricing.
         The NYMEX has manifested
itself in swap quotes at Empress.
Dealers and large marketers offered to
fix prices there for a year at levels
up to C5 cents higher than cash,
sources said.
         These parties need that
premium to cover their basis risk at
Empress, where the swap market is
illiquid, a marketer said. If they
can't find a counterparty to lay off
the basis, the dealers have to hedge on
the NYMEX, which may not reflect
Alberta prices.
         Using Gas Daily's monthly Nova
index for the past 12 months, adding
C20 cents for transportation to
Empress, and converting it to U.S.
dollars at C78 cents to U.S.$1, the
correlation to the average of the last
three days of futures settlement prices
is 77.7%. The conversions from
gigajoules to mmBtus were also made.
         "Physical players in the
province are not taking this basis
risk," the marketer said.
         This lack of correlation may
work in a supplier's favor at times,
because the swap quotes affect the
physical price quotes. Another marketer
was surprised that Empress prices fell
to $C2.25 per gigajoule this fall, so
he bought some gas at that level.
         And while those contemplating
fixed price swaps are wary about a lack
of correlation with the NYMEX, the
basis risk acceptors are unsure about
trade publication indexes at Empress,
showing risk for both sides of the
trade.
         A third kind of risk is credit
risk, which a Canadian analyst said
prevents swaps more than a year in
duration from being done at Empress.

DOE outlines status of energy law

         The Energy Dept. (DOE)
requirements under the Energy Policy
Act of 1992 (EPACT) will have little
impact on the natural gas industry if
DOE's latest implementation status
report is any indication.
         In fact, under the natural gas
section of EPACT, DOE's only duty is to
automatically approve certain gas
imports and exports. As far as the
status of that, DOE said it is "working
with [FERC] to ensure implementation of
this provision."
         There are other items
scattered throughout the EPACT
Implementation Status Report that could
benefit the gas industry, such as a
number of cost-shared gas technology
projects planned for 1994. The projects
will cover drilling, atlases and
databases, low permeability formations,
fracture technology, upgrading low
quality gas and secondary gas recovery.
         DOE also plans to assist Gas
Research Institute efforts to improve
coalbed methane recovery. Other
programs include a five-year research
and development program to increase the
recoverable natural gas resource base
and another five-year R&D program on
advanced natural gas supply
technologies. DOE is also assisting the
Interior Dept. with an EPACT
requirement to amend various lease
agreements and permits for oil and gas
production.
         DOE does have a number of
requirements under the alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs) section of EPACT,
however, which includes natural gas
vehicles. For example, in 1994, DOE
must establish data collection by the
Energy Information Administration on
alternative fuels, AFVs and how AFVs
are currently used.
         Some of the AFV programs have
been delayed. DOE was supposed to issue
guidelines to federal agencies to
measure the percentage of alternative
fuel use in dual-fueled vehicles by the
end of October, but that has been
delayed, awaiting action by the Office
of Management and Budget.
         DOE must also issue guidelines
to federal agencies for measuring the
percentage of alternative fuel use, and
issue regulations establishing
guidelines for state AFV incentives and
planning. That was scheduled to be
completed in October as well, but has
been delayed as well. Another plan to
establish a low interest loan program
for businesses that own or operate
fleets for conversion or purchase of
AFVs also scheduled for October
completion has been pushed back to
December.
         DOE has made some progress in
its AFV requirements. The department
has arranged for the purchase of more
than 5,000 AFVs for the federal fleet,
and provided AFV training to federal
employees.

EBB hooks up traders at Alberta's
AECO C hub.

         Alberta Energy kicked off its
electronic bulletin board (EBB)
yesterday when dedicated computer
terminals in the offices of five large
customers were used to nominate gas at
the AECO C hub in southeast Alberta.
         Another 35 customers will get
the terminals later this week, said
Gwyn Morgan, president of AEC Oil and
Gas, and another 40 early next year.
AECO C is a large storage facility and
hub at Suffield, Alberta, where daily
trading occurs.
         The hub is on the Nova system
and is a C10-13 cents haul from
TransCanada PipeLines at the Empress
border station with Saskatchewan.
Morgan said more than 80 companies are
customers there, trading at least 1.7
million cfd.
         Customers using the new AECO
LINK system can make nominations and
communicate with other players at the
hub via the EBB. The system also
provides a record of trades and their
status at the hub.
         "For the exchange of title,
you would get a confirmation back
electronically," Morgan said. "It saves
the telephone tag."
         AECO LINK also allows
customers outside of Alberta to arrange
for transportation after buying gas at
the hub. A balancing service provided
by Alberta Energy is also part of the
EBB.
         The terminals are installed at
no cost to Alberta Energy's customers,
and the system is supported by about 15
people on the marketing staff. He
declined to comment on the cost of the
system, which was developed in-house.
         While players can post if they
are short or long on transportation and
gas, AECO LINK is not yet an electronic
trading network, Morgan added. A
supplemental service is being developed
wherein traders can electronically
inform accountants at Price Waterhouse
about their deals, which would go into
a price index for AECO.
         Traders that participated that
day would have access to the index,
Morgan explained.
         Other companies in Canada,
such as Williams, WestCoast and Direct
Energy  are trying to create electronic
trading networks. Morgan said Alberta
Energy is having discussions with them
about tying into AECO LINK. "The more
services the better," he said.

Edisto to focus on domestic
reserves

         Edisto Exploration &
Production, a unit of Edisto Resources,
acquired a new, more flexible credit
line of $30 million which will be used
to acquire domestic reserves, expand
pipeline operations and attempt to
increase the market share of its gas
marketing operations at Vesta Energy.
International and certain other assets
are being sold.
         In line with increasing market
share, Edisto is pursuing acquisitions
of gas marketing companies to enhance
its Vesta activities. The focus on
marketing shows strong support for
Vesta, which has been the subject of
industry rumors that it would be sold
following Edisto's filing for
bankruptcy and subsequent
reorganization in June. The company has
always denied it.
         Vesta again made headlines in
August when Debbie Branch, president of
the Tulsa-based marketer, left the
company, as well as Robert Davis,
president and CEO of Esco, parent
company of Vesta Branch subsequently
formed her own company and took a
number of Vesta officials with her.
         Newly elected Chairman and CEO
Michael McGovern reviewed Edisto's
assets following its reorganization.
          In addition to focusing on
marketing, Edisto plans to increase
domestic reserves through development
of existing properties and through
acquisition. Edisto also wants to
expand transportation on its 214-mile
Missouri intrastate pipeline.
         International activities
offshore Tunisia are up for sale,
following the previous sale of onshore
properties in Tunisia and offshore
properties in Malaysia.
         The Multifex International
operations also are up for sale.
Multiflex is a manufacturer and
supplier of hose bundles and subsea
well control umbilicals.
         Edisto acquired an 80% equity
interest in March 1990.

Washington Energy hawks E&P unit

         Washington Energy is
considering selling some of the assets
of its subsidiary Washington Energy
Resources (WER), in an effort to
convert some of the exploration and
production company to cash.
         Washington Energy is also
looking at possible merger
opportunities and a public or private
stock offering. This doesn't mean an
outright sale of WER, a company
spokesperson said. It's an effort to
see what value the marketplace puts on
WER, she explained.
         WER holds reserves of 33.9
million barrels of oil equivalent as of
June 30, and has interests in 248
producing wells. WER holds an equity
interest in additional reserves and
interests in another 45 wells through
its investment in an unconsolidated
affiliate. The company also brokers gas
for third parties and provides gas
management services.
         Washington Energy said its
efforts to monetize WER are unrelated
to a recent rate case which
substantially reduced the annual
revenues of its largest subsidiary,
Washington Natural Gas. Washington
Natural requested a 9.98% overall rate
of return, but the Washington Utilities
and Transportation Commission approved
a rate of 9.15%. As a result,
Washington Natural filed rates last
month to reduce annual revenues by
$16.9 million.
         This also prompted the
Washington Energy board of directors to
reduce the company's quarterly dividend
from 35 cents to 25 cents

El Paso criticizes comments made
about case

         A high-ranking official of El
Paso Natural Gas took issue with
statements last week about allegations
by an independent marketer against the
pipeline.
         Rick Baish, senior vice
president of marketing, rates and
regulation for the pipeline, said he
couldn't comment on charges made by
Windward Energy & Marketing against the
pipeline, Meridian Oil and Burlington
Resources.
         He said the charges  "are
unproven allegations to try to avoid
judgement on the claim that we made
against [Windward] on the money they
owe us. That's pending before a federal
court in Tulsa.
         "It's obviously not pleasant
for us to read about that [in Gas
Daily], but beyond that we had a real
concern that someone ... would think it
appropriate to argue the merits of the
pending case in the newspapers when
it's before a federal judge," Baish
said.
         The stories published in Gas
Markets Week last weekwere taken from
public documents, and the accusers
wouldn't comment to Gas Markets Week on
the case. An attorney's comments
appeared at the end of the story.
         Baish was critical of the
attorney who was quoted anonymously in
the story about Windward's charges. The
attorney said that the gathering issue
was especially ripe since FERC was
considering how to handle gathering
jurisdictionally in the post-Order 636
environment.
         Baish asked that the anonymous
attorney be identified in any future
stories "so your readers can judge for
themselves what that person's agenda
might be." He found the attorney's
statements "grossly offensive."
         He thought the attorney may be
representing someone who would have an
interest in the outcome of the FERC
deliberations on gathering policy. "In
fairness, readers ought to be able to
make their own judgements about what
that person's agenda might be," Baish
said. "I thought what that person said
was entirely improper if not unethical.
I'm hard-pressed to be gentlemanly
about it. I find it hard to understand
how an attorney could make statements
obviously trying to influence FERC
based on allegations that he knew or
should have known [but which] have not
been proven."         MR

Williams introduces electronic gas
trading system

         Williams Energy Ventures
ushered in the new era of electronic
gas trading last week with all the
glitz and glamour that used to be
associated with the oil boom of the
late-1970s.
         The theme of the show was
"It's a jungle out there" in today's
gas trading business. A showroom and
multimedia presentation carried out the
theme with the message that Streamline,
as Williams calls its electronic
system, will turn the jungle into a
master planned community of orderly
trading.
         Unlike the unveiling of the
NYMEX-EnerSoft electronic trading
system on Oct. 20, also in Houston,
several computers had been set up to
demonstrate how buy and sell orders
will be posted, transacted and
nominated to pipelines.
         The few threads laid bare by
the unveiling were caused by
demonstrators who knew far more about
computers than they did about natural
gas trading. While they could dash
around with ease from window to window
in the colorful displays, they couldn't
answer certain detailed questions.
         Industry people attending the
show were forgiving, however, willing
to concede that electronic trading is
the future. As one trader joked to his
group, does this mean he won't able to
hide his big margins any longer?
         Streamline will one day
provide cash discovery at hubs around
the country if it's as successful as
Williams envisions. The system is
available now for installation and
training.
         The first hub, at Carthage in
northeast Texas, is expected to have
enough customers to become operational
by Feb. 1 or by the end of the first
quarter. Carthage ties in to six
interstate and eight intrastate
pipelines that supply 1 billion cfd.
Plus, hub operator East Texas Gas
Systems recently began operating
American Pipeline, which has nearby
interconnects with Natural Gas Pipeline
of America, Tejas Natural Gas (formerly
Exxon Gas Systems) and Texoma/Houston
Pipe Line. East Texas Gas is a
majority-owned affiliate of Union
Pacific Fuels.
         An Intra-Alberta Hub, located
on Nova Pipeline, is scheduled to be in
place early next year. A Westcoast
Energy subsidiary will put that system
on line.         RK

Columbia finds new LNG partner

         To meet the need for
electricity in the Washington, D.C.,
area and comply with the Clean Air Act,
Potomac Electric Power (Pepco) will
join Columbia Gas system in a joint
venture to restart the liquefied
natural gas (LNG) terminal in Cove
Point, Md.
         Columbia LNG and Pepco will
also seek FERC approval this week to
provide peak-day load-shaving services
to local distribution companies
starting with the winter of 1995-1996.
         A pipeline extends from Cove
Point to Loudon, Va. Pepco's interest
in Cove Point is to secure a reliable
and cost-effective source of
transportation to its Chalk Point
generating station via the pipeline.
         Columbia LNG will contribute
the terminal and pipeline in exchange
for an equity interest in the
partnership, and Pepco's subsidiary
will invest up to $25 million in equity
and debt. Pepco's investment will be
used to recommission parts of the
terminal, which has been shut down for
many years, and build a new
liquefaction unit.
         Cove Point, built in the mid-
1970s, is one of four terminals in the
country designed to receive deliveries
of LNG by ship. Currently, only a
terminal in Boston has enough demand to
justify operations.
           At one point last year,
Shell LNG was going to buy Cove Point
from Columbia, but the deal fell
through.

Order 636 didn't startle hedgers

         Order 636 hardly affected the
hedging plans of traders that Gas Daily
talked to this week, and brokers also
reported no changes in customer
activity. But lower temperatures and
more pipeline constraints in the
unbundled environment might have a
pronounced impact later, sources added.
         Spot cash prices have been
shooting up for the past week as fall
turns to early winter. Spot volumes
available for incremental needs seem to
be dwindling. A trader reported a
seller sought, but didn't get, a
December NYMEX equivalent for November
gas at Station 65 into Transcontinental
Gas Pipe Line.
         December futures have been
volatile enough this week for different
brokers to talk about reaching $2.50 or
falling to $2.35. And at times gas
futures seemed to be trading in
sympathy with the rest of the energy
complex on the NYMEX.
         "The Merc will latch on to
whatever it needs to, and now the
strongest thing is cash," a buyer
countered.
         Order 636 went in place for
the bulk of pipelines during a
transition from a weak to strong
futures market, explained Tom Lord of
Morgan Stanley. "How do you sort out
636 from a change in market psychology
in the last two weeks?" he asked.
         Over the medium term, a trader
said "there's the possibility that if
we do get severe weather, there will be
enough uncertainty about supply that we
might get more volatile price spikes
compared to last year."
         With pipeline sales gas gone,
Order 636 changes the way storage is
filled, said a trading manager at a
marketing affiliate. "Wall Street feels
storage is the biggest factor in the
market," he said. "You'll probably see
greater efficiency in the use of
storage, and hedging to make it work."

Injections amounted to bulk of demand in spring

     Gas bought for injection into storage in April and May was the
only thing that propped up prices which would have been well
under $1.50, sources were saying this week.
     Storage injections amounted to the only demand out there, said
one producer. Heating degree days from the end of February
through April were far lower than normal, he said, and this May
hasn't seen any cooling degree days in Texas.
     In April, some sources were wondering if the American Gas
Assn.'s (AGA) estimates showing strong net injections each week
were accurate because prices weren't soaring above $2.00.  One
trader said injections were the only thing that kept April prices up
near $1.90.
     AGA estimated that net injections for the month of April totaled
214 billion cf. That would be a record for April injections, based on
historical data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
See table on page 12. The previous high in net injections was in
April 1985, when net injections were 117 billion cf. This April's
net injections should be well above last April, when net injections
were 112 billion cf.
     April storage data compiled by Gas Storage Report supports the
AGA estimate, and even indicates that net injections may have been
a little higher for the month. Just looking at the 10 largest storage
operators on page 6, net injections total more than 150 billion cf.
With strong injections in April, working gas storage levels are
closer to normal now. Gas Storage Report's ballpark estimate of
working gas in storage at the end of April is about 1,177 billion cf.
     May injections have also been strong, but they may not reach the
record set in last May of 462 billion cf, one storage operator
pointed out. However, one analyst countered that May injections
may come close because distributors and marketers are likely
taking advantage of May prices, especially since June prices should
be higher as demand for air conditioning increases.
     A producer that moves gas on Northern Natural Gas said he
expects June prices to rebound. Distributors on Northern don't
start injecting until June, he said, and that should have an effect on
prices on Northern Natural. He also expects gas demand for air
conditioning in the Southwest to heat up in June. Another reason he
thinks prices are headed up in June is that a number of end-users
were looking to lock up one-year deals in May. " Prices are
probably going to rebound from here."
     One buyer for a pipeline said he isn't counting on a huge
rebound in prices. He said last year was an anomaly because the
LDCs were trying to lock up long-term supplies to back up their
transportation contracts after the pipelines restructured.
Producers were taking spot gas off the market to offer under firm
contracts, and at the same time, large amounts of gas were going into
storage, he said. That all combined to keep prices over $2.00 in
April and May, he added.

EIA revises data to reflect NGPL reclassification

     The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revised its
aggregate storage volumes for January through July of 1993 to
reflect the changes that Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL)
made to its working gas volumes due to reclassification.
     In August 1993, NGPL received FERC approval to reclassify a
portion of its working gas to base gas for accounting purposes. The
pipeline filed revised FERC Form 8s and EIA Form 191s back to
November 1992. The reclassifications also reflect the operational
levels of the pipeline's working gas, NGPL said.
     EIA's monthly storage table on page 9 shows the changes in
working gas and base gas for 1993. An EIA official explained that
1992 doesn't include the changes because the agency had already
issued final numbers for 1992.
     Most of the changes resulted in a shift of about 215 billion cf of
working gas into the base gas column. With these revisions, EIA's
monthly numbers for 1994 are more comparable to last year's. The
only reclassifications that would have to be factored in are for
Southern Natural Gas and KN Interstate Gas.
     The agency also revised its January and February 1994 storage
figures, as well as releasing actual data for March. January's
working gas level of 1,578 billion cf is almost 40 billion cf less
than what EIA initially reported for January.
     With those revisions, the American Gas Assn.'s estimates from
January and February move closer to EIA's actual figures. AGA's
working gas estimate for the week ending Jan. 28 was 1,624 billion
cf. AGA's working gas estimate for the week ending Feb. 25 was
1,074 billion cf, compared to EIA's final February working gas
level of 1,089 billion cf.
     While AGA's estimates are still somewhat lower than EIA's
numbers, they are much closer after the EIA revisions than they
were in the winter. One storage tracker said a number of people
were questioning the accuracy of AGA's January and February
numbers in the winter, but " after all is said and done, they'll
prove pretty good."
     In fact, this source said, " AGA's estimates are doing what they
were meant to do: Gauging storage activity over a week."  For a look
at AGA's most recent estimates, see the table at right.
     Working gas in storage at the end of March was 957 billion cf,
the data show, which brings working gas in line with last March's
levels, when the two reclassifications are considered.
     March had injections of 105 billion cf and withdrawals of 239
billion cf, for net withdrawals of 133 billion cf, EIA said. The net
withdrawals for the month were much lower than past Marchs' net
withdrawals. March 1993 saw heavy net withdrawals of 303 billion
cf due to the " storm of the century"  that hit the eastern half of the
country.
     Those heavy withdrawals brought March 1993 working gas to
1,028 billion cf, according to the revised data which include's
NGPL's reclassification, the lowest March level in 12 years. This
past March's working gas would be about the same if the
unaccounted-for reclassifications, i.e., Southern Natural and KN
Interstate, are factored into the 957 billion cf. Adding Southern
Natural's reclassification of about 21 billion cf and KN's shifting of
55 billion cf, working gas would be 1,033 billion cf. That's 5
billion cf more than March 1993.

American operates unique single complex facility

     Behind the WesTex gas storage facility's novel approach to
combined cavern storage, vertical well reservoir storage and
horizontal well reservoir storage is American Gas Storage's
determination to provide customers with greater market access and
high deliverability service.
     At the recent American Gas Assn. operations conference, Jay
Evans, American Oil & Gas' manager of reservoir engineering,
described American's planning and construction involved to
develop the first gas storage complex to integrate cavern and
reservoir storage.
     The WesTex facility, located in Gaines County, Texas, about 60
miles southwest of Lubbock, plans to offer section 311 service.
American is close to filing a FERC application, said James Lytal,
vice president of business development.
     WesTex consists of three fields:
     %  Salado Gas Storage Project, a bedded salt cavern with 3 billion
cf of working gas capacity. This is the first facility in the United
States constructed in bedded salt exclusively for the storage of
natural gas.
     %  Loop Gas Storage, a vertical well reservoir with 9.4 billion cf
of working gas.
     %  North Felmac Gas Storage, a horizontal well reservoir with 5.6
billion cf of working gas.
     As integrated into one facility, WesTex will have working gas
capacity of 18 billion cf and withdrawal capability of 600 million
cfd and an injection capability of 300 million cfd, Evans said in his
presentation. But Lytal said the working gas capacity may be a
little less depending on the services provided to customers. Direct
WesTex pipeline interconnects allow receipts and deliveries with
El Paso Natural Gas, Northern Natural Gas and Red River Pipeline.
     Lytal said American expects to offer about 7 billion cf of
working gas and 200 million cfd of maximum withdrawal capacity
under seasonal storage service; 5 billion cf of working gas and 140
million cfd of maximum withdrawal capacity under the firm
enhanced seasonal service; and a peaking service from the salt
cavern. The first 1 billion cf of working gas in the cavern should be
in service in November, he said.
     Evans described the capacity of each field and how it was
converted to storage.
     He explained that bedded salt is found throughout much of the
Permian Basin of West Texas, and specifically, the Midland section
of the Permian contains up to 900 feet of gross salt. Evans said the
caverns were constructed in the lower " dirty"  section of the
Permian Salado Salt beds. Well tests indicated that salt caverns
could be constructed in the beds as an acceptable container for
natural gas.
     " The acreage was presently being used for gas storage in the
depleted Loop Yates reservoir, so the existing injection and
withdrawal facilities would be used to handle surface gas
operations,"  Evans said.
     Three cavern wells have been completed and are presently being
solution mined. The first cavern well was converted to gas storage
in November 1993, but was placed back into the solution mining
mode in February 1994, Evans said.
     American started injections into the first cavern in November
1993 at a rate of 60 million cfd. A total of 550 million cf of gas was
injected up to Dec. 6, 1993. Evans said a ledge fall and subsequent
shearing of the tubing string prevented complete fill-up of the
cavern. The cavern was used for storage and injections and
withdrawals up to Feb. 12, 1994, and then returned to solution
mining mode in anticipation of total completion in November 1994.
     Loop is a converted depleted reservoir in the Yates Sand at 3,350
feet. The field produced 12.24 billion cf of gas from a reservoir
containing 13.25 billion cf. The field was converted to storage
operations in 1981 with the addition of six new wells, the
workovers of four existing production wells and compression and
metering facilities, Evans said. The facility exhibited a total
working gas capacity of 4 billion cf at that time, he said.
     American performed a reservoir evaluation of the storage field
to resolve the discrepancies between what the facility exhibited as
expected storage operations and the past history of primary
depletion performance.
     " After numerous simulation runs of the primary and storage
performance operations, a validated working model of the reservoir
emerged. It was determined that the storage field actually contained
two separate reservoirs, which were separated by a four-foot low
permeability layer,"  Evans reported.
     American expanded the facilities in 1991-92 by drilling and
completing 16 new injection/withdrawal wells and workover of eight
original wells. The company added metering and dehydration
facilities to handle the increased volumes. The facility now has 9.4
billion cf of working gas capacity and the withdrawal capability is
200 million cf, up from 50 million cfd.
     This is a reservoir facility in the depleted Felmac (Yates) field.
During primary depletion, the 3,360-feet Yates Sand produced 8.4
billion cf of the 9.24 billion cf capacity. Evans said only one of the
original producing wells exists. American converted the well to a
pressure observation well.
     American performed a numerical simulation study of the field to
determine the most economic development plan for converting the
field to storage. Both vertical and horizontal well completions were
considered while evaluating storage performance, Evans said. The
analysis determined that the most effective and economic
development of the field was by using horizontal well technology.
     Specifically, two in-line horizontal wells with a wellbore
diameter of 6 and 1/2 inches and an open hole extension of 2,000
feet were recommended, Evans said. " It was determined from the
numerical simulation results that the storage reservoir would have
working gas volume of 5.6 billion cf and a withdrawal capacity of
200 million cf,"  he reported.
     The company drilled the first horizontal well in October 1993 at
a vertical depth of 3,500 feet. The well had a horizontal
displacement of 500 feet at 90 degrees and it was drilled
horizontally to a total of 2,000 feet. The facility has a withdrawal
capability of 140 million cfd and an injection capacity of 150
million cfd. Injection of gas began in March at a rate of 50 million
cfd, Evans said.
     American decided to integrate the facilities into a single
complex to provide greater market flexibility and access. The
company tied in gas piping, measurement, dehydration, control and
compression from each of the subject projects. American also
constructed a 22-mile, 20-inch pipeline to the Red River Pipeline.

Entre to develop first offshore gas storage field

     Independent producer Entre Energy plans to develop the first
underground natural gas storage facility located entirely in
offshore waters.
      Entre filed an application with FERC earlier this month to
convert an existing gas producing reservoir located in the
Chandeleur area, Block 29, offshore Louisiana, into the Chandeleur
storage facility. The proposed facility will have an initial working
capacity of about 26 billion cf and injection/withdrawal rates of
300 million cfd, Entre said. The company bought the Chandeleur
block from Chevron in early 1993.
     The facility could be expanded to an ultimate working gas
capacity of 75 billion cf and injection/withdrawal rates of 850
million cfd. The field connects to Texas Eastern Transmission's
East Louisiana (ELA) pipeline system.
     One source said Entre's location is a good one, even though the
Louisiana storage market is competitive. The source said Texas
Eastern customers that take no-notice service from the pipeline
have to pay it back within 48 hours at ELA or pay a penalty. In the
winter, this often pushes prices up pretty high in ELA, the source
said. Customers could replace no-notice with a storage service.
     Entre has proposed a market-based rate structure in its FERC
application. The company is presently negotiating agreements with
customers for long-term contract storage service. Entre will also
host an open season for available capacity, said Stephen Kelly, vice
president of Entre.
     Kelly said the company plans to form a marketing subsidiary to
aggressively market the facility.
     The facility should be offering limited service for the 1994-95
winter season, assuming FERC approves Entre's application by mid-
summer. TCW Asset Management has provided the principal
acquisition and conversion financing for the project. Kelly said the
offshore reservoir is no different to convert to a storage reservoir
than one onshore. They both use the same technology to convert.

ANR seeks rehearing on market-based rate plan

     ANR Pipeline has repackaged its argument that it lacks market
power in its request for rehearing on FERC's decision to reject the
pipeline's market-based pilot programs.
     ANR challenges the commission's finding in ANR's rate case that
the pipeline " failed to file data demonstrating that it lacks market
power in the relevant markets (GSR 3/94)."  ANR says it has
presented in its rate filing the rationale for its three market-based
rate proposals and the rationale meets the standards for
determining market power.
     The pipeline points out in its rehearing request that it has made
three proposals for market-based rates on three different services.
" The appropriate evidence for meeting a market power test is
different for each ANR proposal and furthermore varies from the
evidence that was appropriate in some instances where the
commission has approved market-based pricing,"  ANR says.
     The three proposals seeking market-based rates are limited and
conditioned, the pipeline says. One proposal is for declined
transportation capacity, which refers to any firm transportation
contracts that an existing customer declines to renew. ANR would
post the available capacity on its electronic bulletin board and if it
receives no bids at the maximum rate, it could then attempt to
charge market-based, negotiated rates.
     The second proposal is for any new storage services, which
means services that become available after existing contracts
expire. The third proposal is for released transportation capacity
and it would allow customers with firm transportation capacity to
release it at market-based rates.
     ANR stresses that it hasn't proposed to change its basic
unbundled services, and all its open-access services are now, and
will continue to be, cost-based in its tariff. ANR's proposals for
market-based pricing are limited to three " narrowly prescribed"
circumstances, in which ANR either lacks market power or would
provide protective conditions of service, the pipeline says.
     The pipeline also argues that no single test applies to market
power analyses. ANR contends its three proposals satisfy a relevant
threshold test of lack of market power when the three proposals are
considered separately, and all definitions and conditions are
considered. For instance, ANR says it has 0% of the market in its
market for new storage services, because there are no customers for
these new services yet, so the customers can't be captive to ANR.
ANR adds that plenty of alternatives to its new storage services
already exist.
     Also in its filing, ANR requested rehearing on the commission's
order to the pipeline to eliminate its optional repackaged
transportation and gathering service. The pipeline argues that it
offers an unbundled transportation service without embedded
gathering costs and it also offers this repackaged bundled
transportation and gathering service. " By offering both the
unbundled and repackaged service options, ANR has satisfied both
commission policies of unbundling and maximizing shipper
options,"  ANR says (RP94-43-003).

Alberta Energy to expand storage at hub

     Alberta Energy plans to expand the AECO-C Hub natural gas
storage facility by 500 million cfd of withdrawal capacity and 25
billion cf of reservoir capacity, or 38.5% more than the storage unit
can hold and deliver now.
     On completion of the expansion, withdrawal capacity will be 1.8
billion cfd, or about 13% of Canadian daily wellhead capacity. Total
working storage would be 90 billion cf.
     Alberta Energy President and CEO Gwyn Morgan said the
company currently is soliciting expressions of interest from
potential customers. " Because of our low incremental costs, we are
able to provide our customers with high-quality service at
competitive rates,"  he said. " Our studies indicate that daily
storage requirements within Alberta could be as high as 3 billion
cf, and AECO-C has further potential to meet those needs."
     A portion of the $40 million expansion at the Suffield, Alberta,
facility would be available for the upcoming winter season. The full
expansion will be operational by April 1995. Potential clients are
being asked to confirm their interest by June 15, 1994.
     Morgan said the expansion is part of Alberta Energy's growth
strategy and is consistent with decisions taken by the company to
participate in the Ten Section Hub in Bakersfield, Calif., through
its Alenco Resources subsidiary and to list AECO-C Hub on the
NYMEX trading network.

Changing industry means team approach to development is needed

     The growing competition in the natural gas storage industry, and
the need for technology transfer to develop facilities, will make the
team approach to storage development a necessity, say two Union
Gas officials.
     " Competition among utilities and others for additional storage
has resulted in the need to become proactive in pursuing
development alternatives,"  say William Fay, manager of storage
projects for Union Gas, and James Egden, Union's manager of
geology. Fay presented their paper at the American Gas Assn.'s
operations conference in San Francisco earlier this month.
     In addition, they say, costs to develop storage have increased as
the better-quality reservoirs have already been developed.
Deregulation of the gas industry has also changed the marketplace,
and utilities are realizing they need to develop markets external to
their franchise areas, Fay and Egden say. More and more, utilities
are turning to storage and transportation, they add.
     " To meet these changes, multi-disciplinary teams have become a
necessity within the new market environment,"  the officials stress.
     The concept behind multi-disciplinary teams is for a company to
empower workers on the team with the tools to make the necessary
decisions. This eliminates time-consuming meetings where
management officials are filled in on technical details about a
project so they can make decisions. The tools consist of the goals,
restrictions and parameters -- especially financial -- of a project.
Within this framework, the team can make all of the pertinent
decisions on the project, Fay told Gas Storage Report. " As long as
they are moving toward the goals, there shouldn't be a problem,"  he
said.
     The multi-disciplinary teams that Union has used have grown to
include external service companies and consultants from the
planning stages through the final project evaluation, Fay said. "
Evolution of the team approach has resulted in faster, more cost
effective and detailed project completions,"  Fay and Egden say in
their report.
     But, they warn, Union's transition to the team approach wasn't
necessarily a smooth one since changes were being made in " an
extremely traditional and conservative environment."
     Fay says companies moving to the team approach to project
development probably can expect some resistance from upper
management. That is not unusual, he says, since most organizations
have traditionally operated in a hierarchical-type, filter-down
manner. Senior management may feel they are losing control, Fay
says. The key is to ease senior management's concerns by keeping
senior officials in the loop throughout the life of the project, he
says.
     " You may need to do a number of projects to convince them that
this system works,"  Fay says. Once senior officials see that costs
were kept under control and less time is spent on meetings and
decisions, they'll consider multi-disciplinary teams a benefit, he
adds.
     Fay says the team approach is still evolving at Union and is far
from complete. However, he presented case studies that show some
improvements in communication and time using the team approach.
For one thing, in the past, two central departments in the
development of storage projects, geology and storage planning,
reported to separate vice presidents. " Focus on these two groups
was significantly different resulting in poor communication and
conflicting corporate objectives,"  Fay and Egden say.
     As the regulatory environment changed, companies were
required to file reports with regulatory agencies, which also were
holding more formal hearings. Union realized it would need to
improve communication between the geology and storage planning
departments. The utility restructured so that geology, reservoir
services, storage planning and storage administration all fell under
the storage development department.
     " The emergence of the storage development department was an
attempt to provide a team environment,"  the authors say. From
there, multi-disciplinary teams for individual projects could be
formed, they add.
     Fay says he sees team development growing in the future since
most new storage projects will consist of partnerships made up of
two or more companies. He said the recent announcements of hub
development are examples of partnerships in the development and
ownership of storage projects.
     However, Fay suggests that companies beware of the pitfalls of
teams, or what he calls " the growing pains of moving from a
traditional way of operation."  First of all, senior management may
resist. Also, team members may be prone to second-guessing
decisions. Another issue is the need for more training of
employees. Employees need to be trained both technically and in
the team approach, Fay says, and that can be costly.
     Finally, he says, the team approach may not work for all
projects. " If the company doesn't know what its goal is, then that is
not a good place for a team,"  he says.

Potential Indiana storage project considers hub

     A potential storage project in Indiana is getting noticed lately as
its developers have been divulging bits and pieces about it at
conferences.
     The Blackhawk field in Vigo County, Ind., is an aquifer field that
owner Hamilton Natural Gas has been shopping around as a
potential storage facility, sources say. Hamilton officials didn't
return phone calls by press time.
     Indianapolis-based Hamilton bought the field from Texas Gas
Transmission in 1989 for $300,000, according to papers made
available at recent natural gas conferences. Based on early tests by
Texas Gas and Hamilton's tests of the Blackhawk field, the company
determined the field is ready to be developed as a " good storage
field,"  the papers said.
     Sources said five or six pipelines are in the vicinity of the field,
including Texas Gas, Texas Eastern Transmission and Midwestern
Gas. The field is located about 13 miles southeast of Terre Haute,
Ind. Sources also said they think Hamilton is trying to get a direct
connect into Texas Gas.
     The papers say total delivered gas from the field will be 5.275
billion cf over a 120-day withdrawal cycle. That averages about 44
million cfd. The injection cycle will be for 209 days maximum, the
handouts indicate.
     Not surprisingly, Hamilton has talked about developing
Blackhawk into a hub, a couple of sources said. With its proximity
to a handful of pipelines, it can serve the Midwest market area, they
said. Another source added that the success of Northern Illinois
Gas' Chicago Hub may also be contributing to the hub talk.

Richfield requests waiver of an EBB standard

     Richfield Gas Storage Systems has asked FERC for an exemption
from the provision of Order 563 that requires interstate operators
to provide electronic file downloading (EDI) on their electronic
bulletin boards (EBBs).
     As part of Order 636, the commission required interstate
pipelines to set up EBBs to facilitate the trading of capacity by
shippers. Order 563 requires pipelines to provide standardized
information about service on their systems. Interstates must
comply with Order 563 by June 1.
     Richfield, a small interstate storage operator in Kansas, points
out that the commission stated it will allow for small pipelines to
be exempt from portions of 563. Richfield seeks partial exemption
or a waiver of the requirement to provide EDI because it is a small
company and its storage field is fully subscribed under long-term
contracts.
     Further, Richfield says, it provides transportation only in
conjunction with its storage service. Since Richfield's small
pipeline system and storage field are located in Stevens and Morton
counties, Kansas, they aren't an integral link in the movement of
gas through interstate commerce, the company said.
     Richfield says that in its first year of service, it has received no
customer messages on its EBB and no inquiries on it concerning
service. No customers have offered to release their storage capacity,
although it isn't surprising since the market for storage is more
long-term than transportation, Richfield says.
     " Computer communication capability is not necessary or even
necessarily desirable on Richfield's small system, especially since
Richfield's storage service is provided at confidential, market-
based negotiated rates,"  the company said in its filing.
     Finally, Richfield argues that the cost to comply with EDI is "
prohibitively expensive."  The company said its EBB operator has
determined that EDI will cost $400 per month in addition to the
$200 per month cost to upgrade the EBB as required by Order 563.
Richfield said it can't pass these costs on to customers because it
has market-based rates already in place with customers.
     The National Registry of Capacity Rights has filed a motion to
intervene, asking FERC to grant a 120-waiver while it holds a
technical conference on the issue. The registry would like Richfield
to come up with an alternative to EDI which would allow shippers to
receive capacity release information through files they can
download (RP94-235).

SoCal to provide storage to off-system customer

     Southern California Gas will provide storage service to
Washington Water Power's new peaking power plant in Rathdrum,
Idaho.
     The California Public Utilities Commission approved the six-
year contract, which calls for SoCal to provide firm inventory of
480 million cf, with injection on an as-available basis.
     Washington Water will pay an intrastate transportation rate of
22.5 cents/dth upon injection and no transportation charge upon
withdrawal. Gas withdrawn from storage will be redelivered to the
plant in the upper panhandle of Idaho via backhaul on the Pacific
Gas & Electric/Pacific Gas Transmission system.
     Washington Water Power isn't new to natural gas storage. It is a
co-owner of the Jackson Prairie storage facility in Washington,
which is operated by co-owner Washington Natural Gas. Northwest
Pipeline is also a part owner of the facility.
     The CPUC approval on this contract is consistent with the
commission's ruling on an earlier agreement between SoCal and
Southwest Gas. The commission told SoCal it had to include a
transportation rate in its storage service to Southwest since its
original agreement didn't have a transportation charge in it.
     For independent storage operators the one-way transportation
charge could prove to be a competitive challenge. Some interstate
independents have complained that pipelines that charge only once
for gas to and from storage make it difficult for independents to
compete.

Officials see storage release market down the road

     The storage capacity release market is a huge opportunity for
the industry, said a marketer at the American Gas Assn.'s (AGA)
annual operations conference here earlier this month.
     Kevin O'Toole, vice president of transportation for marketer
Catex/Vitol, said there is a " monstrous market"  for storage
capacity releases and swapping even though only a few deals have
been done. O'Toole pointed to Northern Illinois Gas' Chicago Hub as
an example of where swapping would be effective.
     Richard Rushton, general manager of gas storage for NIGas, said
his company is approaching storage capacity releases cautiously. "
We won't be real aggressive,"  he said, because the Illinois
Commerce Commission has determined that ratepayers should share
the benefits of the hub, but shareholders will assume the risks.
     Another speaker on the panel, Steve Schoening, manager of load
and supply for Wisconsin Natural Gas, said Wisconsin Natural is
still looking to lease storage " close enough to home"  so it could
eliminate the need to nominate transportation from storage on a
pipeline. So far, the LDC has been unsuccessful because the closest
storage is in Illinois or Michigan.
     The panel members discussed how the industry operated this
winter under Order 636 and extreme weather. The panel praised the
industry's successful effort and communication this past winter,
but they also said communication needs to improve in order to make
sure the natural gas system can meet future challenges.
     Distributors need to have a contact at the pipelines to call who
can give them the capacity information they need right away,
Rushton said. He explained that NIGas encountered that problem
this past January when it was trying to find out how much capacity
was flowing on the pipelines that service it.
     Rushton said it turned out that often there was only one person
at the pipeline who could give the distributor capacity information
and by the time that person got back to NIGas, it was midday. Also,
he urged pipelines and suppliers to find a better mechanism for
securing supplies on the weekends. Some of January's coldest days
in NIGas' northern Illinois service area fell right on the weekends.
     Schoening agreed, saying LDCs still need to be able to pick up
the phone and talk to someone, no matter how good a pipeline's EBB
is. He said pipelines need to understand the problems LDCs have
with nominating a day ahead of time.
     John Kelly, director of transmission technical services for
Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, defended pipelines' efforts, pointing
out that " communication is a two-way street."  He said there are
other elements of the industry that need to keep in touch, not just
pipelines and LDCs, but marketers and producers as well. In
addition, customers need to keep pipelines abreast of what they are
doing with their storage volumes so the pipelines can keep track of
volumes and supplies.
     Kelly added that pipelines' bulletin boards will only improve as
they move toward electronic data interchange and they work closely
with customers. Rushton and Schoening agreed that all the tools
weren't in place this winter and the system still managed to operate
effectively. But the system needs to improve, and communication is
the key, Rushton said.

LDC wants gathering line added to Jackson Prairie

     Washington Natural Gas has asked FERC to let it amend an
earlier application to expand its Jackson Prairie storage facility so
it can add a 4,800-foot gathering line.
     The company explained that the gathering line is needed to
relieve a shortfall in the anticipated delivery capability that the
expansion project was going to add. Washington Natural expected
that its expansion would bring seasonal working gas to 15.1 billion
cf, an increase of 2.3 billion cf. The work would also increase the
firm delivery rate to 450 million cfd. The expansion work was
expected to cost a total of about $4.4 million.
     FERC approved Washington Natural's application in a March
1991 order that allows the utility to do well recompletions on six
wells, add two dehydration and two cooling towers and a metering
station. Washington Natural has determined that the well workovers
didn't result in the projected increase in deliverability that it had
anticipated.
     Due to this performance shortfall, the project cannot achieve the
certificated seasonal working gas quantity of 15.1 billion cf, the
distributor said. That leads to a difference between the certificated
contract demand level and the actual withdrawal rate that can be
achieved at the facility.
     Washington Natural says it can fix this shortfall and bring the
expansion project's performance up to its certificated capacity
level by constructing a 4,800-foot, 16-inch gathering line. The
construction is expected to cost $655,000 which the three owners of
Jackson Prairie will bear. The other owners of the facility are
Northwest Pipeline and Washington Water Power.
     The gathering lines will connect some of the existing wells with
the compressor station and will reduce the pressures against which
the withdrawal wells have to work during the withdrawal cycle. "
This arrangement will effectively increase the deliverability of the
withdrawal wells,"  Washington Natural contends (CP94-534).

Design problems for existing cavern and bedded salt cavern
construction

     By Michel Dussaud
     Gas storage in salt caverns is becoming popular as evidenced by
the fact that many of the new gas storage projects, 16 out of 40, or
40%, are in salt caverns. A larger percentage of these new storage
caverns will be converted from existing caverns to storage (40% of
new projects), and more caverns, about 25% of new projects, will be
in bedded salt. This is due to the search for the best location with
regard to pipeline interconnects, especially in the market area,
where no domal salt is available. Also, competition among storage
developers is contributing to the popularity of salt cavern
construction.
     Most of the existing gas storage facilities in salt caverns in the
United States and Canada are in salt domes, with only 15% of them
in bedded salt. A few of the existing gas storage caverns, 20%, are
converted brine or liquid storage caverns. Only one of these
converted caverns is in bedded salt.
     The industry may find it more economically attractive to convert
an existing cavern into storage than developing a new cavern.
However, the storage industry is facing new problems of design in
two areas:
     %  How to convert existing caverns safely and efficiently.
     %  How to develop safe and economic gas storage caverns in
bedded salt.
     Salt caverns may be developed by conventional mining
techniques or by solution mining for the purpose of salt extraction.
They also may be developed to store liquids. When considering a
conversion project, some problems have to be carefully addressed
because these caverns were not initially designed for this purpose.
     The first problem is the tightness of the wells connecting the
cavern with the surface. In the case of conventional salt mine, it is
even more critical. Internal and external (cement bond) tightness
must be checked and the usual procedure is the Mechanical
Integrity Test (MIT) using nitrogen. An apparent leak rate of 250
bbls/year (bottom hole conditions) is generally accepted for gas
caverns. However, a more lenient requirement is usually accepted
for brine production or liquid storage, such as 500-1,000
bbls/year.
     Second, the problem of roof span and roof protection needs to be
addressed. It is common to develop caverns with a very extended
flat roof when producing brine in order to maximize the extracted
salt, especially when the cavern is developed by using a two- or
multi-well technique. In most cases, the brine producer owns the
surface, and no third party is affected in case of a partial roof
collapse resulting in subsidence or even sinkhole formation. In the
case of bedded salt, salt may be solution mined at the roof of the
cavern for the same purpose of maximizing salt extraction, and no
protection is left, leaving the cap rock exposed to the cavern
content.
     These two circumstances may be very dangerous for gas storage.
If the roof span is too large, more gas will have to be kept in the
cavern at the end of withdrawal to maintain cavern stability. If no
salt is left at the roof of the cavern to maintain a barrier and avoid
cap rock exposure, then a lower maximum pressure may be required
to mitigate migration risk.
     Communication between caverns or migration out of the cavern is
a third problem. This may happen when the solution mining process
has not been very well controlled. Then, dissolution abnormalities
may occur, especially at the roof if the blanket material level has
not been well monitored. This may also result from the presence of
a potash seam, for example, which may be dissolved even with salt
saturated brine. Caverns may then communicate through such a
channel which is sometimes very difficult to see by sonar. The same
circumstance can also make the cavern communicate with the
outside of the dome, or with the cap rock in the case of bedded salt.
Such risks are sometimes very difficult to identify and quantify.
Pressure testing is not, in most cases, sensitive enough to detect a
small leak outside the cavern, especially with large caverns.
     Fourth, cavern separation sometimes may not be large enough for
gas storage. Again, because the brine producer's objective is to
extract as much salt as possible, and because brine caverns are
maintained at a relatively constant pressure resulting from the
weight of a brine column, they may use a small separation between
caverns. When converting these caverns into gas storage, higher
minimum pressures may be needed so as not to maintain cavern
stability or control creep closure.
     Finally, in some instances, when contemplating a bedded salt
cavern conversion, the problem is to use the space left between the
rubble in the cavern, when salt is very impure. Depending on the
rubble size and nature, dewatering this part of the cavern may not
be feasible.
     Designing caverns in bedded salt requires addressing some
specific points as well. The first point is the aspect ratio, defined
as the ratio of the cavern height to maximum diameter. It is usually
acknowledged that an oval-shaped cavern, or one with an arc-shaped
roof with an aspect ratio close to one, are the most stable. When this
ratio becomes lower than one, the vertical component of stress is
reduced at the roof of the cavern. Ultimately, it may become
negative, which means that the rock above the cavern is then
subjected to vertical tension. However, even weak vertical
compression may endanger cap rock stability. This situation may
occur with large caverns with extended flat roofs and weak cap
rock. Then, a higher minimum pressure is required to maintain
cavern stability, and more base gas has to be used.
     In some bedded salt layers, there are in situ stresses which are
non isotropic. For instance, because of tectonic thrust, the
horizontal component of the stress may be 5-20% more than the
vertical component. This must be taken into account when designing
the storage cavern. Usually, a higher minimum pressure will be
required.
     Insolubles can be a problem as well. If insoluble content is too
high, for instance above 20%, this may make cavern construction
infeasible, because the pile of rubble will take all the space
developed by salt dissolution. If there are massive and thick
insoluble layers within the salt bed to be dissolved, this also can
make the cavern difficult or unfit to construct.
     Finally, if no salt is left at the roof of the cavern and the cap
rock is exposed to gas under pressure, it is very important to
evaluate cap rock tightness to gas, and identify potential gas traps
or loss zones in permeable horizons above the cavern.
     In conclusion, most of the projects involving cavern conversion
or bedded salt cavern construction are probably feasible provided
the relevant problems are carefully addressed during the design
stage. Some principles of design for underground excavation have
been given by Professor Bieniawski from Pennsylvania State
University. Two of these principles are particularly suited to
storage cavern design. The first of these is the principle of
minimum uncertainty. All parameters relevant to the design must
be properly evaluated. If one can't be assessed properly, such as a
small migration path out of the cavern not seen by sonar and not
easily detected by pressure testing, then the corresponding risk
can't be controlled. The second principle to consider is the state-
of-the-art design. If extrapolating beyond the usual way of design
is needed for a project, then this move must be evaluated carefully
in order to check if the usual assumptions made are still valid.

Amoco Canada adds partners to planned storage hub

     TransCanada PipeLines and Alberta Natural Gas have bought into
Amoco Canada Petroleum's storage project as the companies have
teamed up to create a major new natural gas storage hub near
Calgary.
     The Amoco storage project is estimated to cost close to $80
million and is scheduled to come on line Nov. 1.
     TransCanada will take 40% and Alberta Natural will get 20% of
the project as a result of a joint venture announced by the three
Calgary companies. Amoco retains a 40% share and will continue in
its role as operator of the project, which will store 40 billion cf.
The companies will set up a separate business to oversee the
facility.
     The storage facility is being developed near Amoco's East
Crossfield natural gas plant, about 20 miles north of Calgary. It is
situated between TransCanada's mainline east and Alberta
Natural's mainline west. The project is expected to compete with
Alberta Energy's AECO-C Hub near Medicine Hat, Alberta.
     Although the Amoco storage facility will offer less storage
capacity than Alberta Energy, the project's organizers think it will
provide them with an advantage in the increasingly competitive
storage market. The facility will allow the owners to provide better
service to their customers, TransCanada said.
     TransCanada is also a partner in the Washington 10 storage
project in southeast Michigan. That project is awaiting regulatory
approval.

PG&E storage decision delayed

     The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decided at its
May 4 meeting to hold off on a decision on Pacific Gas & Electric's
(PG&E) unbundled storage program until May 25.
     The commission is reviewing PG&E's plan and a preliminary
decision from an administrative law judge (ALJ) (GSR 4/94). PG&E's
storage program proposal unbundles storage capacity into its
separate functions and it would allow customers to contract for the
separate services.
     The ALJ recommended for the 1994-95 season that 150 million
cfd of injection capacity and 32.1 billion cf of inventory be
available to core customers, just as PG&E requested. The ALJ
suggested the utility make available to the core 1,055 million cfd of
withdrawal capacity, somewhat less than the 1,235 million cfd that
the utility requested.
     Another major issue the CPUC will decide is whether the core or
noncore customers should get expanded capacity at PG&E's main
storage facility, McDonald Island.
     The decision on PG&E's plan also affects the utility's electric
fuels department's request for proposals on storage service. Some of
the proposals, including that by PG&E's gas group, will be affected
by the CPUC decision, an official had said previously.

Market molecules

     %  Arkla Energy Resources, now NorAm Gas Transmission, told
its shippers earlier this month that it is nearing maximum
injection rates into storage. The pipeline once again reminded
shippers to make sure their physical supplies match their markets.
Also, the pipeline won't be able to accept any incremental supplies
without matching physical markets until the system oversupply is
resolved.
     %  During June, Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) said it
won't be able to schedule more than 30% of the total firm storage
rights, including no-notice rights, from points sourced on the
Amarillo system. NGPL anticipates that interruptible storage
injections from Amarillo sources will remain at zero. If June is
similar to May, NGPL expects about 300 million cfd of Amarillo-
sourced injections would be unable to be scheduled.
     %  Columbia Gas Transmission said until further notice, it can't
accept storage in transit, SIT, injections on weekends or holidays.
SIT injections can only be made on weekdays.
     %  Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline offers a discounted
summer storage program. The interruptible service allows
injections from April 1 through Sept. 30, and all gas must be out of
storage by March 31, 1995. The rate for storage only is 12.5
cents/dth and with transportation, the rate is 42 cents. For more
information, call John Childers, transportation services manager, at
701-221-1254.
     %  Northwest Pipeline encouraged shippers to keep imbalances as
close to zero as possible since its balance at the Jackson Prairie
storage facility, of which it is a co-owner, is near its maximum
allowable level. Also, the pipeline doesn't have relief at Questar's
Clay Basin storage facility, where Northwest leases space, to
increase injections there.
     %  NorAm Gas Transmission is the new name of Arkla Energy
Resources. The company received FERC approval to change its name.
NorAm says the name more accurately reflects the regions it
operates in. The tables on pages 6 and 7 reflect the change.
Affiliate Mississippi River Transmission hasn't changed.
     %  Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) is asking FERC for
permission to modify its S-1 rate schedule so it can provide
interruptible no-notice injection rights to balance actual takes at
NGPL's delivery points. As S-1 is presently written, S-1 isn't
available on a no-notice basis to balance actual takes during the
injection period, May 1 through Oct. 31. NGPL's S-1 shippers said
they would like to be able to use S-1 and S-2 to inject gas to help
balance a delivery point when the actual takes at that point are less
than the confirmed delivery nominations.

Enron files for section 311 service

     Enron Storage last month filed for FERC approval to provide
section 311 service from its Napoleonville storage facility in
Louisiana.
     Enron also requested market-based rates for the section 311
service, which allows the company to move gas from storage out of
the state of Louisiana.
     Napoleonville is a salt dome facility in Ascension Parish, La.,
with a working gas capacity of 4 billion cf and a maximum
withdrawal rate of 400 million cfd. Enron plans a second phase at
the cavern and it will add 3 billion cf of working gas.
     FERC hasn't yet set a date for hearing on Enron's request for 311
service and market-based rates.

RG&E releases storage on CNG

     Rochester Gas & Electric (RG&E) has released more storage
capacity on CNG Transmission, but not nearly as much as it
released earlier this spring.
     The utility released 720 million cf of storage on CNG at a
withdrawal rate of 12 million cfd. Public Service of North Carolina
picked up all of the capacity for a one-year term from April 1
through March 31, 1995. The demand rate for the transaction is
$1.95/mcf.
     In March, RG&E released a total of 3 billion cf of storage
capacity on CNG Transmission (GSR 4/94). Three companies took the
capacity: Virginia Natural Gas, Washington Gas Light and CNG
Services.
     RG&E said it has released storage capacity because it has taken
transportation capacity on Empire Pipeline, which came on line last
year. This has freed up some of the utility's storage and
transportation capacity which it has released on electronic bulletin
boards.

Cayuta open season nearing end

     The Cayuta Natural Gas Storage project has a few days left in its
open season for available capacity and deliverability from its
planned salt cavern facility in upstate New York.
     The open season closes May 31 on Cayuta, the second project by
the partners of the nearby Avoca Natural Gas Storage. Cayuta is
expected to have a working gas capacity of 2 billion cf in its first
phase and 320 million cfd of withdrawal capability. The second and
third phases will have 2 billion cf and 1 billion cf of capacity
respectively.
     Avoca is willing to negotiate bids and enter into preliminary
agreements with any party interested in the 3 billion cf of capacity
that will be available in the second and third phases.
     For more information, call James Driscoll of J. Makowski,
developing partner of both projects, at 617-720-7678.

Canadian board rejects InterCoastal pipe conversion

     ANR Pipeline won't soon be connecting its system to InterCoastal
Pipe Line's at the Canadian border nor will ANR tie in with
Consumer Gas' Tecumseh storage project.
     The National Energy Board denied InterCoastal Pipe Line's
application to convert a Canadian oil pipeline to gas, which would
have had the capacity to move 133 million cfd of gas to markets in
eastern Canada and the northeast United States.
     ANR Pipeline planned to build almost 12 miles of new pipe to
connect InterCoastal with its system at the border, as well as to
Ontario utility Consumers' Tecumseh Gas Storage project near
Sarnia. Another 12-mile lateral would have extended from the
border to ANR's existing system in Michigan. ANR has an
application for construction of this pipeline at FERC.
     The board said safety concerns prompted its decision. While it
was satisfied with many aspects of InterCoastal's proposal, " the
board had reservations about several features of the detailed
design. These include the integrity of the existing pipe, localized
depth of cover problems, minimum design temperature, hazard
assessment and setback requirements."
     InterCoastal, jointly owned by Interprovincial Pipe Line (IPL)
and ANR, planned to convert about 130 miles of existing crude oil
pipeline owned by IPL, which extends from IPL's Sarnia, Ontario,
terminal to a point near Toronto. InterCoastal had signed Consumers
Gas as the project's anchoring customer.

Avoca asks FERC for permission to drill test wells

     Avoca Natural Gas Storage has asked FERC for an exemption from
the temporary certificate requirements so the company can install
and test three production and five monitoring wells without
delaying its project.
     The company explained to FERC in its filing that the
Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC), which has jurisdiction
over the withdrawal of water from the river, is requiring Avoca to
provide actual production well data to support its application for
water withdrawal. The Susquehanna commission won't consider test
data, even though Avoca has included the test data in its
application to SRBC, Avoca said.
     Since Avoca isn't authorized to develop and construct production
wells prior to receiving FERC approval on its application, the
company can't drill the wells, it said. This threatens the January
1996 in-service date that Avoca has told customers during
negotiations, especially since the SRBC meets every other month,
Avoca said.
     Avoca has requested the commission grant it an exemption from
the temporary certificate requirements to allow it to construct the
required production wells. The company said it has offered proof
that no additional permanent environmental damage will result
from the construction of the wells (CP94-161).

SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS DISCLOSED FOR OREGON POWER PROJECT

     The gas-supply arrangements for a planned cogeneration facility
in Oregon were among several new transactions disclosed in export-
license applications just filed with the Canadian National Energy
Board.
     Two producer-marketers, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and Canstates Gas
Marketing, separately requested Canadian government approval to export
a combined total of 35,000 MMBtu/day for use in the Hermiston
Generating Co. L.P. combined-cycle plant to be constructed at
Hermiston, Ore. Chevron U.S.A.'s supply would be acquired from Chevron
Canada Resources Ltd., its north-of-the-border affiliate. Canstates
would buy its gas at wholesale from Home Oil Co. Ltd.
     In other developments, Renaissance Energy Ltd. of Calgary filed
for authorization to sell and export gas to Bay State Gas Co. and Bay
State's parent company, Northern Utilities Inc. of Westborough, Mass.
Also, Western Gas Marketing Ltd. disclosed that it has scored a new
transborder deal with the Michigan Gas Utilities unit of UtiliCorp
United Inc.
     Officials with Hermiston Generating did not respond to requests
for information. However, a project description submitted to the NEB
says it consists of two side-by-side combustion turbines that will
utilize gas as their primary fuel.

Big new plant

     The plant's nominal primary output will be 300 Mw, divided
equally between the two combustion units. Hermiston submitted a copy
of a long-term agreement to sell electric power produced by the plant
to PacifiCorp, an electric utility based in Portland, Ore.
     A source familiar with the project says as of now, it is not
intended to be a "qualifying facility" cogenerator for purposes of the
Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act; however, the source says, a
local agricultural-products company will purchase waste energy from
the plant.
     The Feb. 28 contract between Chevron and Hermiston specifies a
maximum volume of 20,000 MMBtu over a 15-year period commencing in the
summer of 1996. Transportation to the international border will be
carried out by NOVA Corp. of Alberta and Alberta Natural Gas Co. Ltd.
Carriage downstream of the border will be by a combination of Pacific
Gas Transmission Co. and Cascade Natural Gas Corp. The latter must
construct a delivery tap to serve the power plant.
     The gas price is a netback formula set to start at (U.S.)
$1.61/MMBtu at the wellhead, with annual 5.5% escalators every Nov. 1.
     The April 7 contract between Canstates and Hermiston calls for
15,000 MMBtu/day over the same term as that of the Chevron contract.
Canstates will buy the gas from Home Oil at a point on ANG's system.
Pricing is similar to the terms of the Chevron agreement.
     A Canstates official reports that Canstates's biggest existing
export business is a long-term relationship with Transco Gas Marketing
Co. under which TGMC receives about 120,000 Mcf/day at the Niagara
Falls border interchange. Canstates, which is controlled by ANG,
inherited most of the TGMC supply deal from Sulpetro Ltd., the
official adds.

Other proposed exports

     Renaissance is proposing to deliver 6,423 MMBtu/day to Bay State
under a 10-year contract commencing Jan. 1, 1995. The delivery point
would be Niagara Falls or upstream on the system of TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd., depending on which entity's firm capacity is used.
     NU would get 990 MMBtu/day over a 10-year term commencing Nov. 1,
1995.
     In both contracts, the gas price would consist of monthly demand,
reservation and transportation charges on TransCanada and NOVA plus a
commodity charge for gas based on an index of price reports in three
industry newsletters.
     According to its NEB filing, Western Gas wants to sell a maximum
of 7,241
Mcf/day to MGU at two locations under a 10-year contract retroactive
to Nov. 1, 1993. The contract price would consist of a demand charge,
inventory charge and commodity charge based on a published index.

NO CHANGES DETECTED IN INDUSTRY'S USE OF DERIVATIVES

     There has been no significant slowdown in the use of derivative
financial products by gas marketers, judging by the comments of
officials contacted by GAS TRANSACTIONS REPORT.
     Of four major marketers contacted, two, Tenneco Gas Trading Co.
and Coastal Gas Marketing Co., say they have taken no recent actions
to limit or restrict derivatives usage. Officials with the other two
companies, who declined to speak for attribution by name or company,
also say they haven't put any new trading policies in effect.
     The reason for official reticence is what one source described as
"political concerns" stemming from Congressional and administrative
scrutiny of derivatives usage. In a related event, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board on April 14 issued a proposed rule
requiring more complete disclosure of a company's use of derivatives.

Gas business `a major beneficiary'

     Brian McLaughlin, director of Tenneco Gas Trading, is adamant
about the benefits of derivatives in the gas business and bullish on
the growth outlook for derivatives such as swaps, options, futures and
more exotic hedging instruments. "In a word, no," was his response
when asked whether the company has reined in its hedging practices or
derivatives employment.

     ***********************************************************
     WHAT'S A `DERIVATIVE' DERIVED FROM?

          Derivatives "are complex financial securities whose
     values are derived from other underlying securities," says
     Richard George, a Charlottesville, Va., portfolio manager
     and editor of a newsletter on derivative risk. He divides
     derivatives into three broad types: exchange-listed, over-
     the-counter and structured/hybrid. Exchange-listed deriva-
     tives include futures and options tied to futures, stock and
     currency exchanges. Examples of OTC derivatives are swaps,
     options and forwards. Structured/hybrid derivatives include
     mortgage securities, bonds with warrants, "convertibles" and
     many more newly emerging instruments.
          To date, gas marketers have relied primarily on
     exchange-listed and OTC derivatives. Industry insiders say
     the use of more-exotic hybrids and custom-structured
     derivatives has been limited so far to a small group of the
     industry's most sophisticated traders.
     ***********************************************************

     McLaughlin would not comment about the losses from derivative
trading reported by companies outside of the gas industry. But he
thinks that derivatives -- based on standard agreements "with slight
modifications and negotiations among counterparties" -- are just what
the gas market needs to keep growing and avoid the distortions of the
past.
     "The gas business has been a major beneficiary of the use of
futures and other derivatives," he says. "We see the operations of the
financial side of the industry as a benchmark for the physical side,"
especially by pointing the way toward greater precision in terminology
and standardization of procedures.
     He concedes that derivatives bring greater risk -- and the risk is
growing as traders attempt to make ever-longer derivative-based
transactions. The key to avoiding fiascos of the type that recently
befell MG Corp., Procter & Gamble Co., Marion Merrill Dow Inc. and
others is to cover all foreseeable risks with appropriate hedges, he
says, and if none are available, "don't be in there half-covered."

CGM likes ERMA

     Venita Ferguson, Coastal Gas Marketing's risk manager, reports
that her company is continuing its practice of hedging price
uncertainties with  offsetting derivative products. CGM makes frequent
use of a modified version of the Energy Risk Management Association's
master energy price swap agreement, she says.
     CGM has put no new restrictions on derivatives usage in recent
weeks, Ferguson says. That part of the company's business is growing
with its portfolio of long-term sales, she adds. (FASB, 203-847-0700;

MMS SENDS FEDERAL ROYALTY PAYERS SCALED-DOWN INFORMATION REQUEST

     The Minerals Management Service this month sent a scaled-down
order for gas-contract settlement information to holders of federal
oil and gas leases. The action carries out MMS's side of an agreement
made earlier this year with the Independent Petroleum Association of
America and other industry groups.
     The industry groups had challenged MMS's interpretation of the
application of royalty regulations to contract-settlement payments.
Last June, MMS ordered all federal lessees to submit detailed
information about payments they had received in settlement of gas-
contract disputes. The order came as a wave of take-or-pay settlements
resulting from industry restructuring was winding down.
     IPAA, in conjunction with the American Petroleum Institute, sued
MMS over the June order and sought a preliminary injunction in federal
court against the data collection effort. It agreed to drop the
request for injunction upon issuance by MMS of the revised order.
     The main difference between last year's order and this year's is
that MMS no longer requires lessees to list the federal or Indian
leases involved in each settlement or the proportion of the settlement
attributable to those leases. MMS continues to require that the
federal royalty payers list all settlements taking place after Dec.
31, 1979.

Still may go to court

     As did the old order, the new order requires royalty payers to
give the date of settlement, the producer's name, the purchaser's
name, the amount of the settlement and the date the settlement payment
was received. MMS defines a settlement as "including, but not limited
to... take-or-pay, price deficiencies, buy out or buy down payments,
etc."
     Under terms of the agreement, the associations will not challenge
the latest MMS order. In the near future, MMS will select up to 10
responses for which it will issue an "order to pay." Those cases will
then enter the Interior Dept.'s administrative review process, and MMS
says it expects they will be litigated to determine whether the
government is owed royalties based on the settlement payments. (MMS,
202-208-3983)

STANDARD CONTRACT HAS ALTERNATIVES FOR SITUATIONS OF NON-PERFORMANCE

     As it does with force majeure, a standard gas contract drafted by
a committee of marketing and legal executives provides alternative
clauses for situations in which one party fails to live up to the deal.
     The standard EFP contract offers two alternatives for the article
titled "Failure to Perform," Article 10. The "A" set places the burden
of dispute resolution on both contract parties by calling on them to
"cooperate" to resolve non-performance issues. The "A" set also
provides for more severe penalties for non-performance.

Alternative A: cooperative dispute resolution


ARTICLE X

Failure to Perform

10A.1 Subject to the tolerances set forth in Transporter's tariff,
Seller is obligated daily to Schedule, or cause to be Scheduled, and
to deliver to the Transporter which is delivering Gas to the Delivery
Point, and Buyer is obligated daily to Schedule, or cause to be
Scheduled, and to receive, from the Transporter receiving the Gas at
the Delivery Point, the Daily Contract Quantity of Gas at the Delivery
Point agreed to for the Period of Delivery. Both parties hereto shall
also promptly notify each other as soon as possible of any
notification by a Transporter of any imbalances which are occurring or
which have occurred, and they shall cooperate to eliminate such
imbalances including the use of any make-up or balancing rights which
either party may have.
[The requirement to notify the other party of an imbalance situation
could be accomplished by telephone; that possibility, along with the
parties' mutual obligation to "cooperate" on the elimination of an
imbalance, adds up to a fairly broad imbalance remedy.]

10A.2 If either party fails to Schedule the Daily Contract Quantity,
as provided in Section 10.1, that party shall be liable for the
following damages:

(1) If the amount Buyer Scheduled on any day is less than the
applicable Daily Contract Quantity and the Sales Price, as defined in
Section 10.2(3) hereunder, is less than the Contract Price, then Buyer
shall be liable for and shall pay to Seller (a) a dollar amount equal
to any demand charges which Seller has incurred on the Transporter
immediately upstream of the Delivery Point for firm transportation of
Gas which Buyer failed to Schedule and (b) a dollar amount equal to
the sum of the product of (i) the difference between the Contract
Price and the Sales Price the Seller receives, multiplied by (ii) the
difference between the Daily Contract Quantity and the quantities
Scheduled by Buyer for each such day during the Period of Delivery.
Receipt of full payment hereunder by Seller shall act to reduce the
Contract Quantity by a quantity equal to the difference between the
original Contract Quantity and the total quantity Scheduled for the
Period of Delivery.
[For example, if the buyer takes 2,000 MMBtu less than the DCQ and the
seller is forced to sell the gas for 10 cents/MMBtu below the contract
price, the buyer must pay the seller $200 per each day it under-takes
plus the pipeline demand charges paid by the seller for firm
transportation.]

(2) If the amount Seller Scheduled on any day is less than the
applicable Daily Contract Quantity and the Replacement Price, as
defined in Section 10.2(3) hereunder, is greater than the Contract
Price, then Seller shall be liable for and shall pay to Buyer (a) a
dollar amount equal to any demand charges which Buyer has incurred on
the Transporter immediately downstream of the Delivery Point for firm
transportation of Gas which Seller failed to Schedule and (b) a dollar
amount equal to the sum of the product of (i) the difference between
the Replacement Price and the Contract Price multiplied by (ii) the
difference between the Daily Contract Quantity and the quantities
Scheduled by Seller for each such day during the Period of Delivery.
Receipt of full payment hereunder by Buyer shall act to reduce the
original Contract Quantity by the difference between the original
Contract Quantity and the total quantity Scheduled by Seller for the
Period of Delivery.
[For example, if the seller delivers 2,000 MMBtu less than the DCQ and
the buyer is forced to buy replacement gas for 5 cents/MMBtu more than
the contract price, the seller must pay the buyer $100 for each day it
under-delivers plus the pipeline demand charges paid by the buyer for
firm service.]

(3) The "Sales Price" shall be the price at which Seller is able,
acting in good faith, to make comparable sales at the highest
reasonable price. The "Replacement Price" shall be the price at which
Buyer is able, acting in good faith, to obtain comparable supplies at
the lowest reasonable price. In the event Seller is not able to find a
market for the quantity of Gas within the Contract Quantity not taken
by the Buyer, the Sales Price shall be deemed to be the fair market
price for the Gas not taken, as agreed to by the parties, minus an
amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Contract Price.
[To reach a valid sales price, the parties can resort to some index --
such as closing prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange or spot
prices published in newsletters.]
In the event Buyer is not able to find replacement gas for the
quantity of Gas within the Contract Quantity not delivered by Seller,
the Replacement Price shall be deemed to be the fair market price for
the Gas not delivered, as agreed to by the parties, plus an amount
equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Contract Price.
[As was the case with the Sales Price determination, it is left to the
buyers to identify an index for the Replacement Price determination.]

10A.3 If by failing to receive or deliver quantities equal to the
Contract Quantity or by failing to confirm Scheduled quantities,
either party hereto creates an imbalance on a Transporter, such party
shall be solely liable for correcting such imbalance(s), so long as
the parties cooperate to correct the imbalance as provided in Section
10.1. If any such imbalance is not corrected, and charges or penalties
are assessed by a Transporter, the party which caused such imbalance
shall be responsible for any and all such charges or penalties.

Alternative B: independent action

     The second alternative for failure to perform makes each party
primarily responsible for finding a suitable commercial outlet in the
event of non-performance by the other party. In so doing, it
establishes the time limits of that substitute outlet and restricts
the damages that can be collected in the event of non-performance.

ARTICLE X

Failure to Perform
[The following section requires each party to find alternative supply
or buyers in the event of non-performance by the other party, and it
permits the alternative arrangement to continue until the end of the
month it which it was entered into.]
10B.1 If for any reason other than an event of force majeure either
party fails, in whole or in part, to perform its respective obligation
to deliver or take Gas under this Agreement, the other party shall use
its best efforts, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, to
mitigate the effect of such failure, which includes attempting to
secure an alternate interruptible supply, or interruptible market, as
the case may be, which allows the defaulting party to resume its
obligation when the defaulting party becomes capable of doing so. If
in so doing, Buyer secures an alternate source of supply and Seller
subsequently regains its ability to deliver Scheduled volumes, Buyer
shall not be required to accept Gas, and Buyer may, without prejudice
to its rights to collect damages from the Seller in accordance with
Section 10B.2 hereof, through the last day of the month in which
Seller's failure to deliver Gas occurs, rely upon the alternate supply
arrangements. If in acting to mitigate its damages Seller secures
alternate markets therefor and Buyer subsequently regains its ability
to accept delivery of Scheduled volumes, Seller shall not be required
to deliver the volumes that the Buyer was previously unable to accept
for delivery, and, Seller may, without prejudice to its rights to
collect damages from the Buyer in accordance with Section 10B.3
hereof, through the last day of the month in which Buyer's failure to
take Gas occurs, continue to deliver to the alternate markets the
nominated volumes of gas that it would have otherwise have been
obligated to deliver hereunder.

[The following section details and limits the damages to which a party
is entitled in the event of non-performance by the other party.]
10B.2 If Seller fails, in whole or in part, to Schedule volumes or to
make Scheduled volumes available to Buyer in accordance with this
Agreement and such failure is not excused by an event of force majeure
or some other provision of the Agreement, the Buyer's right to recover
damages for such failure shall be limited to the following:

(1) If Buyer obtains alternate supplies of Gas, a daily amount equal
to (a) the shortfall in delivery from the Scheduled amount ("Delivery
Shortfall") times the difference between (b) the Contract Price and,
(c) the price Buyer paid for the Gas obtained from an alternate
source. In no event, however, shall the amount of such damages exceed
the amount that would have been payable by the Buyer had the Seller
delivered the Scheduled volumes.

(2) If Buyer does not obtain alternate supplies of Gas, a daily amount
equal to the Seller's Delivery Shortfall times the Contract Price.
Seller agrees to pay Buyer any damages to which Buyer is entitled
hereunder on or before the 15th day after the Seller receives a
written calculation of the amount of such damages from the Buyer.
10B.3 If Buyer fails to Schedule volumes or to take on any day all or
any part of the volumes Scheduled by Buyer hereunder and such failure
is not excused by an event of force majeure or some other provision of
this Agreement, the Seller's right to recover damages for such failure
shall be limited to the following:

(1) If the Seller is able to obtain alternate markets for the Gas the
Buyer fails to take, a daily amount equal to the difference between
(a) the Scheduled volumes for such day and (b) the volumes taken on
such day by the Buyer ("Take Shortfall") times the difference between
(i) the price received by the Seller from the alternate buyer(s) and
(ii) the Contract Price.

(2) If the Seller is not able to obtain alternate markets for the Gas
the Buyer fails to take, a daily amount equal to the Take Shortfall on
such days times the Contract Price. Buyer agrees to pay Seller any
damages to which Seller is entitled in accordance with the above
provisions on or before the 15th day after the Buyer receives a
written calculation of the amount of such damages from the Seller.

was developed to govern transactions incorporating the exchange of
futures for physicals, were covered in article in the previous GAS
TRANSACTIONS REPORT (4/8 GTR, p. 3). Copies of the standard EFP
agreement can be obtained by calling Shelley Hurley, vice president

Active aftermarket and capacity glut predicted

      Unseasonably mild weather in the Northeast has created a lull
in the capacity market after a busy bid week, and sources are
predicting an active aftermarket for capacity in November if the
mild weather keeps up.
      Replacement shippers held about 10 billion cfd in released firm
capacity on Oct. 28, down about 1.5 billion cfd from Sept. 28.
Storage capacity releases were done on CNG Transmission and Texas
Eastern Transmission.
      The aftermarket for capacity should be active now that
pipelines aren't discounting transportation as deeply and if the
weather stays mild, said Ben Hadden with Appalachian Gas Sales.
      He said there have been more release deals done this bid week
than during prior bid weeks, partly because bottlenecks haven't
shown up yet on the long-haul pipelines out of the Gulf Coast. In
past years capacity restraints usually had caused some problems
by now, but pipelines aren't anticipating allocating supply in the
near future, he added.
      "The market is pretty dead right now," said an official with a
Northeastern distributor. But look out if the weather suddenly
turns cold, he said. "If the weather all of a sudden heads south,
markets in the Northeast will catch fire."
      The distributor official said his company held on to its
Tennessee capacity in case the weather turns and its Texas Eastern
capacity so far wasn't selling very well.
      He said there is no demand on CNG, but demand on Columbia Gas
picked up a bit with its recallable capacity going for about a 5
cents/mcf daily demand rate. On Columbia Gulf, the official said he
got a 9 cents/mcf rate for capacity to Leach, Ky.
      The Lebanon, Ohio, interconnect was "really hot" during bid
week for gas sales and capacity releases, according to Hadden.
      On Texas Gas Transmission, Dayton Power & Light released
capacity in about 13 November release deals into Lebanon for daily
demand rates ranging from 5 cents/mcf to CMS Gas Marketing to
17.5 cents/mcf to Tenneco Gas Marketing.
      Term deals for the winter and beyond and storage releases are
starting to pop up on electronic bulletin boards. On CNG, the
Harriman Utility Board released 26 million cf of various storage
capacity on the pipeline to CNG Gas Services for an injection rate of
2.6 cents/mcf and a withdrawal rate of 2.8 cents/mcf. Boston Gas
picked up storage capacity on Texas Eastern from Dartmouth Power
and Bristol & Warren.
      Texas-Ohio Gas picked up about 16 million cf from Yankee Gas
in three term deals on Texas Eastern for about a 13 cents/mcf daily
demand rate in the field and a 21 cents/mcf rate into zone three.
All three deals run through March 1995.
      One source said if shippers start pulling the high-priced gas
they bought last April out of Northeastern storage there will
probably be plenty of capacity coming out of the Gulf Coast access
areas in November.
      Another source said he also expects an active aftermarket as
long as the weather stays mild. He said he's been getting a lot of
calls from customers willing to pay maximum rate into the
Northeast.
      Recallable deals on Tennessee into zone five were going for a
daily demand rate in the low-30 cents/mcf range, according to the
source.

Northern Border plans expansion into Indiana

      Northern Border Pipeline is seeking customers for a proposed
capacity expansion of its existing system and a pipeline extension
into Northern Indiana.
      The proposed capacity expansion involves increasing receipt
capacity by at least 60 million cfd between the Monchy receipt
point at the U.S./Canadian border and the Glen Ullin, N.D., receipt
point on the 42-inch system.
      The 30-inch system between Ventura and Harper, Iowa, is
marked for a 260 million cfd capacity expansion. Both expansions
will be accomplished through the addition of compression.
      The proposed extension into Northern Indiana involves three
legs that start with 163 miles of 30-inch pipeline from Harper,
Iowa, to Northern Illinois Gas' (NIGas) Troy Grove storage field in
Illinois.
      Along this segment, Northern Border proposes to connect with
Interstate Power at Prophetstown, Ill. The pipeline plans 2,200 hp
of compression for this leg with a maximum capacity of 260 million
cfd.
      From Troy Grove, Northern Border plans to build 69 miles of
26-inch pipeline without compression to Manhattan, Ill., where it
will connect with Peoples Gas Light & Coke in the area of Joliet, Ill.
Maximum capacity on this leg will also be 260 million cfd.
      The proposed extension then continues eastward 35 miles with
20-inch pipe into Northern Indiana to connect with Northern
Indiana Public Service (NIPSCO) at Griffith, Ind. Maximum capacity
on this segment will be 175 million cfd.
      Northern Border has not sought FERC approval for the project
yet. The pipeline has targeted Nov. 1, 1997, as the in-service date
for the expansion. The window for bidding on this potential
capacity opened Oct. 24 and will close Nov. 18, 1994. Northern
Border will do a final allocation of bids for the capacity and post
them on its electronic bulletin board by Dec. 16, 1994.
      For more information about the expansion, contact Bill Fonda
with Northern Border at 402-398-7756.

Pipelines go easy on scheduled November maintenance

      Few disruptions in capacity are expected during November as
scheduled maintenance continues to remain light on pipelines
across the United States.
      Starting Nov. 2, ANR Pipeline will be lowering a line at a stream
crossing upstream of the Eakley compressor station. The
maintenance work is scheduled to last about three days. Receipt
points in line segments SW2H, SW2I and SW2J will be shut in
during the work.
      On Oct. 31, Tennessee Gas Pipeline was at capacity through
station 219 in Mercer, Pa., and near capacity on the Sullivan City
lateral in Hidalgo, Texas. The pipeline said it may restrict services
starting Nov. 2.
      Texas Eastern Transmission was at capacity for interruptible
transportation on the 24-inch system through station 16 at Berne,
Ohio, and into the suction of Berne, Ohio, from the 24-inch system
on Nov. 1. The Wilcox, Willow Springs and Monroe laterals were also
at capacity.
      On Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, flow through station 40 at
Sour Lake, Texas, was being allocated on Nov. 1. Also on Transco,
interruptible capacity was limited to 100 million cfd from station
180 in Virginia eastward.

Market

      A marketer in New England said Monday about gas prices, "I
think they'll come off a little bit." And a buyer in Houston
expected much the same, pointing to this week's December futures
close at almost a nickel off last week.
      In other trading, an eastern LDC was fishing for baseload gas
into Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at station 65 at $1.74 but
couldn't find any baseload sellers under $1.78. Swing sellers were
offering deals at $1.72.
      At Parkway, Ontario, into the Union Gas system, buyers wanted
prices in the mid-$1.90s yesterday, while sellers wanted $2.05-15
for their gas.
      A West Coast marketer bought some Permian gas on El Paso at
$1.62, a healthy jump from the mid- to high-$1.50s at the end of
last week. He thought the price increase, which some sources said
had reached $1.68 by late yesterday afternoon, might be in
anticipation of some colder weather moving down from the
Northwest. He was hoping to sell it in the mid-$1.60s.
      Prices at AECO-C ranged from C$1.70-$1.80/gj for day-to-day
trading, and at Sumas into Northwest and at Kingsgate into PGT
prices hovered around $1.50.

Futures

      December futures will find technical support at around $1.93,
with short covering expecting at that level, said an analyst.
However, the contract is expected to find its ceiling at $1.87 and
then trade lower.

Storage

      With withdrawal season right around the corner, net injections
into storage jumped to 8.6 billion cfd, more than double the
previous week's, according to the American Gas Assn.'s (AGA)
survey for the week ending Oct. 21.
      This turnaround at the end of the injection season pushed
working gas in storage to 3,081 billion cf, after passing 3 trillion cf
the previous week, according to AGA's survey. Storage facilities
nationwide are now 96% full, using AGA's estimated full level of
3,206 billion cf.
      Sources said the big increase in injections was probably due to
storage users trying to top off their storage capacity in the last few
weeks of injection season.
      Net injections were 60 billion cf, up 36 billion cf, or 5.1 billion
cfd, from last week's estimate.
      Storage facilities in the east hit 97% full, compared to 95% the
preceding week. The producing region appears to have completed its
injections, with net injections of only 1 billion cf.

WISCONSIN PSC MODIFIES EXISTING ELECTRIC SERVICE
EXTENSION RULES BY EXTENDING THE REFUND PERIOD

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (commission) has
decided to modify its current set of electric service
extension rules to lessen the financial impact upon customers
who wish to extend service to previously undeveloped areas.
The Commission indicated that a wholesale change in the
current rules was not appropriate because it would likely
contribute to urban sprawl, but it was reasonable to extend
the refund period for those customers.

Extension rules determine who pays for the cost incurred in
extending electric utility service to a previously unserved
area. When a customer applies for an extension with a utility
where existing distribution lines are far from the dwelling,
the utility has to extend a distribution line all the way in
to the new location. The customer is responsible for the cost
of the distribution line in advance.

Under the current extension rules the customer is entitled to
a small credit based on the depreciated cost of the
distribution system. The customer is also eligible for
refunds when other customers attach to the same distribution
line that he or she paid for.

CHEVRON GETS GO-AHEAD TO EXPLORE
1.77-MILLION-ACRE TRACT IN PERU

Chevron Overseas Petroleum (Peru) Limited has signed a license
contract with PeruPetro S.A. to explore more than 1.77 million
acres on Block 52 in the Peruvian highlands.

Chevron's exploration program will include a seismic program
and other geologic studies, and is anticipated to start
immediately. Following acquisition and interpretation of the
geologic and seismic data, determinations regarding drilling
will be made.

Block 52 is located 250 miles east of the capital city of
Lima and is adjacent to the giant Camisea gas/condensate
discoveries. It comprises 718,928 hectares (more than 1.77
million acres), and has had no previous exploration activity.

"We are delighted to be returning to Peru," said Richard
Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum, "and we are
eager to begin exploration in such an exciting area. We feel
Block 52 offers excellent potential due to its geologic
similarities with and geographic proximity to the prolific
Camisea fields," he added.

Chevron's history in Peru dates back to the 1930s when the
company conducted geological exploration in the foothills of
the Andes. In addition, Chevron operated a refinery in
Conchan, Peru, until 1972.

The Peruvian government's newly revised hydrocarbon laws and
noted that they have enhanced the appeal of operating in Peru
by offering favorable terms and encouraging foreign investment
in the country.

MITCHELL'S REMAINING INTEREST IN THE WOODLANDS
COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK FOR $17 MILLION

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., The Woodlands, TX, has
sold its remaining 50 percent interest in The Woodlands
Communications Network to TCI Communications, Inc., for $17
million, making TCI Communications the sole owner.

This business was started by Mitchell to serve The Woodlands
when it opened in October 1974 and provides cable television,
home security and advertising services. In April 1987,
Mitchell sold a. half interest to United Artists Cable.  Tele-
Communications, Inc. (TCI) acquired United Artists' cable
systems in 1991, including its half interest in The Woodlands
Communications Network.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer George P. Mitchell said
the sale of the remaining interest in The Woodlands
Communications Network is part of the company's continuing
efforts to enhance profitability by selling non-core assets,
including those that have a greater value to others. The
company has sold more than $200 million in assets during the


last 18 months, Mitchell added.

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. is among the nation's
largest independent producers of natural gas and natural gas
liquids. The company, through its subsidiary, The Woodlands
Corporation, also is the developer of a 25,000-acre
master-planned community 27 miles north of Houston. Mitchell's
shares are traded on the New York and Pacific stock exchanges
under the symbols MND A (voting) and MND B (non-voting).

SPECIAL CHARGES REDUCE CHEVRON'S THIRD QUARTER NET INCOME
TO $282 ON OPERATING EARNINGS OF $504 MILLION UP 24 PERCENT

Chevron Corporation has reported that special charges reduced
third quarter net income 34 percent to $282 million, or $.44
per share, from $425 million ($.65 per share) reported for the
third quarter of 1994.

Excluding special charges, 1995 third quarter results were
$504 million, a 24 percent increase from adjusted earnings of
$407 million for the prior year quarter. Special charges
totaled $222 million and included a $168 million provision
related to the company's recently announced decision to
dispose of its real estate development operations.

Commenting on third quarter results, Chairman and CEO Ken
Derr said, "We're pleased to report another quarter with
operating profit that exceeded half a billion dollars.
Despite flat crude oil and lower natural gas prices compared
with the third quarter of last year, our operating earnings
increased' nearly $100 million, reflecting ongoing strength
in our chemicals and international upstream businesses and our
continued emphasis on reducing costs."

Derr continued, "Our increased profitability this year
translates to a return on capital employed, adjusted for
special items, of 10.2 percent for the 12 months ended Sept.
30. This compares with a return of 8.6 percent for the
calendar year 1994, and demonstrates good progress toward our
12.0 percent goal."

Adjusted for special items, earnings for the first nine
months of 1995 were $1.511 billion, up 38 percent from $1.093
billion for the 1994 nine months. Net income for the 1995
nine months was $1.348 billion, or $2.07 per share, including
special charges totaling $163 million; net income for the
comparable prior year period was $1.070 billion, or $1.64 per
share, and included $23 million of special charges.

"We have a major turnaround currently under way at our
Richmond, Calif., refinery," said Derr. The refinery is
expected to be down for about six weeks to prepare for the
introduction of California-mandated reformulated gasolines
early next year. When the turnaround is complete, we will be
positioned to be the largest producer of these new gasolines.
However, the shutdown will have an effect on our fourth
quarter operations."

Total revenues in the third quarter were $9.3 billion, down 2
percent from $9.5 billion in the year earlier quarter. Total
revenues for the first nine months of 1995 were $27.9
billion, a 5 percent increase from $26.6 billion reported for
the 1994 nine-month period.

Included in third quarter net income were foreign exchange
losses of $26 million in 1995 and $30 million in 1994. For the
first nine months, foreign exchange losses were $20 million
in 1995 and $51 million in 1994.

U.S. exploration and production third quarter net earnings
were $131 million compared with $63 million in the 1994 third
quarter. However, current quarter earnings included a net
benefit of $19 million from special items, whereas 1994
earnings were reduced $61 million for environmental
remediation and litigation provisions. In the 1995 quarter, a
$27 million gain resulting from a refund of federal offshore
lease costs was partially offset by environmental remediation
provisions.

Excluding special items in both quarters, 1995 earnings of
$112 million declined from year-ago earnings of $124 million,
primarily because of lower production volumes and lower
natural gas prices. The company's average U.S. liquids
realization of $14.91 per barrel was little changed from the
$15.03 realized in last year's third quarter; however,
average natural gas realizations of $1.40 per thousand cubic
feet in the 1995 third quarter were down 14 percent from
$1.62 last year. Net liquids production declined to 346,000
barrels per day from 371,000, and net natural gas production
volumes of 1.8 billion cubic feet per day were down 10 percent
from 2.0 billion in last year's third quarter. The lower
production levels were due to normal field declines and a
natural gas field unitization adjustment.

Depreciation expense declined in line with lower production;
exploration expense also declined due to lower well
write-offs.

International exploration and production third quarter net
earnings were $140 million compared with $131 million in the
1994 third quarter. The 1995 quarter included special charges
of $22 million for prior year tax adjustments, mostly due to
a statutory tax rate increase in Australia.

Earnings benefited from higher crude oil sales volumes, due
to the timing of vessel loadings, and a lower effective income
tax rate due to the earnings mix. Crude oil and natural gas
realizations were about flat with the prior year quarter.
Exploration expenses increased due to higher well write-offs.
International net liquids production volumes increased
slightly to 644,000 barrels per day from 640,000 in the 1994
third quarter. Net natural gas production volumes declined
about 6 percent, primarily in Canada, to 539 million cubic
feet per day.

U.S. refining and marketing net earnings were $98 million
compared with a loss of $110 million in the year-ago quarter;
however, when special charges in both periods for
environmental remediation are excluded, earnings were
basically flat at $109 million for the current year quarter
and $108 million for the 1994 quarter.

Refined product sales margins improved in the 1995 quarter on
slightly higher prices. Sales volumes declined 13 percent to
1.2 million barrels per day, as a result of the sales of the
company's Philadelphia refinery in August 1994 and Port
Arthur, Texas, refinery in February 1995. The volume decline
occurred in lower margin unbranded bulk sales; branded
gasoline sales through the company's marketing system
increased 2 percent.

International refining and marketing net earnings declined
slightly to $53 million from $55 million because of special
charges of $15 million in the 1995 third quarter related to
restructurings in certain Caltex areas and in the company's
United Kingdom operations.

Excluding the special charges, earnings increased $13 million
as improved operations in Canada and the United Kingdom more
than offset a decline in Caltex earnings, where sales margins
remain depressed in some of that affiliate's operating areas.
International sales volumes decreased 4 percent to 894,000
barrels per day, largely due to declines in U.K. marketing
sales and in the company's international trading operations.
Caltex sales volumes decreased 1 percent.

Chemicals net earnings increased to $127 million in the 1995
third quarter from $68 million in the comparable 1994 quarter.
Adjusting for special charges in both periods, mostly
environmentally related, earnings of $148 million in the 1995
third quarter were more than double the $72 million earned in
the third quarter of 1994.

The higher 1995 earnings reflect higher product prices and
sales volumes compared with the prior year quarter, consistent
with the improved state of the petrochemicals industry.
However, prices for the company's major products began to
soften in the third quarter, and results declined from the
record $175 million earned in the second quarter. Although
still much stronger than a year ago, prices have weakened for
major products such as styrene and polyethylene.

Corporate and other net charges were $277 million in the
current year quarter compared with income of $212 million in
the 1994 third quarter. Both quarter's results were distorted
by special items. The 1995 quarter included special charges
totaling $172 million, almost all related to the write-down of
the company's investment in the real estate development
business. Results in the 1994 quarter included the reversal of
$301 million of previously established tax and related
interest reserves resulting from a global settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service covering several open tax years.

Excluding the special items in both periods, corporate and
other charges were $105 million in the 1995 third quarter and
$89 million in the year-ago quarter. The 1995 increase was due
to consolidating income tax adjustments.

Capital and exploratory expenditures, including the company's
share of affiliate expenditures, were $1.144 billion in the
third quarter, compared with $1.042 billion spent in last
year's third quarter. Total expenditures for the first nine
months of 1995 were $3.292 billion, up 4 percent from $3.174
billion spent in the same period in 1994.

MITCHELL REPORTS LOWER THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., The Woodlands, TX,
has reported that its net earnings for the three months ended
Oct. 31, 1995, declined to $11.3 million, or 21 cents a share,
from $15 million, or 28 cents a share, in the same period a
year earlier.

Excluding unusual gains and charges in both years, earnings
were $15 million, versus $10.6 million in the prior-year
period. Current-quarter results were adversely affected by
several factors: significantly lower natural gas prices in
North Texas due to the termination of the premium-priced gas
sales contract covering this production in July 1995; weak
spot market prices; a 23-day curtailment in October of gas
and natural gas liquids production in North Texas resulting
from maintenance on the interstate pipeline that transports
Mitchell's gas from this area to Midwest markets; and a
47-day shutdown of the company's one-third-owned MTBE gasoline
additive plant to increase capacity. These factors were more
than offset by profits totaling $19.4 million ($12.6 million
after tax)

Real estate operating earnings increased to $28.9 million,
from $6.3 million during the prior year's third quarter. Much
of the improvement results from the previously discussed $19.4
million cable TV gain. Current-period earnings also
benefitted from an increase in residential lot sales in The
Woodlands at prices 8 percent higher per square foot than
those realized in the prior-year period, improved occupancy
at The Woodlands Executive Conference Center and Resort, and
earnings from The Woodlands Mall, which opened in October
1994.

During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the
company had net earnings of $13.6 million, or 26 cents per
share, compared with $36.8 million, or 70 cents per share, in
the same period last year. Excluding unusual items in both
years, earnings during the current period were $41.1 million,
versus $28.1 million during the prior-year period.
Year-to-date results benefitted from higher natural gas
liquids margins, profits from the MTBE plant, the gain from
the cable system sale, increased earnings from residential and
commercial activities in The Woodlands and lower staff and
interest expenses. These factors were partially offset by
lower gas prices resulting from the buyout of the North Texas
gas sales contract and weak spot market prices.

Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. is a large independent
energy producer and through its subsidiary, The Woodlands
Corporation, is the developer of a 25,000-acre master-planned
community located 27 miles north of downtown Houston. Its
shares are listed on the Now York and Pacific stock exchanges
under the symbols MND A (voting) and MND B (non-voting).

MURPHY OIL REORTS ON THIRD QUARTER

Murphy Oil's president and CEO, Claiborne P.  Deming,
announced today that net income for the third quarter of 1995
totaled $7.6 million, $.17 a share, compared to $37.3 million,
$.83 a share, earned in the third quarter a year ago.  The
current quarter included a bensfit of $8.1 million, $.18 a
share, resulting from settlement of tax matters in the U.S.
and U.K., while the third quarter of 1994 included a benefit
of $13.9 million, $.31 a share, from settlement of a U.S.
Department of Energ Proposed Remedial Order. Net cash from
operating activities excluding changes in noncash working
capital items totaled $84.2 million in the third quarter of
1995, down six percent from a year ago.

In commenting on the results for the current quarter, Mr.
Deming said, "Excluding the unusual item, operating results
reflected a loss of $.5 million that included a $13.6 million
after-tax charge for a previously announced unsuccessful well
in Mobile Block 908. In total, exploration and production
operations lost $5 million in the third quarter of 1995
compared to earning $9.8 million a year ago.

In addition to the Mobile Block 908 well, the current quarter
was adversely affected by generally lower crude oil sales
prices, lower U.S. and Canadian natural gas sales prices, and
an increase in international exploration activity. Partial
offsets were provided by a 12-percent increase in crude oil
and gas liquids production and a 10-percent increase in
natural gas production. Posted price for West Texas
Intermediate crude oil fluctuated between $15.00 a barrel and
$17.25 a barrel in the third quarter of 1995, and closed the
quarter at $15.75.

"Barnings from our worldwide downstream segment totaled $4.2
million in the current quarter compared to $11.9 million a
year ago. U.S. operations accounted for most of the decline as
a result of lower unit margins and a decline in salso of
refined products.

"Earnings from farm, timber, and real estate totaled $1.3
million, a decreases of 58 percent compared to the third
quarter of 1994. Timber operations accounted for most of the
decline."

Exploration and production operations in the U.S., which
included the $13.6 million after-tax charge for the Mobile
Block 908 well, lost $8.9 million compared to earning $.7
million in the third quarter of 1994. Operations in Canada
earned $6.3 million in the current quarter, up from $6.2
million a year ago, and U.K. operations earned $.9 million
compared to $1 million.

Injection program to up yield at Norway's Snorre field

     Norway's Petroleum Directorate says estimated total reserves from the
Snorre field in that country's sector of the North Sea could soon be
upgraded by 20% to 1 billion barrels.
     That's possible because of a pilot project involving the alternate
injection of water and natural gas to increase exploitation yields.
     The field, discovered in 1979, is in blocks 34/4 and 34/7 about 125
miles west of the coastal community of Floro. Norway's Saga Petroleum is
operator of the field -- with Esso Norway as co-operation partner -- for
Deminex, Idemitsu, Norsk Hydro, Elf Petroleum Norge, Amerada Hess,
Enterprise Oil and DNO.
     The Snorre project is one of the most challenging of its kind. It is in
deep water, and the reservoir is extensive and complex. Exploration
drilling delineated the field during most of the 1980s, but sustained low oil
prices added to slow development.
     Original estimates put Snorre recoverable reserves at 77 million barrels
of oil, 247 bcf of gas and 1.8 bcf of natural gas liquids, with a field life
expectancy of 20-25 years. At its peak, original estimates were that field's
liquid output would average 190,000 b/d.
     Located in 985' of water, the field is the first truly deepwater
development in the North Sea. It consists of the largest tension leg
platform (TLP) yet installed, with 40 well slots, and a large, 20-well slot,
remote subsea production system. Wells drilled from the TLP went on
production in August 1992, more than a month ahead of schedule and
under the original budget.
     The field, whose oil-bearing sandstone reservoir layers are found in two
formations (Statfjord and Lunde, averaging 7,500'-8,500' below the ocean
bottom), with pay ranging from nearly 2,790' to 330' in thickness, will be
developed in two stages. The operations in Phase 1 will account for all the
recoverable reserves in the Statfjord formation and some 30% of the
estimated recoverable reserves from the Lunde formation. The decision on
Phase 2 development will be based on experience with Phase 1 production
but likely will involve either relocation of the TLP to the northern part of
the field or installation of two new subsea production systems.
     Tests of wells drilled from the TLP to the Lunde formation have proven
Snorre to be richer than first believed. Based on this, the field's life
expectancy has been extended beyond 2015. Snorre production is about
120,000 b/d currently.
     Oil and gas production is partially processed on the Snorre TLP and
then exported in two 17-mile pipelines to the Statfjord A platform, where
the final processing takes place. The processed oil is then loaded into
tankers through the Statfjord buoy loading system, while the gas is
transported to shore through a Statpipe system.
     However, field output from Snorre likely will not be increased for some
time since the Statfjord platform can handle only 140,000 b/d from Snorre.
     Production from the Snorre reservoirs requires a concept calling for
nearly 100 wells, half of which will be used for water injection and natural
gas reinjection.
     The Snorre subsea production system is the world's largest.  The
system's wells are drilled from a floating drilling unit. The system has a
double set of well slots (10 x 10). The inner row of wells is intended to be
drilled first. They will come on stream one by one. The system's manifold
design allows each well slot to be used for either production or injection
purposes. The 10 outer wells become operational when the inner wells
have ceased production and have been plugged. The 10 x 10 arrangement
allows the manifold and control system, as well as all pipelines and subsea
trees, to be used twice, helping to cut costs beyond those for drilling and
completion.
     Large amounts of electricity are required on the TLP for drilling
operations, water injection and processing. The platform has its own
power station consisting of four gas-powered generators giving a total
capacity of 60 MW.
     Water, pumped into the reservoir to raise formation pressure and
thereby increase production, is pumped from the sea and filtered in the
TLP's water injection system before it reaches the reservoir.
     In addition to 20 wells drilled for oil production, 40 wells will be
drilled from the Snorre TLP, most of the remaining well slots being used
for injection wells.
     To ensure optimum exploitation of the reservoir, the wells will be
drilled horizontally away from both the TLP and the subsea production
system. On the average, wells will be drilled some 1.5 miles below the
seabed, and their horizontal distance from the platform may be as much as
2.5 miles. Total measured depth of wells could reach nearly four miles.

DOE funds seven reservoir projects

     DOE hopes a new initiative will result in more effective production
methods that could keep many aged U.S. oil fields in operation,
particularly for independent producers.
     Under the initiative, DOE has made more than $5 million available to
six leading petroleum-oriented universities and one state geological survey
to help develop more accurate methods for depicting the geological
makeup of oil and gas reservoirs.
     The seven projects were selected during DOE's 1993 petroleum
geoscience competition. Some 63 proposals were received in response to a
DOE solicitation issued last October.
     In total, the seven projects will cost more than $8 million, with the
additional $3 million to be funded by the winning teams. In most cases,
says DOE, the sponsors will team with major and independent producers,
service companies and oilfield consultants to carry out the work.
     All of the projects will apply advanced geoscience and reservoir
engineering concepts to provide operators with a better picture of a
reservoir's characteristics. In some cases, says DOE, the projects will result
in smaller independent producers having access to new and sophisticated
techniques that have been available to and used by major producers but
have not yet trickled down to the independent sector.
     The selected projects, whose quoted costs are estimates and may
change during negotiations, will take place during a three-year period, and
work will be monitored by DOE's Bartlesville, Okla., Project Office.
     The seven selected projects -- with contacts for companies interested in
participating -- are:

IPAA reports drilling cost uptick in 1992

     The Independent Petroleum Assn. of America says domestic oil and gas
wells are getting deeper, and operators are returning to existing wells with
improved recovery technology.
     Yet, in 1992, this trend failed to reflect in higher drilling costs. To the
contrary, the IPAA report observes that the average cost-per-well last year
exhibited a decline of nearly 4%.
     The report adds that much of this decline was precipitated by heavy
discounting by service and supply companies .
     Overall, however, the cost of drilling and completing domestic wells
last year increased by slightly more than 1% from 1991, because wells on
average are deeper than ever.
     Scott Espenshade, who prepared the report, says record low drilling in
1992 forced service and supply companies to offer discounts in order to
get more business. He added that the industry should expect to see such
deep discounts through the remainder of 1993.
     He said an estimate of an average dollar amount for drilling costs
would not prove valid, since the cost varies greatly from well to well.
Instead, the report uses 1989 data to provide a median for comparison for
the 1992 figures.
     Since 1989, the report observes, the cost-per-foot drilling average has
fallen by more than 6% and the cost per well has risen almost 2%. This
should be good news to independents, it adds, since the per-well rise is
modest while wells continue to be drilled deeper.
     Since 1989, U.S. well depth has increased an average of 12%,
Espenshade writes. One cause of this, he adds, is that producers are
looking at deeper pay zones. Also, they are going back to old wells with
improved recovery technology.
     Purchased items accounted for 69% of the cost of drilling and
equipping wells in 1992. And the remaining 31% involved payments to
drilling contractors. This portion of the drilling cost has fallen by about
20% from 1990 levels, IPAA notes. The decline was anticipated because
the industry's average rig count for 1992 -- 721 -- was an all-time low.
     Although overall drilling costs have increased slightly so far in 1993,
says Gene Ames, IPAA chairman, "there is no better time to drill for
natural gas and oil here at home with drilling costs down and the use of
advanced technology on the upswing."
     The drilling cost report will be published quarterly, says Espenshade.
He says he hopes the quarterly report will be beneficial to independents.
Instead of basing their findings on information gathered on a "typical"
U.S. well, he noted, future reports will be broken down by region to reflect
the differences between drilling areas.
     Producers also can take heart from a report just released by Houston-
based Baker Hughes Inc., which estimated the average rig count for 1993
will be about 760 working units.

Two Kern fields revise reserves downward

     Downward additions outnumber by a margin of 2-to-1 upward
additions to estimated reserves in four of California's Kern County oil
fields, where improved recovery projects play a role in production.
     The state Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources Div. in its annual look at
how much recoverable oil is left in the state's fields singles out the Cymric
and Yowlumne fields for upward revisions totaling 24 million barrels;
however, the gains are not enough to make up for downward revisions
totaling 55 million barrels in the McKittrick and Poso Creek fields.
     The Cymric field's Reef Ridge-Antelope pool in the Welport area of the
field is credited with addition of 15.2 million barrels, boosting estimated
reserves to 78.7 million barrels as of the first of this year. Cumulative
production is 191.4 million barrels. Production last year averaged 2,000
b/d. In January, production from 82 wells was 2,750 b/d. Steam plays an
important role here, with Chevron Corp. injecting about 7,000 b/d in cyclic
steaming of some 50 wells.
     The Yowlumne field's Stevens pay picked up 8.8 million barrels,
boosting estimated reserves to 19.1 million barrels. Cumulative production
is 95.9 million barrels. Fifty-six Stevens wells were on line in January,
producing 6,720 b/d. Waterflooding plays an important role at Yowlumne.
Arco Oil & Gas Co., the field operator, puts away 40,000 b/d in 29
injection wells.
     On the debit side, the main area of the McKittrick field was
downgraded 34.5 million barrels, reducing estimated reserves to 4.2
million barrels. In January, 350 wells produced 2,900 b/d. Steamflooding
has been reduced to a minor role in the field, which was on production as
early as 1896 with actual discovery date unknown. In January, only four
injectors were active, with steam injection at a rate of 511 b/d. One
hundred nineteen injection wells were shut in.
     The Poso Creek field, a 1920 discovery, took hits in the Premier area,
where reserves dropped 15.5 million barrels, reducing year-end estimated
reserves to 2 million barrels; and the McVan area, where the drop was 5
million barrels, leaving estimated reserves of 300,000 barrels. Cumulative
production from Premier is 72.5 million barrels. In January, 62 wells
produced 300 b/d. Steamflooding was down to 12 injectors and a rate of
540 b/d with 10 injection wells shut in. At McVan, cumulative production
is 7.2 million barrels. In January, 53 wells produced 146 b/d. Five
steamflood injection wells were shut in.

'92 Okla. oil yield down; gas up slightly

     Oil production in Oklahoma during 1992 declined 5.6% from 1991
totals, while natural gas production increased by 1.4%, says a recent report
from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
     Crude oil and condensate production totaled 101.8 million barrels,
down 6 million barrels from 1991's 107.8 million barrels. Daily average
production was 278,234 barrels, compared with 295,457 b/d in 1991.
     Natural and casinghead gas production last year totaled 1.962 tcf,
compared with 1.935 tcf a year earlier. Daily average production was
5.362 bcf compared with 5.302 bcf/d a year earlier.
     Monthly production figures indicate the decline continued into early
1993, the report notes. For February 1993, oil production totaled 7,006,551
barrels of crude oil and condensate for a daily average of 250,234 barrels.
This was an 8.9% decline from that reported for February 1992.
     Natural gas production also showed a dip for February, with a total of
100.4 bcf, for a daily average of nearly 3.6 bcf. This was a 7.7% decline
from February 1992 figures.
     Oklahoma oil production has declined annually from 1984 production
of 168.6 million barrels. Oil production in 1992 was the state's lowest
since 1919 when production totaled 86.9 million barrels.
     The average price paid for Oklahoma oil in 1992 was $18.99/barrel,
compared with an average price of $19.72 in 1991. The average price for
Oklahoma natural gas was $1.63/mcf, compared with $1.57/mcf a year
earlier.
     Of Oklahoma's 77 counties, 66 produced oil and 69 produced gas in
1992. Five counties produced neither during the year.
     Carter County, in Southcentral Oklahoma, led in oil production with
13.6 million barrels. Latimer County in Southeastern Oklahoma, led in
natural gas production with 212.8 bcf.

     Improving Matrix Acidizing with Nitrogen and Heat In Situ
Generation, by C.N. Khalil and Z. de Almeida of Petroleo Brasiliero SA.
From the 4th SPE, Et Al, Latin American Petroleum Engineering
Conference, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Oct. 14-19, 1990:
     In matrix acidizing operations in sandstone formations, special care
must be taken to prevent the formation of undesirable precipitates
generated by secondary reactions and by cooling of the surrounding
wellbore. The fast and thorough recovery of the spent acid fluid is
desirable. Based on studies conducted at the Petrobras R&D Center, a
chemical process that uses a mixture of saturated solutions of nitrogenated
salts to simultaneously generate nitrogen and heat was applied. The
intercalated cushions of acid fluid and a mixture of the above solutions
results in the in situ generation of nitrogen and heat. The increase in
formation temperature associated with the generation of gas increases the
radial penetration of the acid fluid, at the same time prevents the formation
of insoluble compounds and water blockage, and in general  eases the
recovery of the spent fluid (Abstract No. 545283).

New IOR patents

     S.F. Chien, C.L. Redus and P.L. Sigwardt of Texaco Development
Corp. have patented a method of determining flowline steam quality which
uses flow restriction devices with water addition at a known rate between
restrictions. Another object of the invention is to provide for certain field
applications where high-quality steam is mixed with water to achieve a
specific low-quality steam. In such case, the quality of the resulting low-
quality steam may be accurately determined (Canadian Patent No.
1,301,481).
     W.J. Clarke of Geochemical Corp. has patented a method of grouting
porous gas- and petroleum-bearing formations with a cementitious
material comprising ultra-fine ground slag that is useful for primary and
remedial cementing of a wellbore. A composition is provided which
comprises water, a dispersant, slag and an accelerator to activate the slag
(U.S. Patent No. 5,106,423).
     P.I. Day of Union Oil Co. of California has patented a method used for
determining true in situ resistivity of a thin layer within a formation from
dual induction log data. The method first corrects resistivity data read from
the dual induction log. A representative shoulder bed resistivity is first
determined from average deep resistivity data near the shoulder bed. A
paired estimate of layer resistivity and thickness is then computed based
on the determined shoulder bed resistivity, dip angle, and both deep and
medium resistivity data related to the thin bed. The method does not
require thickness data to be input, and in fact, outputs this information, if
needed (U.S. Patent No. 5,142,472).
     W. Sneed has patented a wireline delivery tool for an underground well
having a pipe, a surface seal for the pipe, and a wireline extending from
the surface into the pipe. The wireline delivery tool includes a body,
having a diameter of less than the interior diameter of the pipe, and a cup
extending from the body to create a seal with the interior of the pipe. A
longitudinal bore within at least a portion of the body has a port through
the body on each side of the cup, so that the ports are in communication
with the interior of the pipe. A pressure valve within the bore normally is
in the closed position. Pressure supplied into the pipe between the surface
seal and the cup will move the delivery tool within the pipe (U.S. Patent
No. 5,180,009).

Texas extends IOR incentives

     Texas Gov. Ann Richards signed into law a bill (S.B. 466) that extends
by four years the opportunity for operators to qualify for existing tax
incentives for new and expanded IOR projects.
     The bill extends the 50% severance tax break for IOR projects through
1998 on projects begun on or after Jan. 1, 1994. The credit will be
available after Jan. 1, 1996.
     Richards praised the measure's incentives. "The estimates I've seen for
the additional recovery of Texas oil surpass 650 million barrels for the
period extending to 1998," Richards said.
     The benefits of the legislation include additional investment in oil
production infrastructure and greater operating efficiency due to the longer
operational life of projects subject to the tax credit, she said.
     State Sen. Bill Sims, D-San Angelo, the bill's sponsor, said the bill was
"the single most important piece of legislation to help the oil and gas
industry passed in the 73rd Texas legislative session."

Horizontal well ups reserves

     Pogo Producing Co. is developing a 21-year-old oil and gas field in the
Gulf of Mexico, adding additional proven reserves with the aid of
horizontal drilling technology.
     Pogo, as operator, recently completed two wells in the Eugene Island
Block 330 field, one of which was the first horizontal well to be drilled in
the field's prolific reservoir.
     Pogo Chairman Paul Van Wagenen said first results from the horizontal
well, the C-7ST Well No. 2, indicated 535' of net pay section from two
lobes of the GA-2 horizon. The well was drilled from Platform C, one of
several fixed drilling/production platforms in the field.
     Due to the successful completion of the horizontal well, an additional
assignment of proven reserves in the field is anticipated, Van Wagenen
said.
     The horizontal well followed by about a week successful completion of
a conventional development well, the C-10ST No. 2, which is now
producing at a rate of 710 b/d of oil on a 20/64" choke, with flowing
tubing pressure of 620 psi. That well encountered 80' of net oil sand and is
producing from the HB sand horizons.
     Pogo, with 35% working interest, is the largest owner in the field,
which was discovered in 1972 and already has produced more than 600
bcf of gas and more than 100 million barrels of oil.
     Van Wagenen said Pogo's approved $60 million 1993 capital
expenditures budget includes a minimum of four development wells and
two recompletions in this very prolific block. The group expects to begin
drilling the third development well within a few weeks, following up with
further drilling and workover activity during the remainder of the year.

Imperial revs up heavy oil output

     Imperial Oil Ltd., Calgary, Alberta, is working to find ways to speed
heavy oil production at its Cold Lake project.
     A company senior vice president, Douglas Baldwin, said the company
will bring phases 7 and 8 of its Cold Lake program onstream later this
year, and the company is investigating ways to accelerate phases 9 and 10,
with steam injection scheduled to begin by mid-1994, adding 25,000 b/d to
production. That will bring total Cold Lake production to about 125,000
b/d, he added.
     Once completed, the four-phase expansion will have cost about C$100
million, Baldwin said.
     He said boilers and central processing facilities needed for the
expansion are in place, with the drilling of injection wells and producing
wells remaining to be completed.
     Drilling in Western Canada is at an all-time high, with shortages of
drilling equipment developing in some areas.

Horizontal scores in Sask.

     Incentives offered by Western Canadian provincial governments to
operators that drill horizontal wells or re-complete horizontally in vertical
wells are keeping the number of such wells high in recent months.
     An example is Petrolantic Ltd., which announced last week it had
completed a horizontal producer in the Battle Creek field in Western
Saskatchewan.
     The well, No. 2-27-3-26 W3M, was drilled to 6,750' total depth  and
cut 1,886' of the Shaunovan formation pay with the horizontal section.
Petrolantic described the main pay zone, some 915' in length, as excellent
oil-saturated, porous (18%-24% porosity) and permeable rock.
     Completed open hole, the well tested at rates of 150-260 b/d. It was
equipped with pumps and rods and is producing into on-site production
tanks.
     The well will be flow-lined to the battery to test production rates at full
capacity, the company said, adding it expects this rate to reach about 500
b/d. It is anticipated that the oil cut will stabilize at the 60% range.
Maximum projected flow rates achievable with existing facilities and
equipment is 800 b/d of fluid, the company added.
     If four-month production results meet projections, up to two additional
horizontal wells may be drilled in the Battle Creek area prior to year-end,
the company said.
     Petrolantic, with headquarters in Calgary, Alberta, says it holds a
32.4% before-payout interest and a 29.3% after-payout interest in the
Battle Creek project. Laval, Quebec-based Granisko Resources Inc. holds
a 29% working interest.

TAIWAN SELECTS ENSERCH, INTERGEN, SCEPTRE IN SECOND ROUND OF IPP BIDS

Enserch Development Corp., International Generating Co. (Intergen) and
Sceptre Power are members of four consortia proposing a total of 3,750 MW
that were selected by the government of Taiwan in the country's second
independent power solicitation, originally for 1,800 MW.
   The four consortia were among 18 bidders proposing 19 separate projects
representing 10,050 MW of new capacity for the solicitation.
   Recently, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) selected from the
first round of proposals seven consortia to build a total of 7,110 MW (IPR,
28 July '95, 1). In that bidding, developers proposed 23 projects
representing more than 30,300 MW.
   Many of the projects selected in the first round have stalled due to the
lack of development experience among the local sponsors (IPR, 20 Oct '95,
1).
   In the latest round, Enserch Development of Dallas said it is part of a
consortium that will build, own and operate a 500-MW, oil-fired, project in
the northern city of Hualien.
   Enserch officials said the company will hold a 30% equity stake in the
project, while 70% will be held by two domestic partners, the Fubon Group
and the Ambassador Group.
   The consortium will spend the rest of 1996 on preliminary development
and expects to begin construction sometime in 1997. Commercial operation
will begin after 1999.
   Boston-based Intergen, a joint venture of Bechtel Group and Pacific Gas
& Electric affiliates, was selected to develop a private power project of
between 1,200 MW and 1,500 MW in a location known as Lizhe. Intergen
declined to release details of the project, but it will be in a joint
venture with a local Taiwanese company.
   Sceptre Power officials declined to release project details, but said
the company is actively developing a project in Taiwan. Reportedly, Sceptre
will have a partner, perhaps Taiwan Sakura Co., in a 1,224-MW, oil-fired
project in Suao.
   A fourth award, to a joint venture of Taiwan's Cheng-Chou Electronics
and ESC of Germany, was for a 600-MW to 700-MW project in Hsin-Chu, though
this could not be confirmed at presstime.
   All four projects are expected to be in commercial operation by 2000 or
2001.
   The government said power rates offered by developers were very
competitive, but did not offer details. The developers now must focus on
obtaining environmental approvals.

S&P DOWNGRADES SOME PROJECT DEBT DUE TO NIMO PRESSURE ON NUG PACTS

   Standard & Poor's has downgraded two non-utility generation debt issues
because of their reliance on payments by Niagara Mohawk Power, which is
moving aggressively to restructure contracts.
   In its ``Power Choice'' proposal, submitted to the New York Public
Service Commission last fall, NiMo offered to open up its service territory
to retail competition, but only if it could restructure the above-market
contracts, which it blames for much of its high rates (IPR, 20 Oct '95,
1).
   If it cannot restructure those pacts, NiMo said, it will seek to take
over projects through its power of eminent domain, then auction them off to
parties that would sell at market prices.
   In addition, NiMo raised the prospect that it might seek Chapter 11
protection under federal bankruptcy laws, which would most likely reduce
payments to NUGs.
   In response, S&P set a BBB- rating for the first mortgage bonds of
Selkirk Cogen Funding Corp., and affirmed that rating on Jan. 5, adding
that the rating outlook is now negative.
   The $392-million debt issue relates to the 332-MW Selkirk cogeneration
project, developed by Cogen Technologies, with a 79% stake, along with
Energy Initiatives, Tomen Power, and U.S. Generating.
   S&P fears the cash flows supporting the debt could be eroded if NiMo
forces a renegotiation of the power-sales contract, or pursues a Chapter 11
filing, it stated. The ratings agency reached that conclusion despite the
fact that the Selkirk project sells only 20% of its power to NiMo, with
most of the output going to Consolidated Edison.
   However, because of the minor reliance on NiMo, ``the project has the
flexibility to potentially absorb a partial loss of Niagara Mohawk
revenues, through contract renegotiation or otherwise, at the BBB- rating
level.'' Cogen Technologies could not be reached for comment by presstime.
   Also on Jan. 5, S&P lowered the ratings from BB to BBB- on senior
secured debt of Energy Investors Fund Funding Corp., and listed the outlook
as negative. Part of the downgrade for the $125-million issue stems from
NiMo's proposals, S&P said.
   Mark Tarini, treasurer of Boston-based Energy Investors Corp. (EIF),
told Independent Power Report the downgrade was not unexpected, since S&P
put the issue on ``CreditWatch'' after the NiMo proposal in October.
However, ``we were surprised they knocked us down two levels.''
   Tarini said the fund in question involves five projects connected with
NiMo: the High Falls and South Glens Falls projects, operated by Adirondack
Hydro, totaling 49 MW; a 58-MW hydro project operated by International
Paper; the Indeck/Olean Energy Center, an 80-MW gas-fired project owned and
operated by Indeck Energy Services in Olean, N.Y.; and the Salt City Energy
Venture, an 80-MW coal project in Solvay, N.Y., developed by CMS Generation
and other partners.
   In downgrading the EIF debt, S&P also cited the fund's investment in 71
MW of wind projects in California, which are owned and operated by
financially troubled Kenetech Corp. Kenetech has suffered financial
problems and a number of key executives including its CEO recently resigned
(IPR, 29 Dec '95, 3; 1 Dec '95, 1).
   If Kenetech recovers and NiMo does not pursue its threats, EIF plans to
lobby for an upgrading of the debt, Tarini said. However, he noted that
``downgrades are like gravity--once ratings go down, its hard to get out of
that hole.''

FORMOSA PLASTICS DEVELOPING TWO PROJECTS TOTALING 5,900 MW IN CHINA

   Formosa Plastics Co. of Taiwan said its Formosa Plastics Group (FPG)
will develop two coal-fired independent power plants totaling 5,900 MW in
the city of Zhangzhou in southern mainland China.
   The 3,500-MW and 2,400-MW plants will cost a total of $7-billion.
   Zhangzhou will provide a number of incentives, including 132-hectares of
land at no charge for five years and reduced charges for the following five
years.
   Formosa Plastics said it expected to bring in at least one equity
partner from the U.S. into the project.
   The company is also building an electric car battery manufacturing
facility in Zhangzhou in a joint venture with American Royal Co. Formosa
will produce the car batteries in mainland China and assemble the cars in
Taiwan.
   Formosa officials said the company is attempting to capitalize on the
experience it is gaining in Taiwan, where it is one of seven companies
selected in that country's first private power solicitation, and to take
advantage of the ``economic liberalization'' underway in China (IPR, 15 Dec
'95, 20).
   Under the name Mailiao Cogeneration Co., Formosa is developing a
1,350-MW, coal-fired plant on a Formosa site at Mailiao in Yunlin County,
Taiwan. The project is expected to be expanded to about 2,400 MW in the
years ahead. Formosa plans for the first phase to reach commercial
operation in 1999.
   Over the longer-term, FPG is also evaluating power project opportunities
in the Philippines.

EDF, ITALY'S EDISON AND FINEL CLOSE ON 600-MW ITALIAN GENERATING FIRM

   A joint venture of Italy's Edison SpA, Finel and Electricite de France
have completed the purchase of a 75% equity stake in the 600-MW Ilva
Servizi Energie (ISE), the power generation arm of Italy's state-owned
steel company Ilva.
   The 75% stake in ISE cost the two companies $220-million, which it paid
out of cash reserves without financing.
   ISE includes a 500-MW, gas-fired, cogeneration plant at Taranto and a
100-MW, gas-fired, cogeneration plant at Piombino in Tuscany. An additional
500-MW, combined-cycle unit is under construction at Taranto and a 170-MW,
combined-cycle unit is planned for Piombino.
   The Taranto plant supplies power and steam to the state-owned plastics
company, Ilva Laminati Piani.
   The additional generating units under construction will cost the
partners about $550-million to complete. Part of the those funds will come
from cash reserves and the remainder from traditional project financing,
which is currently being arranged with an undisclosed European bank.
   In early-1995, Edison and EdF were selected by the government over bids
by British Gas; Endesa of Spain; Mission Energy of the U.S. with Sondel of
Italy; Foster Wheeler Corp. of the U.S. and partners; and Waste Management
International (IPR, 27 Jan '95, 13).
   Edison is owned by Italian holding company Montedison SpA.

ENTERGY CLOSES $1.2-BILLION PURCHASE OF AUSTRALIAN DISTRIBUTOR CITIPOWER

   Entergy Corp. has reached financial closure on its (U.S.) $1.2-billion
acquisition of CitiPower Ltd., the Melbourne, Australia-based electric
power distributor (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 11).
   Entergy acquired CitiPower, its largest international investment to
date, through a solicitation released by the government of Victoria,
Australia.
   Entergy said Bank of America NT&SA, a subsidiary of BankAmerica Corp.,
was the loan arranger for the $914-million of debt financing used to
acquire CitiPower. Lead underwriters were ABN AMRO Australia Ltd., Bank of
America and Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Entergy contributed
$286-million of equity.
   Commonwealth Bank served as the facility agent.
   Entergy also noted co-lead underwriter was Credit Suisse, and
sub-underwriters were Australian & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and IBJ
Australia Bank Ltd.
   Syndication of the $914-million was scheduled to begin within the first
weeks of January.
   CitiPower, with a customer base of some 233,000 customers, serves
Melbourne and its surrounding suburbs.
   Entergy vice president and general manager for Australian activities,
Larry Folks, said, ``It is our intention to work closely with CitiPower's
management team over the coming months to continue establishing best
practices targets and marketing strategies.''
   The Victorian government's deregulation of the electricity industry
means electricity prices will continue to fall, in real terms, at least
until 2000, said Folks.
   Tom Wright, previously vice president, transmission and distribution
systems for Entergy, was appointed CitiPower chief executive officer,
replacing former CitiPower CEO Shane Breheny, who became a transition
advisor.
   CitiPower represents Entergy's first investment in Australia and its
first major international investment it is making alone. In joint ventures
with others, Entergy is active in Argentina, Chile, China, Pakistan and
Peru.

FIRST GAS IN TALKS FOR FINANCING 880-MW GAS PROJECT IN PHILIPPINES

   First Gas Holdings Corp., a joint venture of First Philippine Holdings
of Manila and British Gas, is holding talks with Export Risk Guarantee of
Switzerland, KfW of Germany, Hermes of Germany and the Export-Import Bank
of the U.S., for financing an 880-MW gas-fired project in Sta Rita,
Batangas province, south of Manila.
   The project, expected to cost $600-million, was recently doubled in size
from 440 MW (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 5).
   Gas will come from the offshore Camago-Malampaya field, the Philippines'
biggest oil and gas find, which will be developed by the Philippine units
of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Occidental Petroleum of the U.S.
   Meanwhile, three firms have been qualified to submit a final bid to
build the plant--Asea Brown Boveri, Siemens, and Raytheon Engineers &
Constructors, said Ernesto Pantangco, an official of First Philippine
Holdings Corp.
   The three pre-qualified firms have been asked to submit a final bid on
Jan. 26, with the winner to be announced in March, he said.
   The plant, expected to enter service in 1998, could be built as a single
880-MW facility or with two, 440-MW units, depending on the plan submitted
by the winning bidder.

PHILIPPINE DEVELOPER TO FLOAT BONDS VALUED AT $85-MILLION IN U.S. MARKETS

   First Private Power Corp., a unit of First Philippine Holdings, is set
to float $85-million worth of 12-year bonds in major cities in the United
States next month, a company official said Tuesday.
   Proceeds of the flotation will be used to refinance the short-term
foreign currency depository unit loans FPPC incurred to build the 215-MW
diesel power plant in Bauangtown in La Union Province, which entered
service last year.
   Money from the refinancing scheme will also be used as a partial equity
contribution for a 880-MW gas-fired facility, which is being built jointly
with British Gas (see story above; IPR, 1 Dec '95, 5).
   FPPC chief operating officer Ernesto Pantangco said the lead manager of
the flotation will be Salomon Brothers.
   The coupon rates will be pegged at between 325 and 375 basis points
above the seven-year U.S. Treasury bills. The bonds will have a maturity of
12 years.

UTILICORP, AIR PRODUCTS FORM LINK FOR GAS-FIRED PROJECTS IN MIDWEST

   UtiliCorp United has joined with Air Products & Chemicals to develop
gas-fired independent power projects in the Midwest. The partnership may
later expand its activities to other parts of the U.S. and overseas,
according to a UtiliCorp spokesman.
   UtiliCorp, based in Kansas City, Mo., operates Missouri Public Service
and WestPlains Energy divisions in Kansas and Colorado, along with some gas
utilities. It will pursue the joint projects through its unregulated UtilCo
Group subsidiary.
   Both companies have projects in operation and development, and have
already built two plants together: a 120-MW gas-fired cogeneration project
in Orlando, Fla., which began operating in 1993, selling power to Florida
Power and the Reedy Creek Improvement District; and a 49.9-MW coal-fired
cogeneration plant in Stockton, Calif., in service since 1988 and selling
electricity to Pacific Gas & Electric.
   The companies will focus on the Midwest because they have identified a
need for gas-fired capacity in the region, according to the UtiliCorp
spokesman. He added UtiliCorp brings a knowledge of the Midwest service
area, the regulatory environment and of other utilities in the region.
   Frank Costanza, UtiliCorp vice president of power services, told
Independent Power Report the partners may consider building uncommitted
``merchant plant'' components into some projects. However, until regulatory
uncertainties are resolved, the companies would want to secure purchasers
for most of the output.
   As competitive markets emerge, they may consider a purely merchant
approach--where plants are built without long-term contracts for the
output.
   Altogether, UtilCo Group has 319 MW of equity in 17 operating plants
totaling 800 MW from gas, coal waste and hydro sources, all in the U.S. In
addition, the company is developing a 60-MW plant in Jamaica.
   Air Products & Chemicals has 176 MW of equity in six operating plants
totaling more than 300 MW, including three in-house projects at its
industrial gas and chemical facilities.
   The company also has four projects in development, representing 650 to
725 MW, including a plant in the Czech Republic that is on hold pending the
country's restructuring efforts.
   Except for the Orlando project with UtilCo Group, all of Air Products'
plants involve coal or coal waste.
   Recently, Metropolitan Edison asked Air Products to restructure a 227-MW
coal project to gas in order to lower the capacity payments, but the
parties could not agree on terms, and Met-Ed agreed to buy out the contract
for up to $35-million (see story, page 10).

IDAHO POWER CONSIDERS RENEWABLES SUBSIDIARY; INDONESIA FIRST TARGET

   Idaho Power said it will decide by late spring whether to establish an
independent power subsidiary or energy services company to develop
photovoltaic systems and other renewable energy projects in international
markets.
   Indonesia is an immediate target because the government has begun a
Transmigration Program to encourage its citizens to relocate to outlying
regions, including some of the country's hundreds of islands. Indonesia has
the world's fourth largest population, with most people living in the major
cities.
   The government has earmarked $100-million for the electrification
component of its Transmigration Program. But rather than build a large
power plant on each island, which would be cost prohibitive, the government
is studying the possibility of small hydro and photovoltaics (PV).
   ``Our involvement in the preliminary stages of this project could be the
first step in a broad effort to expand our growth opportunities beyond what
has been considered typical for this company,'' said Joe Marshall, chief
executive officer.
   Idaho Power has been developing PV experience since 1993. In its first
two years, it installed sites in Idaho totaling 3 kW. In 1995 alone, it
installed 86 kW and sources said 1996 will be a pivotal year to decide its
strategy for the future.
   PV systems convert sunlight directly into electricity and can be used to
provide electricity to power water pumps, lighting or refrigeration.
   Idaho Power's engineers have traveled to Indonesia with Community Power
Corp., based in Virginia, to assess the potential for PV in that country.
Idaho Power also is interested in building small hydro, tapping its
considerable experience in the U.S.
   ``Developing PV systems could be a good niche for us internationally,''
said Larry Crowley, Idaho Power's senior manager of strategic planning.
``Our utility has developed a reputation for being a leader in PV
systems.''

CORDELL HULL, ERIC ZAUSNER ESTABLISH FIRM FOR INTERNATIONAL ENERGY ASSETS

   Cordell Hull, recently retired as executive vice president of Bechtel,
and Eric Zausner, a deputy administrator of the Dept. of Energy in the Ford
Administration, have formed Energy Asset Management LLC to develop and
acquire international energy infrastructure assets.
   Hull is chairman of the new company, based in San Francisco, and Zausner
is president. Zausner said it was too early to say more about the company,
which is just getting organized.
   One of Energy Asset Management's first projects is assisting Los
Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises International in acquiring a 12.5%
interest in two Argentine natural gas utility holding companies. Los
Angeles-based PEI, an affiliate of Southern California Gas, announced on
Jan. 2 that discussions and due diligence were proceeding with Sodigas
Pampana SA and Sodigas Sur SA.

TENNECO BUYS 10% OF AUSTRALIAN GAS, POWER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

   Tenneco Power of Houston is taking a 10% equity stake in independent
power developer Energy Equity Corp. Ltd. (EEC) of Perth, Australia, which
has several projects underway (IPR, 3 Nov '95, 6).
   Tenneco Power, a unit of Tenneco Gas, will also take a seat on EEC's
board of directors. EEC's stock is traded on the Australian Stock
Exchange.
   In addition, Tenneco will take a 50% equity stake in EEC's 135-MW,
gas-fired Sulawesi independent power plant that will sell electricity to
Indonesia's state-owned electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).
   Tenneco is also taking an equity stake in EEC's Indonesian Sengkang
onshore natural gas field, estimated to have proven and probable reserves
of 500-billion cubic feet.
   Tenneco is expected to pay about (U.S.) $21-million for the equity in
both projects.
   Financial close on the power project and pipeline is expected in
early-1996.
   As part of its agreement with EEC, Tenneco said it will arrange
financing for the projects.
   Construction of the Sulawesi power plant began in November, with
commercial operation scheduled for early-1997. Tenneco said the
power-purchase agreement with PLN is for a term of 20 years and was
concluded after negotiations between EEC and PLN.
   EEC also holds a 21-year, take-or-pay power-purchase agreement with the
Queensland Electricity Commission for a 37-MW, gas-fired power project. EEC
closed financing for the project with Barclays Bank Australia Ltd. and the
Bank of Western Australia Ltd.
   Separately, Tenneco plans possible power projects from the 470-mile,
16-inch, Moomba-Adelaide pipeline gas pipeline in Australia, which the
company recently purchased.
   Tenneco has separate interests in power projects in Brazil, Chile and
Taiwan.

THAILAND'S EGCO EYES PLANTS IN LAOS CHINA, VIETNAM, INDONESIA, MYANMAR

   One year after becoming a publicly traded company, the Electricity
Generating Public Co. (Egco) of Thailand, a spinoff of the government power
authority, is moving across Thai borders in search of new investments in
China, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam and Laos.
   The company's initial impetus to build plants across the border in Laos
to fuel Thailand's growing demand has evolved into expansion for the sake
of investment, said Siwanan Na Nakorn, Egco executive director and deputy
managing director for new business ventures.
   In China, the company is exploring a joint venture with Huaneng Power
International, to build a 300-MW coal-fired plant in Shanghai.
   Huaneng would hold 70% of the equity and 30% would be owned by Egco.
Siwanan said Egco is working with Thai partners in the venture but declined
to disclose their identities.
   In Myanmar, Egco, in a consortium with the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand and British Gas, is likely to bid on a project that includes a gas
pipeline, a first-stage 200-MW power unit and fertilizer plant.
   In Vietnam, Egco plans to build a 200-MW combined-cycle plant at the
Amata City Bien Hoa industrial park, now under construction outside of Ho
Chi Min City. Egco's equity stake is still under negotiation.
   The Vietnamese government recently asked Egco to increase the initial
capacity of the plant, from 30 MW to 60 MW, to supply areas surrounding the
industrial park.
   Vietnam is also asking Egco to move up the starting date, from late-1997
to late-1996. But Egco and the Vietnamese have not arrived on the price of
the increased power and the company is seeking relief from a tax on diesel
fuel, since the gas pipeline to supply the plant will not be in place until
1998 or 1999.
   The project is a joint venture with Bangpakong Industrial Park of
Thailand.
   Egco is also negotiating with a mine concession holder in Indonesia to
build a mine-mouth coal-fired plant--or simply a mine--in Sumatra or
Kalimantan.
   In Laos, the company has been negotiating with Thai Lao Lignite Corp., a
concession holder, to build a lignite-fired plant in Hong Sa near the
Thai-Lao border. The plant, which would come on-line at 600 MW and
ultimately reach 1,200 MW, would supply Thailand. Siwanan said those
discussions are on hold because of differences over price.
   At home, Egco plans to bid on the next 1,000-MW independent power
solicitation held by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (IPR,
15 Dec '95, 8). EGAT is expected to announce a second 1,000-MW round in
1996, though many bidders in the 1995 request also bid for the second
round.
   Siwanan said the newly-privatized company sat out the first round to
avoid charges that it would receive preferential treatment from EGAT. As a
result of its first listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in November
1994, Egco is 50% publicly held, 48% controlled by EGAT and 2% is owned by
the Crown Property Bureau.
   The company's second public offering will be held in February or March
of 1996, and Siwanan said the sale would likely decrease EGAT's holdings to
40%. Eventually, EGAT's holdings are expected to decline to 25% or 30%, he
said.

MAHARASHSTRA OKAYS AMENDED PLAN FOR DABHOL PROJECT, NOW 2,450 MW

   The Maharashtra state administration on Jan. 8 approved a reformulated
version of Enron Development's Dabhol Power project, which is now planned
as a 2,450-MW plant.
   Maharashtra officials canceled Dabhol in August on charges of a lack of
transparency in the negotiation process and excessively high costs (IPR, 11
Aug '95, 13). Other project partners are General Electric and International
Generating Co. The state administration is calling for the Maharashtra
State Electricity Board to take a 30% stake.
   An earlier meeting on Jan. 6 convened expressly to decide on the Dabhol
plant and two other private power projects was rendered inconclusive after
``hardliners'' in the cabinet insisted the government ``beat down'' even
further recommendations made by a panel of experts appointed by the state.
   A panel's recommendations, submitted in November, had modified the
Dabhol project profile to reduce the tariff and costs of the project (IPR,
3 Nov '95, 6). The cabinet on Jan. 8 ``unanimously accepted most of them''
and has further modified others, state officials said.
   At the same meeting, the cabinet also approved two other private-sector
power projects, the 410-MW Patalganga project sponsored by India's Reliance
Group and the 595-MW, coal-fired Bhadravati project sponsored by the Ispat
Group.
   One of the key alterations to the panel's recommendations has been the
project's power tariff. The Maharashtra state administration has fixed the
power tariff for the Dabhol project at 5.45 cents/kWh, state officials
said. The expert panel had recommended a tariff of 5.5 cents/kWh.
   Chief Minister Manohar Joshi and his Shiv Sena party chief Bal Thackeray
had called for a tariff of 5.3 cents/kWh. Enron officials last week
indicated to the administration that the project would be commercially
unviable, if the tariff was reduced beyond 5.5 cents/kWh.
   Joshi also indicated that Dabhol Power Co., the project company, and the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the state-owned power utility, would
have to sign a new power-purchase agreement before work could resume at the
site of the stalled project.
   Similarly, the administration decided to accept ``in toto'' the
state-appointed expert panel's recommendation that while the project's
total power-generating capacity should be increased from 2,015 MW to
2,450-MW, project costs should be reduced from the originally approved
$1.3-million/MW to $800,000/MW, amounting to a total reduction of nearly
$300-million in fixed costs.
   This, state power officials pointed out, was lower than that of most
similar power projects being set up elsewhere in India, and the lowest
among those approved in Maharashtra state.
   In addition, the project's internal rate of return would be pegged at
21%, the level recommended by the panel, instead of the earlier 25%,
officials said.
   Joshi said the cabinet also approved the use of naphtha instead of
distillate oil for the first phase of the project, and liquefied natural
gas for the second phase, as in the original plan.
   The cabinet, he added, would expect Enron to take measures to ensure
that ``the environment isn't affected whatever the fuel deployed.''
   It also directed the Maharashtra administration not to allow work to
begin again on the first phase until ``all the necessary approvals,'' both
technical and environmental, have been obtained from the federal government
for both the first and second phases. This is expected to delay the
resumption of work at the project site even further.
   Joshi indicated the administration would not compensate Dabhol Power
``in any way'' for the delays that the project has so far incurred. The
first, 695-MW phase of the project was already under construction when the
newly elected state administration issued a work stoppage notice to Dabhol
Power on Aug. 4, 1995.
   Its subsequent revival was also delayed by nearly a month after the
state administration failed to meet its own self-imposed deadline of Dec.
10 to finalize its decision on the expert panel's recommendations (IPR, 29
Dec '95, 18).
   Dabhol Power had estimated that delays were resulting in cost overruns
of $250,000 a day, and had proposed that they should be shared equally by
the developers and the state administration.
   Chief Minister Joshi indicated on Jan. 8 that the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board would hold 30% of the equity of the Dabhol project.
   This, state officials said, would help MSEB have a say in the crucial
managerial decisions of the project, including the use of indigenous rather
than imported naphtha in order to cut costs, as well as in the case of gas
for the second phase, and project equipment for both phases.
   The equity share for MSEB was among the expert panel's recommendations
for the modified project. However, power industry analysts estimate that
the ``anomalous'' decision by the cabinet to insist on a 30% stake for MSEB
at a time when the federal trend suggests increasing privatization of the
power sector, is expected to cost the state about half of its projected
annual outlays, which could force the state to bring in a private Indian
company as a partner in the deal.
   Joshi said both the state and Enron would ``immediately take the
initiative'' to withdraw arbitration proceedings ongoing in a London court
(IPR, 1 Dec '95, 7). The next hearing had been scheduled for Jan. 15.
   Enron officials would not comment on the arbitration decision, pointing
out that the company had yet to receive a formal notice of the cabinet
approval.
   ``While it would be inappropriate for us to speculate on any conditions
until they are reviewed and considered in their entirety and the extent to
which they compare to the recommendations of the state-appointed expert
committee, we are certainly willing to consider recommendations that
provide for a mutually satisfactory project,'' said Enron officials quoting
from a prepared statement by Kenneth Lay, chairman and chief executive
officer of Enron Corp.

CHINA FORMS NEW AGENCY TO SEPARATE GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE ELECTRIC SECTORS

   China is creating an independent entity, National Power Corp. (NPC), to
separate the functions of government and the private electric sector.
   The Ministry of Power, which will be eliminated as it now functions when
NPC is up and running early this year, said NPC will allow China to step-up
its encouragement of foreign investment in the power sector, particularly
in the electricity-starved Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces and the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui.
   NPC is the first step in a multi-phased program to restructure the
Chinese power industry from central planning to a market economy for
electricity.
   Following completion of the national changes, the same restructuring
will be adopted for regional and provincial power administrations.
   All existing national electric power assets will be placed under the
authority of the Chinese State Council. As it is now known, the Ministry of
Power Industry will be dissolved, with its functions transferred to state
commissions, NPC and the China Electricity Council.
   Independently, the Federation of Chinese Power Enterprises will
coordinate work within the private sector.
   Also, the Chinese note that the new Electric Power Law is before members
of the ongoing 17th session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, for expected
approval in 1996.
   The new electric power laws are designed to encourage more domestic and
international investors in the power industry and correct
``insufficiencies'' in existing Chinese power policy.
   The new laws are intended to make sure all of China's resources be
utilized to produce electricity and encourage investors to use new
technology and equipment to build plants, especially cogeneration units.
Also, provisions call for protecting the rights of all investors, traders
and end-users.
   Use of the new laws will gradually unify the cost of electric power
across China.
   The government has also proposed development of a national 6,000-mile,
high-voltage transmission grid. The grid will expand, connect and control
the movement of electricity between the existing inter-provincial and
regional power grid networks.
   The grid is expected to eventually triple the current Chinese
transmission capacity of about 220,000 MW over a total of 106,000-miles and
will be centered around the Three Gorges hydro project on the Yangtze
River. Distribution networks in 35 key cities will be renovated. The
government wants the national grid in-place and operating by 2003.
   A new national grid company will operate the grid, dictating how excess
generation in one area is moved to areas lacking electricity. Development
of the grid is being handled by the China Electric Power Technology & Trade
Corp. of Beijing.

LAOS MAY ALLOW CHINA-THAI LINE IN COUNTRY FOR 1,500-MW PROJECT

   The Laotian government has indicated it may allow a transmission line
linking a 1,500-MW hydro project in China's Yunnan province with Thailand,
to be built on Laotian territory.
   Securing a third-country route for the transmission line is critical for
the project, which is now in the feasibility study stage, since China and
Thailand have no common land border and the project is envisioned to supply
Thailand. Thai officials have expressed concern that building the line
through Myanmar carries too many risks.
   In exchange for opening its territory to the line, Laos, which seeks to
be a major supplier of Thailand's booming energy market, has asked that
some of the power be used to supply Laotian towns and villages near the
line.
   During a meeting of Chinese, Laotian and Thai officials last month at
the ``Electric Power Forum,'' an Asian Development Bank-sponsored event,
Laotian officials agreed in principle to a study on constructing the power
transmission line through Laotian territory.
   Somboune Manolom, deputy director of the Laos Electricity Dept., said
Laos has no objection to the transmission line study, and suggested the
project could boost subregional cooperation.
   The feasibility study for the hydro plant is being conducted under a
joint venture by MDX Power of Bangkok, Thailand, and the Yunnan Electric
Power Bureau, which hold 48% and 52%, respectively. The plant study is
expected to be completed in late-1997.
   The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand has not yet committed
to purchase power from the project.
   One EGAT source said it is too early to know if the project will be
attractive. And a another EGAT official questioned whether the project
would offer energy at a competitive price, given the cost of transporting
power 185 miles from the northern Thai border. EGAT has no existing
agreements to buy power from China.
   But an MDX source said the company is pursuing the effort on the
``fairly strong belief that the project will be economically feasible and
mutually beneficial for the two countries.'' The transmission line is
unlikely to make up a major share of the project cost, he said.
   While MDX and Thai officials say that a Myanmar route for the
transmission line remains an option, Piyasvasti Amranand, head of
Thailand's National Energy Policy Office said it is ``too risky for us''
because the line would go through areas controlled by rebel groups. Also,
he said, some international lenders are reluctant to finance projects in
Myanmar.

SCEPTRE, PARTNERS TO REPOWER TWO SMALL PLANTS IN CHINA; MORE PLANNED

   Sceptre Power Co. of Santa Anna, Calif., has launched a joint venture to
repower two existing units totaling 42 MW in Jiangsu Province, China, with
hopes of repowering much larger plants in the future.
   With project partners New China Hong Kong Group Ltd. of Hong Kong and
Horizon Energy Development Inc., a unit of National Fuel Gas Co. of
Buffalo, N.Y., the 27-MW, coal-fired Wuxian Leekou plant will be expanded
to 39 MW and the 15-MW, coal-fired Jiangyin Sanfangxiang plant will be
increased to 24 MW. Combined costs of both projects are put at
$35.5-million.
   NCHK will hold about 50% of the project, while Sceptre Power and Horizon
Energy will hold the other 50%.
   Sceptre vice president for Asian project development L.W. Ken Kinnie
said both projects are scheduled to reach financial close during the first
quarter of this year and be complete by year-end.
   ``These projects are just to get our feet wet in China,'' Kinnie said.
Sceptre's goal in China is to undertake 10 to 15 similar repowering
projects--although the later ones will be larger--then list the entire
portfolio on the stock exchange of either Hong Kong or China.
   The company expects to have partners in each of the Chinese
undertakings.
   Sceptre began as an affiliate of Canada's Sceptre Resources, but
recently became independent. The company holds several agreements in China
for projects similar to those in Jiangsu Province, but Kinnie said details
will not be released until the project development process is more
advanced.
   The company is searching for other joint venture partners, Kinnie said.
   In a separate joint venture in Pakistan, Sceptre Power is nearing
financial close on a 157-MW, gas-fired project in Lahore (IPR, 29 Dec '95,
5). Partners in that project include Pakistan's Fauji Foundation and Intrag
of Wellesley, Mass.
   Other projects are sought in Brazil, Peru and elsewhere in South
America.

KEY PHILIPPINE SENATOR WANTS PROBE OF LINE DELAYS AFFECTING CEPA PLANT

   The president of the Philippine Senate said Monday he wants a probe on
why state-run National Power Corp. (Napocor) failed to provide needed
transmission lines, leading to delays in operation of two completed power
plants, including one built by Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA) of
Hong Kong, a unit of Hopewell Holdings.
   The plants involved are the 700-MW, coal-fired Pagbilao facility built
by CEPA, and the 300-MW Calaca coal plant owned by Napocor, both completed
in 1995.
   Senate President Neptali Gonzalez said the government has so far
incurred losses of $891.69-million due to the continued non-operation of
the two coal-fired facilities.
   Gonzalez filed a Senate resolution calling for an investigation on
``whether or not there is gross negligence or incompetence on the part of
the National Power Corporation...due to the delay in the construction of
the transmission lines and substations.''
   The two power plants ``were installed and commissioned as scheduled but
remain idle and inoperational due to unavailable transmission lines and
substations,'' Gonzalez said.
   However, Napocor vice president for projects management Antonio Corpuz
previously said that under a contract signed with CEPA, the transmission
lines needed for the Pagbilao plant should be ready by March 1996, at the
latest.
   Corpuz also said then that Napocor will not pay a single cent of the
$26.34-million being claimed by CEPA as an early completion bonus of
Pagbilao (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 5).
   A CEPA source said the ``misunderstanding'' with Napocor is being
discussed by both sides, and that the issue will be resolved ``very
soon.''

PHILIPPINES' NAPOCOR MAY SELL TWO WESTINGHOUSE TURBINES TO TEXACO

   The Philippines' National Power Corp. (Napocor) said Monday it may sell
to Texaco Inc. the two gas turbines totaling 320 MW to be delivered by
Westinghouse in 1997 as part of a package that settled a nuclear plant
dispute (IPR, 29 Dec '95, 18; 15 Dec '95, 10).
   The two new 501F combustion turbines worth $30-million each could be
used by Texaco for a 300-MW cogeneration plant planned in Batangas
province, south of Manila, said Napocor spokeswoman Jane Subang.
   Texaco officials were unavailable for comment.
   Westinghouse had been accused of bribing former president Ferdinand
Marcos in the early-1980s to secure the contract to build the allegedly
faulty nuclear plant in Bataan province, west of Manila.
   Westinghouse equipment and technology were banned in 1993 after talks on
a settlement failed. A $100-million out-of-court settlement that included
the delivery of the two gas turbines was reached recently paving the way
for the lifting of the ban.
   The sale of the gas turbines to Texaco has not yet been finalized,
Subang said. It is also possible the two turbines could be made part of the
planned bidding for a 1,200-MW gas-fired plant, she said (IPR, 15 Dec '95,
10).

PHILIPPINE INVESTMENT BOARD GRANTS INCENTIVES FOR TWO PROJECTS, 160 MW

   The Philippine government investment board has granted tax incentives to
two proposed geothermal projects totaling 160 MW that state-run Philippine
National Oil Co. plans to turn over to the private sector.
   The incentives, which include tax holidays and low duties on imported
equipment, were granted to draw the attention of private investors in the
proposed projects, the investment board said.
   The projects are the 120-MW Mount Labo geothermal plant in Camarines Sur
province, south of Manila, and the 40-MW Negros Geothermal Project in the
central province of Negros Occidental, said PNOC spokeswoman Debbie
Diokno.
   PNOC has not yet decided whether to offer the two projects to investors
on a build-operate-transfer or build-own-operate basis, she said.
   It is also eyeing the Japanese government's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund as a source of funding for both projects, Diokno said.
   The Mount Labo project will be implemented in two phases: a 20-MW
facility scheduled for operation by June 1998, and a 100-MW unit by March
2000.
   The Negros power plant is scheduled for commissioning by August 1998.
   The government's investment board gave ``pioneer status'' to both
projects, entitling their proponents to a six-year income tax holiday, a 3%
duty on imported capital equipment and tax credits on local purchases of
machinery.

SOUTH KOREA LIFTS 750-MW SIZE CAP; 1,600-MW RFP NOW SEEN IN FEBRUARY

   South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) has lifted
its earlier 750-MW private power project size limit, effective immediately
(IPR, 6 Oct '95, 12).
   The timing of the change coincides with the release of an often-delayed
international solicitation to be issued by Korea Electric Power Corp.
(KEPCO) in February for two 800-MW thermal projects, Younghungdong units 1
and 2, which will be developed on a build-own-operate basis.
   The formal request for proposals was expected before the end of 1995,
but was delayed. The RFP was originally scheduled to be released in June
1995. All delays were blamed on personnel changes at the top of MOTIE.
   The cost of each 800 MW is placed between $650-million and
$700-million.
   The policy change means the only restriction faced by private power
developers is a 50% limitation on foreign ownership. Also, nuclear projects
are barred.
   According to a tentative schedule, MOTIE will receive and evaluate
proposals in early-1996 with selection of developers set for July 1996.
Power-purchase agreements will be signed in August 1996, following
negotiations. Development of selected projects will begin in September
1996.
   Those dates could slip into the future.
   Virtually all private companies will be able to compete for the
projects, if the ratio of their net worth to capital during the previous
three years is at least 20% and they have some technical capacity for power
projects.
   KEPCO may not bid for the projects, but will buy the power under a
long-term, power-purchase agreement. Power-purchase negotiations will be
between the selected bidders and KEPCO, which is warning prospective
bidders it will not pay a tariff higher than the cost of power from the
utility's comparable existing plants.
   Successful bidders will be guaranteed returns of 11%, compared to the 9%
guaranteed to KEPCO.
   Separate successful bidders will be selected for each project, and the
same company will not be allowed to participate in both generating plants.
South Korea's largest and most powerful industrial groups are expected to
offer strong competition for the projects.
   Further solicitations after the two 800-MW plants are almost certain
because electricity demand in South Korea is projected to average 5.5%
between 1996 and 2006.
   Currently, installed capacity in South Korea is about 31,810 MW, with
30,188 MW generated by KEPCO. About 62% is fueled by oil, coal or natural
gas, 28.7% is nuclear power and 9.3% is hydroelectric.

QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA, ENCOURAGING BAGASSE PLANTS UNDER NEW PROGRAM

   Queensland, Australia, is promoting bagasse-fired, waste-to-energy
cogeneration plants among the state's sugar mills and is encouraging
domestic and international joint venture partners.
   Under the just-created Queensland Sugar Power Pool Agreement, power
produced by using the waste products of making sugar will be purchased at
special tariffs under a long-term agreement by the Queensland Transmission
& Supply Corp. (QT&SC) starting January 1998.
   Up to 95 MW will be purchased by (QT&SC) when the program begins, but by
2002, the limit will increase to 200 MW, said Queensland energy minister
Tony McGrady.
   The mills will make use of the thermal energy created by the
cogeneration units, but only a very small portion of the electric
generation.
   The program is an effort by the government to explore ``all avenues of
environmentally friendly generation options,'' McGrady said.
   The effort is expected to generate worldwide interest, the government
said, and various private sector companies are welcome to participate, if
they can strike a deal with one of the sugar mills agreeing to provide
fuel.
   So far, sugar mills participating in the project include the three CSR
Ltd. mills located at Invicta, Kalamia and Inkerman and the mills of South
Johnstone and Maryborough. The mills are the initial members of the
Queensland Sugar Power Pool Agreement, but others are expected to join.
   Bagasse is the part of the cane stalk remaining after the milling
process.

NATIONAL POWER, POWERGEN MAY FACE MORE AGENCY-ORDERED PLANT SELL-OFFS

   U.K. generation companies National Power and PowerGen may be forced to
sell additional plants beyond the already-required 6,000 MW, if their
pending acquisitions of regional electric companies (RECs) are cleared.
   PowerGen has bid to acquire Midlands Electricity (IPR, 22 Sept '95, 1)
and National Power has proposed buying Southern Electric (IPR, 6 Oct '95,
13). Both bids, accepted by the RECs, have been referred to the Monopolies
& Mergers Commission (IPR, 1 Dec '95, 17). A decision is expected by March
22.
   London Electricity is pressing industry regulator Stephen Littlechild,
director of the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER), for a reduction
in the generating capacity of PowerGen and National Power.
   According to a London Electricity spokesman, there is considerable
concern at the size and potential market share of the vertically integrated
groups. ``We are not against vertical integration,'' he said, ``but it must
not be at the expense of stifling other suppliers. We would like to see
more generators and suppliers rather than less, which may happen if these
mergers go ahead.''
   PowerGen is already disposing of 2,000 MW of capacity to the Eastern
Group, while National Power is evaluating bids from Enron, AES Corp.,
Eastern Group and Mission Energy for the 2,000-MW plant at West Burton in
Nottinghamshire and two, 1,000-MW plants at Ironbridge in Shropsire and
Rugeley in Staffordshire (IPR, 22 Sept '95, 8; 6 Oct '95, 1).
   National Power forecasts its transaction will be complete by March 31.
All four bidders want to acquire the three plants, but it is possible they
will be sold separately to individual bidders.
   However, London Electricity said further sales are necessary to enable
more players to enter the market, although the two generators point to
their decline in market share since privatization and insist that further
sales are unnecessary.
   The RECs are also concerned about the possible effects on the power
pool. Southeast distributor Seeboard said the workings of the pool should
be scrutinized along with other commercial issues and the voting structure
to ensure that bigger groups do not dominate the market.

UKRAINE GETS $1.8-BILLION WESTERN AID FOR POWER; BIG ABB PROJECT DEAD

   A protocol signed by the Ukraine and the ``G-7'' Western industrial
nations in Ottawa commits the West to provide $1.8-billion in loans for
power plant construction and rehabilitation projects in the Ukraine in
return for closure of 3,000 MW of remaining nuclear capacity at the
Chernobyl site by 2000.
   The west will also contribute $498-million towards Chernobyl cleanup and
decommissioning costs.
   The protocol calls for much of the replacement power funding to be spent
on completion of two 1,000-MW reactors at Khmelnitsky and Rovno and the
rest to go into thermal and hydro plant rehabilitation, pumped-storage
projects and energy conservation.
   The agreement to fund the nuclear plants officially ends chances for
construction at this time of a 2,300-MW, gas-fired combustion turbine
project near the Chernobyl site that was proposed in May 1995 by a
consortium led by Asea Brown Boveri (IPR, 16 June '95, 18).
   The ABB group also included CMS Generation, Kawasaki, Skanska AB of
Sweden, Mannesmananlangebau of Germany and Danish Power as well as local
Ukranian groups.
   The group proposed a crash construction schedule, which would allow the
project to start generating power within 24 months of construction start
and be fully completed within 36 months. They said this would be the best
way to insure new power supplies in time for the closure deadline of 2000.
   However, the project met stiff resistance inside the Ukraine from
supporters of nuclear power and the national utility Minenergo. Critics
argued the country could not afford the cost of gas from Russia that would
be needed to fuel the plant. The Ukraine has had chronic problems paying
Russia for both gas and power supplies in recent years.
   The gas project also was based on initial estimates the west would
provide up to $4-billion for the Chernobyl cleanup and replacement power
projects. However, as talks continued during 1995, it became clear the west
was not willing to commit to such a large sum.
   An ABB spokesman in Zurich said the gas project clearly now had a ``low
priority'' in Ukrainian planning and that his company was looking at
participation in various plant rehabilitation projects. Siemens of Germany
has already been active in promoting such projects and it is possible ABB
will team with Siemens.
   The European Community has already funded a study by Electricite de
France, Tractebel Engineering and IVO of Finland on what will be needed to
complete work on the two nuclear plants.
   The Dec. 20, 1995, protocol also contains language committing the
Ukraine to continue developing a ``financially sound electric power market
with market-based pricing'' that will encourage energy conservation and
attract international investment.

U.K.'S NATIONAL POWER PLANS 60-MW PROJECT IN UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

   The U.K.'s National Power has signed a memorandum of understanding with
Ajman, a sheikdom operating as part of the federation of United Arab
Emirates (UAE), to build, own and operate a $120-million, 50-MW to 60-MW,
desalination and power plant.
   National Power will hold a 49% equity stake in the project, while a
domestic partner, Bin Sofan Trading Co., is expected to hold 51%.
   When complete, the project will also produce about 5-million gallons/day
of desalinated sea water.
   The project is considered the first private power plant in the UAE and
the first power project in Ajman.
   National Power is holding power-purchase agreement negotiations with the
UAE's Ministry of Electricity & Water. The agency is responsible for
electricity supplies in some of the UAE's northern emirates, including
Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah and Umm al-Quwain.
   Within the UAE, the Abu Dhabi Dept. of Water & Electricity, the Dubai
Electricity & Water Authority, and the Sharjah Water & Electricity
Department supply power to their respective areas.
   UAE power demand is projected to increase to 6,900 MW by 1999, based on
load growth of about 20% annually. Current installed capacity is about
4,350 MW, produced by six gas-fired power stations and seven small
generating units.
   About 1,440 MW of government-owned projects are in some stage of
construction. Many of the planned projects are associated with desalination
plants.
   Also, the Ministry of Electricity & Water and the Dubai Electricity &
Water Authority are separately evaluating prospects for several more
projects, totaling about 710 MW.
   Within the UAE, the government is planning a large expansion of
liquefied natural gas production and transportation facilities. The
expansion, estimated to cost about $3-billion, will be undertaken by the
Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Co..
   The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven small semi-autonomous
principalities located on the Persian Gulf.

MET-ED MAY PAY UP TO $35-MILLION TO KILL 227-MW AIR PRODUCTS PACT

   Air Products & Chemicals of Allentown, Pa., has ended talks with
Metropolitan Edison aimed at restructuring the contract for a planned
227-MW coal project (IPR, 6 Oct '95, 7).
   After three months, the companies could not agree on new terms and will
now negotiate a buyout that could reach $35-million to cover Air Products'
development costs.
   To replace the capacity and 100 MW from another recent buyout, Met-Ed
may seek new supplies, a spokesman said.
   Air Products was pursuing the project strictly as a developer, and would
have operated it at the site of the P.H. Glatfelter paper company in York
County, selling steam to the mill and power to Met-Ed, a unit of General
Public Utilities.
   Although Air Products worked alone, the project was being developed
under the name York County Energy Partners L.P., because it planned to seek
limited partners once the plant was operational.
   According to Brad Hahn, Air Products director of business development,
the company completed all of the design work and had received an air permit
from the Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection, as well as a
favorable environmental impact statement (EIS) from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
   He could not estimate how much the company spent on development costs,
but said it would be covered by the final buyout figure.
   When the parties began talking in September, Met-Ed estimated the
existing contract would cost $940-million above market rates during its
25-year term. It proposed that Air Products switch its design from coal to
gas, since that would reduce capacity rates.
   The utility also offered to let the developer participate in GPU's new
gas pool, which was developed for utility peakers, but is being made
available to non-utility generators who agree to renegotiate contracts.
   However, ``it became clear that we would not be able to agree,'' Hahn
told Independent Power Report. The main sticking point was contract length,
since Met-Ed wanted only eight to 10 years, while Air Products preferred a
term closer to the original 25 years. Other details also blocked the
agreement, he added.
   A Met-Ed spokesman said the utility will begin considering alternatives
to replace the 227 MW, as well as the 100 MW it lost when it bought out the
Crown/Vista coal contact from partners Mission Energy, Ahlstrom Development
and Entergy Power Development for $30-million (IPR, 8 Sept '95, 5).
   Met-Ed agreed to that buyout because it saw the contract costing
$298-million over market rates during its 20-year life.
   The spokesman did not say whether Met-Ed would seek bids for new
supplies.
   Air Products & Chemicals has equity stakes of 176 MW in seven operating
plants that produce 303 MW, including three in-house projects. The firm
also has four projects in development, representing about 650 MW to 725 MW,
including a coal gasification plant in the Czech Republic that is currently
on hold.

PANDA TO REFILE LAWSUIT CHARGING FLA. POWER BLOCKED 115-MW PROJECT

   Panda Energy, after voluntarily withdrawing its $345-million federal
suit against Florida Power without prejudice in mid-December, said it will
file the suit again (Case No. 95-992-CIV-T-24 C) (IPR, 11 Aug '95, 1).
   The suit alleged the utility unfairly interfered with construction of a
115-MW cogeneration plant in Polk County, which was to supply Florida Power
with 74.9 MW of firm power under a standard-offer contract.
   Florida Power has since filed a countersuit against Panda in the same
court, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division
(Case No. 95-2145-CIV-T-25-B). In addition, the state Public Service
Commission denied two requests made by Panda in a related action.
   Panda's general counsel Bill Nordlund said the withdrawal was a
strategic move, ``and we still plan to prosecute this matter and move
forward on it. I can't comment on when or what court. We don't want to give
an advance of our intentions to the other side.''
   The countersuit filed by Florida Power at the end of December sought
declaratory judgments against the facts alleged in Panda's suit, which was
a safeguard in case Panda refiled the case, according to Florida Power
attorney James Fama.
   Florida Power asked the court to issue declaratory judgments ruling
that:
   Panda did not have a superior legal right to negotiate for a natural gas
transmission contract with the city of Lakeland, and that the utility did
not interfere with Panda's rights with the city;
   Panda was not entitled to a standard-offer contract if it builds a unit
larger than 75 MW, the largest allowed under PSC rules;
   Panda was not entitled to rates under a standard-offer contract beyond
December 2016, rather than 2026 as Panda sought;
   Panda breached its contract by failing to begin construction on the
unit, which was scheduled to go on line in January 1997;
   The utility also asked the court to declare remedies to Florida Power
from Panda's breach, plus additional relief.
   On Jan. 3, the PSC refused to reconsider a decision the PSC made on Dec.
5, which said the PSC had jurisdiction over standard-offer contracts and
the Florida Power/Panda dispute. It also refused to grant Panda a 90-day
extension beyond Jan. 5 to file testimony in that case (Docket No.
950110-EI).
   As a result, a hearing at the PSC was scheduled for Feb. 19, a staff
recommendation was due April 18, and the commission was scheduled to vote
on April 30.
   Nordlund said Panda made the deadline for filing testimony Jan. 5, and
added, ``We think Florida Power's suit is ludicrous.''

ENERGY INITIATIVES BEATS FLA. POWER IN COURT ON RATES FOR 112-MW PLANT

   Energy Initiatives Inc. won a partial summary judgment Jan. 4 in a case
against Florida Power concerning rates for the developer's 112-MW
cogeneration plant in Umatilla, Fla.
   The project company, Lake Cogen, said the utility was paying it on an
as-available basis at times when it should have been paying for firm
capacity and energy.
   Florida Power attorney James Fama confirmed two other non-utility
generators, Pasco Cogen, also 112 MW and owned by Energy Initiatives, and
the 120-MW Orlando Cogen, developed by Air Products & Chemicals, have
similar court actions pending.
   The Lake Cogen case, filed in state circuit court in Lake County, will
determine whether firm capacity payments should be made based on a model
used by Florida Power, or a separate method Lake Cogen said was called for
in the contract (Case No. 94354 CA-01, Division 8).
   Florida Power pays NUGs both capacity and energy payments when the
theoretically avoided generating unit would operate, but only as-available
or energy payments if the avoided unit would have been off line.
   Florida Power claimed a theoretically avoided 500-MW pulverized coal
plant equipped with a scrubber, which was used to determine capacity and
energy payments, would be used by the utility based on four criteria to
determine when the plant would be dispatched on an economic basis.
   The four parameters were the cost of variable operations and
maintenance, the price of coal, the heat rate of the unit, and a fuel
multiplier of 1, the last of which Fama said was not a significant factor.
   In its motion, Lake Cogen contended other factors, such as environmental
compliance, should be used in determining economic dispatchability of a
generating unit. It said an actual, operating plant should be used for
comparison, which would be Florida Power's coal-fired Crystal River units 1
and 2.
   Judge Don Briggs ruled the parameters for dispatchability should be
based on a real unit and not only the four Florida Power was using. He
ordered a more accurate model be developed, which would be used to
determine how much Lake Cogen should be paid.
   That cost information will be compared to actual payments, which could
be used to determine an award at a later date, assuming the model shows
Lake Cogen was underpaid. A schedule for further proceedings was not set.
   Kelly Tomblin, legal director for Energy Initiatives, a unit of General
Public Utilities, said Florida Power changed the method of payment in
August 1994. Although the developer receives payments for firm capacity and
as-available sales, firm capacity payments ``have been very limited
recently,'' she said.
   ``We believe Florida Power always believed it would be based on a real
operating unit and the judge agreed,'' Tomblin said. ``We think it is good
for cogenerators and good for us in Florida.''
   Tomblin said it would be very difficult to estimate the amount of
damages Florida Power might have to pay until after the judge approves the
final modeling and makes a ruling.

NIMO: PURPA PREEMPTS NEW YORK LAW REQUIRING TAX REIMBURSEMENT TO QFS

   Niagara Mohawk Power has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to act against a New York State law that requires NiMo to pay natural gas
tax reimbursements to qualifying facilities.
   NiMo has paid almost $18-million in reimbursements since the law was
passed in 1991, it said.
   The company wants FERC to bring an enforcement action against the New
York Public Service Commission to bar it from implementing the law, which
directs the PSC to order utilities to reimburse QFs for natural gas import
tax payments that the state requires QFs to pay on fuel used to generate
power sold to the utilities.
   According to NiMo, the state law is preempted by the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act and FERC's PURPA rules. ``The PSC cannot both obey
the New York statute and heed its obligations under Sec. 210 of PURPA,''
NiMo said (Docket No. EL96-26).
   The legislature imposed a monthly ``privilege tax'' on certain gas
importers amounting to 4.25% of the price paid for gas imported into the
state for use or consumption. For cogenerators, the amount of gas taxed is
that used in producing power for sale to utilities, not the gas used to
produce power or steam for steam hosts.
   Utilities may pass the payments through in fuel cost adjustments.
   NiMo itself paid about $7.2-million in 1994 and $4.8-million in 1995
through Sept. 30. The company projected it will pay between $7.2-million in
1996 and $13.5-million in 2006.
   FERC's 1995 rulings in cases involving Connecticut Power & Light (IPR,
27 Jan '95, 10) and Southern California Edison (IPR, 24 March '95, 4)
``leave no room for doubt that this New York statute is preempted'' because
it requires utilities to pay above avoided-cost rates to QFs, NiMo said
(IPR, 21 April '95, 1; 24 March '95, 1).

N.Y. JUDGE SEES ISO AS KEY IN MOVE TO WHOLESALE COMPETITION, ACCESS

   An administrative law judge has recommended New York set up an
independent system operator to formalize wholesale competition and ensure a
smooth transition to retail competition.
   Her recommended decision in the state's Competitive Opportunities
proceeding also calls for separating transmission and distribution from
generation and for recovering stranded costs with an access charge imposed
by a distribution company.
   Administrative law judge Judith Lee of the state's Dept. of Public
Service filed her recommendation Dec. 22 with Ronald Liberty, deputy
director for the Energy and Water Division. Subject to review by the Public
Service Commission, it aims to lower New York's high electricity rates and
keep industry in the state.
   Key parts of the more than 200-page review are:
   -- Stranded costs ``may be made unrecoverable by the transition from
regulation to a competitive market for electricity.'' These costs could be
recovered by a separate mechanism outside the market, such as a
non-bypassable access charge or wires charge imposed by a distribution
company.
   -- Transmission and distribution should be separate from generation
``to limit the exercise of market power,'' and T&D companies will need to
serve all would-be buyers in the short term.
   Lee said she saw as ``critical'' the reliability of the bulk power
system, noting that it should not be sacrificed in any way to achieve the
potential price reduction that may be associated with a system of retail
access. Therefore, ``effective competition at the wholesale level should be
established first, with an eye toward adding retail access as rapidly as
possible once a market is established and reliability is ensured.''
   No timetable for the ``as rapidly as possible'' transition to retail
access is available, a PSC spokesperson told Independent Power Report.
   Lee's recommendation was a ``tremendous disappointment'' to New York
industrials ``and to any advocate of full and open retail competition,''
said Barbara Brenner, counsel to Multiple Interveners, the industrial users
group. ``It delays, without schedule, retail competition and, in fact,
appears to delay even the implementation of wholesale competition for two
years.''

PACIFIC GENERATION BUYS 25% INTEREST IN 100-MW ONTARIO PLANT FROM DESTEC

   Pacific Generation, a unit of PacifiCorp, has acquired a 25% interest in
the 100-MW Kingston cogeneration project under construction in Ontario,
Canada, from Destec Energy Inc.
   Destec retains 50% ownership in the gas-fired project, located in
Ernestown Township. The plant will supply power to the Ontario Hydro grid
and process heat to Celanese Canada's Millhaven polyester plant.
   PanCanadian Petroleum holds the remaining 25% interest and will supply
natural gas to the plant, which will enter service in late-1996.
   Pacific Generation and Destec are already partners in the
almost-completed 240-MW Crockett cogeneration plant near San Francisco,
which will begin operation in April. Other partners are Tomen Power and
Energy Investors Fund. Pacific Gas & Electric will buy the power.
   ``The Kingston project fits our plan for growing our business through
acquisition of existing facilities and the development of new power
projects,'' said John Miller, Pacific Generation president and chief
executive officer.
   In October, Miller had said that after several years of being in a
``holding pattern,'' his company intended to aggressively expand its
independent power activities (IPR, 6 Oct '95, 14). In November, the company
said it was beefing up its top management by hiring five people for
domestic and international expansion (IPR, 17 Nov '95, 3).
   The company, based in Portland, Ore., was formed in 1989 with the merger
of Pacific Power & Light and Utah Power & Light. Ownership and operating
interests of projects developed by Pacific P&L affiliate Onsite Energy Inc.
and UP&L affiliate Energy National Inc. were transferred to Pacific
Generation.
   Pacific Generation holds an interest in 11 power plants in the U.S.
totaling 703 MW. Destec has equity in 19 operating plants totaling 2,810 MW
and has seven projects with over 1,700 MW in construction or advanced
development.

MISSION FORMALLY EXITS 400-MW PROJECT AT WEYERHAEUSER MILL IN WASH. STATE

   Weyerhaeuser Co. of Longview, Wash., and Mission Energy told Washington
state regulators they have reached a stipulated agreement over development
of a 400-MW, gas-fired cogeneration plant, that would give Weyco full
rights to develop the plant alone at its Longview paper mill (IPR, 1 Dec
'95, 13; 29 Jan '93, 1).
   Weyco asked the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council to amend its
certification agreement to reflect its decision to proceed alone.
   It also asked for an amendment that would extend the agreement for 18
months.
   EFSEC will make a decision in February on the request. If the council
approves the deal, ``we will require the governor to sign the new
agreement,'' said Jason Zeller, EFSEC manager.
   Zeller said the two companies reached a stipulated pact after being
pressured by EFSEC to resolve their differences on their own. ``We were
unhappy'' that the companies had been unable to settle their dispute over
the development of the project, he said. The original permit expired in
August.
   Weyco officials indicated to the council they were still interested in
developing the plant eventually, even though the company recently agreed to
purchase 150 MW from the Bonneville Power Administration to cover part of
its 300-MW load at the Longview mill.

AES, ONTARIO HYDRO UNIT IN TALKS TO BUY 2,700-MW ARGENTINE PLANT

   A strategic alliance of Ontario Hydro International, a unit of Ontario
Hydro, and AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., has opened talks with the
government of Argentina concerning the acquisition of the 2,700-MW Yacyreta
hydro project, now under construction on the Parana River, which forms the
border between Argentina and Paraguay.
   Other unidentified developers have also opened discussions on the
project, jointly owned by the governments of Argentina and Paraguay.
   Previously, an international solicitation was scheduled for release in
August 1995, but was not issued (IPR, 30 June '95, 1).
   Analysts said it is unlikely Ontario Hydro and AES could acquire the
plant via a negotiations, and would more likely have to compete in an
international solicitation open to all.
   The project consists of 20 turbines of 135 MW each.
   Officials of Ontario Hydro International and AES met recently with
Argentine government officials about the project.
   Ontario Hydro officials said it and AES may form a consortium to enter a
bid for Yacyreta when and if it is offered via a solicitation.
   Both companies have equity in other South American electric projects.
   The plant will be completed by the middle of 1998.
   Argentine officials confirmed representatives of the two companies met
with energy officials, but nothing substantive came of the meeting.
Meetings with other private developers are taking place.
   Separately, a consortium known as LISTA will build and operate a
transmission system to move power generated by the Yacyreta plant.
   LISTA consists of Jose Cartellone Construcciones Civiles SA
(Cartellone), Sideco Americana SA (Sidecdeco), Italy's Impresa Frate SpA.
(Frate), Pirelli Consultora Conductores e Instalaciones SA (Pirelli),
Construccion Obras de Ingenieria SA (Codi), and Electroingenieria SA.

TAIWAN FIRM PROPOSES 1,010-MW BOT HYDRO PROJECT IN HONDURAS

   Oslow Associates Ltd. of Taiwan has proposed to the government of
Honduras development of a $2-billion, 1,010-MW hydroelectric project on a
build-operate-transfer basis.
   Oslow, a large trading company based in Taiwan, submitted the proposal
following a government trade mission to Honduras.
   The Honduran government tentatively accepted the proposal, pending
completion of a number of subsequent agreements.
   The project will be financed through government-backed loans in Taiwan
and with funds from foreign banks.
   Additional equity partners are expected to be involved in the project,
but none have been identified, Honduran officials said.
   Load growth is high in Honduras, but the country is relatively small.
Installed capacity--two-thirds hydro--is less than 600 MW. Honduras is said
to have an estimated untapped hydro potential of about 3,600 MW.
   Overall, up to 800 MW could be available to the private sector in
Honduras by 1999.
   If the 1,010-MW hydro project is completed, it could export power to
other countries in Central America via the 1,100-mile, high-tension
transmission grid known as the Electricity Interconnection System for
Central America, now in development.
   The Inter-American Development Bank is expected to eventually provide a
$157-million syndicated loan to partially finance the transmission grid.
   The government of Taiwan also agreed to provide undisclosed financing
for the transmission project, which would allow each country to supply or
buy electricity from all others, and serve as an emergency electric supply
backup.
   Recently, Mosbacher Power Group (MPG) of Houston launched pursuit of
smaller independent power projects in Honduras, mostly within the
industrial power niche for projects between 20 MW and 50 MW (IPR, 17 Nov
'95, 16).

SPAIN'S ENDESA SELLS 9.7% OF EDENOR IN ARGENTINA FOR ABOUT $76-MILLION

   Spanish electric utility Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA (Endesa)
said its Endesa Group sold a 9.7% stake in Argentine electricity
distribution company Edenor to Banco Santander de Negocios for about (U.S.)
$76-million.
   Less than two weeks earlier, Endesa paid $156-million to expand its
equity stake in Edenor by 19.5 percentage points, pushing total holdings to
31% (IPR, 29 Dec '95, 12). Endesa bought that piece of Edenor from the
Argentine government.
   Endesa said the sale to Banco Santander de Negocios was made for
financial reasons.
   Endesa said it will maintain its 21.3% holdings in Edenor with joint
venture partners, Astra CAPSA of Argentina, Electricite de France, Societe
D'Amenagement Urbain et Rural of France, Empresa Nacional Hidroelectrica
Ribargozana of Spain, and J.P. Morgan.
   Endesa officials said the company remains strongly interested in
additional equity roles in Latin American electricity projects.

CITY ATTORNEY BLASTS TOLEDO EDISON'S NUMEROUS SPECIAL INDUSTRIAL DISCOUNTS

   Toledo Edison's practice of negotiating special discount contracts with
large industrials is coming under heavy fire from the city of Toledo as the
utility's $35.2-million electric rate case moves slowly through the Ohio
Public Utilities Commission.
   Cleveland Electric Illuminating, a Centerior Energy subsidiary as is
Toledo Edison, is seeking a $83-million rate hike. Together, the two
companies whose electric rates already are among the highest in the Midwest
are asking for $118-million (Case No. 95-300-EL-AIR) (IEB, 21 April '95,
5).
   In written comments filed recently with the PUC, the city of Toledo took
a dim view of Toledo Ed's request, especially in light of what the city
claims is an over-reliance on special contracts by the utility.
   Toledo city attorney Kerry Bruce objected to a recent PUC staff report
that recommended the commission approve the full $118-million increase for
the Centerior companies. The report, Bruce said, ``fails to consider
whether the number of incentive contracts and the magnitude of the
discounts provided violate the prohibition (under Ohio law) against the
setting of special rates.''
   According to Bruce, the report also ``fails to determine whether the
extensive use of incentive contracts to industrial customers exceeds the
purpose of retaining load and instead establishes a rate which is unjustly
discriminatory and unjustly preferential'' in violation of state law.
   Bruce asserted that more than 71% of the potential customers and 92% of
the potential kWh sales under Toledo Edison's Large Power Rate PV-44 are on
special contracts. Under such a scenario, ``it is not clear what purpose
the tariff rate serves,'' he said.
   A Toledo Edison spokeswoman acknowledged that ``yes, we do have a large
number of our large load customers on special contracts.'' She said special
contracts often are the best way to address the individual needs of
customers, not just with price but with other utility services as well.
   Of the 87 large industrials that qualify for Toledo Edison's PV-44 rate,
62 either have special contracts or are receiving the utility's economic
development rates, she confirmed. Under the PV-44 rate, a primary
transmission customer pays a monthly demand charge of $18.25/kVA for the
first 1,000 kVA, $18.05/kVA for the next 29,000 kVA and $17.16/kVA for each
additional kVA. For sub-transmission, the comparable charges per kVA are
$17.48, $17.20 and $16.18.
   Despite the relatively high rate, the number of special contracts, Bruce
told Industrial Energy Bulletin, is simply unacceptable. ``It violates
ratemaking policy to have more load under special contracts than under a
tariff,'' he said. ``It shows the company is subject to market pressures
and really can't implement its regulatory rate.''
   The Toledo Edison spokeswoman defended the special contracts.
``Obviously, it is a competitive marketplace,'' she said. Her company
``recognizes the need to keep large customers in our service area. It's
important to keep those jobs and economic development here instead of
letting it leave.''
   Bruce summed up the city's position by insisting that the utility should
not increase its rates ``because it's bad for business.'' Instead of asking
customers to pay an additional $118-million annually, both Toledo Edison
and CEI should eliminate heir dividend, he said.

ELCON DETAILS PLAN FOR RESTRUCTURING, ISSUES `ROAD MAP' TO COMPETITIVE ERA

   Industrials' major national representative on electric power issues, the
Electricity Consumers Resource Council, last week issued its detailed
``Road Map for the Transition,'' which fills in gaps that critics found in
its ``Blueprint for Customer Choice'' (IEB, 6 Oct '95, 1).
   The biggest feature of the transition document is a plan for dealing
with utilities' stranded investment. Under ELCON's proposal, utilities
would be able to recover up to 50% of their costs stranded by competition,
but in practice, few if any would be able to get back that much.
   The Edison Electric Institute quickly denounced the road map as ``full
of dead ends and some pretty deep potholes.'' EEI criticized the proposal
as a one-size-fits-all imposition of a federal structure on the country's
electric system that will benefit ELCON's members ``at the expense of
everyone else.''
   Still, the road map puts ELCON once again in the vanguard of the
restructuring movement; its proposal is the first one offered in such
detail for consideration by Congress and states as they approach major
decisions this year and next. It is surely not the last, however.
   Rep. Dan Schaefer (R-Colo.), chairman of the House energy and power
subcommittee, told Industrial Energy Bulletin Monday that the full
Commerce Committee will vote out restructuring legislation this year.
Anyone who thinks it will not do so is mistaken, he declared. He urged
input from all sectors of the industry.
   Schaefer reacted only briefly to ELCON's plan. ``I thought they brought
in some good points,'' he said, although he took issue with ELCON's
proposed three-year transition to retail competition, which he called too
fast. ``Real comprehensive legislation--you have to give it time,'' he
said. ``I'm not sure three years is the answer.'' He suggested a phased-in
approach so as not to ``upset things.''
   When ELCON released its blueprint in September, it purposely glossed
over the stranded-cost issue. Shortly thereafter, Schaefer and William
Massey of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission challenged the group to
come forward with specific proposals addressing stranded-cost recovery.
   ELCON's answer to those challenges is a five-step process featuring a
formula for dividing up responsibility for unmitigable stranded investment.
The formula assigns a ``responsibility factor'' to utilities, to be
determined by state regulators according to how efficiently a utility
responded to regulatory mandates and whether the company opposed the
mandates in the first place.
   A utility would be required to absorb at least 50% of its unmitigable
stranded costs, but in practice it probably would have to bear a greater
share. In a nutshell, the formula starts by assigning stranded costs
equally between ratepayers and shareholders, with the responsibility factor
deciding how much of the ratepayers' 50% share the utility would be
required to absorb in addition to its 50% share.
   But the formula only would be applied after state regulators conduct
what ELCON is billing as ``the last great rate case'' to determine what
sunk costs are not mitigable. In the alternative, the utility could opt to
sell its generation assets as a means of determining stranded costs.
   Stranded-cost recovery mechanisms would be subject to negotiation with
individual customers and classes of customers. Regulators would decide
recovery in the absence of a negotiated settlement. The utility would have
no more than five years to recover its stranded costs.
   ELCON executive director John Anderson called the road map's stranded
cost provisions a ``statesmanlike'' effort to end the impasse between ELCON
and EEI over stranded-cost recovery. Historically, ELCON has rejected any
level of stranded-cost recovery in response to EEI's position that
utilities are entitled to 100% recovery. With its proposal on the table,
the issue of stranded-cost recovery is now open to negotiation, Anderson
suggested.
   But EEI president Thomas Kuhn called ELCON's proposal on stranded costs
a nonstarter.
   ``I don't see that there's anything new in the ELCON proposal,'' Kuhn
said in an appearance before the Washington International Energy Group.
``We don't see a bargaining chip here at all.''
   Kuhn cited ``leading economists,'' FERC and most states as endorsing
EEI's position that utilities are entitled to 100% recovery. He predicted
that states will reject ELCON's complicated proposal.
   ELCON's road map proposes a three-year transition featuring a ``customer
election period'' based on the telephone industry experience. No later than
the mid-point of the three-year transition period, state regulators would
feature a ``Day One'' designating the beginning of the customer election
period. As of that date, every customer would have the right to choose an
electric service provider. Customers would be notified at least six months
prior to Day One of their right to switch from their utility provider.
   At the end of the transition, all generation assets will have been
removed from rate base. The generation company may continue to sell the
asset's power to its affiliated--or previously affiliated--distribution
company beyond the transition period under terms of a transition contract
approved by the state.
   Transition contracts also would provide for ancillary and backup
services to qualifying facilities under the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act. The utility PURPA Reform group criticized this aspect of the
proposal as setting the stage for ``the last great PURPA land rush.'' The
group called it inconsistent to deny utilities stranded costs while
committing them indefinitely to the purchase of QF power.
   But ELCON's Anderson rejected utility complaints about uneconomic QF
contracts as ``a thing of the past.'' No utility is entering into high-cost
contracts with PURPA facilities today, he said. The importance of PURPA's
Section 210 is not its mandatory purchase provision, but the section's
requirements that utilities provide backup and ancillary services to QFs.
   As a check against market power, ELCON's road map calls for operational
unbundling of vertically integrated utilities using the Dept. of Justice's
methodology. While free market entry is an important check, it is not
sufficient in and of itself, the group said. Transmission assets would be
turned over to an independent system operator and controls would be placed
on interaffiliate pricing of transmission services and interaffiliate
distribution transactions.
   EEI's Kuhn dismissed as ``specious'' ELCON's concerns about utility
market power and industry concentration. The electric utility industry is a
great deal less concentrated than the telephone industry or most ELCON
members, Kuhn asserted.
   ELCON further proposed that, during the first two years of the
transition, owners of FERC-regulated transmission facilities would be
required to file regional transmission group proposals. Siting of new
interstate transmission systems would become FERC's responsibility. ELCON
also proposed establishment of unregulated Private Delivery Systems, or
PDSs, such as a line linking two industrial facilities.
   If a new transmission line is built privately and without the exercise
of eminent domain, then the line would be unregulated. Owners of existing
transmission systems could petition FERC for a license to opt out from rate
regulation if the owner can show it does not exercise market power and the
line was not sited through the power of eminent domain. The unregulated
privately owned transmission facilities would provide competitive pressures
on monopoly transmission providers, ELCON suggested.
   Independent System Operator franchises would be granted for finite
periods in order to allow others the opportunity to competitively bid for
the right to serve the franchise, ELCON proposed.
   Local distribution services would be unbundled with traditional
distribution functions split between the ``wires'' business and the
electric services merchant business under the proposal.
   ELCON also proposes establishment of joint federal-state boards to make
recommendations for state legislative actions to ensure universal service.
   The road map places much of the responsibility for the outcome of the
transition with state regulators, said ELCON's Anderson. The proposal is
intended to put to rest concerns of state regulators that ELCON advocates
``federalizing the system,'' he said: ``The states are going to have a
whole lot to do'' if the road map is implemented.

NEES REACHES DEAL WITH N.H. PUC STAFF FOR WHEELING PILOT THAT WILL BEGIN IN
MAY

   New England Electric System has reached an agreement with the New
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission staff on conditions for its local
affiliate, Granite State Electric, to carry out a retail wheeling pilot
program starting in May 1996.
   NEES announced the breakthrough Jan. 5 during a briefing to the
commission on collaborative talks between the staff and all utilities in
the state on the two-year pilot, which had been proposed in October to
cover 3% of utility load.
   No other utility announced on Jan. 5 that it had come to terms with the
staff and, therefore, the commission permitted an extra week until Jan. 12
for negotiations.
   In the NEES agreement with the staff, only general outlines were made
public. But sources familiar with the deal said the two sides split the
difference on the key stranded cost issue and that Granite State would be
allowed to recoup 75% of its losses caused by the pilot.
   Granite State will use an access charge to recover the stranded cost and
said the level would be low enough to give customers a ``meaningful'' level
of savings from the pilot. Currently, Granite State's average prices are
10.3 cents/kWh for residential and 7.9 cents/kWh for industrial users.
   In its September draft guidelines, the PUC had proposed 50% recovery of
losses, and NEES and the other utilities had replied by demanding full 100%
recovery before they would cooperate on the plan.
   Once the NEES deal with the staff is formally proposed to the PUC, it is
sure to draw fire from both industrial groups that support the original 50%
level and probably Public Service of New Hampshire, which has held out for
100% recovery.
   In a statement, NEES said the agreement was meant to allow the retail
wheeling pilot proceed as scheduled in May for Granite State customers even
if it is delayed for other utilities in the state. NEES also said that once
the plan was approved by the PUC, it would communicate with its customers
about how they could participate in the pilot.
   Participants would receive unbundled rates for transmission and
distribution and could chose their power supplier. They also would continue
to receive energy conservation programs from the distributor.
   In its October proposal, the PUC allotted 3.75 MW of Granite State's
load to the statewide pilot, which would cover a total of 60 MW. PSNH is by
far the largest participant with 44 MW, although this level may be reduced
to 33 MW.
   While reaching a final deal with PSNH is clearly the top priority of the
PUC, the agreement with NEES appears to be a breakthrough that could make
it harder for PSNH to maintain a hard line in future talks.

MOJAVE PIPELINE PLANS NEW OPEN SEASON IN JAN. OR FEB. TO DECIDE FATE OF
PROJECT

   Mojave Pipeline will hold a new ``open season'' auction in January or
February, and the outcome could decide the fate of the controversial
California natural gas pipeline project.
   Mojave, the Bakersfield, Calif., subsidiary of El Paso Natural Gas, has
been trying since 1992 to break into the California market, providing the
only major transportation alternative to Pacific Gas & Electric for big
users. The line would extend from the Arizona border to Sacramento, with
laterals running to the industrial area around San Francisco Bay. With its
firm rate of 47 cents/decatherm, the line drew a number of large
industrials eager to escape PG&E's intrastate transport rates, which can
exceed $1/dt.
   But the project got bogged down by regulatory demands at both the state
and federal levels (IEB, 8 Sept, 2). Meanwhile, PG&E began discounting its
rates to large users and a number of industrials took those offers, rather
than wait out the regulatory uncertainty.
   In the most recent development, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
ordered Mojave to hold an open season for shippers on Mojave's existing
line--which only extends as far as Bakersfield--to release capacity to
prospective northward expansion customers.
   Although this does not directly affect the expansion itself, Mojave
decided to throw open the whole project to auction in order to gauge the
remaining market interest, according to president Michael Holland.
   The existing contracts call for a firm rate of 47 cents/dt, escalating
at 1% annually, for 15 years. That, however, was based on a project of 475
million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d). ``If the market supports a smaller
project, rates may hve to go higher,'' Holland said, and he added that
Mojave will need at least 325 mmcf/d to proceed at all.
   On a positive note, the recent FERC order favored Mojave on a nagging
pricing issue that threatened to repel more customers (Docket No.
CP93-258-007).
   Previously, the commission ruled that Mojave would have to file new rate
cases each year, instead of fixing 15-year contracts. But the company
complained that neither Mojave nor its customers could abide that kind of
uncertainty and the condition was overturned on rehearing.

N.J. MOVES PSE&G LGAC TO MONTH BASIS, TO LET BIG USERS PLAY MARKET BETTER

   The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has approved a proposal by
Public Service Electric & Gas to switch gas price calculations from a
yearly to a monthly basis.
   This will affect the levelized gas adjustment clause (LGAC), which lets
utilities recover their actual fuel costs. Traditionally, utilities have
updated the LGAC on an annual basis, but the market is now so vibrant, that
customers need more frequent price signals, according to the BPU.
   ``The monthly pricing scheme reflects the current market price and will
allow customers to make more informed decisions concerning their energy
needs,'' said BPU president Herbert Tate.
   With the LGAC changing on a monthly basis, large users will be able to
decide whether to buy from the utility, or from outside suppliers.
   Very large industrials mostly buy exclusively from suppliers or
marketers, using the local utility only for transportation. However,
smaller industrials may still take gas supplies from their local
utilities.
   PSE&G, which proposed the alteration, is indifferent to the price
changes, since utilities only pass along fuel costs on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, and earn no profit.

IN WHAT MAY BE PG&E'S LAST GENERAL RATE CASE, INDUSTRIALS WIN 8% ELECTRIC
CUTS

   Pacific Gas & Electric's large industrial customers will enjoy an 8%
reduction in electric rates this year while the utility also will reduce
its gas rates and pipeline tariffs for core and noncore customers and
cogenerators.
   The California Public Utilities Commission December 20 ordered PG&E to
reduce its 1996 electric rates by $434-million, or an average 5.5%, and gas
rates by $262-million, or an average 11.77%, effective January 1. The
combined rate cuts incorporated PG&E's general rate case with several other
electric and gas revenue and pipeline expansion proceedings.
   The rate cuts will be shared by all customer classes, with all classes
gaining at least 50% of the average reduction and large customers limited
to 150% of the average reduction. The PUC reduced PG&E's electric rates for
commercial and small industrial customers 7%, agricultural rates 2.6%, and
residential rates 2.9%.
   ``This is great news for PG&E customers,'' said PUC Commissioner Jessie
Knight, Jr. ``As industrial customers see lower electric costs the economy
benefits,'' as higher earnings stimulate job growth, he said
   This is expected to be PG&E's last three-year general rate case since
the PUC plans to adopt performance-based ratemaking in implementing its
electric restructuring order providing incentives for utilities to operate
more efficiently and rewarding productivity.
   The PUC has adopted a PBR mechanism for San Diego Gas & Electric and is
currently considering a PBR proposal by Southern California Edison.
Moreover, the PUC has already severed fuel costs, Diablo Canyon ratemaking,
and rate of return issues from PG&E's general rate case and reviews them in
separate proceedings.
   The PUC noted that the decision represented its first step toward
removing large commercial customers from averaging of core residential and
nonresidential gas rates and tariffs. The PUC accordingly approved a slight
shift in PG&E's gas revenue requirement from noncore to core customers.
   The commission adopted PG&E's proposal to reinstate a seasonal rate
differential for noncore industrial and cogeneration gas customers. At the
same time, the PUC rejected the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's
proposal for an unbundled backbone transmission rate, noting that PG&E
plans to unbundle tranmission and storage services.
   The PUC adopted the recommendations of Administrative Law Judge Kim
Malcolm, trimming PG&E's 1996 rates more than the utility had requested.
PG&E had proposed reducing its 1996 electric rates by $128.7-million and
its gas rates by $203.6-million.
   The utility had initially sought to reduce its electric rates by
$200.8-million and its gas rates by $119.1-million, but modified its
requests several times. PG&E has proposed rate cuts to reduce its electric
rates to 10 cents/kWh by December 1999 from its current rates of 10.5
cents/kWh.
   ``It is unusual for a utility to request substantial rate reductions in
its general rate case but a welcome one,'' PUC President Daniel Fessler
said. ``This represents significant progress (in reducting electric rates),
but it is a beginning.''
   PG&E maintained that its final revenue request was a ``bare bones''
proposal in line with its ongoing corporate-wide programs to reduce
operating costs and rates. However, ALJ Malcolm found that PG&E's estimates
of doing business in 1996 and $4.6-billion revenue requirement request were
too high. She stressed that it would be unfair for ratepayers to help
finance the utility's transition to a competitive electric industry.
   Malcolm determined that PG&E had overestimated its future costs for
nuclear decommissioning, employee compensation and pension fund, and
pipeline replacement. She also found that PG&E's timing of recovery for
fossil and geothermal decommissioning costs was unreasonable.
   The ALJ also denied PG&E's request for nearly $30-million in ratepayer
subsidies for marketing programs designed to retain customers, saying that
those costs should be paid by shareholders or customers that benefit
directly from such programs.

SOUTH CAROLINA INDUSTRIALS TO CHALLENGE BROAD RATE HIKES APPROVED FOR
SCE&G

   An industrial group in South Carolina will challenge the Public Service
Commission's late-December decision to approve virtually all of the general
rate increase requested by South Carolina Electric & Gas (Docket No.
95-1000-E).
   Arthur Fusco, a Columbia, S.C., attorney who represents the South
Carolina Energy Users Committee, said the group will urge the PSC to
reconsider several key aspects of its ruling, which granted SCE&G a 7.34%,
$67.5-million general rate increase to be implemented in two phases--a
$59.5-million hike as soon as its new, 385-MW baseload plant in Cope, S.C.,
begins commercial operation later this month, and an $8-million increase
next Jan. 1.
   The investor-owned utility had requested a two-step increase totaling
$76.7-million, or 8.35%, primarily to recoup the $436-million cost of the
Cope plant.
   The commission also said it will allow SCE&G to earn a 12% rate of
return on common equity, which is lower than the 12.25% rate the utility
had requested, but higher than both the 11% it had been permitted to earn
and the 11.25% to 11.75% range proposed by most of those who testified to
the PSC.
   Fusco took issue with the 12% rate of return, noting that even a
quarter-percent increase in that rate results in ``significantly higher''
rates for industrials and others. He also criticized the PSC's decision to
support SCE&G's proposals to establish a $50-million, customer-funded storm
damage reserve fund, and to transfer nearly $256.7-million in depreciation
reserves from the utility's transmission and distribution assets to its
nuclear generation assets.
   The depreciation-reserve shift, Fusco said, will artificially reduce
SCE&G's nuclear generation costs, but increase the utility's T&D costs and,
presumably, its transmission-access and wheeling costs. That, he continued,
would give SCE&G an unfair competitive advantage over other generators, and
will force anyone who seeks access to the utility's T&D system to pay
more.
   Belton Ziegler, SCE&G's general counsel, said the transfer is a
necessary preemptive step to ensure that any industrials that leave the
utility for other suppliers help pay for assets SCE&G had developed to
serve them.
   Without the shift, he said, residential and small-commercial customers
would likely end up paying for ``100%'' of the utility's stranded
investment, ``and we don't think that would be fair.''
   Ziegler continued, ``If you look at the natural gas industry, the
benefits of deregulation went--for the most part--to large customers who
could move off the system'' and avoid, as much as possible, the
responsibility for paying off the investments their old gas companies had
made to serve them.
   ``We are telling industrials that if they leave as generation customers
they still will have to pay [for the nuclear assets SCE&G developed for
them] as transmission and distribution customers.''
   Ziegler also dismissed assertions that the storm fund is unfair. He said
that after Hurricane Hugo battered SCE&G's service territory in September
1989, the utility looked into ways it could prepare for the next big
storm.
   ``It became clear that commercial insurance would be prohibitively
expensive, and that would make more sense to set up a fund'' like the one
the utility proposed and the PSC just approved.
   Fusco said the industrial group is likely to support the South Carolina
Dept. of Consumer Affairs' newly announced plan to ask the PSC to
reconsider its ruling.
   Nancy Vaughn Coombs, DCA's deputy consumer advocate, told Industrial
Energy Bulletin said the DCA took issue with virtually all aspects of the
PSC's ruling, asserting that the rate increase is more than three times
larger than it should be, and that South Carolina law does not allow the
creation of a storm fund like the one the commission approved.
   But Coombs said her agency is most concerned about the
depreciation-reserve transfer, which she said would have the effect of
shifting SCE&G's costs away from its generation sector, which is likely to
face increasing competition as electric-industry deregulation takes hold,
to its transmission and distribution sector, which is likely to remain a
monopoly.
   As a result, she said, SCE&G will have ``a significantly increased
probability'' of recouping--through T&D rates--nuclear investment costs
that ``otherwise would have been subjected to an uncertain policy regarding
the recovery of costs of uneconomic generation capacity.''
   Coombs said that if the commission fails to reverse this and other key
elements of its ruling, her agency is likely to file a legal challenge in
state court.

CONSUMERS INKS LONG-TERM DISCOUNT DEALS WITH THREE MICH. INDUSTRIALS

   Three large industrial firms in Consumers Power's territory have struck
long-term power agreements with the utility in exchange for specified
discounts.
   On Dec. 7, the Michigan Public Service Commission granted ex parte
approval to Consumers' request to become the sole supplier of electricity
to Dow Corning and its affiliate Hemlock Semiconductor (Case U-10997).
   The PSC also granted ex parte approval to Consumers to provide power to
Bundy Tubing on a sole-supplier basis (Case U-10995). A contract between
the utility and Pharmacia & Upjohn is pending.
   Under the agreement between Consumers and Dow Corning, Consumers will be
sole supplier over an eight-year period. Although specific dollar figures
were not disclosed, Dow said it would save several million in energy costs
over the life of the agreement.
   The deal covers three key industrial facilities and is crafted to retain
an existing load and to meet new power requirements between now and 2003.
According to a Consumers spokesman, the utility currently supplies a total
of 50 MW to Dow's corporate center, Hemlock Semiconductor and Dow's Midland
site, which contains an operating 18-MW, wood-fired cogeneration plant.
   Over the eight years of the agreement, this 50 MW gradually be increased
to 110 MW, as the cogeneration unit is shut down next year and Hemlock
Semiconductor expands its facility, the spokesman said.
   A separate agreement calls for the Midland Cogeneration Venture, a
Consumers Power affiliate, to supply approximately one billion lbs. of
steam annually to Dow Corning.
   The special contract with Bundy Tubing has an initial term of five
years, after which time it is subject to automatic renewal for successive
one-year periods. However, after the initial term either party may cancel
the contract by providing the other with timely written notice.
   The contract requires Bundy Tubing to purchase all of its electricity
from Consumers except for back-up generation. Rates and terms of the
purchase are governed by Consumers' Rate D less 15%. Rate D has a charge of
$100/customer/month and an on-peak billing demand charge of $7.85/kW. In
addition, there is a maximum demand charge of $1.85/kW for primary service,
$0.97/kW for subtransmission service and $0.52/kW for transmission
service.
   The special contract with Bundy contains provisions to encourage the
industrial to implement demand and energy savings programs. Consumers has
agreed to reimburse Bundy for the cost of such programs up to $20,000,
provided the programs are completed to Consumers' satisfaction before Jan.
1, 1996, are designed to improve the industrial firm's operations in
Coldwater, Mich., and are performed in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations.
   On Dec. 4, Consumers signed a contract with Pharmacia & Upjohn, its
second largest industrial customer, to become the sole supplier of 75 MW at
discounted rates for 10 years. The contract applies to the industrial
firm's research facility in Kalamazoo, Mich., and its manufacturing plant
in Portage, Mich.

PUC CLOSES PECO INTERRUPTIBLE RIDER; INDUSTRIALS SAY GROWTH WILL SUFFER

   The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ruled that PECO Energy may
close its interruptible rate program to new load (Docket No. R-943281). The
move was opposed by the Philadelphia Area Industrial Energy Users Group
(PAIEUG) and Scott Paper Co., who said interruptible rates help attract new
load, and that freezing the program will hurt economic development (Docket
Nos. R-943281C002 and R-943281C0003).
   The Large Interruptible Rate Option (LILR) provides a discount rate of
approximately 57%, reducing charges from PECO from 7.493 cents/kWh to 3.217
cents/kWh. Although the PUC approved an alternative rate (IR-1), this will
provide a discount of only 5%, to new interruptible customers.
   When PECO proposed freezing LILR, it asked to limit interruptible rates
to customers who were under contract by Oct 1, 1995 (IEB, 25 Aug '95, 7).
It argued that interruptible rates were meant as a load management tool.
However, the utility now has up to 1,000 MW of excess capacity, and the
value of interruptible load has diminished. Since 1984, it has only
interrupted the LILR customers 12 times, PECO pointed out.
   However, industrials responded that the interruptible program is
important for economic development, and was never meant primarily as a load
management tool. Closing out this program will deter firms from starting
new plants in PECO territory or expanding existing plants, they said. In
addition, industrials fear that PECO will use the freeze as the first step
toward phasing-out existing interruptible rates altogether--basing this
prospect on statements by the company. PAIEUG noted that some of its
members have invested millions of dollars to expand in PECO territory, with
the expectation of interruptible service.
   In its decision, the PUC pointed out that PECO has other economic
development tariffs, such as flexible rate options, and that ``PECO is
well-equipped, without the LILR, to attract new load to the territory.'' It
added that electric rates are rarely the sole decisive factor in a
company's location decision and said that LILR has only been a significant
factor in only one firm's decision to move into the area--Lukens Steel.
Taxes, transportation and telecommunications are usually more important
factors, according to the PUC.
   It added that ``Continued availability of [LILR] would...produce a
reduction in PECO's revenues, which would ultimately cause the rates of
other customer classes to increase, which would not help to preserve
existing employment and investment.'' Because the economic development
argument is ``a bald assertion'' by PAIEUG, ``there are no direct benefits
to balance the cost of providing a subsidy of over 3.5 cents/kWh to LILR
customers,'' the PUC said.
   The commission also rejected PAIEUG's assertion that interruptible
customers should not incur generation-related capital costs since the
utility does not have to plan to meet their needs--it can simply interrupt
them any time it needs the capacity. The PUC noted that these customers are
only curtailed at times of peak demand, so that interruptible load only
displaces relatively low capital-cost peaking capacity, and cannot
substitute for baseload or intermediate capacity.

N.C. MUNICIPAL SAYS COINCIDENT-PEAK RATES ATTRACT, RETAIN INDUSTRIALS

   Coincident-peak-based rates that all larger industrial customers of
Greenville, N.C.'s municipal utility must pay are not only enabling
existing industrials to lower their electric bills, they are also helping
the muni lure new industrial firms to the city.
   So says John D. Chaffee, executive director of the Pitt County
Development Commission, adding that industrials that take full advantage of
what the CP rates can offer generally pay no more--and sometimes less--than
they would for electricity from investor-owned utilities and electric
cooperatives that serve areas around Greenville.
   The Greenville Utilities Commission (GUC), as the muni is known,
purchases all its wholesale power from the North Carolina Eastern Municipal
Power Agency, which in turn buys most of its power from Carolina Power &
Light. Because a significant portion of NCEMPA's and the muni's wholesale
power costs is based on their demand during CP&L's highest systemwide
demand hour each month, the muni agency and Greenville have been working
hard to minimize their monthly peaks through, among other things,
aggressive residential load control programs, and programs to help
industrials install peak-shaving generation (IEB, 29 Dec `95, 4).
   GUC general manager Roger Jones said the Greenville muni also in
mid-1994 replaced its traditional industrial rate schedule with a new menu
of CP-only rates that all customers with a demand of 750 kW or more must
choose from.
   They include an ``A'' rate for 750 kW-plus customers whose energy use
must be relatively constant, a ``B'' rate for 750 kW-plus industrials with
more flexibility, and a ``C'' rate for 8 MW-plus customers that are
willing--and able--to make significant reductions in their energy use
during coincident-peak periods.
   Under each rate, the customer pays a basic monthly charge of $440, plus
a relatively high per-kW rate for its demand during the 60 minutes each
month when CP&L--the muni's ultimate power supplier--experiences its
highest systemwide demand. The customer also pays a much smaller per-kW
charge for difference between that coincident-peak level and its highest
demand for all that month, plus energy charges.
   For instance, under the ``C'' rate, a 8-MW customer that reduces its
coincident-peak demand to 2 MW pays the $440 basic charge, plus demand
charges of $21.34/kW on the 2-MW coincident-peak demand and $2.86/kW on the
6 MW above that level. The customer also pays an energy charge of 3.323
cents/kWh.
   ``B'' rate customers, in turn, pay demand charges of $20.16 per
coincident-peak-hour kW and $4.25/kW of demand above that level, and energy
charges of 3.583 cent/kWh for the first 250 MWH and 3.278 cents/kWh for
additional energy.
   ``A'' rate customers, finally, pay a CP-hour demand charge of $18.36/kW,
$7.77/kW for excess demand, and the same energy charges as ``B'' rate
customers.
   [The GUC typically notifies its industrial customers by automated signal
when it expects a potential coincident-peak period to be approaching; at
that point, the rate agreement says, the customer ``may utilize any means
deemed suitable to reduce its coincident peak demand,'' including, for
instance, temporary production cuts and/or the use of muni-approved
peak-shaving generators.]
   Jones said that the muni's 750-kW-plus customers, who also include some
large commercial and institutional accounts, together comprise about
one-quarter of Greenville's total energy use, and that the CP rates have
encouraged them to reduce their peak-period demand by 15 to 20% from what
it typically would have been without the coincident-peak rates.
   The magnitude of reductions in coincident-peak demand varies widely from
customer to customer, the muni manager said. Some are able only to trim
their demand slightly, while others have been ``very aggressive'' and have
slashed peak-period demand by more than 50%. For example, a large Proctor &
Gamble manufacturing plant in Greenville that typically demands about 8 MW
reduces its demand to between 1 and 1.5 MW during coincident peaks, Jones
noted, saving both P&G and the muni thousands of dollars in monthly power
costs.
   Chaffee said P&G ``basically shuts down production [during forecasted CP
hours] to achieve the maximum possible savings.'' To make the best use of
its down time, he noted, the manufacturer performs required maintenance on
its production and other equipment.
   The development commission head said his panel and GUC work closely with
potential industrial recruits to explain the CP rates and to demonstrate
precisely how the industrial could make the fullest use of the rate to its
advantage.
   Chaffee gave as an example the new automobile parts plant that Japan's
ASMO Co. Ltd. in 1994 developed--and in 1995 expanded--in Greenville. The
combined $50-million facility demands about 2.5 MW.
   ``An important issue for ASMO in deciding where to site the [initial]
plant was power costs,'' he said. ``We were able to demonstrate that by
utilizing Greenville's CP rate and installing [a 1-MW peak-shaving
generator to further reduce CP demand] that they would be paying rates
competitive with'' industrial rates offered by Duke Power and other
low-cost, investor-owned utilities in the Southeast.
   Chaffee added, finally, that in his view the CP has been a significant
factor in enabling Greenville to draw increasing numbers of new industries.
He noted that while industrial firms announced $20-million in new
investments in the city in 1992 and $33-million the year after that,
industrial investment jumped to $43-million in 1994 and $55-million in
1995--the first two years the CP rates were mandated.

MONSANTO PHOSPHORUS UNIT INKS LONG-TERM DEAL WITH UTAH P&L

   Monsanto Co. and Utah Power & Light have signed a new power supply
agreement extending to 2001 service that was scheduled to expire in
mid-1997 for Monsanto's elemental phosphorus manufacturing plant at Soda
Springs.
   Approved by the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the new agreement
includes payment of $30-million to the utility for early termination of the
existing contract, a $66,600 monthly minimum charge and 1.85 cents/kWh for
all energy delivered. (Order No. 26282).
   The new contract allows for delivery of about 1.66 billion kWh annually.
UP&L will supply Monsanto with 9 MW of firm power and up to 206 MW of
interruptible power. UP&L may interrupt or curtail service to Monsanto, its
largest Idaho customer, at any time to maintain its system integrity.
   ``The company's new agreement with Monsanto,'' the commission said,
``reflects changes required by manufacturing and supply options available
to Monsanto, and market and regulatory changes within an increasingly more
competitive electric industry.''
   Monsanto has alternatives to continuing its current levels of electric
use such as acquiring power through the Soda Springs municipal electric
system or changing to a much less energy-intensive, purified wet-acid
chemical process of producing phosphorus.
   The commission said, ``Our acceptance and approval of the proposed new
agreement should in no way be interpreted as preauthorization of retail
wheeling, accounting, ratemaking treatment or any rates other than those
specifically identified in the new agreement.''

NIPSCO INDUSTRIALS TO SEE $1.5-MILLION REFUND IN DISPUTED INSURANCE CLAIM

   Industrial customers of Northern Indiana Public Service are expected to
receive at least a $1.5-million refund from a disputed insurance settlement
stemming from the July 2, 1991, collapse of a water pipe at NIPSCO's 480-MW
Bailly coal plant on Lake Michigan.
   Bailly was knocked out of commercial operation for nearly five months
following the collapse of its main circulating water pipes leading into
Lake Michigan. The 15-foot-diameter pipes gave way while Pure Air Inc.
worked nearby to construct a $110-million scrubber at Bailly.
   During the outage, NIPSCO was forced to purchase surplus power from
other utilities at prices higher than what Bailly's industrial customers
had been paying. NIPSCO eventually recovered $9.65-million from its
insurance carrier, but flowed back only $2.75-million to compensate
ratepayers for fuel increases in excess of $6-million as a result of the
accident.
   According to industrial attorney Jack Wickes, of the Indianapolis law
firm Lewis & Kappes, ratepayers paid an additional $6.1-million in fuel
costs during Bailly's outage. Wickes told the Indiana Utility Regulatory
Commission in a hearing late last year that ratepayers should be ``made
whole'' for their higher costs, meaning they should get an additional
$3-million (Cause No. 387-06-FAC 18-S1) (IEB, 16 Dec '94, 10).
   In a 3-2 vote Dec. 19, the commission ordered NIPSCO to refund an
additional $3.35-million. The IURC based its refund amount on the actual
expenses and required the insurance proceeds to be applied first to the
increased fuel charges, which are covered by the insurance policy.
   Wickes told Industrial Energy Bulletin the order ``makes sense...
[NIPSCO] carried insurance for an eventuality that occurred and NIPSCO
wanted some of the money.'' Of the $3.35-million refund, industrials are
expected to receive at least $1.5- million because they represent ``45% to
50% of the consumption'' at the Bailly plant. The money will be refunded as
a credit on industrials' fuel-adjustment charge.
   Two commissioners--David Ziegner and Richard Klein--dissented from the
order. They agreed with the majority that a further refund was due, but
said only about $2-million should be refunded.

PA. FIRMS STRESS CHOICE OF SUPPLIERS; SEE UTILITIES CONTROLLING POWER POOL

   Pennsylvania industrials told the Public Utilities Commission that
retail competition would provide the choice of suppliers that they enjoy in
all other purchasing decisions and while a wholesale pool would provide
some rate benefits, it would be dominated by the utilities, who would keep
prices artificially high.
   The Industrial Energy Consumers of Pennsylvania (IECPA) stressed the
choice issue during testimony in the PUC's Investigation into Electric
Power Competition (Docket No. I-00940032). In that case, industrials are
calling for a six-year transition to retail competition, beginning in 1997
with customers over 5 MW (IEB, 17 Nov '95, 1).
   During recent hearings, IECPA attorney David Kleppinger, of the
Harrisburg law firm McNees, Wallace & Nurick, told the commission that
retail competition is ``a matter of sound public policy. Customer choice
will empower Pennsylvania customers with the ultimate regulator of price,
namely the competitive marketplace.'' However, customers must have direct
access to utilities' transmission and distribution systems to exercise that
choice, he added. Further, utilities should be required to provide
ancillary services on an unbundled, embedded cost-of-service basis. These
would include scheduling, dispatch, balancing, load following, voltage
support, reactive power and loss compensation.
   The issue of choice arose again when PUC commissioner John Hanger
questioned IECPA's analysis of the proposed wholesale pool. Assuming
``perfect competition,'' the pool price would be 2.67 cents/kWh, IECPA
found, but industrial witness Randall Falkenberg added that utilities
``could bid the price up to anything they want really, but I think that
they would stop at a point just a little bit below what new generation
would be''--or 3.5 to 4 cents/kWh.
   ``What is so bad about a price per kilowatt hour...of 3.5 cents/kWh or 4
cents/kWh as compared to today's prices?'' asked commissioner Hanger. Even
with another 1.2 cents added on for retail distribution, Hanger continued,
``[A]s to the prices people are paying right now in Pennsylvania, is this a
disaster?''
   Falkenberg, with the Atlanta firm Kennedy & Associates, responded, ``The
problem is how you get there. You get to that price because that is the
price at which the market-dominant utilities--principally PECO or
PP&L--decide that they want to charge. That's the problem. It's not that it
falls out of the competitive market. It's that a few people at PECO can
decide that's what we want the price to be, and they can enforce that.'' He
added that the utilities could set the price ``at a level just enough below
that a new entrant could build a generating unit at'' in order to keep out
competition.
   In a pool, Falkenberg explained, there would be seven main utility
sellers and one buyer--the independent system operator (ISO). But with
retail competition, ``what you've got is hundreds of thousands of buyers,
each one playing off one seller against another.''
   The hearings also covered stranded investment. IECPA argued that these
costs should be shared, with ratepayer contributions limited to costs that
result directly from deregulation, and which cannot be mitigated by
utilities. Industrials would probably be willing to bear some cost of
mitigation strategies such as accelerated depreciation of plants and
buyouts of overpriced contracts from non-utility generators, according to
Falkenberg. Utilities might also mitigate stranded costs by selling assets
and downsizing, he added.
   The PUC expects to wrap up the case by April, when it will make
recommendations to the governor and legislature.

ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BACKS RETAIL ACCESS IN N.Y.; NO GUARANTEE ON STRANDED
COSTS

   Several New York legislators, including the speaker of the assembly,
have proposed an electric restructuring plan that would open up retail
competition by the year 2000, but the plan would not give utilities any
guarantee that they could recover all of their stranded investments--a
position that industrials have long taken.
   Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver announced the proposal last
week, along with Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman and Energy
Committee Chair Paul Tonko. An aide to Silver said that legislation is
being drafted and is expected to be introduced by the middle of January.
Sponsors would then be sought for a senate version of the bill.
   The ``Competition Plus'' plan would immediately freeze electric rates,
and would phase-in competition over the next seven years. The first phase
of the transition would begin in September 1997, when all utilities would
be required to purchase power in a competitive wholesale market. In the
second phase, beginning in September 2000, all customers would be allowed
to choose their power suppliers, and utilities would be required to provide
transmission and distribution service. In September 2002, utilities would
be required to divest their generating resources.
   A key aspect of the plan is that it would provide ``no guarantee that
utilities will recover all previously incurred costs.'' The stranded
investment issue is one of the biggest disputes in the restructuring
debate. Utilities demand full recovery of stranded costs, saying they have
been required to build enough capacity to meet load forecasts, and that
regulators approved the expensive projects, such as nuclear plants, that
could become financial millstones in the competitive market.
   Industrials, however, argue that many high costs result from
mismanagement and that utility shareholders should absorb some of the
burden. They say utilities should only be allowed to collect costs that
result directly from deregulation and which cannot be mitigated (IEB, 3 Nov
`95, 10).
   The legislators' initiative comes as the Public Service Commission moves
toward resolution of the ``Competitive Opportunities'' proceeding (Case No.
94-E-0952). It challenges the recent ruling in that case by Administrative
Law Judge Judith Lee, who recommended only wholesale competition until some
unspecified date when retail competition is proven not to harm small
ratepayers and reliability. Industrials bitterly condemned that decision,
saying it preserves the status quo and lets utilities control the direction
of change (IEB, 29 Dec `95, 4).
   In announcing the proposal, Assemblyman Tonko stated, ``As the electric
industry moves to a competitive environment, it is clear that the
legislature has a role in the process. Lessons learned from around the
country--specifically in California and the New England states--indicate
that a purely administrative solution to this complex challenge will not
achieve the desired goal of reducing energy prices.''

INDUSTRIAL DSM SEEN GETTING CUSTOMIZED, INCLUDING HELP ON PRODUCTION,
POLLUTION

   Utilities must transform their industrial demand-side management
programs to meet the demands of the competitive market, according to a new
report. This means shifting from a ``resource procurement'' focus to a
customer service approach, says IRT Environment Inc., a Basalt, Colo.,
information and consulting firm.
   IRT states that ``Utilities must provide enhanced, rather than reduced,
services to their industrial customers to satisfy them as customers in a
direct-access environment.'' It notes that industrials are utilities
``least captive'' customers, with options for fuel switching, cogeneration,
and shifting loads to other regions. Therefore, utilities must heed their
complaints about rate-subsidized DSM, the report says. Most big
manufacturers have been pursuing conservation for years, so they see
rate-based DSM as a form of socialism to subsidize others--including
competing industrial firms that have not taken the same initiative.
Utilities should also realize that prescriptive rebates are not appropriate
for industrial users, the report adds. Up to now, utilities have generally
provided industrials very basic services, such as audits and rebates for
motors and lighting. But process work has not been widespread, partly
because processes vary greatly from industry to industry and from firm to
firm. This demands customized approaches, which should include not just
energy efficiency, but help with power quality, productivity improvements
and environmental compliance.
   Some industrials interviewed for the report doubted that utilities can
provide effective energy services, since they have no entrepreneurial
skills. They think utilities can best promote efficiency through
information, rate design and financing. However, some utilities are
contracting with or even acquiring existing energy service companies.
Others may use consultants with expertise in particular industries to help
their customers.
   The report, ``Industrial Efficiency Programs: Building Strategic
Partnerships,'' is available for $100 from The Results Center, IRT
Environment Inc., P.O. Box 2239, Basalt, Colo. 81621; (970) 927-3155.

INDIANA QUARRY'S REQUEST FOR SERVICE FROM PSI ENERGY OVER CO-OP IS
APPROVED

   Citing reliability concerns, an Indiana industrial has prevailed in its
request to the state Utility Regulatory Commission to be served by PSI
Energy, the state's largest electric company, instead of a small rural
electric cooperative (Cause No. 40008).
   In a mid-December ruling the URC authorized PSI to serve a 1.1-MW load
at U.S. Aggregates' Delphi Quarry, a limestone and gravel quarry near
Delphi, Ind., over the objections of Carroll County Rural Electric
Membership Corp.
   Kenneth Robinson, vice president of operations for U.S. Aggregates, said
his company bought the quarry in 1993 and has been expanding it. The
current site consists of a ``primary'' plant located in Carroll County's
service territory and a ``secondary'' plant located in PSI's territory.
   U.S. Aggregates based its preference for PSI on a number of factors: The
present service from PSI has been good; PSI's energy-only rates with no
demand charge, allowing U.S. Aggregates to forecast its usage and utility
costs accurately; PSI offers a larger industrial base and more stable rates
in the future; U.S. Aggregate's concern with possible brown-outs during the
summer, its peak season; and its belief that PSI's capacity and resources
ensure a continuity of service, even during peak demand periods.
   Carroll County manager Ron Kennedy told the URC that even though his
co-op only has five industrial customers, those customers comprise 35% of
its total load. One customer, Indiana Packers, has a peak demand of 5 MW.
   Also, Carroll County, apparently to quell concerns over the possibility
of outages, noted that its office is located only one-half mile from the
Delphi Quarry. The commission issued its ruling somewhat grudgingly, saying
it discourages the practice of ``rate shopping'' by electric utility
customers. The URC said it has been ``reluctant to base determinations of
public convenience and necessity matters relative to service boundary
disputes on rate differentials.''
   To do so, ``could encourage `rate shopping' at the expense of prudent
planning and good utility practice.'' In this case, however, the URC agreed
with U.S. Aggregates that PSI ``can better provide adequate and reliable
service.'' The investor-owned utility, a subsidiary of CINergy Corp., has a
``marginal benefit'' with regard to reliability over the co-op.
   A URC spokeswoman stressed that the agency's comments about ``rate
shopping'' do not mean the commission is necessarily opposed to retail
wheeling. ``We have to go by our interpretation of the existing law,'' she
said. ``Until and unless we have a different direction from the
Legislature, we have to follow existing laws.''

WEPCO IN DISPUTE WITH UPPER PENINSULA POWER OVER SERVING MINE EXPANSION

   Wisconsin Electric Power and Upper Peninsula Power are currently in
settlement talks trying to resolve a dispute over a proposed retail
wheeling agreement that would have allowed WEPCO to supply electricity to
the White Pine mine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula--one of UPPCo's current
customers.
   White Pine is one of the facilities of Copper Range--a corporation
engaged in the mining, refining, and selling of copper in the UP. It
consists of an underground copper mine and related ore processing
facilities located in Carp Lake Township, Ontonagon County, Michigan.
   Until recently, the mine utilized two 20 MW coal-fired generating units
to supply most of its electric energy requirements while occasionally
purchasing small amounts of energy from UPPCo.
   In its application to the Michigan Public Service Commission for
approval of a special contract with the mine, WEPCO said that because of
increased competition, White Pine began exploring the possibility of
expanding its mining operations or, in the alternative, temporarily
shutting down the mine in order to install a new ``solution'' mining
project while pursuing the construction of a new smelter.
   Solution mining injects a slightly acidic liquid into the rock
formations and brings the copper up in liquid form, to be recovered later
as a precipitate.
   Whether White Pine expands operations or builds a new smelter, it has
concluded that the best way to reduce its operating costs, protect jobs,
and provide the greatest likelihood for expanded operations in the future
is to shut down its generating plant and purchase electricity from WEPCO,
the utility stated in its special contract application.
   If approved, WEPCO would supply curtailable electric service to White
Pine. However, WEPCO does not have transmission facilities to serve
increased loads so in order to service to the mine, the utility, on June 1,
entered into a joint use transmission agreement with UPPCo that would
obviate any necessity for WEPCO to build new facilities to serve the mine
until the new smelter is built.
   In its special contract application, WEPCO stated that it was seeking no
certificated authority to render retail service to any resident or business
in Carp Lake Township other than White Pine. The utility also told the PSC
that the proposed agreement was advantageous to the mine because WEPCO
might buy the mine's generating plant.
   UPPCo said it entered into the joint use transmission agreement with
WEPCO at a time when it was believed that UPPCo's transmission facilities
alone would, in the future, be unable to provide reliable service to While
Pine. UPPCo noted that if the mine had shut down its two generating units,
installed the new ``solution'' mining project, and constructed the new
smelter, demand might have increased to more than 100 MW. UPPCo does not
have transmission facilities in place that are capable of serving loads of
this magnitude and an investment would have been required to construct such
facilities. To make such an investment ``in a volatile industry would have
created a substantial risk for a small utility such as UPPCo,'' the company
told the PSC in its petition to intervene.
   When it learned that WEPCO was willing to assume the risk of building
new transmission facilities, UPPCo said it decided to cooperate with the
larger utility and entered into the joint use agreement.
   However, according to UPPCo, there has been a subsequent change in
circumstances that makes the joint use agreement no longer ``necessary or
appropriate'' for its purposes. Specifically, Copper Range shut down its
White Pine mining operations, including the 40 MW generating plant,
retaining only the experimental solution mining project and maintenance
operations.
   ``As a result, the resulting curtailed White Pine mine load can be
adequately served by UPPCo over its existing transmission facilities, and
the participation of Wisconsin Electric is no longer necessary or
desirable,'' UPPCo told the PSC in its intervention petition. Accordingly,
UPPCo asked the PSC not to approve WEPCO's special contract petition.
   In a similar argument before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
UPPCo declared that the changed circumstances led it to decide not to file
the joint use agreement with FERC and that WEPCO was not authorized to file
the agreement on UPPCo's behalf. Regulatory proceedings at both FERC and
the PSC are on hold, pending the outcome of settlement talks, sources
said.

MAINE PS WINS APPROVAL FOR DISCOUNTS FOR INDUSTRIALS CREATING NEW LOAD

   Maine Public Service has won approval from the Maine Public Utilities
Commission for a new targeted economic development rate that would give
temporary discounts for new and existing industrial customers creating new
load.
   Under a special rate proposal approved Dec. 1 (Doc. No. 95-802), new
customers with average demand of at least 50 kW who take full load from MPS
will get a credit on their monthly bills equal to 20% the first year of the
contract, 15% the second year, 10% the third year and 5% the fourth year.
   Also, existing customers adding at least 20 kW of new load and meet
other criteria will receive 20% credits for the new supplies in the first
and second contract years, 15% in the third year and 10% in the fourth
year.
   The PUC said it would cap the special credits at a cumulative amount of
20 MW of new supplies and that requests for the discounts for individual
customers would be considered in the order they were received.
   At the same time, the PUC approved a separate 10% permanent discount for
agricultural storage facilities, which will especially help the local
potato industry. In both cases, the PUC also ordered that any revenue
losses due to the discounts will be borne totally by MPS shareholders and
not ratepayers.
   Early in 1995, MPS asked the PUC for an 18.5% rate hike spread over five
years to meet revenue losses caused by the closing of a local air base and
loss of a major wholesale customer. In November, the PUC approved a
four-year, 12.8% hike but left open for a decision next year how the costs
will be allocated among customer classes. MPS has asked that the main
burden be placed on residential users, to bring industrial rates more in
line with cost-of-service levels.
   The new discounts will enable the company to partially offset the cost
of the rate hike for new and expanding businesses and aid industrial
recruiting while the allocation issue is being debated. They also may help
bring new industrial users to the former Loring Air Force Base and restore
some of the revenues lost due to the closure.
   In early January, MPS said it had signed its first economic development
contract under the new system with the Happy Farms cold storage facility in
Caribou, Me. It said the company had increased business activity and load
needs and qualified for the discounts starting at 20% and dropping to 10%
by the fourth year.

SIGECO CREDITS DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOR WINNING MAJOR NEW TOYOTA PLANT

   Toyota Motor Corp.'s decision to build a $700-million truck assembly
plant near Princeton, Ind., is expected to generate a 25-30 MW electric
load, at least initially, for Southern Indiana Gas & Electric, and if
history is any guide, the load is likely to increase dramatically over the
years.
   SIGECO credited its economic development efforts with contributing to
Toyota's choice of a 1,100-acre site in Gibson County for its new plant
instead of competing sites in Kentucky, Ohio and other parts of Indiana.
All of the site, located along U.S. 41 about 20 miles north of Evansville,
is within SIGECO's service territory. PSI Energy, another IOU, serves an
area just north of the plant site.
   In announcing their selection of the Princeton site, Toyota officials
said the plant would employ 1,300 people and begin producing pickup trucks
in 1998. SIGECO worked closely with the Princeton Chamber of Commerce,
which played a vital role in building a relationship with Toyota, as well
as regional economic development agencies and state government, including
the Indiana Department of Commerce.
   The utility will be building additional transmission facilities,
including a transmission line extension and a new substation, to serve
Toyota. Likewise, SIGECO also will be making similar enhancements to its
natural gas system.
   Although SIGECO would not disclose the plant's projected load, Toyota's
automotive assembly plant near Georgetown, Ky., about 200 miles away,
started out with an approximately 30 MW load in the mid-1980s. Since then,
Toyota has built a second plant at Georgetown, and the site's total load
has mushroomed to 112 MW.
   Kentucky Utilities, which serves the plant, said Toyota's electrical
usage has increased from 166,055,040 kilowatt hours in 1989 to 552,122,640
kilowatt hours in 1994.

WABASH VALLEY REORGANIZES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RATES FOR INDUSTRIALS

   The Wabash Valley Power Assn. has restructured its economic development
rates, replacing its old catch-all EDR-2 rate with three rates designed to
appeal to a broader range of industrial and commercial customers.
   Wabash Valley's three new EDR tariffs were contained in a settlement
agreement recently approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission
(Cause No. 40298). ``In some ways, we're modeling what we're doing on what
PSI/CINergy is doing'' in the area of economic development, said a Wabash
Valley spokesman. PSI Energy is headquartered in Plainfield, Ind., just a
few miles from Wabash Valley's Indianapolis office.
   Under its EDR-2 rate, only new customers with a load in excess of 750 kW
could qualify for its provisions: a demand charge of $10.70/kW for
distribution and $9.70/kW for transmission and an energy charge of 18.81
mills. The discount rate expired after three years. Now, eligible new loads
or existing plant expansions can obtain the revised rates for five years.
   The new EDR-3 rate applies to loads from 300 kW to 749 kW, a load that a
machine shop or Laundromat might have. It carries a demand charge of
$10.72/kW for distribution and $972/kW for transmission and an energy
charge of 18.733 mills.
   The new EDR-4 rate applies to loads from 750 kW to 1.499 MW. It carries
a demand charge of $8.45/kW for distribution and $7.45/kW for transmission
and an energy charge of 17.571 mills. The final rate--EDR-5--applies to
loads in excess of 1.5 MW. This rate is negotiable on a case-by-case
basis.
   Wabash Valley, a generation and transmission cooperative that plans to
emerge in 1997 from more than a decade in Chapter 11 reorganization
proceedings, negotiated the terms of the new tariffs with the state Office
of the Utility Consumer Counselor. Wabash Valley and the OUCC said the new
EDRs are intended to encourage new and expanded industrial and commercial
loads to locate or remain in Indiana.
   ``Based upon this and the evidence presented, the proposed tariffs are
found by this commission to be in the public interest,'' ruled the IURC.
   The Wabash Valley spokesman said the new rates should help the co-op
compete for business against other utilities in a deregulated industry.
``We're stepping up to the plate, and we're going to become as much of a
player in this as anyone else.''

TROUBLED VERDIGRIS VALLEY CO-OP DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT

   Verdigris Valley Electric Cooperative, its economic development
subsidiary and four current and former trustees have formally denied
allegations of gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of
state and federal laws or regulations in connection with one of the largest
economic development losses ever sustained by a distribution co-op.
   The allegations were raised in a class action lawsuit filed in October
by Cal McKinney, a member and harsh critic of the Collinsville, Okla.-based
co-op that in October 1993 announced a $5.68-million writeoff from an
economic development loan to Precision Tubulars, a metalworking firm that
went bankrupt without ever reaching full production (District Court of
Tulsa County, Case No. CJ-95-04552) (IEB, 20 Oct, 11).
   McKinney's suit was designed to make co-op members financially whole.
   In his answer on behalf of the co-op, Tulsa attorney Stephen Riley also
asserted that losses from the Precision deal were ``due to circumstances
beyond [the defendants'] control.'' He also asserted that an Oklahoma law
requiring member approval before a co-op can encumber or otherwise dispose
of a ``substantial'' portion of its assets does not apply in this case.
   The co-op admits to loaning Precision $6.79-million, but it denies that
this constituted a substantial portion of its assets. VVEC's current annual
report lists total assets of $57-million.
   Riley also contended that McKinney lacks standing to represent other
co-op members and that the suit is barred by the two-year statute of
limitations. He said McKinney knew or should have known of the losses to
VVEC members before it was officially announced at the October 1993 annual
meeting because of news accounts of Precision's problems starting in 1991.
   Riley said that former general manager Doyle Fulton and five current and
former trustees also named as defendants are not covered by the answer
because they have not yet been officially served with copies of the
lawsuit. An amended answer will be filed once they are served, he said.
   Riley's answer listed nine grounds on which he contends the suit should
be dismissed but also indicated that the defendants acknowledge a need for
further discovery and investigation. No procedural schedule has been set
for the case, but the discovery process is expected to be lengthy and
complex.
   This litigation marks the first time that all aspects of the Precision
deal and VVEC's involvement in it have been subject to court review. A
Washington County civil case involving much narrower issues generated one
of the largest court files in that county's history.

NYPA ASKS PSC TO KEEP OTHER UTILITIES FROM COMPETING ON INDUSTRIAL RATES

   The New York Power Authority (NYPA) has asked the New York Public
Service Commission to prevent other utilities in the state from offering
industrial incentive rates that compete with its economic development
programs. It warns that if investor-owned utilities cut rates to
industrials, other ratepayers will absorb the burden of the lost revenues,
while those customers would suffer no such impact from the NYPA discount
rates.
   Although NYPA mainly supplies wholesale power to utilities and public
agencies, it provides some low-cost power directly to industrials under an
economic development program set up by the state Legislature. This power
comes from the FitzPatrick nuclear plant and is normally given to firms
that pledge to create or retain a certain number of jobs. It runs about 4
cents/kWh, and the industrials must then pay wheeling charges to their
local utilities for delivery.
   NYPA now complains that some utilities are competing with those economic
development rates, and it wants the PSC to stop them. It has asked the
commission to review the economic development tariffs of Rochester Gas &
Electric (Case No. 94-E-0757), Niagara Mohawk Power (Case No. 94-E-0651)
and New York State Electric & Gas (Case No. 94-E-0990).
   In its petition to the PSC, NYPA states, ``The rationale for this
commission having barred the use of flexible rates to compete with
NYPA's...was clear--to avoid a conflict between complimentary state
policies encouraging the expansion and retention of business and to assure
that customers did not unduly benefit by playing suppliers off each other
to obtain discounts subsidized by other customers.''
   NYPA's petition was triggered by a dispute with RG&E over Amplaco Inc.,
a plastic molding company in the Rochester, N.Y., area. In March of this
year, NYPA trustees approved a 350-kW allocation for the firm, which agreed
to create 29 jobs and protect 186 existing positions. The NYPA allocation
was expected to save the firm $49,000 annually on its electric bills. But
in May, Amplaco notified NYPA that it intended to take power from RG&E at
an undisclosed, negotiated rate.
   NYPA responded that, ``Amplaco was satisfied with the rate it had
obtained from the authority and was prepared to make the job commitments
associated therewith. The state's economy therefore gained nothing from
RG&E's flex rate response.''
   RG&E has not formally responded to NYPA's petition, but a utility
spokesman stressed that the company's shareholders will pick up the lost
revenues for the Amplaco discount, not other ratepayers. Nevertheless,
retaining the manufacturer will help other ratepayers because lost load
forces remaining customers to absorb stranded fixed costs. The move will
also benefit the local economy.
   In earlier discussions of the issue, industrial group Multiple
Intervenors had asserted that the PSC should encourage utilities to compete
as much as possible, including with NYPA. The group is not actively
involved in the NYPA-RG&E dispute.

A PUBLIC MEETING ON GAS VALUATION ISSUES IS SET FOR JAN. 22 in Houston. The

A PUBLIC MEETING ON GAS VALUATION ISSUES IS SET FOR JAN. 22 in Houston. The
Minerals Management Service said the session is meant to gather public
comment on a proposed rulemaking, published in the Nov. 6 Federal Register,
which would implement the recommendations of the Federal Gas Valuation
Negotiated Rulemaking Committee. The panel's recommendations would amend
the rules governing the value of gas produced from federal leases.
   MMS also extended the comment period on the proposed rule until Feb. 5.
   For more information on the meeting, contact MMS' David Guzy at (303)

WESTERN STATES PLAN TO MEET OVER POSSIBLE ADOPTION OF BLM ROLES

By:
Sheryl Morris

Representatives of several Western oil and gas producing states will meet
later this month near Denver to discuss a proposal by the Clinton
administration to relinquish some of the Bureau of Land Management's
inspection and enforcement functions to the states.
Although larger producing states like New Mexico and Wyoming still have
some unanswered questions over the proposal, they believe the plan has some
merit.
   The meeting will be the first for the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact
Commission's BLM Oil and Gas Inspection and Enforcement Transfer Committee
since an organizational session at the IOGCC annual meeting in Houston last
month. Ten states have representatives on the special panel.
   Committee member, William LeMay, described the upcoming Denver session
as a ``strategy meeting'' to formulate an IOGCC consensus for presentation
to the administration. LeMay is the director of the New Mexico Oil
Conservation Division and the New Mexico governor's designated
representative to IOGCC.
   ``We think a lot of those [I&E] functions could be performed more
economically and efficiently at the state level,'' LeMay said. The key
elements, he added, are adequate funding and site-specific regulations.
   ``The same thing that's required on federal lands on the California
coastline wouldn't apply to some of the deserts in New Mexico,'' LeMay
pointed out in urging tailored regulations. ``We don't want to just be an
enforcement arm of federal rules and regulations,'' he added.
   Wyoming may be interested in the transfer if the move saves money and
both the federal government and the state benefit, said another committee
member, Donald Basko, supervisor of the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation
Commission.
   ``But if we have to follow in their footsteps'' as the land manager and
no savings result, ``then there may be no interest in taking it over,''
Basko said. ``We can maybe accomplish the same thing with fewer people and
less money, but that remains to be seen.''
   As part of Vice President Gore's campaign to re-invent government, the
Interior Dept. last year proposed the transfer of some BLM I&E functions,
as well as the abolishment of the Minerals Management Service. The latter
would have included distribution of MMS royalty functions to states and
transfer of the MMS offshore program to another agency.
   When the so-called MMS ``devolution'' was hastily retracted in the face
of intense criticism, states were caught somewhat flatfooted (IE/FL, 7 Aug,
14).
   LeMay acknowledged some fear now that Interior may repeat the MMS
scenario; what he called a ``whoops, we're sorry'' withdrawal of the
proposal involving the BLM activities.
   ``We put a lot of effort'' into studying the MMS abolishment and how New
Mexico might assume the royalty function on federal lands within its
borders, said LeMay, who noted that state officials felt Interior did not
act in ``a lot of good faith'' in offering and then retracting the MMS
plan. Because MMS is the royalty center for Interior and the BLM I&E issue
is tied to costs and revenues, there may be ``some resurrection of those
arguments'' about MMS and state assumption of royalty duties, LeMay said.
   Wyoming ranks first in revenue on mineral royalties from federal lands,
and New Mexico has the largest number of wells on federal tracts, LeMay
said in explaining the particular interest of the two states in maximizing
efficiency in governing those properties.
   While the administration has suggested the I&E transfer, LeMay said,
``we kind of need to tighten it up'' in terms of how the move would be
accomplished. States want answers regarding potential savings, funding
options and personnel needs, he said. ``Each state may have a little
different viewpoint,'' LeMay noted, but the object is consensus ``so we do
not have five or six of the largest states each proposing something
different.''
   Nevada's representative on the committee said ``conceptually it makes a
lot of sense for states to play a greater role in I&E on public lands
because, for the most part, many of us are either doing it concurrently or
doing that work in some sort of cooperative memorandum of understanding
with BLM right now.''
   Russell Fields, administrator of the Nevada Division of Minerals,
pointed out that his state and BLM have an MOU to reduce duplication and
effort. Were the state to take a larger role, it would have to be
``adequately compensated for work done on federal lands,'' he said.
   Beyond I&E, states may be ``interested in what other oil and gas
functions they rightfully should take on,'' Fields said, such as authority
to issue and maintain leases and collect royalties.
   Nevada would not be interested ``in just becoming the cops for the
feds,'' Fields said. States may be more interested if the government wants
something more than just I&E transfer, Fields said, such as an integrated
program with the goal of more efficient use of resources.
   The I&E Committee session is slated for Jan. 26 in Aurora, Colo. Other
states represented on the panel include Utah, Louisiana, California, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Nebraska.

WILDERNESS SOCIETY FINDS NEW CONGRESS `WORST EVER' ON ENVIRONMENT

Support for bills to open the Arctic National Wildlife coastal plain to oil
and gas development and reform the Endangered Species Act are just two
elements of a grievous environmental record that makes the 104th Congress
the ``worst Congress ever,'' The Wilderness Society has charged in a new
report.
   ``The hard-liners in this Congress make James Watt look timid,''
Wilderness Society President Jon Roush said in releasing the study Dec. 27.
``They have a playbook written by the mining, logging, and ranching
industries, and they're hacking away at everything except the subsidies
enjoyed by those industries.''
   In the report, the Society termed the new Congress ``a worse
environmental accident than the Exxon Valdez,'' and said the ``election of
many zealots whose allegiance is to the extractive industries'' threatens
many of the nation's natural resource treasures.
   The study singled out for criticism the record of some newly powerful
lawmakers, including Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House
Resources Committee, Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, chairman of the House
Resources subcommittee on national parks, forests and lands, Rep. John
Doolittle, R-Calif., chairman of the House Resources subcommittee on water
and power resources, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee, and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations interior subcommittee.
   The leadership changes have placed in power members who have tried for
years to rewrite environmental protection laws, the society warned.
   ``The most threatening aspect of this realignment is that the
development-at-all-costs Alaskan delegation heads both resources
committees,'' the report said. In addition, should Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, replace retiring Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., as chair of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, the Wilderness Society warned that
``[s]enators casting swing votes will be under enormous pressure to go
along with the Alaskan delegation's agenda.''
   Environmental groups have strenuously opposed any oil development in the
1.5-million-acre ANWR coast plain, but the Alaska delegation managed to
include language authorizing ANWR leasing in the budget reconciliation
package that President Clinton vetoed last month. The future of the
provision remained uncertain last week as Congress and the president
continued discussions on the budget and partial government shutdown.
   The GOP-led Congress appears intent on gutting the nation's endangered
species statute, the report added, with major ESA reform bills introduced
by Sens. Gorton (S. 768) and Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho, (S. 1364), and Reps.
Young and Richard Pombo, R-Calif., (H.R. 2275).
   While the three bills differ, the report charged they all would allow
some species to go extinct, curtail ESA's protections of species' habitat
on private land, limit protection for subspecies, and require taxpayers to
pay developers not to destroy habitat if protections would diminish the
property value.
   The report also attacked the language in two FY-96 Interior
appropriations bills, both vetoed by the president, that would place a
temporary moratorium on listing of new endangered species and designation
of critical habitat.
   Republican lawmakers' intent to dismantle the National Biological
Service also drew criticism, as The Wilderness Society noted the opposition
of extractive industries and real estate interests to NBS. The service was
created by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in 1993 to consolidate the
biological science expertise within the department.
   NBS would be eliminated and its functions transferred to the U.S.
Geological Survey under the Interior appropriations measures vetoed by
Clinton.
   In other complaints, the report objected to what it termed ``give-away''
legislation, supported by some GOP lawmakers, that would allow states to
take over Bureau of Land Management lands within their borders. It also
attacked ``takings'' measures passed in the House and by the Senate
Judiciary Committee that would compensate landowners when environmental
protection actions by the government degrades their property values.
   Lifting of the Alaskan oil export ban was folly, the report added. While
Stevens argued for repeal of the ban, saying it forced shipment of Alaskan
crude to West Coast markets where it created a glut and depressed prices,
the report noted the senator, in contrast, ``insists that there is an oil
shortage'' when he advocates drilling of ANWR.
   The Society group noted, overall, ``The most important question as 1995
turns to 1996 is probably how vigilant and outspoken Americans will be'' on
environmental issues. It said polls indicate the ``public is firmly
committed to environmental protection and wants to see more progress rather
than an unraveling of current law.''
   The report, ``The Worst Congress Ever: A Review of the Environmental
Record of the 104th Congress at Mid-point and the Outlook for 1996,'' is
available from The Wilderness Society at (202) 833-2300.

OSM PLANS TO CONDUCT EMERGENCY INSPECTIONS IF FURLOUGH CONTINUES

A limited number of federal inspectors will visit surface mines on federal
and Indian lands on an emergency basis this week if the partial government
shutdown continues, Office of Surface Mining Deputy Director Ed Kay said
Thursday.
   Fewer than 10 OSM inspectors will likely be involved in the effort after
they have been designated essential personnel by agency officials.
   The reason for the special designations is that ``nothing is being
done'' to oversee lands where OSM has the primary inspection function
because of the government closure, Kay said. Partial visits are needed ``to
make sure everything is okay,'' the deputy director added, noting that the
Interior Dept. solicitor has approved such inspections on a limited basis.
   Although primacy states conduct the necessary inspections within their
borders, OSM is responsible for assuring health and safety on lands in
Washington and Tennessee, where it is the primary enforcer, as well as on
Indian lands in New Mexico and Arizona and federal lands in Kentucky.
   At OSM's Western Region Coordinating Center in Denver, processing of 100
Indian and 50 federal permits has stopped, its director, Richard Seibel,
said.
   The federal shutdown may also hamper issuance of permits by states,
which have been unable to use OSM's Applicant Violator System since the
agency closed, Seibel said. States check companies through AVS for
outstanding permit violations before issuing new permits, he noted. Losing
access to AVS may delay the states' issuance of new permits.
   OSM is dealing with emergency situations with a skeleton staff, Kay
said. The fact that most surface-mining crises occur during other parts of
the year, when there is typically more rain, makes coping with the current
situation somewhat easier for the agency, he added.

CONSERVANCY FINDS ONE-THIRD OF NATION'S PLANTS, ANIMALS THREATENED

The Nature Conservancy issued a 1996 species report card last week in which
it warned that the survival of one-third of the nation's plants and animals
is threatened, particularly those species dependent on rivers, lakes and
streams. More than 500 scientists examined more than 20,000 U.S. species.
   The troubles of freshwater aquatic species were attributed to poor water
quality and long-term effects of dams and other water diversions. ``These
figures clearly show that efforts to protect the nation's water quality
will not only benefit people, but also these species,'' said John Sawhill,
president and chief executive of the Nature Conservancy.
   The data compiled in the annual report is used by federal and state
resource managers to decide on land use, and by private businesses and
individuals to design projects that do not harm sensitive species and
habitat, the Conservancy said.
   The Conservancy described the report, ``Priorities for Conservation:
1996 Annual Report Card for U.S. Plant and Animal Species,'' as the ``most
comprehensive assessment to date on the conservation status of U.S.
species.''
   The group found that one species, the Merriam's Bearpaw Poppy, a desert
wildflower, is doing better than thought. The wildflower is more abundant
on a Nevada military base than previously known, it said.
   ``Based on this find by Conservancy botanists, the plant probably will
not need to be listed under the federal Endangered Species Act,'' the group
said.
   The animal groups listed as most at risk were: freshwater mussels,
crayfish, freshwater fish, and amphibians.
   The report was a NatureServe publication, sponsored by Canon U.S.A. Inc.
as part of its Clean Earth Campaign. Information on the report is available
from the Conservancy's Larry Carpman at (703) 841-8740.

THE DEADLINE IS MARCH 7 TO FILE COMMENTS ON SURETY RULES under revision by

THE DEADLINE IS MARCH 7 TO FILE COMMENTS ON SURETY RULES under revision by
the Minerals Management Service. The agency said it is considering creation
of a deadline of two years for all Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas
lessees to bring their bond coverage into compliance with new levels of
coverage established in 1993.
   The proposed regulations would clarify MMS' position that ``assignees,
assignors, and co-lessees are jointly and severally liable for compliance''
with OCS lease requirements. The rules also would establish a framework for
lease-specific abandonment accounts and acceptance of a third-party
guarantee, and would update the bond coverage required for right-of-way
holders and geological and geophysical exploration permittees.
   MMS said the changes were needed in order to ``reduce the risk of
default by an underfunded company operating a lease or holding a
right-of-way.''
   For more information, contact Gerald Rhodes of the MMS engineering and
technology division at (703) 787-1609.

DOE ISSUES FINAL RFP FOR HANFORD WORK

By:
Mary Powers, Birmingham, Ala.

DOE Thursday released a final request for proposals for a five-year
management and integration contract at its Hanford Site that for the first
time includes specific performance objectives and measures.
   The RFP is the latest large site management contract issued under the
agency's two-year-old contract reform initiative and is the first to
include performance objectives specified by DOE. Until now, DOE has relied
on bidders to propose such benchmarks.
   DOE said it will attach incentives to a number of the performance
measures to reward contractors for making progress toward cleanup. The
complete fee structure is open for negotiation, however, and will be
proposed by each bidder. Proposals could include a base fee or could be
100% incentive fee. ``We don't want to discourage any innovative thinking
by bidders,'' said a DOE spokesman. The contract has an estimated value of
$4.6 billion over its five-year duration.
   The language in the final RFP was strengthened from that contained in a
draft RFP released last year to emphasize cost-effective innovative
approaches and to include cost reductions in specific areas, such as
overhead and indirect costs, the agency said. Bidders' past performance as
well as their proposed approach to cost reduction will be weighed during
selection. The RFP specifically outlines an aggressive ``make-or-pay''
program that requires work to be contracted out or privatized if it is more
efficient to do so.
   The contract covers all work at Hanford that is not included in the
environmental restoration management contract now held by Bechtel Hanford
Corp. It includes the cleanup of the waste tanks and spent fuel, as well as
infrastructure management, base operations, construction and construction
management. The statement of work included in the final RFP is organized
around what DOE calls ``Project Hanford,'' an effort to duplicate the best
administrative and management controls found in the private sector.
   Proposals are due March 15. DOE says it will make a final selection in
June, with the winner to take over operations Oct. 1. Three, and possibly
four, companies have lined up teams to bid on the Hanford management and
integration contract.
   California-based Fluor Daniel Inc.. is leading a team that includes
Lockheed-Martin; Rust Federal Services; Babcock and Wilcox; Duke Energy and
Services, Numatec and International Technology Corp. Bechtel Corp., which
has the environmental restoration contract at Hanford now, is leading a
team that includes Westinghouse; BNFL Inc.; Computer Sciences Corp., and
Johnson Controls. A third team led by Boston-based Raytheon Corp. includes
CH2M Hill; ICF Kaiser; Tenneco Boeing Information Services Corp., and
Siemens Power Corp.
   Sources last week said a fourth team may be organizing under TRW Inc.'s
and Parsons Corp.'s lead. None of the three teams are final yet, and the
sources said other companies will be added as the final RFP is examined. A
Bechtel spokesman said its team will include several more pre-selected
subcontractors, but that most of the subcontracted work will be
competitively bid after the contract is awarded.
   The contract out for bid is now held by Westinghouse and ICF Kaiser. At
least one industry source gives Bechtel the best odds at winning. ``It has
the strongest team because it includes two large contract holders there
now,'' the source said. Others, however, argue the opposite, saying that
Bechtel can't win because Westinghouse is on its team. ``That company is
the kiss of death out there,'' he said.
   Meanwhile contractors are waiting for the RFP that will replace EG&G at
DOE's Mound site. DOE has promised a draft will be issued between Jan. 15
and Feb. 8. Sources said a number of teams want to bid on the much smaller
$500 million contract.
   ``We're lucky that these two are coming out close together. The big
players are looking at Hanford, leaving the smaller companies to pursue
Mound,'' one source said. The job will include cleaning up the site and
returning the assets to the City of Miamisburg, Ohio, and is expected to be
valued at $80 to $100 million a year for five years.
   International Technology Corp. is planning to lead a team, while sources
say Fluor Daniel's management team at DOE's nearby Fernald Environmental
Management Project will also bid the job. Other players looking to lead or
join teams include ICF Kaiser, Babcock & Wilcox, Parsons, Morrison Knudsen,
Weston, SAIC, Foster Wheeler, and TRW.
    ``There's lots of mating dances going on here,'' said an industry
source, who along with other company officials are in Ohio planning their
strategy.

BOB ALCOCK HAS BEEN NAMED ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY for congressional,

BOB ALCOCK HAS BEEN NAMED ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY for congressional,
intergovernmental and public affairs at DOE. Alcock, who most recently
worked as deputy assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs,
replaced Carolyn Herr Watts, who left the agency for the private sector
last month.
   The White House has nominated and the Senate Energy Committee has
confirmed Derrick Forrister. a former special assistant to Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary, for the assistant secretary job, but the nomination has been
blocked in the Senate since last summer.
   Alcock worked as former Texas Democratic Rep. Barbara Jordan's
legislative assistant from l1973 to 1979 and, after two years in the
private sector, returned to Congress as chief of staff to California
Democratic Rep. Esteban Torres.
   He was named deputy assistant secretary in February 1994. In that
position, he was responsible for providing liaison between DOE and various
state and local government officials including governors, mayors, state
legislators, county supervisors and tribal leaders.

GAO SAYS SPENDING GAPS TYPICAL FOR DOE

DOE's inability to document $255,000 in expenses it incurred on two trade
missions to India and South Africa are part of a ``systemic''
record-keeping problem at the department that may date back to the
Manhattan Project, an official with the General Accounting Office said
Thursday.
   At a hearing before the House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, Victor Rezendes, GAO's director of energy, resources and
science issues, said his office found DOE was unable to provide records for
$80,000 in expenses it claimed for an October 1994 trade mission to India
and $175,000 in charges made during a similar trip to South Africa in
August.
   In both instances, GAO said, the money was paid by U.S. embassies in the
countries for goods and services purchased on behalf of the DOE
delegations.
   Rezendes, whose office looked into the cost of the two trips at the
request of Ohio Republican Rep. Martin Hoke, a critic of Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary's overseas travel, told the subcommittee that DOE did not
have written procedures in place during either of the trips specifying what
types of records were to be kept or the process to follow when obtaining
travel support from the State Dept.
   For both trips, Rezendes said, embassies reported charges to DOE that
listed the amounts paid to vendors. ``The lists sometimes, but not always,
provided a brief description of the nature of the charges,'' he said.
   ``DOE's accounting office recorded the charges in DOE's accounts, but
relied on the responsible program office to approve the charges. However,
the program officials did not maintain supporting documents of the expenses
incurred,'' he said. Further, Rezendes said that in some cases, the program
officials ``could not provide an explanation for the embassies' charges.''
   DOE, Rezendes added, could not provide GAO auditors with supporting
documents to ``give assurances of what the money was spent for. This is not
a new problem at DOE and without the documentation, we don't know, nor does
DOE know, what the money was spent on.''
   ``We want to ensure that double billing did not occur, and maybe there
charges are perfectly okay, but the point is we don't know,'' he said.
   Rezendes said the problem of shoddy bookkeeping at DOE precedes O'Leary
and may, in fact, have its origins in the Manhattan Project. ``This goes
back a long time and probably predates DOE, the [Atomic Energy Commission]
and goes back to the Manhattan Project. The United States government, in
its effort to build the atomic bomb, agreed to total cost reimbursement.
Everything was allowable and after the war the same total cost
reimbursement system was retained,'' he said.
   ``Anytime we have looked at DOE with a microscope we have found a lack
of documentation and an understanding of what it is paying for,'' Rezendes
added.
   Questioned by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., Rezendes said his
investigation failed to turn up any evidence of improper or illegal use of
federal funds, but he added that the problem is there is insufficient
documentation available yet to make a conclusive determination.
   Rezendes credited O'Leary for making ``the most aggressive changes'' of
any of her predecessors in the agency's contracting process and said DOE,
working with GAO, is working to develop written procedures that would
require DOE officials traveling abroad to follow specific steps, such as
completing certain documents and vouchers and submitting all required
receipts in support of travel expenses to the agency's accounting office.
``If properly implemented, these procedures should prevent similar problems
from occurring in the future,'' he added.
   The GAO report was critical of DOE's decision to change the source of
funding for security staff accompanying O'Leary on overseas trips from the
agency's administration account to its Defense Programs account. DOE
transferred $400,000 from the DP account to pay for the security costs in
FY-95.
   The decision, Rezendes said, ``is inconsistent with a long-standing
principle of appropriations accounting.'' DOE acted improperly, GAO said,
by using the Defense Programs money to cover the security costs without
first informing Congress.
   Congress has already acted to address the problem, Rezendes said. In the
FY-96 energy and water development appropriations act, Congress directed
that all costs to support the travel of any security detail accompanying
O'Leary are to be paid out of the departmental administration account.
   House Republicans used last week's hearing to reissue a demand that
O'Leary resign.
   Hoke, in an opening statement, said DOE, under O'Leary's leadership,
``has unfortunately become a glaring symbol of government waste.''
   ``Up until now, most of the media focus has been on Secretary O'Leary's
lavish excessive travel -- 100 trips -- which in itself is a serious
problem.
   However, that is just the tip of a mismanagement iceberg that masks the
much larger problem of profound agency chaos, with tens of millions of
dollars in lost computers and other property, hundreds of thousands of
dollars unaccounted for, special perks for special friends, a useless and
stupid waste of $43,000 to rate the friendliness of reporters, editorial
boards, and members of Congress, illegal lobbying, hundreds of full-time
employees devoted to public relations and the secretary's personal
image-building, and countless other examples of waste, fraud and abuse,''
he said.
   House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., joined his
colleagues in condemning O'Leary's travel. ``It is becoming more and more
clear to me that under the current leadership, [DOE] has little respect for
the American taxpayer. The secretary and her entourage of hundreds travel
in luxury at taxpayer's expense throughout the world.
   ``Yet, according to the findings in the GAO report, they don't even care
enough to keep a single, solitary receipt for more than a quarter-million
dollars expended on just these two trips alone. And when they run short of
travel funds, they violate nearly a century's worth of budget principles to
drain other funds to pick up the tab,'' he said.
   Subcommittee Democrats voiced support, arguing that no evidence had been
provided that showed money had been misused and that the problem may be
nothing more than an accounting glitch.
   Dingell, in his opening statement, questioned why the panel had not
asked DOE or State Dept. officials to testify about the trips. ``I hope it
doesn't show that we are more interested in a political hatchet job than we
are in finding the truth,'' he said. State Dept. employees have been
furloughed by the government shutdown.
   DOE said Wednesday that it had received ``summary statements that show
that each expenditure incurred was certified by a State Department
official.'' While DOE said it had not received every voucher to determine
whether it should have paid all of the certified expenses, it expects to
receive those documents when the federal shutdown ends.
   DOE also said it disagreed with GAO's criticism of its decision to pay
for security on foreign trips with $400,000 from Defense Program accounts,
which officials noted have been used for some time for security on domestic
travel. ``We stand by our decision to use the same appropriation account
for security for both foreign and domestic travel,'' DOE said.

O'LEARY ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR AIR OVER IMPACT OF OVERSEAS EXCURSIONS

Exactly how much new business has been gained by U.S. companies by virtue
of DOE's four overseas trade missions was still an open question last
week.
   In a Dec. 28 letter to Congress, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said
company executives who accompanied her on the trips have told the agency
they have completed, or are close to finalizing, $4.3 billion in deals that
could be tied to the missions.
   O'Leary's letter came in response to a Dec. 20 request from the chairmen
of seven House Committees and subcommittees asking the secretary to explain
what they described as apparent multibillion-dollar discrepancies in the
economic benefits she said companies have gained from her overseas travel
(IE/FL, 25 Dec, 1).
   At various times, O'Leary has claimed the trips have resulted in as much
as $27.7 billion and as little as $2.4 billion in new business for U.S.
companies.
   At a hearing last week before the House Commerce subcommittee on
oversight and investigations, however, Ohio Republican Rep. Martin Hoke
said his own survey of company officials put the value of the trips at
about $1.4 billion. Hoke suggested, moreover, that even that figure may be
generous.
   Hoke, who has been a harsh critic of O'Leary's travel, said the
secretary's trade missions are the product of an agency undergoing a
``bureaucratic midlife crisis, desperately pretending to be something it is
not in an attempt to find a new purpose to justify its continued
existence.''
   O'Leary, he continued, ``often acts more like the head of a state
chamber of commerce trade delegation ... than a member of the president's
Cabinet charged with the profoundly important, if somewhat dull,
responsibility of safeguarding the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile.''
   Just how much new business the trade missions have returned to U.S.
companies is important to determining how effective the trips have been,
Hoke said.
   The congressman said O'Leary originally claimed that the trade missions
to India, Pakistan, China and South Africa resulted in $19.7 billion worth
of contracts for U.S. companies. Recently, however, in response to a
newspaper inquiry, DOE said $2.4 billion in deals had been signed. On Dec.
19, the agency revised the figure to $4.3 billion.
   Hoke said he believes the actual number is probably closer to $1.4
billion. Even that number is ``guesswork,'' Hoke said, adding that most of
the contracts were won by large U.S. companies with strong international
representation. They were capable, he said, of securing the contracts
without DOE's help.
   In her letter to Congress, O'Leary attempted to clear the air. In
testimony she delivered to the Senate in March, O'Leary estimated that
energy-related business agreements advanced during DOE and Commerce
Dept.-sponsored trade missions had a combined potential and realized value
of $27.7 billion.
   A later estimate of $19.7 billion represents realized and potential
agreements of energy-related deals that have come out of DOE trade
missions. They include, she said, ``memoranda of intent or understanding
 ... , power purchase agreements, fuel supply agreements and other steps
necessary to advance business deals. The $19.7 billion estimate represents
the total potential value of the deals advanced by the trade missions that
I headed and is an important guidepost for tracking the long-term success
of the missions.''
   As for the $4.3 billion figure, O'Leary said that represents the number
of deals that have been completed. The $2.4 billion estimate DOE gave
earlier this year in response to an inquiry from the Los Angeles Times did
not include several deals companies later reported as completed.
   In her letter, O'Leary told members that while the trade missions have
provided U.S. companies with new contracts and have created American jobs,
business deals are not the only benefits that have accrued.
   DOE trade missions ``help shape policies that support the success of
U.S. competitiveness, democratization and market economies,'' she said.
   ``Our missions have encouraged countries to create the necessary legal,
financial, and regulatory policies that are the cornerstone of market
economies, while also enabling projects with U.S. energy companies to reach
closure. ... Every nation in which we have conducted trade missions has
further endorsed market reforms in the energy sector, and I believe our
work has greatly contributed to that progress.''
   The trips have also helped create a ``level playing field'' for U.S.
business, O'Leary said. U.S. businesses have asked for DOE's help and
Congress has given DOE the authority to provide assistance, ``because these
markets are important to their future and because foreign competitors enjoy
strong support from their governments.''
   O'Leary said DOE will continue to track the progress of the dollar-value
of the trade missions, but warned that because the emerging markets
involved in the trade missions have little experience in competitive
markets, the final dollar figure for successful projects advanced during
the trips may not be known for five to 10 years.

E. SHIRLEY THOMAS, DOE OMBUDSMAN AND FRIEND OF SECRETARY HAZEL O'LEARY, has
been notified she will have to repay between $20,000 and $25,000 she has
received as a living allowance for nearly two years, but for which she was
ineligible.
   A department spokeswoman said Thomas was informed by the agency's Office
of General Counsel that she will have to pay back a $35 per day allowance
she had received as an allowance for maintaining her principal residence in
Newark, where she was employed as a social worker before being tapped by
O'Leary for the $93,000-a-year DOE post. In fact, Thomas moved to the
Washington area in December 1993.
   DOE spokeswoman Barbara Semedo said Thomas was said to be ``eager'' to
repay the funds. Thomas could not be reached for comment.
   O'Leary in November defended Thomas against charges from House
Republicans that her job is unnecessary and that she was appointed to the
post chiefly because of their longtime friendship.

BUDGET CUT FORCES LAYOFF OF PART-TIME AND STUDENT WORKERS AT DOE

Although a DOE plan to meet congressional cuts in the agency's
administration budget spared full-time employees from layoffs, 32 part-time
workers and student interns were not as lucky.
   DOE last week said it will lay off nine part-time workers, eight of whom
were employed in the agency's mailroom, and 23 college and high school
students, to help it comply with a congressional directive that it cut
administrative staff by 15% this year.
   In its FY-96 energy and water development appropriations bill, Congress
reduced funding for DOE's administration $41 million below what the
department had sought. In report language accompanying the bill, the
lawmakers said the funding level assumed a 15% cut in DOE's workforce.
   The administration budget pays the salaries and other operating expenses
for about 2,900 employees in non-program offices, including human
resources, the office of congressional and public affairs, policy field
management and the Idaho, Oak Ridge and Chicago field offices.
   DOE managers and union representatives signed off on a plan shortly
before Christmas that would comply with the congressional requirement yet
spare forced layoffs through such actions as increasing the number of
workers opting for early retirement, eliminating overtime spending and
performance bonuses, continuing a hiring freeze and furloughing each
employee for at least 48 hours spread out over the current fiscal year
(IE/FL, 25 Dec, 12).
   The plan, however, does call for some forced reductions. A DOE official
last week said 32 workers will be laid off. Under the plan, the nine
temporary employees will be dismissed from the agency on or before Jan.
26.
   Twenty-three student employees -- including college students working in
the department's cooperative education program and high school students
employed under the agency's ``Stay in School'' program -- will get their
walking papers.
   Under the cooperative education program, DOE gives college students the
opportunity to gain professional experience while they work toward their
degrees. Upon graduation, the students have the opportunity to move into
full-time permanent positions at the agency.
   The Stay in School program involves clerical work largely for high
school students, whose financial situation may otherwise force them to drop
out before matriculating.
   Eligibility for both programs is based on financial need. Students in
both programs will be asked to leave their jobs by April 19, the official
said.
   Department-wide, DOE will retain 40 college students in the cooperative
education program and six under the Stay in School program, the official
said. In addition, officials are hoping that some of the 23 students will
be picked up by DOE program offices that are not facing the same salary
restrictions as is the department administration account.

ERVIN SAYS DIVISION WILL CUT STAFF BY ONE-THIRD OVER NEXT FIVE YEARS

By:
Lira Behrens

As part of its effort to comply with DOE's Strategic Alignment Initiative,
DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy division is aiming to cut
staff by a third and reduce administrative costs by 50% over the next five
years.
   EERE Assistant Secretary Christine Ervin told reporters in a briefing
Thursday that it was unclear where the cuts would be made, but two-thirds
of them would likely be made in the first two years. Many of the cuts also
will come from closing four of the 10 EERE Regional Support Offices that
was announced in August.
   The administrative improvements will come from a new computerized
personnel center the division hopes to unveil in February, as well as a
partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which Ervin said
has ``its own aggressive program to reduce administrative costs.'' A team
of EERE employees has already identified 67 processes where ``there might
be major savings,'' she said.
   Ervin described the restructuring of the division as ``not a dramatic
reorganization, but a natural evolution.''
  One major effect of the change, Ervin said, would be to decrease the
ratio of managers to staff within the division from 1:5 to 1:15. Doing so,
she said, would ``push decisionmaking down in the organization, giving more
authority to the staff.''
   The other major change effected by the reorganization is what she termed
``graduation day'' for the division's Office of Technical and Financial
Assistance. The office, which deals primarily with state and local
assistance programs, has previously been in a ``separate box,'' which she
said had been an obstacle to deployment of EERE's r&d programs.
   Under the new organization, OTFA's Weatherization Assistance Program and
State Energy Conservation Program grants would be housed with the
division's building energy programs under a new Office of Building Systems
and State and Community Programs. Mary Fowler, who had been OTFA's acting
deputy assistant secretary, is now the associate deputy assistant secretary
for the new office.
   Ervin said the lack of an Interior appropriations bill (which funds the
division's efficiency programs) has not required employee furloughs or
cutbacks in grants because the department has money left over from FY-95
and so-called ``no-year money.'' According to Ervin's Chief of Staff Brian
Castelli, the programs could operate ``a few more months'' on the outyear
funding.
   One program Ervin said has been delayed by the government shutdown is
the implementation of an agreement reached in early December with the
Environmental Protection Agency to consolidate the two agencies' appliance
efficiency labeling programs. EPA, whose funding bill has not been
approved, has an ``energy star'' program that labels computers and other
appliances as energy efficient, while DOE is responsible for setting energy
efficiency standards for appliances.
   According to Ervin, DOE and EPA have worked with retailers such as
Circuit City, Sears and Home Depot on what the new labels should look like.
The department had hoped to complete the label consolidation by the end of
the year, but has been unable to meet with EPA because the agency's
employees are furloughed.
   In other programs, Ervin said the department plans to issue final
guidelines for Home Energy Rating Systems by January 31. The department has
asked the Home Energy Ratings Systems Council and several state-run HERS
programs known as the Residential Energy Services Network, to resolve their
differences on technical issues related to the guidelines before then.
   Members of the HERS Council, which submitted recommended guidelines to
DOE in October 1994, late last year expressed concern that the disagreement
threatened the program (IE/FL, 30 Oct, 7). The groups have now apparently
narrowed the list of issues over which they disagree and have tentatively
scheduled a series of meetings for mid-January.

HOUSE BID TO OVERRIDE CLINTON VETO OF INTERIOR SPENDING BILL FAILS

House Republicans failed to override President Clinton's veto of the
Interior appropriations bill Thursday, garnering only 239 of the 278 votes
needed to pass the bill over Clinton's objections.
   Among the reasons the president said he vetoed the bill (H.R. 1977) was
that it did not contain enough funding for DOE's energy efficiency programs
(IE/FL, 25 Dec, 4). According to administration sources, the bill's future
will likely hinge on the White House's negotiations with Congress on the
overall budget agreement.
   Sources familiar with the negotiations last week said advocates of the
efficiency programs in the White House were asking for $75 million in
additional FY-96 funding to be split between three efficiency programs: the
Weatherization Assistance Program, the Partnership for a new Generation of
Vehicles program, and the programs aimed at implementing the
administration's Climate Change Action Plan.
   A congressional aide, however, denied that the overall budget
negotiations would affect the FY-96 Interior appropriations bill. The aide
said it was unclear what appropriators would do with the interior bill. The
two options, she said, were to either move another stand-alone bill, or
roll funding for the programs into a long-term continuing resolution.
   The FY-97 budget request process is apparently on hold until the FY-96
budget levels are settled. DOE has submitted a budget request to the Office
of Management and Budget of $915 million for EERE, but it was unclear at
press time how that may have been changed during the ``passback'' process.
   Of the outlook for FY-97 funding for her programs, DOE Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Christine Ervin told
reporters last week that ``a lot of it is hinging on the negotiations for
FY-96.''
   While she would not divulge details of the FY-97 request until it has
been submitted to Congress by the president, Ervin said the ``historic
percentage increases [in efficiency and renewable energy programs] in past
years are not likely to continue. We do know that energy efficiency and
renewable energy remain a high priority for the secretary and the
administration.'' And she added there will be ``some decent continuations
for programs.''

DOE WILL PROVIDE $100,000 TO JAMES E. RUSSELL PETROLEUM INC., to improve a

DOE WILL PROVIDE $100,000 TO JAMES E. RUSSELL PETROLEUM INC., to improve a
new process to clean water used in oil field operations.
   The ``air flotation process'' emerged from an earlier DOE co-sponsored
project with Russell Petroleum and the University of Kansas. Russell
Petroleum, Abilene, Texas, will contribute $102,000 of its own to continue
research on the project. DOE's award will be made through the National
Institute for Petroleum Energy Research in Bartlesville, Okla.
   According to DOE, water produced with oil is often reinjected into the
reservoir to increase the efficiency of the oil recovery operation. But
impurities in the water can plug the tiny pores in the reservoir rock,
often blocking the water from reaching the target zones.
   In the air flotation process, air is bubbled through a flotation column.
Waste impurities cling to the air bubbles and are removed from the water.
The technique, a modification of a process originally developed to clean
coal and other minerals, has been used in some offshore oil operations. It
was unclear, however, whether the process would be cost-effective for
onshore oil fields, particularly those operated by smaller, independent
producers.
   According to the department, the original Russell Petroleum project
showed that the air flotation device may make economic sense for many
independent producers. The company credits the technology with contributing
to the recovery of some 300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would have
been left in the ground.
   Under the second phase of the project, which will last 18 months,
Russell Petroleum will develop screening criteria to help other producers
determine where and when the process can be applied; develop optimum design
and operating guidelines for the technology; determine the cost of
implementing critical design improvements; and communicate the correct
method of applying the technology and its benefits to other operators.
   The original project was funded under DOE's Reservoir Class Field
Demonstration Program, which is aimed at demonstrating ways that oil
producers can avoid prematurely abandoning their wells. The Russell
Petroleum follow-on project is the result of a solicitation DOE issued to
the 33 participants in the ``near-term'' category of the program. The
department has recently requested proposals for follow-on projects from
participants in ``mid-term'' and other categories of the program.

THE NUCLEAR ENERGY INSTITUTE MISTAKENLY LISTED A CONSUMER GROUP among

THE NUCLEAR ENERGY INSTITUTE MISTAKENLY LISTED A CONSUMER GROUP among
supporters of a bill aimed at fixing DOE's high-level nuclear waste
program.
   In an ad NEI placed in the Dec. 12, 13 and 14 Washington editionS of the
Los Angeles Times, the industry group included the Consumer Federation of
America in a list of organizations it said support the bill (H.R. 1020). In
a letter to the paper's editor, CFA Executive Director Stephen Brobeck said
the group did not approve the use of its name in the ad and that it has no
position on the bill.
   Brobeck, who asked the paper to print a correction, said NEI ``has
admitted their error and apologized to us.''
   The ad was brought to the attention of CFA by several state Public
Interest Research Groups, who are members of the federation, and who oppose
the bill.
   U.S. PIRG said the incident ``is just one more example of the brazen
excess the nuclear industry uses to ram a destructive bill through
Congress.''
   An NEI spokeswoman Friday acknowledged the group made a mistake in
including CFA among those groups endorsing the bill. She, however, said CFA
was included because the group had passed a resolution urging Congress to
ensure that money paid by consumers into the nuclear waste fund was used
for the program. That provision, she added, is a key part of the
legislation.
   The spokeswoman criticized PIRG, saying the group was allowing its
``anti-nuclear views to get in the way of protecting consumers.''

EEI PRESIDENT THOMAS KUHN WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF CONGRESS waits until

EEI PRESIDENT THOMAS KUHN WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF CONGRESS waits until
the end of the session to decide on nuclear waste legislation. That's when
the first two laws addressing the topic passed in 1982 and 1987, Kuhn said
during a briefing last week for the Washington International Energy Group,
and he suggested that history may repeat itself this year.
   Nevertheless, the Edison Electric Institute chief said a bill reported
overwhelmingly by the House Commerce Committee in August could be the start
of a new law this year. He said he thought the measure (H.R. 1020), which
would require DOE to open an interim site for nuclear waste in Nevada by
1998, may pass the House handily if it gets to the floor. That, he added,
would ``motivate'' the Senate to respond similarly.
   ``Hopefully, the issue is important enough that it will percolate up and
be finished this year,'' Kuhn said of a nuclear waste bill. ``There is a
critical need for it.''
   Kuhn was less sanguine that Congress will reconsider proposals to sell
DOE's power marketing administrations, which EEI supported in 1995, but
which failed because of opposition in the regions where the PMAs operate.
He credited the public power and rural cooperative portions of the electric
utility sector for their successful fight against the proposals.
   ``I don't really believe there will be a very active discussion of the
issue this year, but I do believe it will be back in the next Congress,''
Kuhn said of the PMAs. The fact that the PMAs operate with a federal
``subsidy'' will draw more scrutiny as the notion of competition in the
overall utility sector gains support nationally, he added.
   While EEI wants lawmakers' help on nuclear waste and the PMAs, the group
would prefer that they abstain from addressing retail wheeling or
competition in the utility industry, he said. Kuhn acknowledged that
proposals by House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va.,
and other lawmakers that address those issues likely will be discussed
further this year, but he said he hoped nothing would come of them.
   ``We very strongly feel we don't need federally mandated wheeling,'' he
said. ``We don't need a federal solution regarding competition.'' According
to Kuhn, utilities in conjunction with state regulators and other interests
are likely to find solutions to problems related to competition that will
be better than any prescriptions from Washington.

A PANEL CHAIRED BY DOE AND EPA HAVE SELECTED EIGHT PROJECTS involving four

A PANEL CHAIRED BY DOE AND EPA HAVE SELECTED EIGHT PROJECTS involving four
countries and 13 U.S. companies under the second round of the U.S.
Initiative on Joint Implementation.
   The pilot program encourages partnerships between U.S. companies and
developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to DOE,
the program ``spurs technology cooperation by increasing the access of
developing countries to energy-efficiency and renewable energy
technologies. Industrialized countries benefit through the expansion of
export markets.''
   Should a greenhouse gas control program be implemented in the future,
U.S. companies hope they would be able to get credit for reducing emissions
overseas, where such reduction measures are cheaper to implement.
   The projects announced last week, which are financed by the private
sector, will employ geothermal, biomass, hydroelectric and wind energy
technologies, as well as forest management practices in Costa Rica,
Honduras, Nicaragua and Russia.
   Five of the eight projects -- selected from 21 proposals submitted --
are located in Costa Rica. At a ceremony announcing the selected projects
last month, DOE Deputy Energy Secretary Charles Curtis attributed the
number of projects in Costa Rica to its president, Jose Maria Figueres, who
has created a special office of joint implementation and has vowed to
``make Costa Rica a showplace'' for such projects.
   Curtis said Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has ``worked hard to gain
greater acceptance'' of joint implementation projects. The first round of
seven projects were selected in February 1995.
   The projects announced last week are: a forestry project in Costa Rica
involving U.S. partner Newton Treviso Corp.; a geothermal project in
Nicaragua, with Trans-Pacific Geothermal Corp.; a biomass generation
project in Honduras with U.S. participants Nations Energy, a subsidiary of
Tucson Electric, the Edison Electric Institute and Add on Energy 1; a
hydroelectric project in Costa Rica with New World Power Corp.; a windfarm
in Costa Rica with New World Power Corp.; a wind facility in Costa Rica
with Power Systems Inc. and EnergyWorks; a forest restoration project in
Costa Rica with the Nature Conservancy; and a fugitive gas capture project
in Russia with Oregon State University, Sustainable Development Technology
Corp., Sealweld Corp., and EPA.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS CLAIM DOE IS `BACKSLIDING' ON REPROCESSING POLICY

By:
David Kramer

Environmental groups charged last week that DOE is ``backsliding'' on a
20-year-old U.S. commitment to end reprocessing activities by pursuing a
plan to use chemical separations ``canyons'' to treat spent fuel and other
nuclear materials at the Savannah River Site.
   Led by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, which
released a report on the issue Thursday, the groups claimed that by
generating additional waste, reprocessing will cause more environmental
problems than it solves and will undermine the credibility of U.S. efforts
to convince other nations such as North Korea, India and Russia to end
their reprocessing activities.
   ``How is the United States going to convince these countries and others
to halt reprocessing if we're plunging into it ourselves?'' asked IEER
researcher Noah Sachs, author of the report: ``Risky Relapse into
Reprocessing.'' Though DOE has pledged not to use the plutonium or highly
enriched uranium separated through reprocessing for weapons, other
countries will not be able to verify this, he noted.
   ``It creates a kind of reprocessing double standard,'' Sachs said,
adding that other nations will be unable to verify DOE's pledge not to use
the fissile materials that are separated through reprocessing for nuclear
weapons.
   After exhaustive environmental analyses, DOE has elected to reprocess
much of the spent fuel and solutions containing fissile materials at SRS to
stabilize the material for long-term storage. Moreover, a number of
influential Republican lawmakers, notably Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, have consistently advocated
reprocessing as a solution to spent fuel management problems at SRS and
other DOE sites.
   But the environmental groups, which also included the Energy Research
Foundation, an SRS watchdog organization, and Snake River Alliance, a
grass-roots group located near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,
argued that DOE should instead place the spent fuel into dry storage until
technical solutions to problems facing long-term disposition have been
resolved.
   Beatrice Brailsford, executive director of SRA, also criticized DOE's
continuing support at INEL of experimental technology known as
electrometallurgical processing, calling it a ``back door flirtation with
reprocessing.'' The technology ``poses a peril to nonproliferation goals,''
she said, and also fails to respond to any clear need.
   ``DOE's bad interim storage policy is being driven by a bad long-term
storage policy,'' said Arjun Makhijani, IEER president. DOE should start
from scratch in its efforts to find a high-level waste repository, he said,
and abandon its trouble-plagued effort to characterize the Yucca Mountain,
Nev., site. In so doing, the agency ought to resurrect its deep seabed
disposal research program, which was terminated when Congress ordered the
agency to focus all its efforts on the Nevada site.
   DOE need not rush into a repository, Makhijani maintained, since interim
dry storage for a period of up to 100 years would permit the decay of most
of the highly radioactive and heat-generating fission products such as
strontium and cesium. That in turn would eliminate many of the technical
design concerns that face the Yucca Mountain project.
   IEER also rejected reprocessing advocates' contention that DOE spent
fuel, which unlike commercial fuel is in metal form, must be stabilized
prior to its permanent storage. Alternatives to reprocessing could be
developed over the next few decades, or special containers might be
designed specifically for the DOE material, they said.
   ``There is no spent fuel management option that is without risks,''
Sachs said, ``but DOE's own data show that the storage option poses far
fewer risks than reprocessing.''
   According to Sachs, DOE data show that the radiation dose to the
population surrounding SRS during reprocessing activities would be four to
five million times higher than from continued storage of the material
there. DOE estimates in the report indicate an exposure level of 15
person-rem per year via air pathways, and a further 2.2 person-rem per year
via water pathways to the population within 50 miles of SRS.
   DOE's current reprocessing plans will add three million gallons of
high-level liquid radioactive wastes to the tanks at SRS, increasing the
total volume of those wastes by around 10%, according to the report.

REPORT BY SRS CONTRACTOR APPEARS TO ADVOCATE REPROCESSING AT SITE

By:
David Kramer

The operator of DOE's Savannah River Site prepared a report for a local
congressman that suggests reprocessing of spent commercial nuclear fuel at
the facility to prepare the material for permanent disposal.
   An internal report by Westinghouse Savannah River Co., the management
and operating contractor, said reprocessing the nation's commercial spent
fuel for disposal in a permanent repository could be accomplished at SRS
for as much as ``several billion dollars'' less than it will cost to
dispose of it directly in a repository, as the current plan calls for.
Moreover, Westinghouse said, reprocessing would ``increase the technical
assuredness of the spent fuel management program, and potentially could
yield recyclable uranium feedstock.''
   The report, which was prepared in August, was made public by the Energy
Research Foundation, an SRS watchdog environmental group, last week. A DOE
spokesman at Savannah River said the report was requested by Rep. Charles
Norwood, R-Ga., and took about a week to complete. He added that DOE had
not sought the study.
   ERF Director Brian Costner expressed outrage at the report, calling its
cost estimates ``absolutely absurd.'' They do not include any expenses to
upgrade the two 40-year-old reprocessing ``canyons,'' he said. Further, he
added, they fail to account for additional wastes that would be generated
by reprocessing and do not consider ongoing problems with SRS' Defense
Waste Processing Facility, which would be used to vitrify the high-level
wastes that are separated from the spent fuel.
   According to the report, DOE could dispose of the current inventory of
commercial spent nuclear fuel for about $8 billion, including the estimated
repository fees for the canisters that contain the vitrified waste. While a
final repository would still be required, the cost and technical
uncertainty would be cut significantly by the 20-fold volume reduction that
would be achieved through reprocessing, as well as the conversion of the
waste to a single form containing only short-lived non-fissile fission
products, the paper said.
   Reprocessing opponents point out that the procedure would result in a
huge volume of low-level waste that Westinghouse proposes to form into a
concrete-like ``saltstone'' for storage. The report argues that the
saltstone is ``a non-hazardous, non-regulated waste form which has no
environmental impact,'' a characterization disputed by Costner.
   Costner also charged that SRS was ``toying with U.S. nonproliferation
policy,'' and ``trying to redefine reprocessing without a clear open
debate.''
   The Clinton administration generally opposes reprocessing on the grounds
that it encourages proliferation of nuclear weapons-usable materials. DOE,
however, plans to resume reprocessing activities at SRS in order to
stabilize some of its spent fuel and other nuclear materials left over from
weapons production (related story above).
   The administration has been especially adamant in opposing the
reprocessing of commercial spent fuel, however, and has never considered it
as an alternative for civilian spent fuel disposal.
   However, a number of Republican congressmen and senators, particularly
those in the region surrounding SRS, have advocated reprocessing. Norwood
and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
are two such proponents.
   The report said SRS has documented that the canyons can operate until
2015 ``with normal capital upgrades.'' SRS, said the report, ``has the
immediate capability to assist the DOE and the nuclear power industry in
addressing the nation's spent fuel crisis by beginning the immediate
receipt of commercial spent fuels.''
   The DOE spokesman said Norwood's request came after Senate Energy
Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, proposed using SRS and DOE's
Hanford Site in Washington as interim storage facilities for commercial
spent fuel. ``We get a lot of requests from our congressional delegation
and we respond to them,'' he said.
   The Westinghouse report, however, was well-detailed and appeared to be
written with a pro-reprocessing slant. For example, it indicates that the
direct disposal route for spent fuel is fraught with technical
uncertainties, commenting, ``this uncertainty has not provided the public
with any confidence that the DOE can successfully manage spent fuels.'' By
contrast, the reprocessing route ``offers a technologically proven,
cost-effective solution to the spent fuel disposal problem,'' it said.
   The report also examined the feasibility of reprocessing spent fuel from
other DOE facilities -- the Hanford Site and the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory. It concluded that the cost of disposing of DOE's Naval Reactor
spent fuels could be cut by nearly two-thirds, to $5 billion, compared to
$14 billion for direct disposal. The cost of disposing of DOE's stainless
steel and zirconium-clad spent fuels could be cut to around $700 million,
from $1.2 billion, it said.

SAIC EXECUTIVE ALM NOMINATED AS DOE'S ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP CHIEF

In an action widely expected for months, the White House Dec. 27 nominated
Science Applications International Corp.'s Alvin Alm to take over DOE's
environmental cleanup program. Alm, a director and senior vice president
for SAIC's Environmental Business Area, will replace Thomas Grumbly as
assistant secretary for environmental management at DOE if he is confirmed
by the Senate.
   President Clinton Dec. 20 nominated Grumbly as DOE under secretary, the
third most senior position at the agency (IE/FL, 25 Dec, 10).
   Prior to joining SAIC in 1989, Alm was the chief executive of Alliance
Technologies Corp. and served as the board chairman and chief executive of
Thermal Analytical Corp. From 1983 to 1985 he was the deputy administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   In 1970, ALM served as the first staff director of the newly created
White House Council on Environmental Quality and in 1973 became EPA's
assistant administrator for planning and management, a position with
responsibilities for strategic planning, budgeting, policy and internal
management.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Alm's new position would mark his second
stint at DOE. In 1977, he joined the agency as assistant secretary for
policy and evaluation. Alm now serves as co-chairman of DOE's Environmental
Management Advisory Board and is on the board of the Energy and
Environmental Policy Institute and the Environmental Export Council.
   Alm will inherit from Grumbly a roughly $6-billion-a-year program that
has come under increasing pressure in Congress and the administration to
reduce its costs. Although it largely escaped deep spending cuts proposed
by the House last year, the program is certain to come under still more
scrutiny from congressional budget cutters this year. In addition, Energy
Secretary Hazel O'Leary is moving ahead with a promise she made early last
year to reduce the program's costs by more than $4 billion over the next
five years.
   Just how quickly the Senate will act on the two nominations is an open
question. An aide to the Senate Energy Committee last week said Grumbly has
a good reputation among committee members and should have little difficulty
winning confirmation. Less is known about Alm, he said, but there is little
reason to believe he will prove controversial.
   Although Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, prefers to move
quickly on nominations, the aide said it could be several months before the
committee and Senate take action, largely because the Senate has been
operating for several weeks without a full contingent and may do so for
sometime longer.

EM DIVISION TELLS CONGRESS OF ITS PLAN FOR COPING WITH BUDGET CUTS

DOE's Environmental Management division last week told lawmakers how it
plans to allocate the $476 million in cuts Congress made to its FY-96
budget.
   In letters sent to about 100 senators and representatives, Thomas
Grumbly, the assistant secretary for environmental management, said EM has
slashed its headquarters costs by 37%, to $222 million, in response to
directives contained in the conference report accompanying the FY-96 Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Act. It also used prior-year balances
as much as possible, also as directed by the appropriators, and accelerated
cleanup activities to reduce long-term costs both at the Fernald
Environmental Management Project and the Rocky Flats Environmental
Technology Site, he added.
   Congress appropriated 7.3% less than DOE's amended budget request for EM
this year -- providing just over $6 billion. But lawmakers earmarked $135
million in EM expenditures, further reducing the amount available to
allocate among the DOE cleanup sites.
   ``The bottom line for most sites is that in virtually all cases the
field office budget reductions were less than 10 percent,'' Grumbly wrote
in the Jan. 2 letters. Reductions at each site were made after consulting
with and reaching agreement among all the field managers, he said.
   Grumbly said the actual percentage cuts among all the sites varied for
three reasons. First, the level of prior-year balances varied among the
sites, and reducing these was one of the goals set by Congress. Second, DOE
sought to maximize the level of compliance at the sites with regulatory and
other requirements, which also vary. And finally, the congressional
earmarks required the department to add funding to certain sites for
specific projects.
   A direct comparison between FY-95 and FY-96 funding levels for each site
as a percentage of the EM budget is not possible due to the increase in
responsibilities of the EM progam in FY-96, he said. These new duties
include site management at the Savannah River Site, Mound Plant and
Pinellas Plant, as well as additional nuclear materials management
activities across the complex.
   Among DOE's largest cleanup operations, funding for the Hanford Site is
being cut 6.3%, to $1.3 billion, while the Savannah River Site's budget
will decline 8.6%, to $1.2 billion. Funding for the Oak Ridge Reservation
will fall by 9.2%, to $782 million, while that for Rocky Flats will decline
by 8.7%, to $573 million. The Ohio Field Office, which funds cleanup both
at Fernald and Mound, will decline by 3.5%, to $509 million, and Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory's budget will fall by 7.2%, to $471
million.
   Funding for Albuquerque Operations, which funds cleanup projects at two
DOE weapons labs as well as operation of the Waste Isolation Pilot Project,
will decline 4.5%, to $608 million, according to the letter.
   In a letter to Washington Republican Sen. Slade Gorton, Grumbly warned
that additional job reductions beyond the 4,800 that have already been
announced by DOE for the Hanford Site are likely. He added that a precise
tally of cuts was not possible at this time.
   Congressional earmarks included a $50 million increase to the budget
request for EM's technology development program to provide funds to be
managed by DOE's Office of Energy Research to develop a research program
that uses the national laboratories and universities; a $25 supplement to
the technology development account for electrometallurgical r&d; $59
million for the maintenance of funding levels at the Morgantown Energy
Technology Center to fund contracts associated with private sector
involvement in developing improved technologies that address needs of the
technology development ``focus areas'' and crosscutting programs; and $1
million in additional funds to the Western Environment Technology Office in
Butte, Mont., to meet EM's commitment to maintain funding level required to
accomplish previously initiated activities.

A SWAP OF WASTE OIL FROM TVA TO DOE SAVED TAXPAYERS $100,000, according to

A SWAP OF WASTE OIL FROM TVA TO DOE SAVED TAXPAYERS $100,000, according to
DOE. While trying to dispose of 75,000 gallons of mineral oil that was
slightly contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, officials at the
Tennessee Valley Authority found that DOE could use the material at its Oak
Ridge K-25 Site.
   The oil is now being used as a first step in cleaning out three large
storage tanks that previously held liquids containing much higher levels of
PCBs. Flushing the 22,500-gallon tanks with oil is a standard initial step
in removing PCBs from the tank walls.
   According to Vince Adams, the DOE manager of the site's Toxic Substance
Control Act Incinerator, where the storage tanks are located, the
department would have purchased commercial fuel oil, at a cost of about
$80,000, to do the job, if not for TVA's offer. TVA estimates it saved
$20,000 in disposal costs by finding a user for it.
   The oil eventually will be burned in the incinerator, which was built in
part to destroy PCB-contaminated liquid wastes.

ALJ SAYS GREAT PLAINS COAL-GAS SETTLEMENTS UNFAIR TO RATEPAYERS

Controversy over the Great Plains coal-gasification project, which has
haunted Ferc virtually since it was first approved in 1979, lingers on.
After Administrative Law Judge Michel Levant refused to approve the terms
of settlements negotiated by pipelines to resolve years of litigation, the
plant's owner warned last week that, if unchanged, Levant's decision could
close down the synthetic gas facility.
   Four pipelines that signed 25-year, high-cost contracts to buy the
plant's output thought they had finally resolved their problems when in
early 1994 they negotiated deals with Dakota Gasification Co. to lower the
price they must pay. But in a Dec. 29 initial decision, Levant pointed to
``an abundance of post-settlement evidence'' confirming his view that the
settlements ``depart from the carefully crafted balance'' achieved in
Ferc's 1981 ruling, opinion 119, and do so ``at a grossly disproportionate
cost to ratepayers.''
   But in a statement, Dakota Gasification Vice President Kent Janssen said
Levant's decision would breach the original deal among pipelines,
ratepayers and DOE. ``Pricing language in the gas purchase agreements was
drafted by the ratepayers themselves,'' he said. ``Judge Levant's decision
would allow them to break that deal. That simply isn't right.''
   Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.,
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. and ANR Pipeline Co. had asked the
commission to endorse their deals with Dakota Gasification and DOE, the
previous owner of the plant, and rule that the resulting costs are eligible
for full recovery under terms of order 636. The commission subsequently
severed Natural from the proceeding because of a settlement between the
pipeline and its customers. Ferc set the case for hearing in October 1994,
instructing the ALJ to keep in mind the commission's cost-passthrough
commitment to the pipelines and its vow to ratepayers that costs would be
market-based (IF, 17 Oct '94, 13).
   The settlements committed the pipelines to pay a total of $504 million
in demand charges over seven years. The gas price would be pegged to the
spot price at Ventura, Iowa, as reported in published indexes.
   To begin with, Levant chided the pipelines for failing to confer with
either the commission or their customers during negotiations. It is
``incomprehensible that the pipelines made no effort to consult with the
commission'' about their disputes with Dakota Gasification, which spawned
extensive litigation. And ``it is even more remarkable that even though the
ratepayers would be expected to pay the costs of any settlement agreement,
the pipelines made no effort to bring them into the settlement
negotiations,'' said the decision (RP93-100, et al.).
   What's more, the pipelines apparently did not conduct ``any meaningful
studies or comparative analyses to evaluate the resultant costs and
benefits . . . to ratepayers'' under the original agreements and the
settlements. The ``thrust'' of the pipelines' argument in support of the
settlements ``was that they compared favorably with potential litigation
outcomes,'' Levant continued. But he characterized the pipelines'
litigation scenarios as ``highly speculative.''
   The bottom line is that the settlements ``do not reflect a reasonable
compromise,'' said the judge. There is ``simply no evidence in the record .
 . . which supports the imposition upon ratepayers of an obligation to pay
$504 million in demand charges in seven years,'' he said, noting that
ratepayers already had paid about $490 million in above-market gas costs
over the past decade to support demonstration of the coal-gasification
technology.
   Levant suggested that in weighing their options, the pipelines should
have paid more attention to their other high-cost gas supply contracts,
which ``served to elevate the price'' of synthetic natural gas purchased
from Dakota Gasification under terms of the original pricing formula. At
the time of the settlements, these contracts were being reformed, leading
to a natural decline in the SNG price. The option of continuing to buy
under the original agreements, ``with necessary and appropriate
modifications by the commission'' to reflect the restructured pipeline
services market, ``yields a more favorable result for the pipelines and,
more importantly, for the ratepayers who must ultimately pay the bill,''
Levant concluded.
   At one time speculative, the coal-gasification technology developed at
the Great Plains project is now ``a great success,'' Levant asserted. He
said ``there has been no persuasive showing in the record that continued
operations of the plant cannot be sustained'' under modified versions of
the original agreements approved in opinion 119.
   Levant also held that an appropriate ``top-of-the-market'' pricing
formula for the period commencing May 1, 1993, would be based on an average
of Gulf Coast spot-price indexes plus a 5% premium. Testimony during the
hearing by a ratepayer witness ``recognizes a reasonable premium for SNG in
tracking the natural-gas market, which is supported by [a] survey of
LDCs,'' said the decision.
   The formula endorsed by Levant would have produced a 1995 average price
of around $1.65/MMBtu, using figures from Inside F.E.R.C.'s Gas Market
Report. In his statement, Janssen said that Dakota Gasification's cost of
production currently is $2.60/MMBtu, ``and the pricing Judge Levant
suggests comes nowhere near covering costs. For the judge to suggest
[Dakota Gasification] can survive with that price is ludicrous.''
   Levant ruled that the pipelines' purchase obligations should be limited
to the original total of 137,500 MMBtu/day, rather than the settlements'
153,520 MMBtu/day. Even though the contract-demand language in the original
agreements is pegged to the total output of the plant, which has since
increased, Dakota Gasification ``has made no showing to justify unlimited
expansion of the original contract obligations for the purchase of SNG by
the pipelines or the ratepayers,'' the judge said. Excess volumes produced
at the plant can be made available for sale by Dakota Gasification ``at
competitive market prices or for production of the more lucrative
byproducts and co-products.''
   Dakota Gasification said the plant's average production since 1988 has
been 157,000 Mcf/day.
   Finally, the rate charged by Dakota Gasification for transporting gas
from the plant to an interconnection with Northern Border Pipeline Co. at
Hebron, N.D., should be 5.5 cents/MMBtu, rather than the 22 cents/MMBtu
proposed by the plant owner, Levant said. According to an estimate by Ferc
staff, Dakota Gasification already has collected some $46 million in
transportation revenue, which has ``fully compensated'' the company for
transportation ``for the entire [25-year] life of the project,'' the
decision said.
   If the decision is upheld, the pipelines would have to refund to
customers all amounts above the price and volume specified in the order
since May 1, 1993. Dakota Gasification, which vowed to file exceptions to
Levant's decision within 30 days, noted that the commission has promised to
act in the case by the end of 1996.

GAS PRICES TO CONSUMERS FELL MORE THAN WELLHEAD PRICES over the past 10

GAS PRICES TO CONSUMERS FELL MORE THAN WELLHEAD PRICES over the past 10
years, according to a study released last week by the American Gas Assn.
While some classes of customers enjoyed greater savings than others, all
customers experienced lower prices in real terms during the decade ending
in 1994, said AGA President Michael Baly.
   ``Over this 10-year period, the actual average price of natural gas to
all customers declined by 93 cents/Mcf,'' while wellhead prices fell by 78
cents/Mcf, he said. Industrial customers saw the largest savings, averaging
57%, ``as regulators and utilities moved toward reflecting the actual cost
of service for a customer and toward eliminating the historic subsidization
of residential prices by large-volume users,'' the report said. During the
same period, residential gas prices fell by 24%, after having increased by
111% the previous decade.
   A recent Energy Information Administration study covering the period
1988 through 1994 found that wellhead prices and the cost of transmission
to the city-gate fell roughly equally but that distribution markups did not
decline (IF, 4 Dec, 3).
   Seeking to deflect criticism that the distribution and transmission
sectors of the industry have not done enough to reduce costs, Baly said
that costs in these sectors declined by 33% during the 10 years. ``The
pricing structures of the different sectors of the industry are not the
same and they respond differently and at different times to the commodity,
labor and capital markets, and to regulatory impediments,'' he said. Baly
added that ``this makes it unlikely that prices in each sector would move
identically and simultaneously on a percentage basis.''
   Offering a cost-cutting example, the report noted that the gas utility
industry served almost 58-million gas meters in 1994 with about 187,000
employees, compared with 49-million meters and 221,000 employees 10 years
earlier. ``That's the equivalent of serving 18% more customers with 15%
fewer employees, a personnel reduction of 34,000 across the utility
industry,'' said the report.
   The bottom line ``still is that all gas customers are benefiting from
increased competition and lower gas prices,'' Baly concluded. Gas demand
increased by nearly 30% during the 10-year study period, the report noted.
And to extend this trend in the face of growing competition from a
restructured electric industry, ``all sectors of the industry will continue
working to reduce costs, to enhance product value to gas consumers and to
resist attempts to fragment and weaken the industry.''

Natural Gas Prices,'' contact AGA at (703) 841-8400.

WILLIAMS STEPS IN AS FULL KERN RIVER OWNER AFTER FTC KNOCKS QUESTAR OUT

   It all happened rather quickly. After the Federal Trade Commission late
last month moved to block Questar Pipeline Co.'s $225 million plan to
acquire Tenneco Energy's 50% ownership interest in Kern River Gas
Transmission Co., the parties agreed not to challenge the decision and
Tenneco Energy promptly picked another suitor, reaching an agreement at a
lesser price with The Williams Cos. Inc. on Dec. 31.
   Since it already owns the other half of Kern River, Williams would be
the sole owner of the Wyoming-to-California pipeline. The $205 million sale
is subject to FTC approval, which is where Questar ran into problems in its
bid.
   Reasoning that Questar's planned ownership in Kern River would translate
into a monopoly on gas service in the Salt Lake City area, the FTC on Dec.
27 said it would bar the move. Questar owns Utah distributor Mountain Fuel
Supply Co. and the FTC was concerned that if it also held a portion of Kern
River, the pipeline would not bypass Mountain Fuel to serve customers
directly, an FTC official noted.
   If the purchase had gone through, ``Questar could discourage Kern River
from competing in the area,'' according to William Baer, director of the
FTC's Bureau of Competition. ``Kern River was soliciting business in the
Salt Lake City area,'' and ``diminishing that threat of lateral bypass to
Kern River was our concern with the acquisition,'' Baer told Inside
F.E.R.C. Industrial customers should view the ruling as a positive
development, he asserted.
   Following the decision, Questar decided to forgo the purchase rather
than challenge the FTC. Litigation ``wasn't in our best interest,'' a
Questar spokesman said. ``Our interest was access to Nevada and California
markets,'' he said. ``We are disappointed'' with the FTC ruling ``and don't
agree with it,'' Tenneco Energy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve
Chesebro' said in a statement. But the company decided to contact potential
buyers rather than fight the FTC, Chesebro' said.
   The Questar spokesman noted that Questar and Tenneco Energy had filed
documents with the FTC and conducted extensive discussions with FTC staff
to demonstrate that the purchase would not reduce competition for gas
transportation services in Utah. ``We said both Ferc and state regulators
would pay attention to whether Mountain Fuel was acting in the customers'
best interest,'' the spokesman explained.
   Mountain Fuel does receive gas from Kern River to serve customers near
Salt Lake City, but ``Kern River has never sold gas in the area,'' he
added. The Questar spokesman suggested that the FTC was ``using an obsolete
view of the pipeline industry'' that didn't include the open-access
principles of order 636. He noted that Questar had planned to have its Kern
River functions separate from its other operations to mitigate any
antitrust concerns.
   According to a release from the FTC, the acquisition would
``substantially reduce competition'' between Questar and Kern River, which
would lead to ``higher prices and other anticompetitive effects.'' The fact
that Questar owns Mountain Fuel ``enhanced its market power,'' Baer noted.
He conceded that ``this is a somewhat unusual antitrust case'' because Kern
River is a competitive presence in the area ``even though they have zero
percent of the market.''
   And ``we weren't convinced'' that Ferc regulation of Kern River would
alleviate that market power, Baer said. What's more, Questar has said that
it faces competition from Kern River because Kern River has expressed its
intentions to expand to directly serve the Salt Lake City area, and the
planned purchase was like ``buying an insurance policy'' against that
competition, Baer asserted.
   As for the sale to Williams, Tenneco Energy said the companies executed
a binding $205 million agreement on the last day of the year. ``We
concluded it was in Tenneco's best interest to avoid the time and expense
involved in restarting the bidding process and go ahead and finalize the
terms of the transaction before year-end,'' Chesebro' said. The timing of
the sale also allows Tenneco Energy to retain about $10 million of net
operating income accrued since September, when the company first announced
the sale of its share of the system to Questar.
   Williams is pretty confident that it will not run into trouble getting
FTC approval of its Kern River purchase, according to corporate spokesman
Jim Gipson. ``I don't think they will have more of a problem with us owning
100% of Kern River than they have with us owning 50%,'' he said. Williams
subsidiary Northwest Pipeline Corp., which transports gas from some of the
same Rocky Mountain production areas as Kern River, ``serves the Pacific
Northwest,'' a market area completely different from Kern River's, he
noted.
   If the purchase is approved by the FTC, Gipson observed, ``we will
wholly own five interstate pipelines'' -- Williams Natural Gas Co.,
Northwest, Texas Gas Transmission Corp., Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corp. and Kern River.
   Williams has had the right since last May to make an offer to purchase
Tenneco Energy's half interest in Kern River. While the company ``has not
commented'' on whether or not it ever did, ``don't assume that we didn't
make an offer,'' Gipson advised.
   In September, when Questar agreed to pay $225 million for Tenneco
Energy's portion of Kern River (IF, 18 Sept, 8), Williams declined a chance
to match that offer. But Keith Bailey, chairman, president and CEO of
Williams, noted last week that lower interest rates, tax issues and other
factors combined to change the economics of the acquisition since then.
``We have always said that we were interested in [wholly] owning Kern River
under the right set of circumstances,'' Gipson pointed out.
   Lower interest rates are key to the deal's viability, Gipson said.
Williams and Tenneco Energy began working last year to refinance Kern
River's debt ``to take advantage of today's [low] interest rates,'' he
stated, and that will help Williams finance its acquisition. When Kern
River was built in 1991, Williams and Tenneco Energy each paid $150 million
of the $1 billion cost, and the remaining $700 million was borrowed from
various banks at an average interest rate just over 9%, Gipson recalled.
Williams plans to refinance the remaining $643 million of debt at an
interest rate that probably will be 2% lower, he said.
   Tax issues also came into play in the structuring of the deal, Gipson
continued. While Questar's transaction with Tenneco Energy was to be a $225
million stock purchase, Williams is buying Tenneco Energy's 50% partnership
interest, rather than stock. For Williams, purchasing a partnership
interest rather than stock is preferable for tax reasons, he said.
   The stock-purchase structure of Tenneco Energy's deal with Questar was
one factor that discouraged Williams from matching Questar's offer when it
had the chance, according to Gipson. ``The deal we had to pass on last
fall, the only opportunity we had was to match [Questar's offer], in
structure and price,'' he said. ``Every company is different, every
company's financial profile is different. So what is a great deal for one
company is not necessarily a great deal for another.''
   Gipson also noted that Williams is paying $20 million less than Questar
had agreed to pay. Williams is paying $26 million more, however, for
Tenneco Energy's 50% partnership interest than its own 50% Kern River
interest carries in Williams' own books. Williams has appreciated its
initial $150 million investment in Kern River to $179 million, Gipson
said.
   As 100% owner of Kern River, Williams ``could monetize the 50%'' it
bought from Tenneco Energy ``to an investor or to the public,'' Gipson
pointed out. ``We're not necessarily announcing that we are going to do
that,'' but the option would be there, he said.
   If the purchase goes through, Williams will stop reporting income from
Kern River as equity income and start reporting it as operating income. The
pipeline has been contributing $32 million to $33 million per year to
Williams' income; that would double once Williams gets Tenneco Energy's
share, and Williams also expects savings from increased operating
efficiencies. Williams always has operated Kern River, but Tenneco Energy
has handled the administrative side. After the acquisition, administrative
functions ``will be folded into our Salt Lake City offices,'' where an
administrative staff already is in place for Northwest. While it will add a
few people to the current Salt Lake City staff, Williams expects Kern River
to achieve ``annual savings of $2 million to $3 million'' as a result of
``not having two corporate entities involved'' in running it, Gipson said.
   Following the purchase announcement, Moody's Investors Service Inc.
placed the securities ratings of Williams and its subsidiaries on review
for possible downgrade. Moody's said its review ``will examine the
likelihood of a deterioration in Williams' financial position as a result
of the acquisition. Although Williams' 100% ownership of Kern River may
provide operational benefits, the acquisition is expected to add a
substantial amount of debt to Williams' balance sheet.''

WITH CONDITIONS, FERC SIGNS OFF ON PARKING SERVICES FOR THREE PIPES

   The added flexibility afforded customers is reason enough to approve the
plans of three pipelines to provide hub services in the form of parking and
loaning, Ferc reasoned in a series of orders issued late last month.
Proposals by Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., Mojave Pipeline Co. and
Iroquois Gas Transmission System all were approved with an effective date
of Jan. 1, subject to conditions. Ferc said technical conferences should be
held to address concerns about the Mojave and Panhandle plans.
   The pipelines generally proposed to establish programs that would allow
customers to park gas at specified receipt points for withdrawal at a later
date.
   Iroquois shippers were concerned that existing operations would be
hindered as the pipeline used excess line pack to provide the services (IF,
18 Dec, 6). But Ferc dismissed that notion in its Dec. 29 order (RP96-63).
Because Iroquois has assigned its parking and loaning service a lower
priority than firm and interruptible transportation, ``there is no basis
upon which to find, at this time, that the PAL service will adversely
impact Iroquois' provision of firm service,'' Ferc said. The commission
also found Iroquois' rates to be just and reasonable. It concluded that
Iroquois shippers will ``reap significant benefits in the form of added
flexibility'' as a result of the PAL service.
   For Mojave, which also sought to establish an imbalance trading service,
shippers had several questions about how the pipeline would implement its
hub proposal (RP96-67). With no storage facilities of its own, how would
Mojave's use of line pack relate to the creation of imbalances? shippers
wondered (IF, 25 Dec, 15).
   Ferc ordered a technical conference for parties to address ``their
operational concerns regarding how Mojave will offer hub services and how
the hub services may impact other existing services and tariff
provisions.'' Ferc said customers should be able to explore Mojave's
treatment of hub service revenues and its implementation of the new
imbalance trading provisions at the conference.
   ``Likewise, the technical conference can provide a more informed basis
to determine if Mojave's maximum `first-day' and `subsequent-day' rates are
too high, as suggested by several parties,'' Ferc said. The commission
noted that it's difficult to compare rate design among the pipelines
offering hub services because of the variety of those services and pipeline
systems. It's unclear what resources Mojave will use in rendering the
services, Ferc added. It accepted Mojave's hub plan subject to refund and
the outcome of the technical conference.
   The commission called for a technical conference in the Panhandle
proceeding as well, primarily to explore Panhandle's failure to allocate
any costs to its parking service and the possibility of a revenue-crediting
mechanism. Late last month, Panhandle sought to allay shippers' fears
regarding its parking service, insisting that it would meet its firm and
interruptible requirements before any parking transactions take place (IF,
25 Dec, 14).
   The commission's Dec. 29 ruling (RP96-51) found that the operational
flexibility, supply management and financial management options associated
with the parking service should be in place as soon as possible during the
current winter season. Despite those benefits, however, Ferc said Panhandle
needs to provide more support for the parking service rates. The commission
said ``the convening of a technical conference is the best method to
resolve the issues raised by the parties.''
   The order noted that Panhandle did not show a derivation for its
proposed minimum daily rate of 0.5 cents/Dt. ``Panhandle will be required
to file work papers and supporting materials which support and demonstrate
such derivations,'' Ferc said. It approved the parking service subject to
refund and the outcome of the technical conference.

SERVICE REVISIONS GIVING TENNESSEE SHIPPERS MORE FLEXIBILITY took effect

SERVICE REVISIONS GIVING TENNESSEE SHIPPERS MORE FLEXIBILITY took effect
Jan. 1 as scheduled, the pipeline reported to Ferc last week. The changes
were part of a settlement (RP95-396) on Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.'s
much-maligned services. In approving the deal Nov. 1, Ferc ordered the
status report on Tennessee's follow-through (IF, 30 Oct, 3).
   Certain firm transporters now can bump interruptible shippers. In
addition, flexible nomination and scheduling provisions have been
implemented, and provisions on unauthorized overruns and maximum allowed
volumes give customers additional swing rights, Tennessee said. The
pipeline's production-area pooling, or supply aggregation (SA) service,
also is now in place. Some 102 customers that scheduled nearly 3.9-million
Dt/day used the modified services and SA service for Jan. 1 business,
according to the pipeline.
   Tennessee said a pilot group of shippers successfully tested TENN-SPEED
3, an upgrade of its computer software, from Nov. 16 through Dec. 8. All
customers should be using the new software by April, it said. Also
beginning in April, new ``swing on storage'' and cash-out services will be
available.

FERC'S NOI SHOULD NOT HOLD UP OFFSHORE EXPLORATION PLANS, Shell Gas

FERC'S NOI SHOULD NOT HOLD UP OFFSHORE EXPLORATION PLANS, Shell Gas
Pipeline Co. told the commission in two different petitions last month. In
its notice of inquiry (RM96-5) on systems operating in the Outer
Continental Shelf, Ferc vowed to consider changes to its regulations in a
prompt manner because there are several projects pending at the commission
(IF, 4 Dec, 1).
   Shell Gas late last month said Ferc should not wait for the outcome of
the NOI before issuing an order on its proposed Mississippi Canyon
Gathering System (IF, 16 Oct, 11). Delaying a decision on its request for a
nonjurisdictional declaration ``would have exactly the effect that the
commission says it wants to avoid: impeding and distorting developmental
activities on the OCS,'' Shell Gas said. If the commission cannot issue an
order by Feb. 1, it could issue an interim ruling, declaring the
Mississippi Canyon facilities to be nonjurisdictional, subject to the
outcome of its inquiry, the pipeline suggested in the Dec. 22 filing
(CP96-9).
   Meanwhile, in a new request for a declaratory order (CP96-113), Shell
Gas submitted plans to develop the Garden Banks Gathering System in the
OCS. While Shell Gas commended Ferc for its effort to clarify its
regulations regarding the OCS, delaying the planned construction of the
Garden Banks system risks disruption of oil and gas production from
critical areas, it asserted.
   The Garden Banks system would consist of a 50-mile, 30-inch-diameter
pipeline extending from the planned Enchilada platform in the Garden Banks
area to a new platform to be set in the South Marsh area. It would
interconnect with the existing facilities of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corp., ANR Pipeline Co. and the Blue Water header system. Shell Gas and
Amerada Hess Corp., which has committed to a 20% ownership in the system,
expect multiple lateral lines to deliver gas into the 30-inch line because
there is insufficient pipeline capacity to handle expected production
volumes in the area. Shell Offshore Inc.'s production from the Auger Field
was shut in during portions of 1995 because of a lack of pipeline outlets,
Shell Gas claimed.
   Asserting that the Garden Banks system meets Ferc's primary-function
test, Shell Gas noted that Ferc found a similar ``spine and laterals
network'' of the Viosca Knoll Gathering System to be nonjurisdictional.
Although the planned 30-inch pipe would be the widest line classified by
Ferc as a gathering facility, the large diameter is necessary to handle all
of the expected production from the area, Shell Gas said. It added that
``collecting gas from multiple sources into a single 30-inch pipeline
`spine' is a more economically efficient way to handle the large volumes of
anticipated production from the Garden Banks area than numerous piecemeal
gathering lines from individual blocks to individual pipeline
connections.''
   The system would have a capacity of 1.2 Bcf/day, according to the
application. Shell Gas asked Ferc to declare the facilities
nonjurisdictional by March 1 so production can begin to flow by April 1,
1997. If the system is not ready for service by then, ``Shell and other
Garden Banks producers will be subject to significant financial losses,''
it told Ferc.

LATE TO THE GAME, EASTERN SHORE FILES INITIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN

   Two years after most pipelines were forced to jump through the hoops of
order 636, Eastern Shore Natural Gas Co. submitted its initial
restructuring plan. ``We've been in a unique situation,'' said Michael
McMasters, director of planning for Eastern Shore, explaining that the
pipeline at the time of industrywide restructuring was not required to join
the ranks of open-access pipelines. All that is about to change, however:
the pipeline agreed in a settlement to go open access and filed its plan
(CP96-128) Dec. 29.
   ``There really wasn't any great demand'' for open-access status on the
pipeline ``by any of the customers or any public agency'' when order 636
was issued, an attorney for Eastern Shore added. ``We felt customers were
pleased with the service and the rates'' from the pipeline, the attorney
noted. Since Eastern Shore was not an open-access pipeline, order 636 did
not apply, according to the attorney.
   More recently, however, at least one customer ``has expressed some
interest'' in unbundled service, ``and we thought the time was right'' to
offer it, the attorney said. McMasters added that in the pipeline's last
rate case, ``we agreed to open our system'' as part of a settlement.
   Eastern Shore's system runs from interconnects with Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp. and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. in southern
Pennsylvania through Maryland and Delaware, it noted. It serves four local
distribution companies and 12 direct sales customers, with a majority of
its throughput going to its parent, Chesapeake Utilities Corp., McMasters
explained.
   Operation of its bundled city-gate sales service requires a significant
amount of effort in coordinating receipts, McMasters said. It is severely
constrained in operational flexibility because peak-day throughput is about
four times the system's linepack, the pipeline noted in the application.
``The advent of open-access service on the Eastern Shore system, with new
rights and obligations being bestowed on both Eastern Shore and its
customers, may engender a great deal of uncertainty about the future
operations of its system,'' Eastern Shore told Ferc.
   Rather than retain upstream capacity, as some pipelines did, it proposed
to have customers exercise nominating and scheduling rights on Transco and
Columbia through Eastern Shore. ``We will act as an agent in scheduling
their gas'' on the upstream pipelines in order to preserve operational
control of its system, McMasters said.
   Another critical element to its operations is a certificate request
(CP96-97) filed last month (IF, 11 Dec, 14) to increase capacity on its
system and deal with the declining pressure on its Hockessin line, where it
takes gas from Transco, McMasters added. Noting that Eastern Shore proposed
an effective date for restructured services of no later than Nov. 1,
McMasters said ``we can't open our system until we get the other
certificate.''
   The pipeline intends to file a rate case implementing straight
fixed-variable rate design on May 1, the application noted. The timing of
the rate case is also tied to the certificate request in order to include
the cost of the additional facilities, according to McMasters. The switch
to SFV and other elements should produce an average rate hike of 13.56%, he
said.
   Eastern Shore proposed to implement a capacity-release program, with
bidding on a ``very simple'' electronic bulletin board that is still being
developed. ``Eastern Shore is proceeding very deliberately in the
development and implementation of its EBB in order to avoid unnecessary
costs which would ultimately be borne by its customers,'' it said. Any
transition costs resulting from restructuring will be collected consistent
with order 636, Eastern Shore said.
   In offering unbundled firm transportation, Eastern Shore said customers
will receive entitlements equivalent to their current bundled service
rights. It is offering firm and interruptible transportation, and a
no-notice transportation service. Eastern Shore said the cost-based sales
service requirement for small customers under order 636-A is not applicable
because it has traditionally not offered sales under a small customer rate
schedule.
   It sought a limited waiver from the commission's marketing-affiliate
standards. ``Due to its small size, Eastern Shore has historically shared
facilities and employees with Chesapeake,'' resulting in lower costs and
lower rates for its customers, the pipeline noted. And since the
distributor sells off-system gas, it is likely considered a marketing
affiliate of the pipeline. Eastern Shore said that it has separated the
operations of its pipeline from those of its marketing affiliate to the
maximum extent possible, however, with only two shared employees.

CONSOLIDATION OF GAS COMPANIES WILL CONTINUE IN '96, ANALYSTS PREDICT

By:
Cathy Landry

   The gas industry has not seen the last of consolidation, as
ever-increasing competition this year will force companies to seek greater
efficiencies and cost-cutting measures, according to industry analysts.
   ``I would say . . . the merger-and-acquisition activity will rebuild in
1996 as companies continue to transform into what I describe as energy
conglomerates,'' explained John Olson, first vice president of securities
research for Merrill Lynch. Even though there were some sizable
acquisitions in 1995, Olson characterized the 1995 merger-and-acquisition
activity as ``fairly quiet.''
   The really big year for consolidation, he said, was 1994, when Panhandle
Eastern Corp. merged with Associated Natural Gas Corp. in a transaction
valued at about $800 million, and The Williams Cos. Inc. announced a $3
billion acquisition of Transco Energy Co. (IF, 26 Dec. '94, 1). Olson
believes 1996 will rival 1994's activity level.
   Two consolidation trends should emerge, Olson predicted. First, the big
integrated energy companies -- ``the Williamses, Panhandles, Coastals,
Enrons, Sonats of the world -- will be looking very hard at both U.S. and
foreign acquisitions.'' Second, ``you will also see electric utilities
looking very hard at both pure [distribution companies] and integrated
natural-gas companies.''
   Ralph Pellecchia, a gas analyst and senior director at Fitch Investors
Service Inc., predicted that companies will continue to position themselves
to deal with greater competition. Because of increasing head-to-head
competition in a number of markets, Pellecchia suspects there will be even
more ``partnering up'' in 1996. He said producers and marketers will
continue to team up, as will producers and marketers with distributors. In
addition, he said more gas and electric companies will become partners in
the coming year. And he thinks there is the potential for gas distributors
and telecommunications companies to match up.
   Capacity turnback will remain one of the major issues in the gas
industry this year, Pellecchia predicted, with pipelines serving California
particularly hard hit. And the turnback issue will ``heat up'' in the
Midwest and in other areas of the country as contracts begin to expire and
pipeline customers move toward shorter-term commitments, he said.
   Gregg Anderson, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co., agreed
that merger-and-acquisition activity will continue next year. ``I think
1996 will be characterized by continuing consolidation and cost-cutting,''
he said.
   Anderson, who specializes in exploration-and-production companies,
expects there to be more, smaller transactions in 1996 than the eye-popping
megadeals in late 1994. ``I think there are fewer and fewer large companies
out there that have placed all their bets on long-term gas prices.'' He
noted, however, that ``there are a fair number of midsize companies that
are still being hurt by the volatility of gas prices.''
   Duff & Phelps recently lowered its outlook for gas prices over the next
five years. The rating group expects annual-average gas prices between
$1.80 and $2/Mcf, down somewhat from its previous projection of $2/Mcf
flat. If prices in fact do deteriorate, e&p companies will be forced to
continue to cut costs, Anderson said.

AGA ANNOUNCED ITS SUPPORT OF THE D'AMATO BILL TO REPEAL PUHCA, saying that

AGA ANNOUNCED ITS SUPPORT OF THE D'AMATO BILL TO REPEAL PUHCA, saying that
introduction of the measure ``is an important first step toward eliminating
an outdated statute that unnecessarily inhibits competition and has become
redundant in light of other, more effective reform implemented in the last
60 years.'' The American Gas Assn. board last month adopted a resolution
calling for repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (IF, 11 Dec,
12), just weeks into the term of the group's new chairman, George Davidson
Jr., who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Consolidated
Natural Gas Co., one of five AGA members regulated under the act.
   In a Jan. 3 letter to Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who
chairs the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, AGA
President Michael Baly offered the group's explicit support for ``repeal of
PUHCA as called for in your bill.'' Under the measure (S. 1317), Ferc and
the states would be provided access to utility books and records, and they
would have jurisdiction over rate treatment of costs associated with
affiliate transactions (IF, 16 Oct, 1).
   Baly further indicated that AGA ``recognizes that PUHCA relates to
corporate organization and financing, and repeal appropriately can be
considered apart from other legislation on a stand-alone basis.'' Key
energy lawmakers in the House plan to address PUHCA reform as part of
restructuring of the electric industry, but Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, has stated firm
opposition to linking reform of the act with comprehensive reform of the
industry.
   ``Your bill . . . recognizes the anachronistic and burdensome regulatory
system in place to enforce the provisions of PUHCA,'' Baly's letter
continued. ``That the Securities and Exchange Commission has endorsed
repeal of the statute makes this an opportune time for Congress to act on
this issue. We urge you to hold hearings on your bill in a timely fashion
so that the momentum building on this will not be lost,'' he urged.

UNION ELECTRIC, CIPS WANT STOCKHOLDERS TO GET CUT OF MERGER SAVINGS

   In seeking approval of their proposed merger, Union Electric Co. and
Central Illinois Public Service Co. have asked Ferc to authorize a ``shared
savings plan'' that would enable stockholders to recover direct merger
costs and then split the remaining savings with ratepayers.
   The two utilities, which would be operating utility subsidiaries of the
registered holding company Ameren Corp., also need Ferc approval of
agreements that would implement their plan to transfer Union Electric's
retail electric and gas service in Illinois to CIPS. The Dec. 22 merger
application (EC96-7) asked for expeditious approval without a hearing,
asserting that ``there can be no dispute that the transaction will produce
substantial cost savings, will expand wholesale market opportunities for
the majority of regional market participants and, therefore, will be
consistent with the public interest.''
   When Union Electric and CIPS announced their merger in August (IF, 21
Aug, 1), they projected cost savings of $570 million over 10 years. The
application raised that to $590 million -- $196 million in corporate and
operations labor, $204 million in corporate and administrative programs,
$69 million in nonfuel purchasing economies, $84 million in electric
production and $37 million in gas supply.
   The cost-savings projection was developed in the initial stages of
merger negotiations and thus is ``not an ex post facto attempt to justify a
decision to merge'' but rather has been ``an important element of the
applicant's internal merger planning,'' the application said. The
projection also doesn't include programs to reduce costs and increase
efficiencies that the two utilities have undertaken on their own, apart
from the merger, it added.
   Subtracted from the savings are costs of $19 million to accomplish the
merger, $22 million in transaction costs and a $232 million merger premium,
yielding net savings in the first 10 years of $317 million.
   The utilities said that in addition to the $590 million saved in the
first 10 years, the merger would produce another $970 million in savings in
the second 10-year period and almost $1.4 billion in the third 10-year
period. To allow stockholders to share in the savings, the companies would
amortize the $273 million in merger costs over 10 years in a way that
ensures there are net savings in each year. They then would split net
savings equally between shareholders and customers. The utilities asked
Ferc to find that the sharing plan ``is consistent with appropriate
regulatory accounting treatment.''
   CIPS serves 317,000 retail electric customers and 166,000 gas customers
in central and southern Illinois. Union Electric serves 1.06-million
electric customers and 100,000 gas customers in Missouri and 64,000
electric customers and 18,000 gas customers in Illinois. CIPS would acquire
Union Electric's electric and gas distribution systems in Illinois, but not
its generation or transmission facilities in that state.
   After the merger, under a ``system support agreement'' CIPS would buy
capacity and energy from Union Electric to serve the transferred electric
customers in Illinois. The agreement is intended to avoid cost-shifting
between state jurisdictions and, in short, ``to maintain the status quo,
with the generation and transmission system planned and installed to serve
these customers continuing to serve them,'' the application said. Without
the agreement, ``the transfer of the Illinois customers would not be
possible, and the resulting economies would be lost,'' it added, calling
the agreement ``central'' to the merger plan.
   On a related point, the applicants asked Ferc to authorize the transfer
of the current balance in an Illinois account for Union Electric's nuclear
decommissioning costs to a Ferc subaccount, since Union Electric no longer
would have retail service in Illinois.
   Union Electric and CIPS also plan to operate their combined generation
and transmission facilities as a single control area under a ``joint
dispatch agreement.'' The single control area would interface with 28 other
utilities, which ``should enhance interchange purchase and sales
activities,'' they said. ``The result should be reduced costs'' for the two
utilities.
   On wholesale electric issues, the two utilities said they have complied
with Ferc's merger policy by filing open-access transmission tariffs that
conform to the pro forma tariffs in the commission's proposed transmission
rule (RM95-8).
   Contracts for wholesale requirements customers would remain in place,
and any inclusion of merger costs in rates after current contracts expire
would be negotiated with those customers, the application said. Moreover,
Union Electric and CIPS committed to an open season in which any wholesale
requirements customer could terminate its contract by giving 90 days'
notice if either utility files for a rate increase. That commitment would
apply to the first five years after the merger is consummated. And any
wholesale customer whose contract expires prior to the fifth anniversary
would be allowed to extend its contract to the fifth anniversary date.
   Bulk-power market participants would benefit because the two utilities
would transmit at a single-system, postage-stamp rate, which would expand
rather than diminish bulk-power supply options, the utilities asserted. The
application included testimony by Rodney Frame of National Economic
Research Associates Inc., who concluded that ``there is no likelihood of an
adverse effect on competition in any of the relevant markets,'' the
application said.
   The merger was approved on Dec. 20 by shareholders of both Union
Electric and CIPSCO Inc., the parent of CIPS. The companies have filed for
approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Illinois
Commerce Commission and said they will seek authorization from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission as well as
federal antitrust clearance.

THE STATE OF THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY ``IS NOT AT ALL BAD''

THE STATE OF THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY ``IS NOT AT ALL BAD,'' according to
Edison Electric Institute President Thomas Kuhn. In a luncheon discussion
in Washington last week sponsored by the Washington International Energy
Group, Kuhn touted the 3.4% growth in electricity demand last year and
asserted that steady merger activity is ``changing the face of our
industry'' for the better.
   At Ferc, ``the mega-NOPR is on target and the commissioners seem to be
in sync'' for achieving the goal of issuing a final rule on open-access
transmission and stranded-cost recovery this spring, he said. Commenting on
a subject that is drawing increased attention both as part of and apart
from the debate over the proposed rule, Kuhn said EEI is ``very much open
to the concept of developing the specifics'' of what would constitute an
independent system operator for transmission service.
   ``But before you say that the ISO should be applicable to every place .
 . . you have to look at a lot of those specifics'' to make sure that it
accommodates unique characteristics of the affected market, he continued.
The industry remains concerned that one-size-fits-all solutions may be
inappropriate in the context of the restructuring, Kuhn added.
   Looking at what is going on in Congress, the EEI president maintained
that there is no need for legislation ``to address retail competition that
tells the state what they have to do.'' Asserting that ``states are
vigorously looking at competition,'' Kuhn said they do not need a federal
mandate to require retail wheeling. Asked if EEI is concerned that without
a legislative directive there will develop a hodgepodge of programs state
by state, Kuhn replied that markets are developing on a regional basis.
``Issues are being addressed'' and solutions are being examined regionally,
he asserted. ``You are just seeing the marketplace work.''
   Kuhn declined to speculate on what action Congress might ultimately
take, or when it might happen. House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas
Bliley Jr., R-Va., and energy and power subcommittee Chairman Dan Schaefer,
R-Colo., have talked about comprehensive legislation to restructure the
industry, possibly involving federal pre-emption on the issue of retail
wheeling (IF, 27 Nov, 1), but ``they haven't really come up with any
particular proposals at this time,'' he observed.
   Commenting on specific state developments, Kuhn said the investor-owned
utility industry was very pleased that the California Public Utilities
Commission's Dec. 20 restructuring order would permit 100% recovery of
stranded costs. And on that subject, he slammed the Electricity Consumers
Resource Council's proposal to give utilities the chance to recover no more
than 50% of such costs, suggesting that it in fact would allow very little
cost recovery (see story on page 1).

NEPCO CAN'T CHARGE A FIRM RATE FOR CURTAILABLE TRANSMISSION even though the

NEPCO CAN'T CHARGE A FIRM RATE FOR CURTAILABLE TRANSMISSION even though the
customer has agreed to the rate, the commission says. In a Dec. 29 order
(ER96-200, et al.), Ferc directed New England Power Co. to file within 30
days lower rates for the service that is subject to curtailment.
   NEPCO transmits power from the New York Power Authority to various
Massachusetts municipal customers, whose agent is Massachusetts Municipal
Wholesale Electric Co. In a renegotiation last fall, MMWEC agreed to pay a
firm rate for transmission of 35,456 Kw. Of that amount, 17,730 Kw will be
transmitted on a firm basis and the remaining 17,726 Kw will have a
curtailment priority higher than some nonfirm transmission but lower than
the firm service that NEPCO provides to itself and other firm customers.
   Ferc declared itself unpersuaded by NEPCO's arguments that MMWEC agreed
to pay the firm rate for the whole amount and that the utility wasn't
obligated to offer any firm service at all. ``For the firm service that it
will provide, NEPCO should be compensated. However, for the other service
it will provide, i.e., for the less-than-firm service it will provide,
NEPCO is not thereby entitled to an excessive rate,'' the commission said.

ELCON OFFERS STRANDED-COST RECOVERY PLAN; NO THANKS, SAYS EEI CHIEF

By:
Craig S. Cano

   Asserting that it's time to drop the posturing by utilities that seek
100% stranded-cost recovery and customers that argue for no recovery, the
Electricity Consumers Resource Council with some trepidation last week
proposed a formula that would permit utilities to recover up to 50% of
costs associated with uneconomic assets. The decision to put a
stranded-cost proposal into play stemmed from a desire to ``kick this thing
along,'' said ELCON Executive Director John Anderson, despite lingering
concern that the proposal might be interpreted as a signal that industrial
customers are willing to negotiate an even higher recovery figure.
   At a Wednesday press briefing to release ELCON's ``Road Map for the
Transition'' to a fully competitive market, the group's Director of
Technical Affairs John Hughes noted that uneconomic assets are ``very
clearly defined'' by the document. ``We are restricting what we want to put
on the table'' in the first place, he said. The result is that what ELCON
calls 50% recovery may indeed be much less than half in the eyes of
utilities.
   But the investor-owned utility industry trade group is not prepared to
budge from its insistence on the right to seek full cost recovery. ELCON's
complex formula for calculating and allocating stranded costs is ``designed
to ensure that there would be very little, if any, cost recovery,'' said
Edison Electric Institute President Thomas Kuhn. Speaking at a Thursday
lunch sponsored by the Washington International Energy Group (see story on
page 10), Kuhn asserted that the proposal ignores the fact that Ferc and
many states, like California, believe a utility's right to seek full cost
recovery is in the public interest. ``We really think it is a road map full
of ruts and potholes,'' he added.
   Asked if he sees the ELCON proposal as a bargaining issue to which an
EEI counteroffer will be made, Kuhn said that ``we already have come up
with our own proposal. We are sticking with it.'' EEI supports Ferc's
proposal to allow utilities to seek full recovery, he said, adding, ``I
don't see a bargaining chip here at all.'' Furthermore, ``I don't think
[the ELCON proposal] is going to be adopted by anybody,'' Kuhn said.
   The road map identified certain costs that would not be eligible for
recovery. For example, utilities could not recoup the above-market costs of
purchased-power agreements and/or fuel-supply contracts that the utility
has with affiliated companies. Also, ``no utility shall be allowed to seek
recovery of any costs associated with uneconomic assets that were committed
to subsequent to the enactment of the Energy Policy Act,'' said the road
map, which is a companion document to ELCON's ``Blueprint for Customer
Choice'' (IF, 9 Oct, 3).
   Utilities also would be required to engage in mitigation measures,
including writing off or writing down assets. Finally, during the
transition period to competitive markets, utilities would not be permitted
to earn a return on any uneconomic asset.
   Costs that could be recovered as uneconomic assets would include those
from purchased-power agreements and/or fuel-supply contracts with
nonaffiliates that exceed a market-clearing price; properly allocated
overhead expenditures associated with the uneconomic assets; some costs
associated with the deferred recovery of certain investments or
expenditures as a result of regulatory decisions; and the rate base value
of uneconomic generating assets in excess of their fair market value.
   However, stranded costs for generating assets would be reduced by two
factors. First, utilities would deduct from the calculation the
differential between fair market value and any generation assets below that
value. Second, the uneconomic asset costs would be offset by deferred
accounts that ``constitute outstanding utility obligations to their
ratepayers and are owed to their ratepayers,'' ELCON said.
   Having defined the eligible costs, the proposal then identified a
five-step process for recovering them. Step one would be to determine the
exact amount of the uneconomic assets through either a regulatory
proceeding or the utility's voluntary divestiture of the assets as a means
of determining their market value, which Anderson described as ``the last
great rate case or divest.''
   In step two, the state commission would determine a shareholder/customer
sharing mechanism. First, the utility would be required to commit to
mitigate costs to the ``maximum extent possible'' or the state could set a
``minimum mitigation threshold'' designating a level of expected
mitigation. The nonmitigable costs would be split between the utility and
customers based on a formula that would allow the company to recover no
more than 50% and could give even less based on the imposition of what
ELCON called a ``responsibility factor.'' That factor, to be developed by
each state commission, would reflect: the portion of the utility's
portfolio of uneconomic assets that were due to management discretion and
those that were due to government mandates; the utility's mitigation of the
mitigable costs; and the ``quality of the utility's management at the time
the uneconomic assets were incurred.''
   Essentially, an extremely well-managed and efficient utility that
``aggressively opposed'' any government mandate -- e.g., New York's 6 cents
avoided-cost law -- that created the uneconomic asset would get to recover
the full 50%. Conversely, a poorly run utility that did not fight such
government mandates could be denied recovery of any costs, ELCON said.
   In the rest of the process, step three would involve allocation of
recoverable costs to each customer class ``on a pro-rata basis using
cost-causation principles''; step four would be to determine a set recovery
period of three to five years; and step five would involve a true-up
mechanism to annually re-evaluate the level of the recoverable costs.
   That is an ``absolutely ludicrous way to go about things,'' Kuhn
commented. And in a prepared response, EEI said the proposal ``sets up a
regulatory nightmare, where utilities will be involved in proceedings for
years, arguing every point of legitimate stranded-cost recovery and
relitigating prudence, already determined by state commissions, with
ELCON's members.''
   EEI further asserted that the road map ``suffers from the same fatal
flaws'' that the trade group saw in the blueprint. ``It is an attempt to
advance ELCON's goal of imposing a one-size-fits-all `federal structure' on
the U.S. electric system which will deliver any benefits of restructuring
primarily to its members at the expense of everyone else.''
   Anderson revealed ELCON's intent to issue the road map at the National
Assn. of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' annual meeting, where he came
under sharp criticism from state regulators for the blueprint's lack of
detail about transition issues (IF, 20 Nov, 15). As he did at that time,
Anderson last week stressed that the blueprint was a ``vision'' document
meant to describe where the electric business should end up and was never
intended to address the transition period. The road map should ``dispel the
uncertainty of not knowing'' how to get to full competition, Hughes added.
   Stranded cost is just one part of the road map. Overall, it envisions
the transition as a three-year process to end on a designated day. Halfway
through the transition, customers would be allowed to choose their new
power supplier.
   Looking at market power, ELCON asserted that while customer choice ``is
a powerful weapon, . . . there must also be full enforcement of laws and
regulations to protect consumers against anticompetitive practices and
antitrust violations.'' Market entry is another check on market power, so
``no undue prohibitions should exist to entry in any market segment such as
generation, grid operation, ancillary services, transmission, local
distribution, merchant or customer service,'' it said.
   ELCON embraced the concept of operationally unbundling generation,
transmission, distribution and merchant functions into separate corporate
entities. That's the approach put forth by the Dept. of Justice in its
comments on Ferc's notice of proposed rulemaking on open-access
transmission (RM95-8). The road map also detailed the pricing and
regulation of interaffiliate transactions that would be necessary to ensure
success of operational unbundling. So while ELCON did not call for
mandatory divestiture, market pressures may bring about that result as
utilities find ``it isn't worth the hassle to stay under the regulatory
reach,'' Anderson said.
   But EEI countered that there is ``no need to `require' unbundling or to
encourage divestiture.'' The group said its NOPR comments demonstrated that
``the competitive market and the threat of competition will mitigate market
power. The establishment of [regional transmission groups], which EEI has
been advocating for years, can further help mitigate market power if some
feel it still exists.''
   On the issue of decontrol of generation, ELCON said that by the end of
the transition period all generation should be removed from rate base.
During the transition, and for some additional period if a fully
competitive market still has not emerged, the generating company would
continue to sell power to the affiliated or previously affiliated
distribution company under ``transition contracts at rates based on
embedded costs or other state-approved rates, terms and conditions,'' it
said.
   The transition contracts also would provide for ancillary and backup
services ``to all producers and consumers who had or achieved [Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act] qualifying status by the beginning of the
transition period.'' ELCON said repeal or reform of PURPA should not begin
until those contracts are in place and enforceable.
   That provision was panned by the PURPA Reform Group, which comprises
utilities seeking to repeal the mandatory-purchase requirement of section
210. ``Although ELCON purports to support `real competition' in electric
power, it seems bent on using PURPA for every subsidy it can possibly
get,'' the group said in a statement. ``Utilities would be denied recovery
of prudently incurred costs associated with uneconomic assets committed to
after passage of the Energy Policy Act -- and yet they would be required to
continue buying PURPA power for the indefinite future.''
   Anticipating that criticism, Anderson asserted at the briefing that the
debate over repeal of section 210 is misdirected in its focus on the
mandatory-purchase requirement. He maintained that no new PURPA contracts
are being signed at above-market costs and that the utilities' problem is
with older high-cost contracts. What is lost in the debate, Anderson
continued, is that section 210 also requires that backup and ancillary
services be provided to QFs. And until QFs are assured of being able to
obtain those services on a competitive basis, Congress should not pull the
section 210 rug out from under them, he said.
   In other sections of the road map, ELCON supported private ownership of
transmission and distribution lines, independent system operations and
coordination, and a federal/state joint board on universal services.

ISOS, CAPACITY RELEASE, ALTERNATIVE RATES HIGHLIGHT FERC'S 1996 AGENDA

By:
Chris Newkumet

   The coming year at Ferc should be eventful indeed with the commission
planning to make major progress on a series of initiatives spanning its
gas, electric and hydropower responsibilities. But the big enchilada
clearly is the open-access transmission rule, Chair Elizabeth Moler
indicated last week, vowing that a final rule will be out sometime this
spring. And a critical element of the rule may well involve independent
system operators, a concept that has caught the commission's attention to
the extent that it is planning a Jan. 24 public conference to further
explore the idea.
   In an interview with Inside F.E.R.C. last Thursday, Moler also vowed
that this year will bring: guidelines for reforming power pools to ensure
nondiscriminatory operation; a new merger policy that accommodates the
changing nature of the electric industry; substantial progress in
developing alternative pipeline rate structures and guidelines for
incentive rates; formalized information and business practice standards for
the pipeline sector; and possible revisions to the commission's
hydropower-relicensing regulations.
   What's more, Moler revealed that the commission is quickly narrowing the
field of potential changes to the capacity-release program designed to make
such transactions ``easier and more equitable,'' with final revisions
expected well before the end of the year. Still near the intractable end of
the spectrum of Ferc issues, however, is capacity turnback; Moler allowed
that no one has hit upon a ready solution to the growing dilemma, with the
commission and the industry continuing to feel their way.
   The highest-profile generic proceeding at the commission, the
open-access transmission notice of proposed rulemaking (RM95-8), likely
will cross the finish line ahead of all others. ``We're beginning very
serious staff work and commissioner work'' on the final rule, Moler said,
characterizing the recent holiday break as the ``seventh-inning stretch''
in the mega-NOPR game.
   Part of that work will examine how ISOs may fit into the final rule,
Moler noted, asserting that the concept has ``great potential'' in the
scheme of things to come. With three major power pools telling Ferc that
they plan to install ISOs, and the California Public Utilities Commission
including the concept in its restructuring plan, it was not hard for Ferc
to notice that ``the industry seems willing to embrace them,'' the chair
said.
   ``The issue before us now is how do we evaluate ISOs,'' Moler continued.
``What are the essential elements and operating characteristics of an ISO?
How do we make sure that ISOs, if they are created, are nondiscriminatory?
Are ISOs necessary? Is functional unbundling enough, or do we have to
mandate ISOs?'' At the public conference, ``we will benefit from some
additional dialogue on the issues as we work toward a final rule,'' she
said.
   ISOs have potential not only in tight pools, Moler continued.
``Individual companies or two or three companies doing a strategic alliance
could set up an ISO,'' she suggested. What an ISO should not become is ``a
reincarnated pool where only the utilities can play . . . and have the
potential to discriminate in favor of their own generation.''
   The commission has learned much by watching the individual state
restructuring proceedings, the chair said, emphasizing the interface
between the new state programs and what Ferc has in mind for the wholesale
market. ``Individual states are beginning to make their decisions about the
nature of their local distribution and the way they want their utilities to
be structured,'' Moler observed. Open access at the interstate level
``clearly facilitates that . . . it is an essential prerequisite to further
progress at the state level.''
   For instance, the CPUC ``has decided to go to direct access,'' she noted
(IF, 25 Dec, 1). ``So be it, great. And in order to do that, they decided
they need a power pool . . . [and] a power exchange. And they recognized
the power pool and power exchange are jurisdictional to this commission. So
there is absolutely a link between'' wholesale and retail open access.
   Anything to report on the Ferc/state jurisdictional split? ``The ball
now is in our court to come out with a decision and define what we mean by
interstate transmission,'' Moler acknowledged. ``Obviously, we've been very
cognizant of the states' concerns about it, but it's our turn to issue a
final rule'' and go on from there.
   The rules of the game for power pools also are on Moler's mind. ``I
anticipate major work this year on reforming power pools,'' she revealed.
During the recent conference on the topic (IF, 11 Dec, 1), pool
representatives ``all said they are reforming themselves,'' the chair
related. Even so, Ferc will give the matter ``a lot of attention this
year'' under the mantle of its notice of inquiry on alternative
power-pooling institutions (RM94-20). ``What do power pools have to do in
terms of new membership and new structures and split-savings rates in order
to be nondiscriminatory?'' she wondered. ``That's a big deal,'' and Ferc
will issue new guidelines this year.
   A new policy for utility mergers will be next up, Moler said, noting
that ``lots of companies seeking to merge are very anxious about what we
will do. It's very topical.'' She observed that ``some of the measures of
benefits that we have used historically'' to judge mergers ``will not be
appropriate'' in an open-access environment. For instance, in recent cases
utilities have been required to provide open access as a merged entity.
``Well, everybody will be open'' after the final rule is issued, ``so we
have to re-examine our merger policy.''
   In the area of hydro relicensing, ``we're making slow but steady
progress'' in working through the mountain of applications filed at the end
of 1993, Moler said, noting that the commission is ``encouraging
settlements, and we have lots of settlement activity going on in several
basins.''
   Looking ahead to the next major flood of relicensing applications due at
the turn of the century, the chair seemed to agree with the National
Hydropower Assn. that Ferc's regulations could use some upgrading. The
commission recently invited comment on NHA's petition for rulemaking (IF, 6
Nov, 4), and Moler said she would ``love to be able to move the process
faster at less cost to the project sponsors. And if changing our regs is
the way to do that, I'm happy to figure out what to do.''
   On the gas agenda for 1996 is reforming the capacity-release program.
Asked whether it makes sense to develop strict rules that the market
routinely evades, Moler insisted that the best approach simply is to ``make
capacity release easier to do,'' a task that she vowed to complete this
year.
   And the existing price cap clearly will be on the table. ``I'm certainly
aware that the capacity-release issue has evolved in the past year,'' and
one new element involves state regulators, Moler explained. ``As more and
more states are looking at competitive markets behind the city-gate, the
nature of the capacity-release program is going to change.'' One of her
``personal hesitations in terms of releasing the price cap'' has revolved
around the existence of workable competition. And ``if there are major
changes at the state level where there is full competition behind the
city-gate, I won't be as worried about the price cap.''
   Commissioner James Hoecker's idea of setting an annual revenue cap (IF,
25 Dec, 1) ``is one of a variety of things we're looking at,'' said Moler,
acknowledging that she is moving closer to the realization that the price
cap can be lifted under certain circumstances. ``The industry's changing,
the market's changing,'' Moler reasoned.
   Moler also will be targeting the relationship between capacity-release
deals and interruptible transportation, which she characterized as out of
whack. ``I think we should have some parallel requirements'' for capacity
release and IT transportation, the chair suggested, asserting that
pipelines tend to ``make it really easy to do interruptible, because they
make the cash, but much more difficult to do capacity release, because they
don't.''
   This dichotomy ``appears to be trivial, but it's not,'' Moler said. ``It
absolutely tilts the playing field'' in favor of pipeline IT service. ``I
don't think we can pretend that pipelines will be indifferent'' to whether
capacity release or IT transactions are conducted on their systems, ``but I
hope to make it easier'' for shippers to release capacity.
   Moler also has great hope for the commission's ongoing study of
alternative rates, maintaining that progress in this area could answer
recurring complaints about pipelines' earnings. Wall Street analysts and
pipeline executives have argued time and again that rates of return on
equity simply are not high enough in large part due to the discounted cash
flow methodology used by the commission, but Moler sought to shift the
focus of the debate. ``My belief now is that what we really need to
concentrate on is finding mechanisms that will allow the pipelines rate
flexibility, particularly as they seek to serve new markets or as their
customers want to package things differently.'' Developing new criteria for
incentive rates is another high-priority item.
   ``If we can do a better job than we have to date in those two areas,''
pipelines ``will have an opportunity to earn a better return. And we're
working on that.'' While some in the industry still complain about the DCF
methodology, ``the people who have made the most impassioned pleas to me
recently on this issue'' have asked for ``a way that we can be more
flexible.''
   Pointing to the recourse rate plan floated by the Interstate Natural Gas
Assn. of America (IF, 13 Nov, 7), Moler explained that the idea is for a
pipeline to protect traditional, captive customers while having the rate
flexibility to offer attractive terms to new customers. Ferc is ``very
seriously looking at what we can do in that area,'' the chair related. She
cautioned, however, that there are ``lots of questions about what kinds of
flexibility you should give pipelines. . . . I don't want to give them rate
flexibility in a way that will result in deterioration of open-access
service.'' That having been said, ``it's difficult to figure out how to do
that,'' she admitted.
   Moler predicted that within the next year or so, the ``with-it''
pipelines, ``those that want to offer new services, offer new deals,'' will
be in a position to earn higher returns due to improvements in rate
flexibility and incentives. This approach ``is much more promising than
spending a great deal of time looking at the DCF methodology,'' Moler said,
adding that ``there is clearly more enthusiasm in the industry for
alternative ratemaking approaches than there is in fiddling around with ROR
analyses and the DCF methodology.''
   An issue that does not elicit such optimism from Moler is capacity
turnback. ``The commission and the industry seem to be feeling their way''
in this area, she acknowledged, noting that none of the major players in
the debate as yet has come up with ``a solution'' to the problem. ``The
best solution is growing the marketplace,'' she offered, while admitting
that certain markets where turnback is an acute problem, like Chicago and
California, show no signs of imminent growth. ``Where markets are not
growing, it's a very difficult issue.''
   Referring to the recent order involving Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of
America (IF, 16 Oct, 1), Moler noted that ``all we've been able to come up
with to date'' in terms of a potential solution ``is basically rate
flexibility. That's what the Natural order stands for -- rate flexibility
but don't zap your captive customers'' by shifting excess costs their way.
She conceded ``that is not a final solution in any way, shape or form. I
don't pretend it is.'' Natural responded that Ferc ``can't possibly think
this is enough,'' she related. But the pipeline and its customers are
busily pursuing a settlement, she said, suggesting that the long
give-and-take process may be the only way out for pipelines like Natural
and El Paso Natural Gas Co.
   And it could get worse, Moler allowed. Would the commission stand by and
watch a pipeline suffer severe financial hardship, even bankruptcy, due to
turnback costs? ``I certainly hope'' that doesn't happen. ``Anybody in this
position would hope not. But it could happen.''
   Ferc is feeling some financial pressure of its own these days, due to
budget authorization that orders a 20% reduction in oil-and-gas staff over
the next two years (IF, 20 Nov, 4), and Moler is none too pleased. ``I'm
not happy,'' she said of the budget cut. ``We went in with a voluntary and
very significant cut, and they cut us even further. No manager . . . would
be happy in those circumstances.'' But ``it's a fact of life'' now, and
``the fact that they gave us two years'' to make the cuts ``certainly makes
it easier to deal with.'' Through attrition and transfer of staff to the
electric program, Moler is hoping that ``we don't have to lay too many
people off'' as a result of the budget directive.

COMMENT DEADLINE EXTENDED

Ferc is beginning to feel the impact of the partial shutdown of the federal
government. Noting that a number of agencies closed due to the budget
impasse were unable to file comments on the draft environmental impact
statement (IF, 20 Nov, 13) for the open-access notice of proposed
rulemaking (RM95-8), the commission last week lifted the comment deadline.
``In order to accommodate this unusual circumstance, notice is hereby given
that an extension of time for the filing of comments by all parties on the
DEIS is granted for a reasonable period after the agencies have reopened.''
The comments had been due today (Monday); a new deadline will be set in a
future notice, Ferc said.

EQUITRANS AGREED TO BE PLACED AT RISK FOR ITS STORAGE EXPERIMENT involving

EQUITRANS AGREED TO BE PLACED AT RISK FOR ITS STORAGE EXPERIMENT involving
the injection of nitrogen to replace a certain amount of base gas at its
Shirley reservoir in West Virginia. Equitrans Inc. ``believes that this
project is important both for itself and for the industry and is willing to
assume the risks of the project to see it move forward,'' the pipeline said
in a Dec. 29 amendment to its application (CP95-565).
   One of the contested elements of Equitrans' certificate request was a
condition that if the project fails, the pipeline will be guaranteed
recovery of the net book value of the facility, along with a return on its
investment (IF, 31 July, 15). After another look at the risks and remedies
in case the nitrogen mixes with other gas to damage the facility, Equitrans
said it would bear all costs associated with such an event.
   However, the likelihood of that occurring is less than 1%, according to
Equitrans. Under a worst-case scenario, Equitrans said costs to restore the
storage field to normal operations would amount to $1.7 million. It added
that it would use the revenue generated from the sale of the withdrawn base
gas to fund the restoration efforts.
   Furthermore, Equitrans assured customers that the terms of all existing
storage contracts would be met regardless of any adverse effects resulting
from the project. ``This commitment is being made in order to render moot
the security-of-supply concerns'' expressed by customers and to limit the
number of issues to be addressed by Ferc, Equitrans said.
   The pipeline also specified how much base gas it intends to replace with
nitrogen. Although it plans to inject 300,000 Mcf of nitrogen, Equitrans
proposed to withdraw up to 400,000 Mcf of base gas to allow the pressure
within the reservoir to push the nitrogen away from working-gas parts of
the facility. The net reduction in base gas ``will ultimately reduce
Equitrans' storage rate base to the benefit of customers, while having
virtually no impact on storage operations,'' the pipeline said.

AVOCA'S CERTIFICATE AMENDMENTS WERE APPROVED WITH ONLY A FEW adjustments,

AVOCA'S CERTIFICATE AMENDMENTS WERE APPROVED WITH ONLY A FEW adjustments,
most of which involve environmental conditions. Sponsors of Avoca Natural
Gas Storage sought four changes in its certificate to operate the facility,
including installing a header that would allow connections with two
pipelines in addition to its approved link with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.
(IF, 23 Oct, 15).
   Ferc's Dec. 29 order (CP94-161) approved the header, designed to
accommodate connections with CNG Transmission Corp. and National Fuel Gas
Supply Corp., along with the other three amendments.
   The commission dismissed the concerns of Rochester Gas & Electric Corp.,
which has unused storage and transportation capacity on CNG Transmission
and argued that a connection is not needed because of its unsubscribed
capacity. The commission said it is not approving an interconnect yet, but
is simply allowing the installation of the header. ``Rochester Gas should
intervene and raise its concerns when an application is filed to construct
the interconnect between Avoca and CNG,'' Ferc suggested.
   The order approved the use of electric compressor motors rather than the
gas-fired engines originally planned, noting the reduced emission and noise
levels. Ferc also found no problems with Avoca's switch to six caverns
instead of five, since there will be no change in the working-gas capacity
of 5 Bcf. Lastly, the commission approved Avoca's request to take water
directly from the Cohocton River to supplement its withdrawals of water
from the storage caverns.

PLEASE LET US FINISH CONSTRUCTING OUR FACILITIES, EGAN TOLD FERC in an

PLEASE LET US FINISH CONSTRUCTING OUR FACILITIES, EGAN TOLD FERC in an
emergency motion for clarification. Egan Hub Partners L.P. was in the
middle of construction under Ferc's prior-notice procedures when the
commission issued its order asserting jurisdiction over Egan's operations,
it explained in a motion (CP96-21) late last month.
   Although its storage facilities in Louisiana have been operating since
summer, Egan filed a prior-notice request in October to build 6.7 miles of
24-inch pipeline and related equipment to connect with Columbia Gulf
Transmission Co. The notice said that Egan would operate the facilities
under section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, and construction began on
Dec. 4, Egan related.
   Then Ferc issued its order (PR95-11) finding Egan's interstate storage
facilities subject to its jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act and
directing Egan to seek NGA section 7 authority (IF, 18 Dec, 1). Egan halted
construction in order to seek clarification of Ferc's ruling.
   Even though Ferc said it should continue storage service using its rates
in effect, Egan asked Ferc to interpret the order to allow the section 311
construction to continue. ``Egan believes that the order was not intended
to penalize Egan or its customers for those actions initiated prior to
issuance of the order,'' it said. ``Justice requires either clarification
or a stay in order to allow Egan to complete construction of the
facilities,'' the company asserted. No environmental benefit would be
gained by delaying the construction, it added.
   And Ferc recently stayed its decision asserting jurisdiction over
pipeline systems run by Kansas Pipeline Operating Co. (IF, 18 Dec, 2) to
avoid potential hardship and inequity, Egan said in claiming that its
situation is almost identical to that of the Midwest pipeline systems.
   If Ferc does not grant the relief, ``customers will not receive the
service they expected during the winter heating season,'' Egan said,
enclosing affidavits from three customers that signed up for service
through the Columbia Gulf interconnect. With prompt approval from Ferc,
Egan said it could complete the facilities and initiate service for the
customers by Feb. 1.
   ``Without the requested authority, Egan, and ultimately its customers,
will incur additional and unnecessary costs,'' it said. Egan noted that it
is currently paying standby costs for contractors and equipment totaling
almost $17,000/day -- ``an amount which is significant for a company of
Egan's size.''

SHIPPERS CAN CHOOSE TO PAY KOCH GATEWAY DIRECTLY FOR FUEL USED to transport

SHIPPERS CAN CHOOSE TO PAY KOCH GATEWAY DIRECTLY FOR FUEL USED to transport
their gas now that the commission has approved the pipeline's
cash-reimbursement plan. Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. had offered to allow
customers to select the cash-reimbursement option once it posts a price for
such deals on its electronic bulletin board (IF, 11 Dec, 13), and the
commission late last month turned thumbs up on the proposal.
   In a Dec. 28 decision (RP96-58), Ferc dismissed arguments that the sale
of fuel gas should be made by a separate arm of the pipeline and comply
with the commission's affiliate standards. Noting that it has approved
similar tariffs for other pipelines, Ferc reasoned that the
cash-reimbursement option is analogous to imbalance cash-out programs. The
commission said Koch Gateway's plan ``is not a marketing service, but is an
extension of its transportation service, and it is not necessary for the
sale to be made by Koch Gateway's marketing affiliate.''
   Once a customer selects cash reimbursement, Koch Gateway will offer the
same deal to similarly situated shippers while retaining the right to deny
requests, according to the order. Rejecting protests that the tariff
provides Koch Gateway too much discretion in who would qualify for cash
reimbursement, Ferc said the pipeline needs some operational flexibility
for situations when it needs to have the fuel in-kind. ``We find that the
terms of the tariff and the commission's regulations afford customers
adequate protection against arbitrary action by Koch Gateway,'' Ferc said.
   Shippers will still have the option of reimbursing Koch Gateway by
supplying gas in-kind, the commission noted. It accepted the change with an
effective date of Jan. 1.

AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE EL PASO RATE CASE, ``there
just does not appear to be present the necessary give and take, at least at
this point,'' to produce a settlement anytime soon, the commission's head
administrative law judge commented late last month in appointing an ALJ to
commence a formal hearing.
   While rejecting El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s proposed exit fee to recover
costs of turned-back capacity last summer, the commission directed parties
to pursue a settlement of other elements of the rate case (RP95-363),
setting a Dec. 31 deadline. Parties recently offered differing views on the
progress of those negotiations (IF, 18 Dec, 7), and Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner
Jr. apparently agreed with the darker view held by Southern California
Edison Co., which earlier last month called on the commission to appoint a
hearing judge.
   The parties ``have now had some five months of active negotiations,
including unprecedented conferences before a settlement judge'' both in and
outside Washington, said the scheduling order. ``With the number of
conferences that have been held and the enormous effort that has been put
forth, everything that could have been said by the parties has been said
many times and everyone's desires have been fully considered,'' Wagner
observed. Even so, ``it does not now appear that a unanimous settlement or
even a unanimous partial settlement is possible.''
   Accordingly, the case should go to hearing ``on an expedited basis''
under the hand of ALJ Joseph Nacy. The order directs Nacy to issue an
initial decision within 18 months.
   And while ALJ David Harfeld was relieved of his duties as settlement
judge, ``there is no reason the parties cannot continue to meet among
themselves to try to work out their differences and dispose of this rather
difficult case through an agreed-upon settlement,'' Wagner observed. In
fact, the parties are scheduled to meet again in Washington Jan. 10-11.
   Separately, El Paso on Dec. 28 filed to place into effect as of Jan. 1 a
modified version of the June 30 rates accepted and suspended by the
commission last summer.

ANR IS DOUBLE-CHARGING FOR SERVICE TO A PLANT IN OKLAHOMA, Amoco Production

ANR IS DOUBLE-CHARGING FOR SERVICE TO A PLANT IN OKLAHOMA, Amoco Production
Co. asserted late last month. Based on the pipeline's misclassification of
its own facilities behind the Mooreland processing plant, ANR Pipeline Co.
is collecting both transportation and gathering charges, Amoco told the
commission.
   In its complaint (RP96-92), the producer asked Ferc to classify ANR's
facilities behind the plant as gathering and make the pipeline refund
transportation charges previously collected on plant fuel and shrinkage
volumes. ANR operates several compressor stations in the area, with some
attached to its transportation system and others connected to gathering
lines, Amoco related. ANR operates its Mooreland station, however, as both
a transportation and gathering facility, according to Amoco.
   The pipeline's intent is to create a way to charge both gathering and
transportation fees for gathering service, Amoco asserted. After applying
Ferc's modified primary-function test to ANR's Mooreland-area system, Amoco
said ``none of ANR's behind-the-plant facilities performs a transportation
service with respect to field production delivered to the inlet of the
Mooreland plant and are therefore improperly classified as transmission
facilities.''
   As operator of the Mooreland processing plant, Amoco explained that it
usually provides plant fuel and shrinkage volumes by sourcing gas upstream
of the plant. But ``ANR's classification of behind-the-plant facilities has
inhibited Amoco's ability to obtain upstream gas supplies because ANR
bundles together transportation and gathering rates on such gas,'' Amoco
said. So when ANR charges the Mooreland plant owners for downstream
transportation, it receives double charges on volumes of gas equivalent to
fuel and shrinkage, Amoco asserted.
   The producer noted that Ferc ordered Williams Natural Gas Co. to stop
charging both gathering and transportation rates on fuel and shrinkage
volumes in a similar case. The ANR proceeding deserves the same treatment,
Amoco said, asserting that Ferc should order refunds, with interest, on all
improper transportation charges collected since ANR unbundled its gathering
and transportation rates.

FERC WILL DETERMINE RATE TREATMENT FOR NORTHERN BORDER'S proposed

FERC WILL DETERMINE RATE TREATMENT FOR NORTHERN BORDER'S proposed
expansion/extension project in the pending certificate proceeding, it made
clear in a Dec. 29 rate order. Northern Border Pipeline Co. had filed pro
forma tariffs showing a change in its depreciation rate schedule that it
emphasized would be made only if the project is built.
   Competitor Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America had urged the commission
to reject the pro forma sheets (IF, 4 Dec, 15). But Ferc said it considers
the tariff sheets ``to have been provided for demonstration purposes only''
and neither accepted nor rejected them.
   The commission suspended the rate filing (RP96-45) until June 1 and said
a number of issues raised by shippers -- including Northern Border's
existing depreciation rates -- can be thrashed out in a hearing. But it
rejected up front two changes sought by Northern Border.
   First, Ferc said Northern Border can't drop its minimum revenue credit
for interruptible transportation. Under the pipeline's cost-of-service
tariff, firm shippers pay all of its costs and receive credits for
interruptible transportation. The minimum credit was put in place when
Northern Border began open-access transportation because the pipeline could
discount IT without bearing any economic consequences itself.
   ``This reasoning is equally applicable today and will remain so for as
long as Northern Border maintains this form of tariff,'' the commission
said, adding that the cost-of-service tariff ``gives Northern Border
advantages which other pipelines do not enjoy, their [straight
fixed-variable] rate design notwithstanding.'' Since other pipelines base
rates on projected costs and billing determinants, they face underrecovery
of their cost of service when they discount, the order noted.
   Second, Northern Border asked to eliminate a tariff requirement for a
triennial review of its equity rate of return. Again, though, Ferc cited
Northern Border's unusual cost-of-service rate structure. The three-year
review requirement has applied since the pipeline was built and ``was
considered an essential part of the regulatory bargain that was originally
accepted by Northern Border and still prevails,'' the order said. Northern
Border ``has not presented a basis for a departure'' from the policy, it
added.
   On another point, Ferc set for hearing Northern Border's request to
raise its allowance for charitable donations from $20,000 to $100,000.
Commissioner James Hoecker dissented on that issue, as he has in other rate
cases, saying he would ``summarily find that charitable contributions
should not be included in rates'' but nevertheless hopes Northern Border
``would continue charitable giving regardless of the rate treatment
permitted such costs.''

SPECIAL REPORT

If you had gas to sell in Louisiana for Jan. 1, 1996 likely is shaping up
to be a pretty good year. Jan. 1 index prices in Louisiana -- with a few
exceptions -- posted gains of $1.01 to $1.24/MMBtu over Dec. 1 index
levels. The exceptions were for Louisiana deliveries into Koch Gateway
Pipeline Co. (up 40 cents/MMBtu), Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America (down
2 cents/MMBtu) and Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. in West Louisiana (up
63 cents/MMBtu).
Sellers in Appalachia also found significantly higher index prices for Jan.
1 over Dec. 1: CNG Transmission Corp. was up $1.27/MMBtu and Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp., $1.20/MMBtu. Index prices on Mid-Continent pipelines
rose too (9 cents to 15 cents/MMBtu) but not by anywhere near as much.
   Indexes for pipelines in Texas, where longhaul capacity was limited,
ranged from minus 6 cents/MMBtu on Texas Eastern in East Texas to plus 8
cents/MMBtu in Florida Gas Transmission Co.'s zone 1. Indexes in the
Rockies were down 4 cents to 6 cents/MMBtu from Dec. 1. Permian Basin
indexes were up 15 cents and 18 cents/MMBtu, and the San Juan Basin index
rose a nickel.

SALP HISTORY REPORT

Note: NRC's SALP program was revised July 14, 1993 (NRC Management 
directive 8.6). NRC says that ``the final rating for each functional area
will be a composite rating of the performance based on a knowledgeable
balancing of the issues in a functional area and their safety significance.
Statistical or numerical balancing of data is inappropriate.'' With this
revision NRC has reduced the number of functional areas to four: plant
operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant support. This last area
includes activities such as radiological controls, emergency preparedness,
security, chemistry, and fire protection.

FOOTNOTES:
RPT - date report issued
ASSMT. PERIOD - assessment period
OPS - plant operations
RCON - radiological controls
MNT/SURV - maintenance, surveillance
EP - emergency preparedness
SEC - security
ENG/TS - engineering/technical support
SA - safety assessment/quality verification
PLSP - plant support
N - not rated

Category 1--Licensee attention and involvement have been properly focused
on safety and resulted in a superior level of safety performance. Licensee
programs and procedures have provided effective controls. The licensee's
self-assessment efforts have been effective in the identification of
emergent issues. Corrective actions are technically sound, comprehensive,
and thorough. Recurring problems are eliminated and resolution of issues is
timely. Root cause analyses are thorough.

Category 2--Licensee attention and involvement are normally well focused
and resulted in a good level of safety performance. Licensee programs and
procedures normally provide the necessary control of activities, but
deficiencies may exist. The licensee's self-assessments are normally good,
although issues may escape identification. Corrective actions are usually
effective, although some may not be complete. Root cause analyses are
normally thorough.

Category 3--Licensee attention and involvement have resulted in an
acceptable level of safety performance. However, licensee performance may
exhibit one or more of the following characteristics. Licensee programs and
procedures have not provided sufficient control of activities in important
areas. The licensee's self-assessment efforts may not occur until after a
potential problem becomes apparent. A clear understanding of the safety
implications of significant issues may not have been demonstrated. Numerous
minor issues combine to indicate that the licensee's corrective action is
not thorough. Root cause analyses do not probe enough, resulting in the
incomplete resolution of issues. Because the margin to unacceptable
performance in important aspects is small, increased NRC and licensee
attention is required.

Category N--Insufficient information exists to support an assessment of
licensee performance. These cases include instances in which a rating
cannot be developed because of insufficient licensee activity or
insufficient NRC inspection. The category is normally used for construction
phase reactors only.

INDUSTRY CBLA SAVINGS NEAR $600-MILLION MARK THROUGH MID-DECEMBER

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   The nuclear utility industry estimates total savings of $590-million in
averted costs from NRC's cost-beneficial licensing action (CBLA) program
through mid-December, 1995.
   Industry interest in the agency's CBLA program was about the same in
1995 as during the previous year, with utilities submitting 116 CBLA
requests through December 14, 1995 compared with 123 requests in 1994,
according to NRC's semi-annual report on the program. But industry
estimates of the savings gained through licensing actions approved by the
NRC dropped significantly from the previous year.
   In 1995, NRC approved 115 CBLA requests for a total estimated savings of
$235-million. During 1994, the agency approved 52 CBLA requests, totalling
$335-million in expected savings over the remaining operating lifetimes of
the affected nuclear power plants. In 1993, the first year of the program,
utilities projected $20-million in savings from 33 approved CBLA requests.
   The declining value of the estimated savings ``likely reflects [the
fact] that the licensees initially submitted CBLA requests with the
greatest value,'' Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) Director
William Russell said in a December 28, 1995 memorandum to Executive
Director for Operations James Taylor. Russell suggested that future
amendment requests will continue to show declining savings.
   However, Russell said that the economic impact of the CBLA program is
difficult to assess because utilities are ``not very specific'' with their
cost savings information. He cautioned that the industry's projected
$590-million total lifetime savings are based on conservative estimates by
utilities and could actually reflect higher savings.
   ``We believe that the combined lifetime industry savings is a very
conservative estimate because some licensees have not provided total
estimated savings but rather have simply indicated that savings realized
from the CBLA would exceed the $100,000 criteria,'' he said. ``For
uniformity, cost data submitted by licensees are presented as savings over
the remainder of the 40-year plant design life.''
   The CBLA program, which has been institutionalized in NRR, grew out of a
task force established in April 1993 as part of an NRC effort to help
nuclear utilities control operations and maintenance costs. The CBLA task
force was one of several groups established within the agency to work on
streamlining the regulatory process and reducing regulatory burdens on
industry.
   Two years ago, the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) forecast that
utilities would submit 400 CBLA requests a year during 1994 and 1995--far
more than have actually been submitted. Of the 272 CBLA requests submitted
by utilities so far, the NRC has approved 173 and denied 11. Utilities
withdrew three requests, and 85 submittals are still under review.
   During the six-month period ending December 14, the NRC denied one CBLA
request, a submittal by Northeast Nuclear Energy Co. for Millstone-1. The
utility had requested a revised exemption from Appendix R to eliminate
reliance on maronite boards as radiant heat shields in the cable vault
area. The NRC decided that the proposal would not provide an ``equivalent
level of fire safety to that required by Section III.G of Appendix R,'' the
memorandum said.

NRC APPROVES INDUSTRY GUIDELINE FOR MANAGING COMMITMENTS

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   Executive Director for Operations James Taylor signed a Secy information
paper December 20, approving a commitment management program developed by
the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).
   Secy 95-300, a Secy paper that does not require commission action,
finalizes the agency's approval of NEI's guidance for managing NRC
commitments, said Gene Imbro, head of the Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation (NRR) regulatory review group and cost-beneficial licensing
action (CBLA) program. The Secy paper caps more than 20 months of joint
industry-NRC work to develop a way to help utilities manage the thousands
of commitments on the books and eliminate those no longer deemed
significant to safe plant operation.
   About half of the industry is already using the guidance, and they are
saving money, according to Stephen Floyd, NEI manager of special projects,
who developed the guidance document. Floyd said that some utilities have
estimated ``a couple million dollars already in direct savings,'' while
others have projected several million dollars in soft savings (INRC, 13
Nov. '95, 1).
   Imbro said the commission paper contains a letter that the agency plans
to send to NEI endorsing the use of the industry commitment management
guideline. NEI intends to send a copy of the letter to all nuclear
utilities, along with the guidance document.
   The average nuclear power plant has between 8,000 and 10,000 commitments
per unit. Currently, there is no uniform method used by utilities for
determining how to change or drop commitments, NRC staffers noted. Adoption
of the NEI guidance document would be entirely voluntary.

NRC ORDER BARRING MAINE YANKEE RESTART COULD BE CLEARED THIS MONTH

By:
David Stellfox, Washington

   A restart of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co.'s Maine Yankee could still
come this month, plant officials say, despite an NRC order January 3
barring restart of the unit.
   Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Director William Russell issued the
order blocking Maine Yankee from restarting until it has satisfied certain
concerns about the safety analyses for the plant's emergency core cooling
system (ECCS) and containment.
   Once documentation is submitted to NRC addressing those initial
concerns, Maine Yankee will be allowed to start up. However, operation will
be restricted to 2,440-MW thermal, about a 10% derating, while NRC is
reviewing the material provided and until a new safety analysis for the
ECCS and containment is provided for operating at higher thermal power
levels.
   The plant's originally licensed thermal power is 2,440-MW thermal, but
NRC had granted it two power uprates in the 1980s. The unit was last
operating at 2,700-MW thermal.
   Maine Yankee spokesman Marshall Murphy said January 4 he expected the
plant would restart in ``the January time frame.''
   A planned restart in late December--after a one year outage to repair
steam generators--was derailed when an anonymous allegation was made that
the plant's safety analyses for ECCS and containment design were faulty
(INRC, 25 Dec. '95, 1).
   In its January 3 order, NRC said that it approved the use of the Yankee
Atomic Electric Co. (YAEC) version of a computer code, Relap5-YA, for
analyzing Maine Yankee's ECCS in 1989, but with ``twelve conditions,
including specifications for future plant specific licensing submittals,
justifying options taken and sensitivity studies performed.''
   NRC never followed up on the demands for information until after the
allegation was made December 4, 1995 and it found ``(t)his licensee has not
provided the justifications or submittals specified....''
   At a December 18 meeting at NRC, YAEC President Andrew Kadak said that
the material was held on site because, although the staff's safety
evaluation report called for submittals, a related NRC letter at the time
spoke of NRC audits. However, Maine Yankee spokesman Murphy could not
confirm that last week. Murphy said plant officials were still reviewing
the entire order, including ``taking a look at that language.''
   NRC noted that its order addresses only future operation and does not
address allegations related to violations of NRC requirements in the past,
including allegations of wrongdoing, which will be dealt with separately.
   According to the order, Maine Yankee must supply the following material
prior to restart:
   -- A description of evaluations that have been completed that provide
justification for the use of the current cycle's operating limits, as
established in the Cycle 15 Core Operating Limits Report, using methods
approved for Maine Yankee and without reliance on the Relap5-YA computer
code for small break loss-of-coolant accidents (SBLOCA) analysis and
assuming a reactor thermal rating of 2,440 MWt. Details related to analyses
performed, significant assumptions, and conclusions drawn shall be
provided.
   -- A description of all other applications where Relap5-YA is relied on
for Cycle 15 operation identifying the details of the application, and
conclusions drawn with respect to any facility modifications or procedure
changes. For each application, document the determination that operability,
as defined in Maine Yankee Technical Specifications, of affected
structures, systems and components is maintained. For plant procedures
required by Maine Yankee Technical Specifications that rely on Relap5-YA
analysis for operator action, document the determination as to why the
affected operator action continues to be appropriate or, if necessary,
evaluate the affected procedures in accordance with 10 CFR Section 50.59
and provide a summary of that evaluation. If any procedures are changed,
confirm that appropriate training has been provided.
   -- A description of measures taken to limit reactor operation to a
maximum thermal power of 2,440 MWt (90.37% of 2,700 MWt).
   -- A description of measures taken to limit containment internal
operating pressure to a maximum of 2 psig.
   Also, according to the order, Maine Yankee has 30 days to supply the
following information:
   -- A SBLOCA analysis that is specific to Maine Yankee for operation at
power levels up to 2,700 MWt. The analysis must meet the requirements of 10
CFR Section 50.46, ``Acceptance criteria for emergency core cooling systems
for light water nuclear power reactors,'' and NUREG-0737, ``Clarification
of TMI Action Plan Requirements,'' Items II.K.3.30 and 31, ``SBLOCA
Methods'' and ``Plant-specific Analysis,'' respectively, and NUREG-0737,
Item II.K.3.5, ``Automatic Trip of Reactor Coolant Pumps During LOCA.''
   -- An integrated containment analysis, accounting for relevant changes
to the facility (e.g., spray system changes, power uprates, and containment
maximum temperature and pressure changes), during a design basis accident
(DBA) that demonstrates the maximum calculated DBA containment pressure
meets the design basis pressure for Maine Yankee (55 psig). Assumptions
used for these analyses that are different from those specified in
Nureg-0800, the NRC Standard Review Plan, Section 6.2.1.1.A, shall be
described.

WHISTLE-BLOWERS SAY AGENCY SHOULD SUSPEND PLANT OPERATING LICENSES

By:
Dave Airozo Washington

   Two whistle-blowers locked in years-long battles with Georgia Power Co.
and the Southern Nuclear Operating Co. over alleged harassment want NRC to
immediately suspend the companies' nuclear plant operating licenses and
fine them more than $20-million because, the whistle-blowers say, the
discrimination by senior management continues.
   Late last week the whistle-blowers, Allen Mosbaugh and Marvin Hobby,
were expected to file a so-called 2.206 petition with NRC in which they
argue that the agency's own regulations require that the drastic action be
taken and the hefty fines meted out. They contend that senior managers of
the companies have repeatedly violated NRC whistle-blower protection
provisions and that the agency must escalate enforcement action.
   Last year, both Mosbaugh and Hobby won Department of Labor (DOL) cases
against the companies over alleged retaliation for whistle-blowing. In both
cases, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich directed the companies to reinstate
the men and ordered payment of other damages.
   In mid-December, Georgia Power filed a motion with DOL's Office of
Administrative Appeals asking that the record in the Mosbaugh case be
reopened and further hearings be held. In the motion, Georgia Power noted
that during the DOL proceeding, NRC's Office of Investigations had held on
to 76 tape recordings Mosbaugh had surreptitiously made of fellow employees
while he was assistant general manager of the Vogtle nuclear plant. OI used
the tapes recordings as part of its own investigation into Mosbaugh's
allegations of wrongdoing by Georgia Power management. The tapes were not
given to Georgia Power until after the record in the Labor proceeding was
closed, and Georgia Power now claims that the tapes contain significant
information that would have affected Reich's decision.
   Georgia Power also plans to appeal Reich's decision in the Hobby case
but the proceeding is in limbo at DOL because of the federal government's
budget crisis and resulting government employee furloughs, Georgia Power
spokesman Tal Wright said January 4.
   NRC is already considering ``escalated enforcement action'' because of
the Mosbaugh harassment case.
   In a draft of the 2.206 petition, the whistle-blowers note that Reich
specifically identified A.W. Dahlberg, former Georgia Power president and
now president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of
Southern Co. as having had an ``active role'' in the ``illegal'' firings of
Hobby and Mosbaugh. They charge that the discrimination against Hobby and
Mosbaugh, and Georgia Power's refusal to reinstate them, continues to have
a ``chilling effect'' on Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear workers and
that the NRC should fine the companies $200,000 a day for each day that
Hobby and Mosbaugh are not reinstated.
   With the meter running from the date of Reich's decisions, the fine
would total $20-million as of January 4.
   In their petition, the whistle-blowers also note that George Hairston
and Kenneth McCoy, both Georgia Power senior managers, were involved in
providing NRC with inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the
equipment performance and test results following a 1990
loss-of-offsite-power incident at Vogtle (INRC, 20 Feb. '95, 8).
   The whistle-blowers suggest that the repeated involvement of senior
officials in these cases reveals a pattern of noncompliance with NRC
regulations and that the agency must impose strong sanctions, including the
suspension of the operating licenses until the alleged management problem
is corrected.
   NRC regulations (10 CFR Part 2) do call for progressively stiffer
enforcement actions for repeated violations of the same requirements within
a two-year period. The agency has already hit Georgia Power with a Severity
Level II violation and a $200,000 fine for supplying inaccurate and
incomplete information related to the Vogtle incident and, as noted above,
is considering more in response to the Mosbaugh case.
   Under the NRC guidelines, if a licensee is slapped with two Severity
Level II violations within the two-year period, suspension of affected
operations should be considered.
   ``The actual progression to be used in a particular case will depend on
the circumstances,' the regulations say. ``Enforcement sanctions will
normally escalate for recurring similar violations.''

FOUR UTILITIES EXPECT SAVINGS FROM JOINT STANDARD TECH SPEC SUBMITTAL

By:
Wilson Dizard III, Washington

   Four Region IV utilities expect savings that could range into the
millions of dollars from their banding together to submit their standard
technical specifications applications to NRC.
   Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E), Texas Utilities Electric Co. (TUEC),
Union Electric Co., and Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp. (WNOC) joined
forces late last year to coordinate their joint standard tech spec
conversion. The utilities presented their plans to NRC staff at a November
14 meeting.
   Roger Walker, manager of nuclear licensing for TUEC, told Inside N.R.C.
that the savings from the standard tech spec conversion process could run
between $1- and $4-million a year.
   Alan Passwater, licensing manager for Union Electric's Callaway, said
his utility earlier planned to conduct a joint standard tech spec submittal
with WNOC, because Wolf Creek and Callaway were built to the standard SNPPS
(Standardized Nuclear Power Plant System) design devised by Westinghouse in
the mid-1970s. Passwater said extending the joint standard tech spec
application to four utilities would likely save his utility $200,000.
   The four utilities all operate one nuclear station each. All of the
units are in NRC Region IV, and all are two-train, four-loop Westinghouse
units.
   Managers for the four utilities see the joint tech spec application as
the first of what could become several joint efforts in dealing with NRC.
   NRC has been pressing nuclear plant operators to adopt standard
technical specifications (INRC, 15 May '95, 8). NRC staff estimate that up
to 40% of the surveillances required under existing tech specs could be
eliminated under standard tech specs. By mid-1995, close to 50 plants had
committed formally to standard tech spec conversion.
   Walker said that the four utilities plan to submit their joint
application in December 1996. ``It's a long, elaborate process,'' Walker
said, noting that the application would run well into the hundreds of
pages.
   ``We did an economic estimate before we started,'' Walker said. ``We
estimated hard savings and soft savings.'' The hard savings flowed from
requirements that would be dropped, and the soft savings were estimated to
come from avoided plant shutdowns.
   ``The soft savings were much stronger than the hard savings,'' Walker
said.
   Walker noted that some procedure changes that would require tech spec
changes under current conditions could be handled through NRC's 50.59
process under the standard tech specs.
   Walker also expects faster service from NRC in any future tech spec
changes after the standard tech specs are adopted.
   Steve Wideman, supervisor of licensing for Wolf Creek, said the impetus
for the joint standard tech spec submittal flowed from senior management
meetings among the four utilities last summer. He noted the joint submittal
would also save the utilities some of the NRC review fees associated with
the process.
   Pat Nugent, tech spec supervisor for PG&E's Diablo Canyon, said, ``We
believe there is some economic benefit. Also, NRC has been pushing the
industry hard to go to standard tech specs.''
   The four utilities expect that NRC will take four to six months to
review their standard tech spec application, which takes the schedule out
to mid-1997. The new tech specs will be implemented in the middle of an
operating cycle at each unit, but the utilities have not reached that point
in their planning yet.
   Some of the utilities are in the process of seeking line item changes to
their existing tech specs, a process that NRC staff said would continue
while the joint standard tech specs are developed.
   NRC staff told the utilities at the November 14 meeting that the
application process could be accelerated if the applications were sent
electronically.

DUKE POWER

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   DUKE POWER EXPECTS TO SAVE $2.7-MILLION AT THE OCONEE NUCLEAR PLANT by
changing the qualified life of pressure transmitters installed in the
reactor containment buildings of the three units.
   The 105 pressure transmitters inside the containment buildings all had a
10-year qualified life, based on the assumption that they would be subject
to ambient temperatures of 120 degrees F. Robert Smith, an engineer at
Duke, who for years had been pushing to install temperature devices in the
containments to determine the real temperature, last year installed
temperature monitoring data loggers at Oconee.
   The actual ambient temperature level in the basement was only 80 degrees
F, which allowed Duke to change the qualified life of the transmitters, and
obviated the need to replace them for the remaining operating life of the
unit, Smith said. The idea to install the temperature devices grew out of a
program instituted at Duke Power three years ago to review the
environmental qualification (EQ) of electrical equipment coming up for a
changeout before each outage, he added.
   Duke is continuing to analyze electrical equipment based on the actual
temperatures in which they run and expects to save several hundred thousand
dollars--maybe close to $1-million--on replacement costs for changing other
electrical equipment, such as level switches and solenoid valves, said
Smith.
   The utility also ``is looking at installing temperature monitoring
equipment at Catawba and McGuire, where greater savings are projected,''
according to Duke spokesperson Rick Zuercher.

NRC, FEMA, INDUSTRY WORKING TO DEVELOP MORE REALISTIC EP DRILLS

By:
Tom Harrison, Washington

   The NRC is working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
and industry organizations to develop more realistic emergency planning
(EP) drill scenarios that participants say will improve training and reduce
costs for plant owners.
   Members of the Realism in Scenarios Working Group include
representatives from the NRC, FEMA, the Institute of Nuclear Power
Operations (INPO), the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), and the Conference
of Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD).
   The idea originated with NRC senior management, who saw room for
improvement after participating in EP drills, said Aby Mohseni, NRC
emergency response coordinator.
   ``There are some good scenarios out there, but there are some that are
not as logical and coherent as others,'' he said.
   For example, a scenario might involve a plant having significant core
damage without major problems with core cooling, which is not possible.
   Or to test various parts of the plant in the drill, events could include
a plane crash, an earthquake, an on-site fire and several employees
suffering heart attacks--all within the space of a few hours.
   The NRC is searching its database to develop criteria for what makes a
good scenario, Mohseni said, and wants to have those attributes identified
within a couple of months.
   After that, the group, which held its first meeting in December, plans
to have a plant volunteer to test the criteria in an upcoming drill.
   The criteria aren't intended to become a regulation or increase costs,
and may eventually save money for utilities, he said.
   After the group develops a repository of scenarios, utilities will be
able to reuse them instead of having to come up with their own, he said.
   Every other year, each plant is required to hold a graded drill, which
is overseen and assessed by NRC officials. These biennial drills also
involve state and local governments, whose performance is evaluated by
FEMA.
   ``We've had 15 years of experience since TMI in doing the major
exercises,'' Mohseni said. ``Those 15 years have shed some light on where
we could get more benefit in training.''
   Plants also hold at least one emergency plan drill a year involving the
NRC and other outside agencies and conduct several drills annually on their
own.
   Costs for drills range from thousands of dollars to tens of thousands
depending on the number of people involved and the scope of the exercise.
   The biennial drills traditionally involve the release of enough
radioactivity to require several miles around the plant to be evacuated,
which allows FEMA to meet its requirements.
   Emergency planners say the scenarios are unrealistic because they have
to meet objectives set by the NRC and FEMA.
   ``You've got to break things in the plant that are almost beyond
belief,'' said Jim Weeks, manager of emergency planning at Wolf Creek.
   The scenarios also don't allow operators to be successful in solving
problems, he said.
   ``Operators know no matter what they do, they're going to go to a
general emergency,'' he said. ``From the operations people's point of view,
they're not getting much value out of it because they know they're not
going to be successful.''
   That results in negative training, said scenario group member Ron
Fraass, a public health physicist with the state of Kansas.
   ``It keeps control room operators from taking some ideas and running
with it,'' he said.
   Many utilities develop their own scenarios in-house. Paying a consultant
to devise a scenario can cost $60,000, according to industry estimates.

WORLD REGULATORS AGREE MORE WORK NEEDED TO LEAVE CIRC CRACKS IN PLACE

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Significant improvements are needed in plugging criteria and crack
sizing before circumferentially cracked steam generator tubes can be left
in service, a group of experts from the nuclear industry, research and
regulatory bodies agreed late last year.
   Those improvements depend, in part, on a much broader base of experience
of past degradation, better understanding of why and how flaws develop, and
more robust nondestructive examination (NDE) tools and analysis methods.
   As for criteria used to determine response to axial cracking, the
experts found present voltage-based criteria acceptable for now, but said
the criteria have weaknesses that may be offset in the future by improved
technology for sizing cracks.
   In any case, the experts said, international collaboration is needed to
develop more realistic plugging criteria based on examination of pulled
tubes and laboratory-produced cracks.
   At an international workshop devoted to steam generator tube integrity,
sponsored by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and hosted by the NRC's
Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research at the Argonne National Laboratory
near Chicago, 100 experts from 15 countries explored the extent of
knowledge on different types of steam generator degradation.
   Much has been learned since the NEA's last steam generator meeting in
Brussels in 1991. But participants decided that because of the evolving
nature of tube degradation any definitive conclusions would be premature,
according to Jean-Pierre Clausner, the NEA staffer responsible for the
workshop.
   Reports on the meeting were presented late last year to the NEA's
Committee on Nuclear Regulatory Activities (CNRA) and to its Committee on
the Safety of Nuclear Installations (CSNI), sponsors of the workshop. The
experts' findings and recommendations were numerous and detailed, given
that they met in parallel sessions covering tube degradation, inspection,
integrity, preventive and corrective measures, and operational aspects of
risk analysis.

Group Recommends Pulling More Tubes
   According to a summary prepared for the CNRA/CSNI, several of the
workshop sessions highlighted the need to pull and examine for analysis
more tubes and tube/tube support plate assemblies from both operating and
retired steam generators. The examinations are considered key to defining
the precise conditions of crevice chemistry, developing better NDE
standards, providing prototype flaw specimens for integrity testing, and
evaluating such repair techniques as sleeving.
   The CNRA did not follow a recommendation from the Argonne meeting to
develop an international data base on tube pressure and leakage testing and
destructive examinations, Clausner said--not because it isn't needed, but
because the committee members felt such data would be very difficult for
regulators to gather because it belongs logically to the nuclear industry.
   On the other hand, he said, the committee recommended that the CSNI's
working group on component integrity intensify its monitoring of the
phenomena involved in steam generator tube degradation, permitting a more
complete review of the international situation within the next two years.
   The Argonne workshop agreed that circumferential and axial cracks in
steam generator tubes should continue to be treated separately with respect
to their impact on safety, according to the NEA summary. In general, better
inspection tools for early detection of stress corrosion cracking (SCC),
more experimental data on outer-diameter SCC crack initiation and growth,
improved monitoring instrumentation, and better understanding of local
stress/strain conditions are needed, as is a better correlation of
chemistry and microstructure with SCC susceptibility, the experts found.
   They agreed that periodic NDE is not very useful in detecting
fatigue-induced cracks, for which plants must depend on leak-before-break
methods to manage degradation. Greater attention is needed to processes
initiating at regions of mild deformation, such as denting and scratches,
they said, and the impact of tube support plate ligament cracking--now
observed at several plants, notably in France--is ``not thoroughly
understood,'' they said.
   Officials agreed that reliable crack detection and sizing are important
even if circumferentially cracked tubes are plugged on detection. The
detection threshold for circumferential cracks with eddy current testing is
only about 50% throughwall, pointing to the need for other NDE methods.
Ultrasonic techniques (UT) have potential, but ``there are problems with
false positive calls, and improvements are clearly needed,'' officials
said.
   Accurate sizing information is needed to develop data on crack growth
rate. However, sizing cracks is more difficult than detecting them, they
said.
   Robert Comby of Electricite de France's Central Laboratories (GDL), said
that only two of the countries participating in the Argonne workshop use
tube plugging criteria for circumferential cracking based on analysis, not
mere detection. They are Belgium and Canada. The Canadians plug the tubes
all the same, he said. Comby said very intricate work is used to analyze
outer-diameter circumferential cracking, which is ``very diverse'' in
nature and evolves in a way that is still poorly understood.
   One of the French participants, Guy Turluer of the Institute of Nuclear
Safety & Protection (IPSN), said that the dilemma highlighted by the
Argonne meeting was that ``few countries have feedback from operating
experience'' concerning circumferential cracking. ``We don't know the
nature of the corrosive environment. It's hard to reproduce in the
laboratory,'' he said.

No Consensus On Continued Use
   The Argonne workshop could reach ``no consensus on the question of
leaving tubes with circumferential cracks in service,'' the NEA summary
said. But the experts discussing tube integrity agreed that ``regulatory
requirements should be flexible to allow adapting to changing technology
and operating experience,'' for example to allow implementation of
degradation-specific management.
   Another group considered the status and efficacy of preventive and
corrective measures used to mitigate or overcome tube degradation. On the
issue of mechanical mitigation, they found that successful tube sleeving
``requires development of qualification guidelines and a procedure
checklist,'' observing that ``many early failures were associated with
application outside of the process window.''
   While sleeves can generally be adequately inspected, the group said that
integrity validation requires that sleeved tubes be removed and examined. 
Nickel-plating of the tubes, as used for example in Belgium, can be applied
at almost all tube locations. However, inspection of those tubes requires
UT rather than eddy current techniques.
   Direct tube repair by remelting and welding can be applied primarily at
tube support plate intersections, the group said, but it complicates
subsequent inspections because eddy current tests are not effective and the
rough surface makes UT more difficult. Shot- or roto-peening before service
guards well against primary water SCC, but post-service peening can at best
delay the onset of cracking, they said. The group recommended cold-leg
peening where PWSCC is the primary mode of tube degradation.
   To prevent degradation, workshop participants said, ``good sludge
control is essential.'' Steam generator crevice chemistry is still
inadequately characterized, ``making it difficult to evaluate water
chemistry remedies,'' they said. They recommended a significant steam
generator tube sampling program to increase knowledge about crevices.
   The ultimate remedy for tube degradation, steam generator replacement,
should be effective, they said, since new steam generator designs minimize
stresses and sludge buildup, and new alloys--690 and 800--should provide
sufficient protection against corrosion.
   Finally, the Argonne workshop agreed on the need to improve human
reliability information and methods used in probabilistic analysis of steam
generator tube rupture events. They approved the implementation of on-line
leakage monitoring, but called for improved correlation between leakage and
degradation for various tube degradation modes as well as for a more
refined technical basis for operational leakage limits. They also said the
role of steam generator tube degradation in overall plant risk should be
better appreciated.

GOOD MARKS FOR BEZNAU-1 AND -2 IN INTERNATIONAL ASSESSMENT

By:
Laura Pilarski, Zurich

   Switzerland's 364-MW Beznau-1 and -2 have achieved an ``excellent''
record, said an IAEA Operational Safety Review Team (Osart) which completed
a three-week review December 1.
   Osarts compare performance to best international practices. The audit
was made at the request of the Swiss government in a general effort to
enhance operational nuclear safety and not because of any specific safety
concerns. An official Beznau report will be submitted to Bern in a few
months.
   Nordostschweizerische Kraftwerke AG (NOK), owner of the two PWRs, was
commended for several areas of performance, including having an experienced
and capable staff with a strong apprenticeship program; a commitment to
highest work quality standards, with good condition and cleanliness of
plant equipment; imbuing station management and staff with high goals; and
utilizing state-of-the-art safety analysis techniques to ensure high safety
standards are maintained.
   Among the Osart's proposals for improvement were: conducting reviews of
abnormal operating events in more depth and giving more attention to human
performance factors contributing to these events; providing improved
guidelines to examine plant conditions before returning to power operation
following reactor trips; strengthening management safety policies and
guidance to the staff; fostering a more self-questioning attitude among
staffers in performing plant activities; and increasing management
exchanges with nuclear power plants internationally.
   An Osart team will return to Beznau for a follow-up visit sometime in
1997. The Swiss review was the 86th plant reviewed in the Osart program.
The cost, which the owner and plant assume, is estimated at more than
1-million Swiss francs and includes all internal costs of special reports,
documentation, and files.
   Nuclear opponents in Switzerland tend to disparage Osart reviews, saying
they are not concerned with possible technical problems and plant design.

NEI WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH IN '96 FOR THERMO-LAG WAIVERS UNTIL NEW RULE

By:
David Stellfox, Washington

   A Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) executive says the industry lobby
organization will continue to push NRC to waive certain fire protection
requirements on Thermo-Lag fire barriers until a new rule can be
developed.
   NRC Chairman Shirley Jackson told Inside N.R.C. November 15, 1995 that
she opposed the idea. It is an idea that has been floating around for a
long time, but was resurrected formally with NRC staff on November 8, 1995
by Bill Rasin, NEI vice president for technical issues.
   Despite Jackson's apparent opposition, NEI Executive Vice President Joe
Colvin said his organization would continue to push for that option in
1996.
   ``We have not given up on that approach,'' Colvin said. ``I think the
staff at the leadership level is receptive to this approach because they're
spending a lot of resources and we are too.''
   NEI would have to ``have communication with Chairman Jackson and
Commissioner Rogers and the senior staff'' about the issue, Colvin said in
remarks prior to Commissioner Greta Dicus' Senate confirmation.
   NEI is due to have a meeting with NRC senior staff on the issue this
month and a staff paper to the commission on Thermo-Lag resolution is
overdue.
   The problem of unqualified Thermo-Lag fire barriers dates back to
1991-92 and still remains, according to some estimates, years away from
resolution.
   The problem with the fire protection issues, Colvin said, particularly
Thermo-Lag is that ``it's not just a technical issue. It's not just a
licensing issue. It's got political overtones.''
   He said ``everyone agrees'' that the fire protection regulations require
adjustment so if the agency is going to change the regulations anyway, why
force compliance with the old ones in the interim when compensatory
measures taken are adequate to insure safety.
   Looking ahead to 1996, Colvin said he sees the industry-NRC relationship
as positive. He said a dialog has been opened up. The two parties are
comparing notes as to what their respective priorities are to make best use
of both industry and NRC resources. One of the most positive signs, Colvin
said, is that the dialog with NRC is now ``engaged at the EDO level'' and
includes the office heads.
   One of the most often cited past successes of industry/NRC cooperation
has been the maintenance rule. When it came to developing the regulatory
guidance for the maintenance rule, which takes effect in July, senior
industry officials and senior NRC officials sat down to iron out the
guidance. The result was considered a success by both sides and yet ``the
maintenance rule approach'' has been unsuccessful when applied elsewhere.
   It was first tried on the license renewal rule and ``it didn't work,''
there, Colvin said. Then, it was tried on the maintenance rule and ``it
worked tremendously (well).''
   Then it was tried on graded quality assurance (QA) and it didn't work,
Colvin said. ``It's people and perception driven.'' All these issues,
particularly the QA, is ``talking about changing the way people do things.
That makes people nervous--at both utilities and NRC,'' he said.
   One advantage with the use of the approach on the maintenance rule, was
that NRC didn't use outside contractors and high-level staffers
participated in themeetings and made decisions, Colvin said. It was the
strong leadership from both the industry and agency side that made the
difference, he said.
   He said NEI would be continuing to try to use the maintenance rule model
of looking at systems, structures and components and their risk and try to
apply that in other contexts in 1996.
   The failure, so far, of the graded QA effort Colvin said it is ``very
difficult to get the mindset changed. The QA infrastructure runs long and
deep in the industry and in NRC. It's almost sacred. There's a lot of
emotion you got to get through before you can get down to details.''

CRITICS FEAR ANOTHER `BROWNS FERRY' AS NRC OKAYS COMBUSTIBLE FIRE STOPS

By:
David Stellfox, Washington

   A silicone foam or elastomer sealant material--used to block the spread
of fires at the soon-to-be licensed Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Watts
Bar plant--is combustible and prone to ``deep-seated fires,'' NRC says.
   Nonetheless, the agency said the material is an ``acceptable deviation''
from requirements limiting fire stops to noncombustible materials.
   The antinuclear group Nuclear Information & Resource Service (NIRS) and
a private fire protection engineer contend that the NRC violated federal
law when it authorized the use of the admittedly combustible fire seals at
Watts Bar.
   Four years before the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island-2, TVA's Browns
Ferry plant had a near meltdown after a fire started in a penetration seal
made of combustible urethane. Penetration seals are used to stop a fire
from spreading from one room or fire area to another.
   But at Browns Ferry, the fire quickly spread through electrical control
equipment, disabling systems needed to safely shut off the nuclear chain
reaction. That near disaster led to the creation of NRC's current fire
protection requirements that call for the use of noncombustible materials.
   The NRC staff decision that Watts Barr could use combustible silicone
materials to seal penetrations through fire walls and floors has alarmed
nuclear watchdogs. NIRS wrote to NRC Chairman Shirley Jackson saying that
Watts Bar should be denied a full-power operating license because it does
not meet fire protection requirements. The commission is expected to issue
the full-power license to Watts Bar within a few weeks.
   Jackson would not comment on the issue, and staffers in her office
referred inquiries to the NRC Public Affairs Office. Agency spokesman Joe
Gilliland said that, as of January 4, no official response had been made to
NIRS.
   In a letter to Jackson in late December, NIRS said it was ``ironic''
that NRC would consider licensing a TVA plant with combustible penetration
seals 20 years after a fire at another TVA plant prompted the agency to
adopt fire protection rules specifically to bar the use of such material.
   Equally ironic, nuclear watchdogs said, is that the argument NRC staff
used to justify use of the seals is remarkably similar to an argument it
recently rejected for an unrelated fire protection material.
   That fire barrier material, known as Thermo-Lag, is used to protect
electrical cables and components used to shut down reactors.
   The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), the nuclear industry trade
association, tried unsuccessfully to claim that Thermo-Lag was
noncombustible using arguments similar to what NRC used to accept the
combustible penetration seals.
   Gerald Brown, a Minneapolis-based fire protection engineer, claimed that
by waiving requirements on penetration seals, NRC is trying to avoid an
expensive drain on both industry and NRC resources.
   Other industry sources say privately that NRC treated Thermo-Lag more
strictly because Thermo-Lag had become a political problem for them,
particularly after a congressional hearing in 1993. Problems with fire
barrier penetration seals have not gotten the same level of public
attention.
   It was Brown's 1991 allegations on Thermo-Lag that prompted a wholesale
upheaval in nuclear industry fire protection programs. His 1991 allegations
were confirmed by NRC and led the agency to disqualify all prior testing of
Thermo-Lag and to declare all those barriers inoperable--a matter still
unresolved five years later.
   As a fire protection consultant, Brown potentially stands to gain
business from utilities upgrading fire protection programs and equipment.
   Brown said the nuclear power industry, in attempting to requalify
Thermo-Lag in the last five years, wanted to claim that the material was
``noncombustible.'' They did so with the argument that given the difficulty
of igniting the material, the location in the plant, and the absence of any
other combustibles to start or feed a fire, Thermo-Lag was ``effectively''
noncombustible.
   NRC rejected that argument (INRC, 3 April '95, 3), but then turned
around and used a remarkably similar approach to justify the use of
combustible fire penetration seals at Watts Bar, Brown said. ``That's
ludicrous. It's a double standard, and it's against the law.''
   NRC's Conrad McCracken, the plant systems branch chief in the Office of
Nuclear Reactor Regulation, doesn't deny that the silicone seals are
combustible. McCracken couldn't be reached for comment, but in a December
21 response letter to Paul Gunter of NIRS, McCracken wrote: ``The NRC staff
acknowledges that silicone foam and silicone elastomer penetration seal
materials are combustible as defined by NRC fire protection guidance.''
   However, McCracken wrote Gunter that the seal material does provide some
protection; it acts as a sacrificial material and is accepted in many
non-nuclear applications. Incidentally, the same is true of Thermo-Lag.
   The seal material ``make up a relatively small contribution to the
overall combustible load...are usually distributed throughout the fire
area, as opposed to representing concentrations of combustibles, and are
difficult to ignite,'' McCracken wrote. Finally, McCracken concluded the
use of the silicone seals ``is an acceptable deviation from the penetration
seal guidance in Nureg-0800.''
   In a separate response to an e-mail allegation from Brown, McCracken
acknowledged that a fire ``may become deep-seated within the penetration.''
Brown says this makes it appear the fire has been extinguished when deep
inside the seal it is still burning.
   The NRC's fire protection requirements are prescriptive, Brown said. Is
the material combustible or isn't it? he asked. To say it is combustible
but that's an acceptable deviation is not prescriptive regulation, Brown
said. ``That's a performance-based answer,'' he said. NRC has so far
refused industry attempts to resolve problems with Thermo-Lag by using
performance-based approaches, Brown noted, and now the NRC is turning
around and using a performance-based approach for penetration seals.
   Besides the apparent double standard, Brown maintained NRC cannot
legally make an acceptable deviation on the penetration seals. He said that
unlike the situation with Thermo-Lag, penetration seals are specifically
addressed in the federal Code of Federal Regulations. Brown added that NRC
does not have the right to waive federal law but can only promulgate new,
superseding law. For Thermo-Lag, the requirements are in subsidiary
guidance documents giving NRC greater flexibility in interpretation and
enforcement.
   But penetration seals are specifically addressed in 10 CFR Part 50,
Appendix R, Section M, which says, in part: ``Penetration seal designs
shall utilize only noncombustible materials and shall be qualified by tests
that are comparable to tests used to rate fire barriers.''
   Brown, who also filed allegations over the penetration seals, claimed
NRC has been ignoring problems with the seals. Many of the problems related
to seals with voids and gaps and other issues are contained in NRC's own
files, and others were documented in a series of Inside N.R.C. articles in
1994 (INRC, 19 Sept. '94, 1 and INRC, 17 Oct. '94, 1).
   Thousands of similar silicone foam or elastomer seals are installed in
nuclear units across the country.
   In addition to their combustibility, questions have been raised about
the effectiveness of the seals. Penetration seal problems related to
installation, testing, documentation and poor maintenance, go back at least
15 years and rival problems associated with the controversial Thermo-Lag
material.
   In 1987 NRC drafted guidance on penetration seals intended to clarify
what was needed to qualify a seal. The guidance was leaked to industry
officials, then mysteriously dropped from the regulatory agenda and was
never issued (INRC, 6 March '95, 1). NRC officials have claimed the
penetration seal requirements in the leaked document were incorporated into
other NRC regulations, but industry sources have strongly disputed that.
The question has never been resolved.
   Brown said the NRC simply doesn't want to face up to the problems with
penetration seals so ``they are carefully selecting regulations (to
enforce) to suit the industry. This is the most flagrant and fraudulent
example.''

DICUS TO ASSUME DUTIES AS COMMISSIONER IN FEBRUARY, RESTORING QUORUM

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   The Senate confirmed Greta Joy Dicus as an NRC commissioner December 22,
paving the way for restoring a three-person quorum to the commission.
   Dicus, who is director of the Division of Radiation Control & Emergency
Management at the Arkansas Department of Health, said that she hopes to be
ready to assume her duties as commissioner in early February. ``I have a
lot of goals I hope to accomplish in my time on the commission, but I want
to get up there and get a staff together before I get into those goals,''
she told Inside N.R.C. January 4.
   Dicus' term runs through June 30, 1998. No date has been set yet for an
official swearing-in ceremony.
   The commission has been acting without a quorum since July 1, 1995 when
Gail de Planque left after her five-year term as a commissioner ended and
Ivan Selin quit as chairman a year early. Currently, Chairman Shirley
Jackson is making commission decisions--in consultation with Commissioner
Kenneth Rogers--under an arrangement of ``delegated authority'' approved by
the commission when it still had four members.
   Clinton nominated Dicus July 14, 1995 to fill a third seat on the
commission. Dicus faced no opposition in the Senate Environment & Public
Works Committee, which approved her nomination September 19 (INRC, 2 Oct.
'95, 15). The fast-track nomination process stalled, however, when Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) made it clear to the White House that
he would not schedule a confirmation vote until President Clinton sent to
the Senate an intent to nominate a Republican to the five-member
commission.
   Ultimately, Dole relented and allowed the confirmation to go forward. A
White House staffer said January 2 that the administration is ``looking at
other candidates'' to fill the remaining two seats on the commission, but
has sent no names to the Senate since the Dicus nomination.
   Dicus was among more than 65 executive nominations cleared for a Senate
vote on December 22. Charles William Burton of Texas was confirmed as a
member of the board of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC) for a term
that lasts only until February 24. Kathleen McGinty of Pennsylvania was
confirmed as chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality.
   There had been speculation on the Hill that Dole let the nominations go
through to avoid the need to have the names all renominated in the second
session of the Congress. Because of the ongoing budget problems, however,
the first session of the 104th Congress was declared over, sine die, at
11:55 a.m. January 3. The second session began at noon.
   Dicus served as a member of the USEC board for a one-year term that
ended in March 1995. She is a member of the Conference of Radiation Control
Program Directors (CRCPD) and was elected chairman of the CRCPD in 1993.
Dicus, who has served as Arkansas liaison to the NRC, received her B.A.
from Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas in 1961 and an M.A. in
radiation biology from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School
at Dallas in 1967.

Number Of Secy Papers, Commission Meetings Down
   The commission continued a downward trend in the number of Secy papers
handled in 1995. The staff produced 310 Secy papers last year, down
slightly from the 315 papers in 1994, and down significantly from the 360
papers produced in 1993.
   Also, there were fewer commission meetings last year than in the
previous year, according to Andrew Bates, senior level adviser to the
secretary of the commission. There were 86 commission meetings held in
1995, compared with 92 meetings in 1994. Fifty-two of the 86 meetings took
place in the first half of 1995, and 34 meetings in the second half.
   Part of the reason for the decline in the number of meetings can be
attributed to the fact that there have only been two commissioners since
July 1, 1995, and the staff has tried not to schedule commission meetings
when one of them is away or on leave.
   The schedule for commission briefings for the month of January is very
light. Except for one briefing on industry restructuring scheduled for
January 5, the calendar is empty until the end of the month. On January 30,
a briefing by DOE on the high-level waste program has been tentatively
scheduled. The periodic briefing on operating reactors and fuel facilities
meeting on is tentatively set for January 31.

Watts Bar-1 Full Power License Briefing Still On Hold
   A commission briefing on the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar-1
full power license--one of the most important decisions facing the
commission in some time--could be put off until after Dicus is sworn in as
a commissioner and a legal quorum is restored.
   The NRC announced December 20 that a planned January 5 commission
briefing on the license would be rescheduled.
   NRC staffers said January 2 that a commission briefing on the Watts
Bar-1 license had been set tentatively for January 31, three days after
Rogers returns from a personal trip, but before Dicus's presumed
swearing-in at the beginning of February (Nucleonics Week, 4 Jan., 3).
However, NRC spokesperson Joe Gilliland said January 4 that a commission
briefing had not yet been set--even tentatively--on the matter. ``That date
may have just been set as a working assumption for the staff,'' Gilliland
said.
   Delaying a vote on the license would avoid a possible legal challenge to
a commission decision approving Watts Bar's full-power operation. A lawsuit
already is pending challenging the delegated authority procedure under
which Jackson has exercised the full power of the commission for six
months. In that case, intervenors challenging the Trump-S nuclear research
project at the University of Missouri sued over the procedure (INRC, 13
Nov. '95, 5).

NRC LAST MONTH TURNED DOWN A SUBMITTAL

   THE NRC LAST MONTH TURNED DOWN A SUBMITTAL BY PENNSYLVANIA POWER & LIGHT
Co. (PP&L) seeking a change in the quality assurance program. The change
request was submitted as a cost-beneficial licensing action (CBLA), but NRC
staffers said that changes to the quality assurance plan under 10 CFR
50.54(a) are not considered eligible for CBLAs.
   ``The submitted change proposes an elimination of the biennial procedure
review requirements for plant emergency operating procedures, off normal
procedures, emergency operating procedures, and other procedures of which
usage may be dictated by event,'' Michael Modes, chief of civil, mechanical
and materials engineering branch in the Division of Reactor Safety, wrote
in a December 15, 1995 letter to Robert Byram, senior vice president,
nuclear, of PP&L.
   Modes said the proposed change is a ``reduction in the commitment
previously accepted by the NRC,'' and added that if the change has already
been implemented, ``you must cease implementation.''

NRC NOTES IMPROVEMENTS, PERSISTENT PERSONNEL ERRORS AT FITZPATRICK

   The New York Power Authority received Category 2 ratings in all four
functional areas in NRC's latest systematic assessment of licensee
performance (SALP) at FitzPatrick. NRC Region I Administrator Thomas Martin
said NRC found good coordination and communication between plant and
corporate groups. He said, however, that despite some improvements as a
result of a number of initiatives, ``persistent personnel errors across
multiple parts of the organization demonstrated the need for continued
management attention.''
   According to Nucleonics Week, FitzPatrick, an 849-MW BWR, had a gross
capacity factor in 1994 of 69.25%. Through October 1995, the capacity
factor was 61.27%.
   In his letter to the utility, Martin noted the effectiveness of NYPA's
response to individual plant events and problems. He added, however, that
there were continued instances of ``a lack of a broad approach to event
investigations and root-cause determinations.''

NRC FINDS `SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT' IN OPERATIONS AT COMANCHE PEAK

   TU Electric received top Category 1 ratings in three functional
areas--operations, maintenance, and plant support--and a Category 2 rating
in the area of engineering in NRC's latest SALP review at Comanche Peak.
   NRC Region IV Administrator L.J. Callan said the utility's ``superior
performance in the operations area represented a significant improvement
and was marked by a strong safety focus, clear management support for
operations, effective communication of management expectations, and strong
management involvement in operator training.'' Callan, however, also noted
a decline in performance in the engineering area. The SALP board, Callan
said, ``considered the examples of less than thorough and timely evaluation
of problems which affect operations and the instances where equipment
performance information was not effectively tracked and used to improve
reliability by predicting and preventing challenges to the plant, including
those introduced from the balance-of-plant.''
   According to Nucleonics Week, Comanche Peak-1 and -2, both 1,161-MW
Westinghouse PWRs, had gross capacity factors in 1994 of 95.98% and 54.76%,
respectively. Through October 1995, the capacity factors were 78.48% and
94.40%, respectively.
   In the area of maintenance, Callan said NRC found ``an improvement in
plant material condition, the absence of significant maintenance worker
induced plant challenges, the reduction in the maintenance backlog, and a
healthy customer service philosophy.''

NRC FOUND CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE

   NRC FOUND CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE OPERATIONS AREA AT
LIMERICK in a plant performance review (PPR) done December 5, 1995. NRC,
however, said that it was concerned about four scrams between August 8 and
September 11, 1995, as well as other transients experienced during the last
six months. In a letter to PECO Energy, NRC's Wayne Lanning, deputy
director of the division of reactor projects, noted that the utility's
``reviews have not found common contributing root causes, but we have noted
that you have developed a Focus on Excellence Through People Program to
address broad issues.''
   The PPR process consists of a review of inspection findings, significant
events and other information related to the integrated performance at a
nuclear plant. The purpose of the PPR process, NRC says, it to assess
performance trends and to plan future inspection activities. Another PPR
will occur later in the SALP cycle at Limerick, NRC said.

COOPER COMPLETES OUTAGE 22 DAYS LATE

   Major modifications to emergency diesel generators at Cooper last month
added another 22 days to the plant's refueling outage, costing the Nebraska
Public Power District (NPPD) roughly $2.2-million. The plant ended the
77-day refueling outage, which also included an in-service inspection of
the reactor vessel, on December 27.
   Terrence Reis, acting chief of reactor projects in NRC Region IV, said
last week that NPPD modified the diesel generators from a design that
needed a continuous supply of air to run to one that only needed an air
supply to start, similar to those used at all other nuclear generating
units in the U.S. Officials at both NRC and NPPD touted the modification as
one that would enhance plant safety. Cooper, once considered a
trouble-prone plant, is making a turn-around, according to NRC officials.
Reis said that NPPD officials admit that they underestimated the complexity
of the diesel generator modifications. He added that after some significant
problems with the work that NPPD quality assurance officials got very
``aggressive,'' making the modifications on the second generator go a lot
smoother.
   The diesel generator modifications, said Reis, are not related to the
Appendix R fire protection work done earlier. In November, NPPD crews found
that diesel generator modifications done in 1994 to meet NRC fire
protection rules actually would have made that equipment inoperable during
a control room fire (Nucleonics Week, 30 Nov. '95, 8). Crews had
incorrectly wired the control panel when they installed fuses in 1994 to
isolate five of the diesel generator indications on the control room
panel.

THREE UTILITIES SLAPPED WITH $50,000 FINES

   NRC started the new year by announcing $50,000 fines against each of
three utilities: Commonwealth Edison Co. (CECO), Baltimore Gas & Electric
Co. (BG&E), and the New York Power Authority (NYPA).
   NRC said that CECO had failed to correct a potential problem with
circuit breaker settings at Quad Cities. Managers at Quad Cities had been
told of a potential problem with the circuit breakers based on an incident
at CECO's Dresden plant, but failed to act, NRC said. The utility now is
planning plant modifications and procedure changes at Quad Cities.
   NRC staff identified a violation at BG&E's Calvert Cliffs involving lax
controls on unescorted access to the plant. A contractor employee was
granted unescorted access to the plant even though security staff at
Calvert Cliffs knew that the worker had been arrested under a different
name, NRC said. The worker's unescorted access permission later was revoked
when federal officials told BG&E that he was an illegal alien who had
fraudulently applied for a U.S. passport under another false name.
   NYPA was cited for four violations at Indian Point-3. The lapses
involved an October 15, 1995 incident in which the unit was taken from cold
shutdown to hot shutdown while switches controlling recirculation and
containment spray pumps were in the wrong position.
   The utilities have until February 1 to pay or contest the fines.

ENEL DIPS BELOW $34.00

Italy's ENEL has made awards to South African producers following its
recent tender and has done so at much lower levels than most predicted.
At what is believed to be $33.65 FOBT Richards Bay, basis 6,200kc GAR,
the price not only covers the tonnages award to the two successful
tenderers - Amcoal and Ingwe - but also the second year of two-year
contracts awarded a year ago to Shell and, again, Ingwe.

In all 2.5mt has been awarded plus 400,000t in options: under the new
tender, Amcoal gets 1mt including options and Ingwe 300,000t including
options while under the terms of last year's two-year contracts, Ingwe
will ship 700,000t and Shell 400,000t. Last year's prices were $32.50
for Ingwe and Shell and $32.60 for other South African suppliers.

Under the terms of the new awards, Amcoal will receive a two-year
contract with 1mt earmarked for 1997 and Ingwe's tonnage under the two
awards will be rolled together for a similar 1mt volume for next year.

Over the next two weeks ENEL will negotiate with the Colombian
producers it approached in its search for 500,000t. These include:
Carbocol, Intercor, Carbones del Caribe and Drummond. The settlement
price is expected to be in a $36-36.50 range basis 11,700/11,800
Btu/lb.

When all the tonnage is booked from these tenders, purchases will
proceed for Chinese, Polish and Venezuelan deliveries.

US exporters told ICR New Year's Week they expect Enel's tender for 1mt
of US coal "any day." It was originally scheduled for mid-December.
Delays are related to a change in spec: Enel plans to cut the sulfur
limit from 1.0% to 0.8% and the Btu minimum from 12,500 to 12,000. Ash
stays at 10%, which for southern Appalachian coals tends to correspond
to the previous higher Btu level, raising the question of Btu premiums.

TAIPOWER SEEKS AUSTRALIAN LOW

Taiwan Power Corporation has started 1996 with a bang with two tenders
out and a decision imminent for Australian coal which looks like
setting a new low benchmark for its long-term contract buy-ins. The two
tenders include a second attempt to purchase a trial panamax of low
c.v. (4,500kc-5,500kc GAR), high moisture material for its Taichung
station, the tender closing on January 16. The second tender is for
five panamaxes for March and April delivery. Contact: Director of Fuel,
Taiwan Power, 9th Floor, 242 Roosevelt Road, Section 3, Taipei 100,
Taiwan. Phone: 886 2 366 6752; fax, 886 2 367 0597.

But it is reports of very low prices in four bids into a tender for a
long-term supplies from Australia which created something of a buzz
this week. The bids are from Camberwell, Saxonvale, Ulan and Coal and
Allied, spanning less than $2 from a low of just under $22.50 FOB. None
of the companies contacted said they had heard from Taipower about the
tender and suggested that prices quoted were lower than their actual
bids. The prices will be for the first year of deliveries in a seven-
year contract.

NATPOWER BUYS FOUR CAPES

National Power of the UK has booked four capes from the US for first
quarter delivery, bringing to well in excess of 1mt the company has
booked for 1996 delivery just from the US. The purchases, of mid-
sulphur material, have all been done a few cents higher than similar
purchases by the company in the Fall of 1995. They have helped to
produce a drying up of supplies of this quality coal from some US
suppliers. One cape is from the East Coast from AMCI - which had
already won 500,000t worth of business from NatPower; the balance is
coming through traders from the Gulf.

TRY SPOT, JAPANESE URGED

Japanese utilities should ditch their dependence on contract purchases
and increase the amount of spot tonnage bought, according to a study*
by the country's Institute of Energy Economics.

The study, comparing Japanese utility buying practices with those in
Europe, South Korea, and Taiwan, urges the utilities to become more
flexible for at least 1.8mt of their annual needs. This tonnage, 6% of
current demand, represents the fluctuations in annual consumption
caused by different weather conditions in recent years.

Tonnage fluctuations are likely to increase as coal stations shift
towards mid-loading and consequently, says the study, spot purchases
should move towards 10% of annual consumption.

In comparison with virtually no spot purchases by Japanese power
companies, European, Taiwanese and Korean powercos take 28-44%, 10-30%
and 10% respectively of their coal needs from the spot market.

The next few years will see Japanese coal stations drop their
utilisation from 65% today to about 59% in 1999 and even lower in
subsequent years, bringing Japanese coal station utilisation close to
those of Europe.

The IEE report sees no merit in current buying practices of including
option tonnages since they bring no benefit in lower prices. Since
Japanese power companies burn high-quality coals of well-known origin,
they are likely to enter the spot market initially through closed
tenders for specific brands. "But, if they hope to procure the cheapest
coal, they have to make open tender-based spot procurement as Taiwan
does," buying coal on physical properties alone, and buying coal which,
in some cases, has an unknown origin, says the IEE study.

EPDC REPLIES TO THE S. AFRICANS

The price ideas requested by Japan's Electric Power Development
Corporation - a request which led to demands for rises of $3 - have now
received a dusty response from the EPDC buyers for a c25 cut to $36.36
FOBT Richard Bay. This price relates to Total's Ermelo supplies basis
6,021kc NAR. The other offers range upwards from $33.80 for TCOA's
Witbank and include Total's Arthur Taylor and Shell's Rietspruit.

TNEB AWARDS CONTRACTS

India's Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has concluded 1996
contracts for a total of 2.4mt, having succeeded in getting the bidders
down to a level of $59.45/t CIF. This is higher than the low bid of
$49.00 submitted by PT Sarita Prima but significantly under all other
bids, which ranged from $64.85 to $73.25/t CIF Madras.

Several of the contract winners appear to be affiliated, based on their
offering the same coals. Glencore and Esteco each offered Cook,
Tselentis, and Prima Comex Indonesia; and Emirates Trading and Western
Shipping each offered Danau Mashitam, Shanxi, and Ensham. PT Sarita
Prima offered Berau and Bukit Asam, while Alagendran Exports offered a
range of Indonesian, South African, and Australian.

The two "unknowns" who won contracts last year along with Alagendran
and Emirates - Ocean Centre and Kerry Coal - have not reappeared on the
line up this time around (ICR 366/1).

KARNATAKA SEEKS 250,000T

Karnataka Power Corporation (KPC) is once again entering the
international market, this time looking for 250,000t. In its previous
attempt to import in 1993, the utility found the offers in response to
its 1mt tender technically and commercially unacceptable (ICR 353/13).

Karnataka is passing through a severe power crisis because of a strike
at Singarani Collieries in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh state since mid-
October. This has created shortages at Karnataka's only coal-fired
power station at Raichur. Hydro activity has also been poor.

Bids can be submitted by January 18 for delivery before May 31.

The bidders are being asked to quote in Indian rupees (the rupee has
declined 12% against the $ since October).

Further information can be obtained from Superintending Engineer (MM),
Karnataka Power Corporation Limited, 82 Shakti Bhavan, 3rd Floor, Race
Course Road, Bungalore - 560001, Karnataka, India. Telephone: +91-(0)80-

ANDHRA PRADESH COOLS TO IMPORTS

Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board (APSEB) may not place orders for
the 500,000t quantity it put to tender in September. The utility found
the offers it received at around Rs2,900/t cost three times the price
of domestic coal available from the coal mines in Andhra Pradesh.

The sharp decline in the Rupee value against the dollar in October-
November has further increased the delivery price of imports. Coupled
with the high price factor is the precarious financial position of the
APSEB board.

CHILGENER SETTLES 500,000T

Chilgener has settled a third of its 1.5mt requirement for 1996,
concluding with Colombian producers at competitive prices. Sources say
the buyer claims to have concluded at $34.00-35.00/t FOB basis 6,600kc
GAR.

The company plans to conduct talks with other suppliers over the next
month. It has inventories sufficient to last it until March and can
wait to conclude until late February.

Meanwhile, the Chilean utility has asked for bids on one or two trial
cargoes of western US and western Canadian coals. Offers are due
January 10. Observers say the company is looking to diversify supply
sources, given the rapid growth in its consumption.

CODELCO MAKES AWARDS

Chile's Codelco has awarded contracts for 1996 supplies for the
Tocopilla plant to companies in Canada, Australia, Colombia, and
Indonesia. Prices are believed to be up $4-5 over the previous levels,
but those prices were negotiated in September 1994, before last year's
market upswing. Sources said prices for all suppliers are in the range
of $40-42/t CFR basis 6300kc GAR. The price on the Indonesian coal is
believed to be $36.20/t CFR basis 5,400kc GAR.

Codelco officials told ICR they could not release any details until
contracts are formally concluded. Codelco is acting as purchasing agent
for the new owner of the privatised Tocopilla Division, now called
Central Termica Tocopilla.

Although Codelco had originally asked for bids on 280,000t for 1996 and
900,000t in 1997, it decided not to award any tonnage for the second
year. The volume was set at a higher level for 1997 because several
domestic contracts expire, leaving open the possibility of their
replacement with imports. One observer comments that prices may be
somewhat below market because bidders believed they were competing for
multi-year agreements.

Elsewhere in the Chilean market, P.T. Adaro has won an order for a test
cargo for Chilgener's Guacolda plant.

KIDECO SUPPLIES NEW INDONESIAN POWER PLANT

The South Korean owned coal mine PT Kideco Jaya Agung, in East
Kalimantan, has signed a long-term contract for supply to the
Indonesian private power plant PT Jawa Power. It will be Kideco's first
domestic supply contract. Currently all output is exported, mostly for
use by the South Korean power utility.

PT Jawa Power is in the very early stages of developing 2x600 MW plants
at Paiton in East Java, alongside the existing 2x400MW the existing
2x400 MW units now in operation and run by the state utility PT
Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), and the 2x615 MW units to be built by
the now celebrated private power company, PT Pation Energy Company.

Kideco, wholly Korean owned, (80% of which is by Korean state
agencies), and operating under a production sharing contract with the
Indonesian government, will supply 1.8mt/yr over 30 years to PT Jawa.
This matches the term of PT Jawa's operation, for which a power
purchase agreement with the PLN was signed in April 1995.

It is not yet known where the additional coal needed will come from,
but there are rumours that further supply may be secured from another
Kalimantan producer, PT Berau, which started production in 1994 from
its mines in north-eastern Kalimantan. Berau is a joint venture between
Nissho Iwai of Japan and PT United Tractors Indonesia.

In 1995, Kideco produced about 2.5mt all exported to South Korea.
Kideco said it would increase production to around 6mt by 1999. Kideco
began production from its mine south of Balikapapan in the second half
of 1993. Coal is shipped by road 40k to the Kideco run seaport of Tanah
Merah, which can accommodate bulk carriers of up to 40,000DWT.

PT Jawa is being built by a partnership made up of Siemens of Germany
(50%) PowerGen of Britain (35%) and the Indonesian PT Bumi Pertiwi
Tatapradipta (15%), a subsidiary of the Bimantara group, controlled by
president Suharto's second son, Bambang Trihadmojo.

Power for the purpose of testing the new unloading dock that is being
constructed to serve the Kraft plant. Delivery will be between March 1
and March 25.

TMT will supply Venezuelan coal produced by Carbosurco in the state of
Falcon. As earlier reported, TMT recently signed a contract to take
230,000t of Carbosurco's output for shipment out of Palmarejo on Lake
Maracaibo (ICR 388/12). Approximately 60% of the volume is earmarked

RBCT 1995 EXPORTS HIT 58.1MT

The Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT) pulled out all the stops during
December to shift 5.58mt of coal and bring the total throughout for
calendar 1995 to 58.12mt. That compares with the calendar 1994 total
throughput of 53.5mt.

The official throughput target for 1995 issued by the RBCT was 56mt,
although members were told they6 could export coal up to their
respective quotas of a total RBCT throughput of 59mt. Reason for the
lower official target is that major exporters Ingwe and Amcoal - which
between them account for nearly two thirds of RBCT capacity - indicated
early in the year they did not have the coal available to meet
throughput rates equivalent to 59mt. Both groups said that they were
aiming for their shares of a throughput level of 56mt.

A number of the smaller RBCT shareholders made it clear they were not
constrained by such availability problems. It seems some have exported
at more than their proportionate share of 59mt by "buying-in" RBCT
quotas from other members unable to utilise their full entitlements.

Industry sources indicate the going rate for such deals varies between
US$1.5/t and $3/t, depending on market conditions.

It's early days for predictions on 1996 but the feeling in the industry
seems to be that a repeat performance of the 4.6mt growth shown in 1995
is unlikely. Reasons for this are worries over constraints on
production capacity at the various mines, most of which are at full
stretch already, combined with a degree of caution over the market.

The official RBCT line on export growth is that ideally, the members
would like to increase total throughput by about 2-2.5mt annually which
is also about the long-term average annual increase achieved in their
exports. Last year's 4.6mt jump in exports shows many SA exporters are
prepared to go all out to take advantage of favourable market
conditions when they present themselves. A similar performance this
year must, however, bring the RBCT to the limit of the capacity it can
provide through rationalisation and reorganisation of its operations at
minimal capital cost.

The RBCT's nominal capacity is currently stated at 60mt/yr. The
terminal's track record over the past few years has shown the RBCT's
"nominal capacity to be as long as the proverbial piece of string.
While the 60mt/yr number is therefore not a cap it is, however, very
close to what can be achieved without having to make a major capital
investment in expanding the terminal.

a decision on that unspecified investment by the members is pending to
push the terminal's capacity to 70mt. Industry executives comment
conventional wisdom is the RBCT should be exporting between 65mt and
70mt by 2000. Judging by 1995's performance it could be sooner than
that.

COLD WEATHER WARMS UK TRADE

Freezing conditions in North West Europe during December meant relief
for the beleagured UK house coal trade. After a run of mild winters,
capped by an appalling 1994/95 in which trade fell by 20-30% to an
annual rate of well below 2mt/yr, sales were very low throughout 1995.
This reflected high carryover stocks from the winter and structural
changes within the industry.

The structural changes followed the privatisation of British Coal in
December 1994. RJB Mining, the lead producer in the newly privatised
world, made its priority in this sector a deliberate targeting of
import markets, offering heavily discounted supplies in northern
Scotland to challenge longstanding Polish contracts. It also pursued
direct sales to merchants, which had traditionally been supplied by
factors. Merchants, confronted with increasing competition between
different suppliers and between suppliers and factors, had another
reason to hold back from purchasing.

By October, which was the warmest in the UK on record, there were signs
of panic within the industry because coal was still not moving and
balance sheets were already in the red. By this time, two of the
leading factors were changing hands with Coal Products, itself newly
privatised, buying Anglo Coal from Anglo United and the management of
British Fuels just about to secure their company from British Coal. The
management of the third biggest factor, PD Fuels which is owned by
Powell Duffryn, gained exclusivity to bid for their company just before
Christmas.

After the bitterly cold weather of December, traders are now talking of
shortages developing for some grades. They point out that many effects
of the cold snap are yet to be felt because it hit in the middle of a
holiday period when fires were on all of the time.

Another cold snap will surely bring another surge in sales. There is
already a shortage of 50mm plus sized material and of singles. As one
trader put it, "if you had some Colombian product at the moment you'd
sell thousands of tonnes of it, the trouble is none of us has". Given a
lead time of c. 35 days to bring in a typical 35-40,000t consignment
for processing and the fact that the coldest months in the UK are
normally January and February, only those with coal already on the way
or at European stockpiles will be able to respond on time to meet
demand.

Phibro has sold two capes of Colombian to Electricite de France at
close to $37.00/t FOB basis 12,000 Btu/lb. One will be delivered in
each half of 1996. The purchase completes EdF's requirement for the
first half.

The price is $1.00 less than deals done two or three months ago for US
coal of equivalent quality to EdF. The French company bought from

GERMAN IMPORTS ROSE 3% IN 1995

Coal and coke imports into Germany increased by only around 3% in 1995
to 18mt, according to the German Coal Importers Federation. The border
price for imported steam coal into Germany averaged DM76t ($53.10)/t
hard coal equivalent during the first 10 months of 1995, just over one
quarter of the price of German coal - DM291/thce - before subsidies
took effect.

In 1996, the importers anticipate that, assuming there are no
significant currency swings, imported coal prices will remain stable
and cheap. It seems contradictory therefore that the volume of imports
is expected to fall by around 10% in 1996. The reason is that many
large consumer utilities have generous coal stocks, the hangover in
volumes from their obligation to buy German coal under the now-lapsed
Jahrhundert contract which were larger than their actual needs.

These companies will draw down their stocks in 1996, reducing purchases
of fresh coal by as much as 10%. German and imported coal are expected
to be affected to the same degree.

Ruhrkohle announced at the end of last year that sales would reach an
average 27mt a year over the next three years, resulting in an excess
production capacity of 2-3mt. Saarberg expects to sell only around 7mt
in 1996 instead of the originally anticipated 8.2mt.

The coal importers association warns against what it considers over-
estimates of coal sales for this year and beyond by politicians
responsible for German coal policy. The consultancy Prognos in Basel,
in particular, is criticised as having given too optimistic a picture
of coal's future market position in its recent energy forecast for the
Federal economy ministry. The development of steam coal use for
electricity generation is especially overrated, say the importers.

BAYERNWERK PLANS 0.3MT IMPORTS.

Saarberg, Germany's second largest coal producer, signed a five-year
coal supply contract with major utility Bayernwerk on December 21 1995,
just days before the 15-year Jahrhundert contract expired at the close
of the year. The deal covers 2.3mt, 0.46mt/a year.

Bayernwerk signed up for coal from Ruhrkohle for 1996-2000 back in July
last year. The contract was for nearly 4mt, a little under 0.8mt per
year. The utility has thus made a firm commitment to use around 1.26mt
of German coal a year. Stocks standing at 0.5mt at the end of 1995 will
also be drawn down.

Furthermore, after two years of using only Germany coal, in 1996
Bayernwerk will import 0.3mt.

Delivery of the imports by water is restricted due to the limited
unloading facilities at the power stations, so the utility buys only
part cargos of 15,000t. Rail deliveries from Poland and the Czech
Republic are more or less continuous week-by-week throughout the year.

AL NASR BIDS SHOW RISES

Opening bids into Egypt's Al Nasr Company of Coke and Chemicals tender
for Australian coals show 5-6% increase on last year's prices. BHP
(Blackwater) and South Blackwater - who supplied under the previous
contract - have bid $47.75 and $47.20 FOB respectively, compared with
last year's price of around $46.

Two newcomers bidding for the Al Nasr "standard high vol" are
Glencore's Cook and KCC's Tahmoor - Glencore close to the traditional
suppliers' prices, KCC for substantially more. All bidders are going
for the full 400,000t on offer which in the case of Cook shows a
remarkable turnaround; only a year ago it was producing just 275,000t.

A second blend is being called for by Al Nasr for 100,000t of lower
vol, lower ash material. One explanation for this development is that
the buyer is seeking an alternative to one of its US coals. MIM (Oaky
Creek) and BHP (Saraji blend) are both going for the full 100,000t
offered.

Traditionally, Al Nasr has come back seeking better prices, although
the fact that it is tendering in the middle of the JSM negotiations
would suggest that few are going to oblige with lower offers with so
much at risk. Decision expected in February. The new contracts will run
for four years commencing on April 1 this year.

The CIF Alexandria prices reveal a wide range of freight estimates ($11-
16.40) suggesting that some suppliers are very keen to get the business
without posting damaging FOB numbers. Alexandria takes panamaxes with
the alternative cape port, El Dikela, sometimes being used.

COALARBED, ISCOR EXPAND TONNAGE

CoalArbed has won new multi-year contracts to supply 250,000t/yr out of
Baltimore to South Africa's Iscor. The tonnage is in addition to the
more than 700,000t that CoalArbed supplied in 1995 under long-term
deals.

CoalArbed will supply mid-vol coking coal from two Pennsylvania
producers, Bradford Coal and K & J Coal. Neither company has been
active in direct sales to export customers in recent years, although
Bradford formerly supplied Pakistan Steel through Hansen Coal.

Both companies have operations in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania,
served by Conrail for shipment through the Consol Coal Pier. They are
strip operations in the Kittanning and Freeport seams with typical
volatile content of 26-27%, according to sources.

Representatives of Iscor were in the US in December to visit mines. The
steel company has been increasing its import tonnage because of
declining reserves at the captive Hlobane colliery and because it wants
to improve coke quality when it adds pulverised coal injection this
year (ICR 365/7). At the moment, the company would take higher import
volumes but is reportedly held back by capacity limitations of its
discharge equipment.

CoalArbed has been supplying Iscor with southern Appalachian coals from
producers such as Consol and Pittston for shipment out of Hampton
Roads. The new contracts represent the first deals out of Baltimore.
But although Iscor's import requirement could rise to nearly 2mt/yr
after 2000, it is expected to cut its US take when it goes ahead with
developing an operation in Queensland at Moranbah, where it is
currently undertaking exploration work.

GERMAN COKERS TO IMPORT 1.3MT.

Backdated to the beginning of 1995, a deal was finally signed shortly
before Christmas by German steel companies and Ruhrkohle allowing the
import of an additional 1.3mt of coking coal a year (ICR 385/2).

The steel companies which operate coking plant - Thyssen Stahl, HKM and
Preussag Stahl will together import between 0.7mt and 0.8mt of coking
coal annually. Thyssen will probably have an import entitlement of
around 0.5mt with the other two mills sharing the rest. Ruhrkohle will
import about 0.5mt, rather more than the figure of 0.32mt circulating
in November last year.

The volumes have been fixed only verbally as they depend on the amount
of coke breeze produced in each company's coking plant. This in turn
can be varied under various technical conditions. Also, for a limited
period, Thyssen will give up a part of its share to the other two
mills.

(The link with coke breeze hinges on the fact that the coking coal
equivalent to the breeze is not eligible for subsidy under the rules of
the Huette Contract.)

The steel companies now allowed to import coking coal will, it seems,
derive no significant financial benefit from the deal as Ruhrkohle
already supplies all coking coal at more or less world market prices.
However the mills will have the opportunity to "practise" with world
market coking coal in preparation for the moment when the door is
finally opened to unrestricted coking coal imports.

This could be in 2002 when the Huette contract expires or earlier if
the German government decides to screw back coking coal subsidies
sooner.

Backdating the agreement to beginning 1995 means that imports by
Thyssen, HKM and Ruhrkohle last year will be covered by the deal.
Preussag however will start importing this year for the first time.

AUSTRALIA SHIPS 137MT

A survey of port throughput in Australia shows that the country lifted
exports from 131.2mt to 136.7mt. Port Kembla was the only port to see a
significant fall, dropping 1.5mt to 10.8mt. Four ports moved over 20mt -
 Gladstone, Hay Point, Dalrymple Bay and Newcastle which rose 3.4mt to
48.9mt.

The stock situation tightened during November, largely through
industrial action, cutting exports stocks from 11.5mt to 11.5mt. A
further fall was predicted for December because of production problems

BSM NAME SAD COORDINATOR

Once again, the Brazilian steel mills have nominated Helio Sad of
Usiminas as the chief negotiator for this year's coking coal contracts.
Talks are expected to start in late February after Carnival.

It should be noted that although the mills do much of their negotiating
as a bloc, the recent moves of CST to modify or cancel existing
contracts were the actions of that company on its own.

CST STUNS SUPPLIERS

Brazil's CST has astonished the industry by sending out a letter to all
of its coal suppliers asking for a price reduction on existing
contracts. In the case of certain suppliers, CST has followed up with a
second communication saying it is cancelling its contracts with those
companies.

The initial letter went out mid-December from CST's new chief raw
materials buyer, Coletano Abreu. It asked for price cuts of $4.00/t on
coals priced more than $40.00 and cuts of $3.00 on coals between $30.00
and $40.00, both to be effective January 15. At the same time, CST sent
letters to iron ore producer CVRD asking for a 10% cut and to shipping
company Doce Nave also asking for 10%.

The company said it was forced to take the measure because of a 25-30%
drop in sales of steel slabs, its only product. CST is believed to be
under pressure from its leading bank which, like many banks in Brazil,
is going through a bad period due to the lack of inflationary gains
under the new currency system.

Suppliers have universally responded to this message by saying it is
not possible. One major supplier told ICR, "We sent back a very polite
letter saying that we appreciate where they're coming from, but when we
run into bad times we bite the bullet and we expect the customer to do
the same."

The informal reaction, however, has been far from polite. The
implications of such a move are obvious, as the modification of formal
contracts in progress would call into question the whole framework of
agreements in the market. CST's action has reportedly been as unpopular
elsewhere in Brazil as it has with the suppliers, as buyers at the
other mills worry their credibility will be undermined. According to
sources outside CST, it is also highly unpopular with members of the
company's raw materials purchasing staff whose experience in the coal
market is far more extensive than that of the newcomer Abreu.

As mentioned above, the initial price cut request was followed by a
message to selected high-vol suppliers indicating their contracts were
actually being cancelled. This message, sent out December 28, stated:
"Due to substantial changes in our coal blending, as a consequence of
drastic administrative measures because of declining slab prices in the
international market, we are cancelling the balance of our contracts."
   It wasn't clear at press time which companies were the lucky
recipients of this second message. Some sources said, however, they
believed CST was attempting to cut back on US high-vol because it had
recently taken increased volumes of high-vol from Canada's Devco.

SHELL RINGS THE CHANGES

Shell Coal International has replaced Peter de Wit in his position as
vice president, supply and trading, with Mike Sweeney, previously
general manager for Asia, America and for metallurgical coal. De Wit
moves to a new post involving coal and gas supplies.

Meanwhile, in Australia, Shell is advertising for two traders. One is
to join its Shell Australia team in Sydney under Lindsay Flint, the
other to work with David Heap, the Shell Coal International executive
based there. The latter is effectively a relocation of a London-based
job, probably to Sydney or Jakarta.

COALCORP WANTS UPGRADE

Coal Corporation of New Zealand is negotiating with Tranz Rail and the
Lyttelton Port about the provision of transport services to meet
CoalCorp's planned export growth targets. The company has also
commissioned engineering consultants Connell Wagner to undertake
technical analysis regarding the construction of a deep-water jetty in
Buller Bay, chairman David Stock said last month.

"Our directors are concerned about delays in the Coal Export Project to
date and are progressing developments that will allow export growth
targets to be met in the event that the negotiations with Tranz Rail
and the LPC are not concluded satisfactorily."

C&L SURVEY DETAILS COLLAPSE IN NSW PROFITABILITY

Fiscal 1994/95 was a monetary disaster for the New South Wales coal
industry with the aggregate after tax profit falling by A$100m ($74.4m)
from the previous year to just A$98m, according to the annual survey
conducted by Cooper & Lybrand. However, it is expected that the
performance of the industry will show a marked improvement this year,
and in 1996/97 with the expectation of further price rises this year.

There is now a degree of optimism in the industry, given the higher
prices and continuing increases in productivity, the director of the
NSW Minerals Council and CEO of Peabody Resources, Bob Humphris, said.
Although the latest Coopers & Lybrand survey is now just over six
months out of date, (it covers the 1994/95 FY), it does show the
immense damage caused by the savage price cuts forced by the Japanese
buyers for JFY 1994.

Twenty one companies took part in the survey representing about 80% of
NSW production. This grew by 8% to about 67.5mt in the year, of which a
little more than 50% was won from underground operations. Domestic
demand remained static and all of the additional 5.1mt found its way
into export markets which increased to close to 50mt. Operating profit
after tax but before abnormal and extraordinary items averaged only
A$1.45/t less than half the A$3.19/t profit for the previous financial
year.

If extraordinary and abnormal items are included, the meagre profit is
all but wiped out. The aggregate bottom line result for last financial
year for all the companies surveyed was only A$3m which suggests that,
in all probability, a relatively large percentage of the respondents
traded in the red.

The Minerals Council, as always, has been quick to point out that the
governments' take of coal industry revenue was much higher than that
received by the producers. Total government revenue grew from A$12.14/t
in 1993/94 to A$12.43/t. The figure includes services provided, notably
rail freights, as well as income tax. A breakdown of the total payments
to the state and federal governments suggest that NSW is getting its
act together on becoming a more efficient provider of services.
Provision of government services fell from A$396m in 1992/93 to A$336m
in 1993/94 and to A$312m last financial year - a 24% drop in three
years. This was achieved despite the fact that tonnages moved rose by
almost 9% last year. Capital investment in 1994/95, mirroring industry
optimism, rose to A$625m from $485m the year before and it is estimated
that it will rise further to around A$700m this financial year. It is
also likely that capital expenditure will remain strong for the
remainder of this decade as producers gear up for the anticipated
increase in demand. Most of this will be met through brownfields
expansion, Humphris said. The survey also includes a comparison of data
from a constant group of respondents whose production rose from 60.9mt
to 61.8mt in the last couple of years although employment levels fell
by almost 800 from 12,064 to 11,272. The constant group also performed
better financially than all the respondents with the after tax
operating profit before abnormals and extraordinaries being A$106m
compared with A$210 the previous year.

The Minerals Council has also released data compiled by the Joint Coal
Board and the Reserve Bank which shows that employment levels for the
entire industry continue to fall. These dropped 8.6% in 1992/93 to
14,458, a further 5.2% to 13,701 in 1993/94 and a further 0.6% to
13,612 last financial year. At the same time, output per employee is
rising steadily - up 7.7% three years ago to 5,580t a man year followed
by a 6.5% rise in 1993/94 to 5,940t and a further 6% increase last year
to 6,440t.

Consequently, the labour cost per tonne produced dropped 4.5% in
1992/93, 4.2% in 1993/94 and 2.5% last year to A$10.39.

CONSOL, RHEINBRAUN TALK BUYOUT

DuPont is negotiating with Rheinbraun parent RWE to sell its remaining
50% share in leading US producer Consol, according to reliable sources.
The two sides held a series of pre-Christmas meetings in London to work
out the details of the buyout, but are still talking over valuation,
ICR understands.

The crux of the matter, apparently, is that Rheinbraun does not expect
to pay as much for the second half of the company as it did for the
first half. The German company paid an estimated $1.25bn for its
initial share in 1991 (ICR 270/6).

A Consol spokesman said he could not comment on acquisition rumours.
From Germany, RWE chief Dietmar Kuhnt issued a statement confirming
that DuPont wants to sell its stake in Consol and saying that RWE will
look for another partner or partners to replace DuPont.

Expectations have been high this fall that DuPont would soon sell its
share in Consol. The company has made no secret that it considers coal
to be a non-core asset. One source points out that reports of a
divestiture have been widespread since former DuPont chairman Edgar
Woolard said the company intended to buy back shares owned by Seagram
and to fund that with a sale of Consol.

In connection with the RWE-DuPont negotiations, there have also been
rumours that a third party will take a minority share in Consol. The
name of Cyprus Amax has come up in this connection, but it should be
remembered that Cyprus has been mentioned as a prospective buyer of
virtually every property on the block for the past six months. One
observer notes that a part-ownership of Consol by Cyprus Amax would be
illogical from an operational point of view as it would "paralyse" the
two competitors.

CONSOL ANNOUNCES REORGANISATION

Consol will eliminate three regional mining offices in a major
reorganisation resulting in the loss of an estimated 200-300 jobs. Also
at Consol, company president William Karis will take over Bobby Brown's
position as CEO, while Brown will stay with Consol to focus on
"strategic issues."

In the reorganisation, Consol will shut down its mining offices in
Washington, Pennsylvania; Morgantown, West Virginia; and St. Louis,
Missouri. Functions handled at these mid-level offices will be
transferred either to company headquarters in Pittsburgh or to the
mining operations themselves, a spokesman told ICR.

"We are trying to update our structure to reflect the character of our
company in 1995," the spokesman said. "The structure was put in place
in 1975, but we mine fifty percent more coal than we did 20 years ago
with fifty percent fewer mines."

The change will be effective as of February. There have also been
rumours that some of Consol's regional sales offices will close, but
the spokesman said he was not aware of any such plan.

Regarding Brown's new role, the company did not define the "strategic
issues" he will deal with, but his responsibilities may be related to
an upcoming change in ownership. The shift of the CEO position from
Brown to Karis follows a transfer of the president position from the
former to the latter in 1995.

AEP, COGENTRIX FORM VENTURE

American Electric Power, the largest coal-burning power company in the
US, has formed a joint venture with independent power company Cogentrix
and with Zurn Industries of Erie, Pennsylvania. The venture, called
Industrial Energy Partners, will focus on building IPPs selling
electricity beyond AEP's own service area, possibly including overseas.

The announcement was made in December at a power conference in
California. It reflects a decision by Ohio-based AEP to take advantage
of the deregulation of the US electricity industry. The venture
involves a non-utility subsidiary called AEP Resources, one of several
unregulated entities recently formed by AEP to pursue new power-related
markets. The parent company controls utilities in seven states in the
midwest burning about 45m short tons (st)/yr.

Cogentrix is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and operates
power projects in the US and overseas. It operates 10 plants in the US
and is currently working toward development of a $1.4bn power plant in
Mangalore, India.

Zurn is a manufacturer of equipment for power generation. It has
designed and built more than 40 generating stations over the past 10
years that are fuelled by natural gas or waste products.

PEN OWNERSHIP CHANGES

The evolution of an independent US producer continues with Pen
Holdings' announcement this week that controlling interest in the
company's common stock was sold to William Beckner January 3. Beckner
has been the company's president and chief executive officer since 1993
and has held various executive positions since 1982.

Pen, a privately held company located in Brentwood, Tennessee, was
originally formed in 1971 by Eddie Pen, who died February 6, 1993. His
wife, Grace Pen, has served as chairman of the company's board of
directors since his death. The sale was effected by Grace Pen and the
other co-executors of Pen's estate.

The company was originally known as P&C Bituminous Coal and was created
by Pen largely to do business with Taiwan Power. However, the company's
long-term contract supplies to Taipower have declined in volume at the
same time it has shifted toward domestic markets as well as export
markets outside Taiwan.

Pen has total revenues of more than $200m per year and employs 500
people. Its two largest subsidiaries are Pen Coal Corp. and Elk Horn
Coal, which control about 200m short tons of reserves in east Kentucky
and southern West Virginia.

RUHRKOHLE HOPES TO INCREASE STAKE IN GERMAN CREEK

Ruhrkohle International, a subsidiary of Ruhrkohle Handel, the trading
arm of German coal producer Ruhrkohle, wants to increase its share in
Australia's German Creek from around 12% to at least 20%.

Ruhrkohle International continues to scout the world for other
interesting investment possibilities. Any acquisitions are likely to be
small however after the investment of several hundred million DMs in
Venezuela since "Ruhrkohle is not a company with enormous financial
resources." Only those of the German state.

Latest International Iron and Steel Institute blast furnace iron
production figures show a sharp drop off in November in European
activity rates. Indeed the institute's monthly analysis for the first
11 months of 1995 indicates a slowing across the board of the 43
industries surveyed. Although in Asia South Korea and Taiwan continue

latter by 5.9% in November compared with November 1994.

CHINESE COKE SALES REACH 7MT

The rapid growth in Chinese coke exports could approach 9mt for the
whole of 1995, easily more than double 1994 sales. In October exports
hit a new monthly record with 890,000t shipped, bringing to 7.05mt the
volume moved in the first 10 months of the year (3.13mt in January
October 1994. Prices, according to Chinese customs authorities, reached
$80.52/t FOB compared with $67.39 a year previously.

Coal exports also look to be heading for another record year with
22.44mt moved in the first 10 months compared with 18.34mt in the same
1994 period.

FREIGHTS STAY QUIET

Deep sea freight rates are drifting with very little activity reported
in any sector. The Baltic Freight Index has slipped to 1,589, from its
pre-Christmas level of slightly over 1,600. Brokers report an
"absolutely terrible" cape-sized market and a not much better panamax
sector. Of the few spot fixtures reported, since just before Christmas,
capes from the US Atlantic to ARA ranged around $6.00. A cape in the
Pacific fetched $5.15 for a shipment from Queensland to South Korea.
The only Colombian business reported was for a 60,000t shipment from
Puerto Bolivar to Wedel in Germany at $11.25, whilst there was no
Richards Bay loading fixtures reported.

UMW INAUGURATES ROBERTS

The United Mine Workers of America swore in its new president, Cecil
Roberts, December 22. Roberts succeeds Richard Trumka in leading the US
miners' union and is expected to take an aggressive stance in
attempting to reverse the union's declining representation in the
industry.

Roberts has been active in the UMW since the 1970s and became a
leading figure in the 1989 Pittston strike while serving as vice
president of the union's District 17. He has worked as a coal miner
since 1971.

DONG/AMERADA PROBE NEW DANISH N SEA GASLINE

Denmark's state owned Dansk Olie og Naturgas (Dong) and Amerada Hess
A/S, local unit of US Amerada Hess Corp, are jointly investigating a
possible DKr1.5-2.5bn ($270.7-451m) new gas transport system in the
Danish North Sea, potentially tapping Norwegian and UK supplies as well
as Danish gas.  The move follows acceptance by Dong of an Amerada
proposal to participate in a joint study of the technical and economic
feasibility of building a new system.  Faced with rapidly growing
natural gas demand in Denmark Dong is currently investigating further
gas supplies.

Dong already owns the existing pipeline system transporting natural gas
from Central Graben fields in the southwestern Danish North Sea to
shore on the west coast of Jutland.  Announcing the new investigation
late last month, Amerada noted the existing system has an annual
transport capacity of about 7.5 Bcm.  This corresponds to the total
amount of gas Dansk Undergrunds Consortium, hitherto Dong's sole
supplier, is able to deliver to Dong from 1997.  "With these deliveries
the existing gas transport system will be nearing its capacity," said
Amerada.

"From the turn of the century, Dong expects to be able to sell
additional gas in the region of two billion cubic metres per annum
which entails securing new gas supplies.  Taken together, this means
that there is a need for a new system which will also give improved
security of supply for the Danish market."  Amerada is an operator and
participant in several exploration licences in the Danish sector while
Dong is a part owner, with a typical 20% share in all licences awarded
since 1984.

Amerada says it expects to start Danish sector production soon, with
one discovery for which it has expectations being the South Arne field
in licence 7/89.  This saw a promising production test earlier last
year.  "A new gas transport system would be able to gather gas from
both South Arne as well as other smaller fields and could also be
linked to the Norwegian system," said Amerada.  Amerada and Dong would
"in appropriate circumstances" seek cooperation with other field
owners.

Some of these smaller fields would not be economic if they had to bear
the costs of a transport infrastructure on their own, said Amerada.
"Apart from transporting gas from any smaller Danish fields there may
also be a possibility to transport gas to Denmark from the UK, German
and Norwegian sectors.  Depending on which technical solution is the
most attractive, the transport system would require an investment of
approximately 1.5-2.5bn Danish Kroner (C.#170-280 million)."

The accompanying map (see hard copy) shows the existing transport
systems for oil and natural gas from Danish Undergrunds Consortium's
fields in the Central Graben in the southwestern Danish North Sea.  The
dotted line indicates a potential new transport sytem for natural gas
emanating from the South Arne field in the western Danish North Sea.
Amerada notes there are unutilised fields on Danish as well as on
German, English and Norwegian territory.

BP/SONATRACH IN ALGERIAN GAS PUSH ON EUROPE

BP just before Christmas announced signing of a major potential $3.5bn
gas deal with Algerian state oil and gas firm Sonatrach which marks a
key new strategic phase in Algeria's push for future gas sales in
Europe and a major advance for BP's ambitions to boost its
international gas business. The two companies signed an agreement to
explore for and produce gas in the remote Sahara Desert and,
particularly significantly, to market it jointly in Europe, notably
southern Europe.

Algerian industry and energy minister Ammar Makhloufi said the BP deal
could be a model for other similar projects; Exxon is reportedly to
start negotiations on a possible natural gas deal close to the BP
location. Algeria's bloody struggle between Islamic militants and
government security forces has not so far deterred energy firms; while
the bulk of oil and gas fields are in the south of the country most
violence has been in the north.

Commenting on the new deal, BP chief executive John Browne said: "This
is a landmark agreement which could increase BP's worldwide gas
production by 30%. It is the first major gas joint venture a foreign
company has signed with Sonatrach, the sole gas producer in Algeria for
the past 30 years. It has the potential to open up a new area of gas
production in Algeria and, from the next decade onwards, to give
European consumers greater choice in their sources of gas supply."

Under the deal, which follows two years of negotiations, BP will
initially appraise known gas finds and search for additional reserves
in the In Salah region of District 3 some 1,200 km south of Algiers.
The licence area is about 25,000 sq km or 20% of the total District 3
area and BP said the area was believed to be capable of producing about
10 Bcm/yr of gas by the early part of the next century; the area has
yielded no liquids to date and they are not expected.

Present BP global gas output is about 13 Bcm/yr, most in the North Sea.
Current estimates are that the Algerian licence area holds about 10 Tcf
split equally between existing finds and future discoveries. Subject to
proving sufficient reserves, gas would be transported north via a new
pipeline (see map in hard copy) to link with Algeria's existing
pipeline system and then onwards by pipe to Europe to be marketed
jointly by a new company to be owned 50:50 by BP and Sonatrach. First
gas is looked for about 2002-2003.

BP said it was planning to spend about $100m on an initial two to three
year appraisal and exploration programme and later investment decisions
would be needed for subsequent stages of the project. The deal requires
approval of the European Union as well as ratification by Algerian
authorities. BP Exploration chief executive Rodney Chase said BP would
shortly start seismic work in the In Salah region and was planning to
drill nine appraisal and exploration wells to establish location and
size of known reserves and to find new fields. The licence area holds
seven known gasfields and 750 sq km of 3D seismic will be shot over
these, plus drilling of five appraisal wells. A separate exploration
area in the licence has a work programme of 2,000 sq km of 2D seismic
and four exploration wells

Depending on success of this initial phase, full development would
require construction of a 520 km, 48-inch diameter pipeline to take gas
to Hassi R'Mel, Algeria's gas hub, linking up to the new Maghreb
gasline to Spain and the TransMed system to Italy, and then on to
market. LNG export is not envisaged. Pipeline construction could cost
up to $1,000m, with full cost of the project estimated at some $3,500m
over a five year period. BP would fund 65% of this investment and
Sonatrach the remainder. BP is expected to get about 30% of net profits
over the full 20-30 year life of the project. The pipeline is big
enough to carry gas from other concessions.

NIGERIA LNG SEALS MAJOR CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT

Nigeria LNG Ltd (NLNG) late last year turned a deaf ear to continued
international calls for reprisals against Nigeria's military regime for
its execution of minority Ogoni activists (IGR 289/21) and kept the
long delayed Bonny LNG project on the rails with final award of the
main project construction contract. The company said the move started
the final phase of the project which main foreign partner Shell noted
has so far taken 30 years to bring to fruition. The lump sum turnkey
contract, reportedly worth about $3bn, has been confirmed to a
contracting consortium of France's Technip, Italian Snamprogetti, MW
Kellogg of the US and Japan's JGC.

It covers engineering, procurement and construction for the
liquefaction plant at Finima, Bonny Island, together with associated
facilities and the gas transmission system to collect natural gas from
producers. NLNG said the contractors were "obliged to ensure maximum
Nigerian input during construction and to follow strict regulations to
ensure environmental impact protection". Shell, holder of 25.6% of the
project and technical leader, said until now there had been no way to
dispose of large volumes of associated gas produced with oil in the
Delta region.

If the construction contract had not been signed by end-1995 a complex,
interdependent series of other contracts, including contracts for
export of Nigerian gas, would have collapsed, terminating the LNG
project with little hope of revival. It again stressed the benefits of
the project for jobs and the environment - through cuts in gas flaring -
 and that no dividends would accrue to shareholders, which include the
Nigerian state, until after 2007.

Shell Development Co of Nigeria managing director Brian Anderson said:
"We recognise there have been calls for the project to be halted as a
gesture of political protest. We respect these views and understand the
concerns they reflect. But we cannot accept that this would-contribute
to the good of Nigeria." Other partners in NLNG are Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp with a 49% stake, France's Elf with 15% and Italy's Agip
with 10.4%.

MAJOR ITALY-NORWAY GAS DEAL FLAGGED

Agreement appears imminent in negotiations on a supply deal to
establish Norway as a major source of natural gas for Italy. Antonio
Badini, Italian ambassador in Oslo, is quoted in the weekly Mondo
Economico as saying: "It's now a question of several weeks, the time
for settling the last details." The agreement was said by the magazine
to provide for the Eni group's Snam to import 10-12 Bcm/yr from the
Norwegian North Sea for an annual value of L1,500bn ($940m). It would
run for 20 years, from 1999/2000. The magazine added that Norwegian
commerce minister Gete Knudsen discussed the matter on a recent visit
to Italy.

The Eni group gives no further details than those already disclosed by
Snam. The negotiations, Snam said last month, are with the GFU
consortium of Norwegian producers and the gas would be landed at
Dunkerque, France under arrangements with Gaz de France. A pipeline
would have to be laid across French territory to bring the gas to
Montcenis on the Italian border. Little has been made known about the
pipeline scheme and various aspects are reported still under discussion
such as whether it would be owned by Gaz de France alone or jointly
with Snam.

The advantage for Snam is that in Norway it will gain a secure major
source, at much lower political risk than the two existing leading
suppliers, Algeria and Russia. It already imports lesser quantities
from a low risk source, Holland, but here the availability is limited.

PTT PLANS THAI WEST/EAST GASLINE

The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) is embarking on a 7.27bn baht
($290.8m) investment project for a new natural gas pipeline spanning
from Thailand's western region to the east. The new gasline, 28 inches
in diameter and 200 km long, will be laid from Ratchaburi province to
link with PTT's existing gas grid at the Bangkok South Power plant in
Samut Prakan and Wang Noi in Ayutthaya. According to PTT, the west-to-
east line is geared to respond to greater natural gas demand by
industries and future power stations operated by independent power
producers (IPPs) along the route.

The gasline will form an integral part of the larger pipeline, 42
inches in diameter and 300 km long, to be laid from the Thai-Burmese
border at Kanchanaburi province to a 1,800 MW combined cycle plant to
be built by Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat). The
Kanchanaburi-Ratchaburi gasline, estimated to cost 16.5bn baht, will
transport natural gas from Burma's offshore Yadana and Yetagun
gasfields to Thailand. PTT has just received Cabinet endorsement for
investing in the two gasline projects. The west-to-east pipeline is
scheduled operational in 1999, a year after expected completion of the
Kanchanaburi-Ratchaburi stretch.

At present, PTT, the Thai state oil and gas firm, is selecting
companies to provide engineering consultancy services for the
Kanchanaburi-Ratchaburi gasline project, PTT officials said. Meanwhile,
the Cabinet has signalled a green light for PTT to proceed with a
1.47bn baht investment in another gas pipeline scheme - a 24-inch, 100
km stretch - from Tantawan gasfield in the Gulf of Thailand to tie in
with PTT's Gulf grid. The approval came after PTT sealed an agreement
with the group led by US-based Pogo Producing for long-term natural gas
supply from Tantawan. The Tantawan gasline is scheduled complete at end-
1997, before starting delivery of 100 MMcfd to PTT (IGR 287/18).

SYRIAN GAS OUTPUT POISED TO DOUBLE

Plans have been put together that will see a doubling of Syrian gas
production by 2000. A recent study into reserves and prospects leads
the oil ministry to give the green light to projects aimed at utilising
a flow of over 16 MMcmd. Four schemes will make this possible, the
biggest being the start of production from fields near Palmyra. These
are due to start up at 3 MMcmd when first-stage development is
completed in 1996. A second stage development will double that to 6
MMcmd during 1997.

Also near Palmyra will be Marathon's oilfield development, expected to
yield some 1.1 MMcmd of associated gas by 2000. Final scheme involves
expansion of production and processing capacity at the Jbeissah
gasfield, where output will rise from 1.7 MMcmd now to 2.5 MMcmd.

Getting this new gas to market will involve laying of 1,160 km of new
pipeline. Utilisation will come mainly from new power plants such as
that at al-Zara (IGR 289/22), fertiliser production, refinery use, iron
and steel production and general industrial use. By 2000, these will
absorb 12.85 MMcmd. Distribution through domestic grids will take 3.5
MMcmd.

GADONNEIX TAKES HELM AT GAZ DE FRANCE

Pierre Gadonneix has succeeded Loik le Floch-Prigent as president of
Gaz de France (GdF). The latter - who has socialist credentials as well
as a reputation for competent management - was sent in to pacify state
railway company Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer (SNCF) whose
employees were at the vanguard of the recent wave of French strikes. It
was third time lucky for Gadonneix, appointed general manager of GdF in
July 1987. In 1988, when Jacques Fournier left, Gadonneix saw Francis
Gutmann get the top job. In 1993, le Floch-Prigent was appointed over
his head.

Choice of the highly qualified Gadonneix - who has a doctorate from the
Harvard Business School, as well as attending France's elite technical
university Ecole Polytechnique, and the specialised Ecole Nationale
Superieure du Petrole et des Moteurs - also contrasts with the recent
politically motivated appointment of Edmond Alphandery at the head of
GdF's sister organisation Electricite de France. But like Alphandery,
Gadonneix will take part in nominating his deputy, which will
strengthen his presidential authority. Among names being mentioned for
the general manager's post are current deputy general manager Jean
Balazuc, as well as director of the industry ministry's energy
department Claude Mandil, and Michel Francony, director of EdF-GdF
Services (which manages both utilities' distribution systems).

It remains to be seen to what extent Gadonneix will pursue the
internationalist and market oriented policies of his predecessor. He
must renegotiate the company's charter, which defines its activities.
At home GdF faces challenges from both electricity and fuel oil and
could face challenges to its monopoly of gas distribution from such
established service companies as Generale des Eaux or Lyonnaise des
Eaux. Internationally, Gadonneix will have to manage assets already
acquired in Canada, Uruguay and US. Eventually, he will also have to
face pressure from Brussels to deregulate, even if the European
Commission has decided to focus its attention on deregulating the
electricity market in the first instance, and is taking its time.

In his time at the industry ministry, Gadonneix worked with liberally
inclined ministers such as Michel d'Ornano, Rene Monory and Alain
Madelin. But he will face fierce opposition from the trade unions to
any proposals along the lines of le Floch-Prigent's plans to exchange
shareholdings with Russian gas company Gazprom, even if current
industry minister Franck Borotra favours selling minority stakes to an
Elf or a Statoil, or to individuals.

* GdF is to pay the state a dividend of FFr970m ($198.34m) for 1995,
while Electricite de France is to pay FFr1.5bn, according to figures
published in the official journal.

HYDRO SEEKS 2000 OSEBERG GAS

Norsk Hydro has now submitted a NKr3.6bn ($569.8m) plan to Norway's
industry and energy ministry for development and operation of gas
reserves at its North Sea Oseberg field, with start of gas exports
targeted at 2000. Development would be via a new steel gas process and
export platform linked to the Oseberg field centre with gas exports
tied into the existing pipeline system in the Heimdal area. Recoverable
Oseberg gas reserves are put at 115 Bcm and average gas export at 4
Bcm/yr during 2000-2010, rising to 10 Bcm/yr thereafter.

Investment costs are estimated at NKr2.5bn for the field installations
and NKrl.lbn for the pipeline. Oseberg started oil production in 1988,
now running at some 0.5m b/d. Meanwhile, Norwegian state oil and gas
firm Statoil has now submitted a development and operation plan to the
ministry for the mid-Norwegian Aasgard field. A verdict on whether gas
from the project will be processed at Kaarstoe or Kollsnes remains
outstanding.

GAS DELIVERIES HIT NEW PEAK

Norwegian gas deliveries to continental Europe hit a new peak in early
December because of cold weather, according to state oil and gas firm
Statoil. Daily gas delivery orders received by the gas sales centre at
Stavanger and the Bygnes operations centre set the record during
December 5-8. Almost 55 MMcmd was piped through the Europipe and
Statpipe/Norpipe systems to Emden, Germany and the Zeepipe trunkline to
Zeebrugge, Belgium. With deliveries from Ekofisk on top, these sales
ensured maximum Norwegian deliveries in response to Europe's cold
weather, said Statoil.

NORFRA GROUP URGES SHORT LOOP

A 15-20 km by-pass loop linking Norway's Statpipe and Norpipe gas
trunklines around the Ekofisk centre, should replace the existing
connection via the North Sea field, according to state oil and gas firm
Statoil. It has put the proposal forward as operator of the NorFra
partnership planning a gasline from Norway to Dunkirk, France. A
government decision is expected by 1 March.

Costed at NKr500m ($79.14m), the short loop is preferred by NorFra
partners to a longer 150 km alternative, said Statoil. Due ready by
summer 1998, it will feed gas from fields including Statfjord and
Gullfaks into the Norpipe line to Emden. Completion will coincide with
completion of new facilities at Ekofisk which will in future handle gas
from Ekofisk alone.

however, the Central Asian republic could produce up to 64 Bcm this

Russia cut off Turkmen pipe access to Europe. Production in 1994
slumped to 35.6 Bcm and was planned at 34.6 Bcm last year. An increase
is now expected in the wake of the recent deal setting up joint Russo-

COLD SPELLS GOOD/BAD BG NEWS

Record low temperatures brought good news and bad news for beleaguered
British Gas over the Christmas/New Year period. Gas demand hit new
highs with the previous peak in England and Wales exceeded by 2% while
in Scotland, where temperatures fell as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius
in Glasgow, demand was 10% up on the previous high. BG said it was
managing to meet demand in England from storage and higher North Sea
production. In Scotland it was interrupting supply to businesses with
interruptible contracts. Bottled gas supplier Calor said it was selling
50% more gas than a year earlier.

Coming during a time of low industrial activity because of the holiday
period, the demand rise was attributable virtually entirely to higher
heating use. Spot natural gas prices firmed on the cold but the rise
was modest, about 0.25p/therm to around 10.5p, as only the
industrial/commercial market is deregulated as yet. With the current UK
gas glut posing major problems for BG, the higher cold weather demand
was welcome as one way of helping reduce the surplus.

But this good news came hand in hand with bad as BG faced making
compensation payments to thousands of customers for failure to respond
swiftly when central heating systems broke down. The problem focussed
on 3-star service contracts, for which customers pay over #100
($152.3m) a year with an expectation of attention within 24 hours of
notifying a breakdown. BG denied staff cuts were to blame for delays
and said weather conditions were exceptional. But the Gas Consumers
Council said it had tracked an increase in 3-star contract complaints
before Christmas and the cold snap.

BG APPOINTS CONTRACTS GURU

British Gas has now appointed a special negotiator to handle the take-
or-pay gas contracts problem that has faced it with costly write-downs.
At the same time it has indicated first producers to agree to
renegotiate contracts with BG will get best terms. So far North Sea
producers have shown no inclination to revamp long term take-or-pay
contracts to supply BG at prices well above current competitive market
levels. Job of BG's new chief negotiator Kenneth Gardener, a director
of Charterhouse Bank, is to persuade producers to come to the table.

Gardener, who took on his new post on 1 January, has given up executive
duties at Charterhouse but remains a director. On his appointment last
month he acknowledged producers would be reluctant to re-open legally
binding contracts but said he believed a "win win" position could
emerge from negotiations. He has agreed to give at least two years to
the problem. Meanwhile, BG has also indicated it will increase pressure
on producers after 1 February when the supply contracts will be
transferred to a new trading subsidiary.

News of the troubleshooter appointment was one factor in a sharp pre-
Christmas rally in BG shares which added some 9% in just a couple of
days, the price rising to 250p ($3.88); other factors were record cold
weather and renewed market speculation, so far unfounded, that a bid
may emerge for BG from the likes of Shell or BP. BG also underlined the
increased significance of legal issues in its affairs with appointment
of William Friedrich, formerly with international law firm Shearman &
Sterling, as its general counsel. Other recent senior appointments
include promotion of Harry Moulson, head of BG pipe unit TransCo, to
executive director and of Dr Pierre Jungels, formerly with Belgium's
Petrofina, as managing director, exploration and production.

HOMES COMPETITION 'ON COURSE'

The UK government is pressing ahead with a pilot trial of domestic gas
market competition this spring despite claims that necessary systems
are not ready. Some 0.5m household customers in southwest England are
due to be offered a choice of supplier, breaking the current British
Gas monopoly, from 1 April. BG pipeline unit TransCo sought delay of
the trial, expressing concern over lack of time for computer testing.
But in the run-up to Christmas industry and energy minister Tim Eggar
rejected the move.

Instead, it was agreed gas regulator Ofgas should appoint a
'troubleshooter' or 'controller' to ensure problems are sorted out and
the timetable is maintained. Following the offer from Amerada Hess of
savings of some 15% on current levels for households switching from BG,
Total has waded in with announced savings of up to 16%, with Swebgas,
regional electricity company in the southwest area, offering savings of
at least 17%. Texaco has also joined forces with LPG market leader
Calor to chase the domestic and small commercial natural gas markets.
BG has yet to reveal its hand on how it will respond to the household
market challenge.

MINISTER RESIGNATION HITS GAS TAX

Resignation and replacement of Austrian finance minister Andreas
Staribacher last week [2 January] will likely cause a further delay in
introduction of a tax on gas (IGR 287/12), variously labelled as an
energy, CO2 or environmental levy. Petroleum products came under the
tax last May, with gas, electricity and coal to follow. Originally the
extended tax was expected at the start of this year but parties to the
discussion, ranging from government to electricity and industrial
interests, have been unable to agree a formula which would be fair to
all consumers. Staribacher had argued in favour of the tax on gas on
grounds that the tax should be part of a general energy levy to
encourage reduced consumption, not to promote a shift from one energy
source to another.

As finance minister, he had been under considerable pressure to impose
the broadened tax as part of a programme to ease an unbearably large
budget deficit projected for this year. Staribacher's replacement as
finance minister is Viktor Klima, who leaves his previous post as
minister for state industry, transportation and communications. Before
joining the government, Klima was finance chief at OMV and will likely
be sympathetic to demands of the energy industry in view of OMV's
monopoly over gas imports.

The cabinet reshuffle as well as expected complications in forming a
new government following an indecisive election last month will now
probably postpone any possible introduction of the levy on gas and the
remaining energy resources until after mid-year at earliest. Once a
government is established, the issue of the amount of the tax and the
exceptions (such as gas used for electricity generation) will still
have to be resolved.

EVN/BAYERNWERKE LAND KOGAZ

Success of a joint $87m bid by Germany's Bayernwerke and Austria's
Energieversorgung Niederosterreich (EVN) in the second tender for
Hungary's Kogaz regional gas utility (IGR 289/4) has cemented a
partnership which could have further consequences. The two concerns
increased their offer for Kogaz by some $20m to win in their bid for a
50% plus one share holding in the utility which serves three provinces
in the southwestern part of the country bordering on Slovenia and
Croatia. EVN had hoped rather to gain a shareholding in a gas utility
bordering on Austria, making supply synergies possible, but had to be
content with the Kogaz award.

The Austrian concern has had a co-operation agreement with Kogaz for
some time. Kogaz  supplies about 190,000 customers in a service area
with a population of over 1m. Annual sales of about 700 Bcm are worth
about $6.2m. While EVN was the only Austrian utility to share in
Hungary's gas privatisation, the deal will not bring pleasure to OMV,
which holds a virtual monopoly over gas imports to Austria.

The reason is the stronger relationship which EVN will achieve with
Bayernwerke, seen by OMV and federal electricity authority Verbund as
an unwelcome intruder on the Austrian energy scene. Bayernwerke already
shares with EVN  a holding in Austria's one private gas and oil
producer, Rohol Aufsuchungs AG (RAG). The German concern has made
offers on several Austrian privatisations but has been rebuffed by OMV
and the Verbund with support from the government, which prefers to see
control of the energy sector remain in Austrian hands.

Industry has urged that the oNORM M 7323 technical standard, virtually
identical to the German TRB 610 standard which took effect as of 1
January 1996, be enacted immediately in Austria. Industry points out
that the German standard was developed at some expense due to extensive
research and testing and that there is no reason the law not be adopted
at once. The regulation would apply to tanks used by private as well as
industry gas consumers.

GWH Gas- u. Warenhandelsgesmbh, a joint venture trading house owned by
Austria's gas import monopoly OMV and Russia's Gazexport, has reported
a successful 1995 with a trading volume of Sch1.9bn ($190m). The firm
was set up in 1994 to expedite dealings between the two concerns and to
overcome Russian currency problems. Under agreements which run until
2012, Gazexport last year supplied about 1.7 Bcm of gas in exchange for
4,000 tonnes (t) of lubricants, 2,000t of polyethylene and about 1.2m
sq metres of geotextiles, with the latter products supplied by OMV's
plastics subsidiaries for use in the Russian gas industry. GWH was also
instrumental in expediting a long-term contract for transport of an
additional 500 MMcm of Russian gas through Austria to Bavaria via OMV
pipelines.

1994 "but with the present state of the Deutschemark and an oil price
of, say, $15/bbl, it is not economic to produce now". That study was
based on a pipeline from the reserves, in blocks A/6-B/4, to Denmark,
and BEB then reckoned "that we need $20/bbl to make the scheme viable".

An offshore power station and a spur line to the Ekofisk-Emden Norpipe
trunkline have been other options considered. Front-running scheme now
is a tie-back to Amoco's Valhall platform in the Norwegian sector. Aker
Engineering is looking at a pipeline from A/6-B/4 via Norwegian, German
and Danish territorial waters (see also separate story). At the fields
a small wellhead platform would be sited in about 50 metres of water.

BEB last drilled a well in the area, B/4-4, in 1992; B/4-3 in 1988 was
a suspended gas find and previous finds had been made in A/6. One
problem with the gas is high nitrogen content. Gas has also been found
in H/15-H/18. BEB tells IGR that a A/6-B/4 "development would require
the drilling of more wells". No drilling elsewhere off Germany is
envisaged by the company in 1996.

REPSOL CONFIRMS T&T DEAL

Spain's oil, gas and chemical conglomerate Repsol confirmed in mid-
December it has bought the 20% stake in Trinidad and Tobago's Atlantic
LNG Co that was offered to Spain's industrial gas distributor Enagas.
Enagas will still buy 40% of the LNG produced at the Trinidad plant to
be built at a cost of $1bn and scheduled onstream in early 1999 (see
separate story). Repsol, whose gas operations now account for 25% of
its profits - Pta42.2bn ($349m) in the first nine months of 1995, up
26.6% - spent $200m on its share, which makes it the third biggest
partner in the 400 MMcfd LNG plant, after Amoco Trinidad LNG Co, an
affiliate of US Amoco Corp with 34%, and British Gas Trinidad LNG with
26%.

The other partners are Cabot Trinidad LNG, an affiliate of Cabot Corp
of the US, and Trinidad's public National Gas Co, with 10% each. The
remaining 60% of the 3m tonnes (t)/yr of LNG that the plant will
produce will be bought by Boston-based Cabot. Enagas and Cabot signed
an initial deal with Atlantic LNG in July and Enagas was given the
option to acquire 20% of the equity.

Although insiders thought Enagas would acquire the share, Repsol's move
is part of its own gas expansion programme. Repsol owns 45.3% of
Spain's domestic gas distributor Gas Natural, which in turn holds 91%
of Enagas. Repsol now has a foot firmly in Trinidad's important gas
market and Enagas will import a further 14.6bn thermies a year of LNG,
equivalent to 18% of Spain's current annual consumption, over a 20-year
period.

Enagas is holding talks with an unnamed shipping company to rent a
125,000t tanker to bring the LNG to Spain's regasification plants at
Huelva and Cartegena, with an option to buy the ship. Enagas has for
some years pursued a policy of expanding and diversifying its supply
sources, to give more flexibility and security to the Spanish gas
sector. A Repsol spokesman said its participation in the project
"strengthens the company's upstream integration and consolidates the
growing importance of natural gas in its activities". The investment
was made through Repsol affiliate Repsol International BV.

Meanwhile, the Spanish Treasury and state industrial holding company
SEPI are negotiating the 'destiny' of the approximate Pta80bn that will
be gained from the sale of 7% of Repsol shares in the New Year. The
state, through SEPI, owns 21% of Repsol and SEPI executives would like
the privatisation cash to help alleviate the Pta700bn debt it was left
with when defunct loss-making holding company INI was closed down last
year and partially replaced by SEPI. Treasury officials are said to
want to use the capital gain to help reduce the public deficit.

NEW SWITCH TO GAS FUEL

The Basque engineering unit of Babcock Wilcox has singed a Pta2bn
($16.5m) contract with southern Spanish utility Sevillana de
Electricidad to convert the fuel oil-fired Bahia de Algeciras power
station to gas use, only the second thermal plant to make the move so
far in Spain. After conversion, the station's boiler will be able to
use fuel oil or gas, or a mixture of both in any proportion. Gas de
Euskadi, owned by the Basque government's energy enterprise Ente Vasco
de la Energia (EVE) and national industrial gas distributor Enagas,
recorded nine-month 1995 gross profits of Pta917m, which compares with
gross profits of just Pta485m for the whole of 1994.

Gas de Euskadi in mid-December inaugurated a new distribution pipeline
in the Zalla district close to Bilbao. The consortium behind the future
Zabalgarbi gas-fired incinerator, the largest energy project under way
in the Basque country, has increased its capital from Pta400m to
Pta1.4bn. The consortium includes EVE and Babcock & Wilcox.

GN QUITS TELECOMS PLAY

Gas Natural has made a joint announcement with electricity utilities
Endesa and Sevillana de Electricidad that they are pulling out of
Spain's third main paging company, Compania Europea de Radiobusqueda
(Cersa), in which each holds a 9% stake. The three energy companies
have had this stake in telecommunications since 1992 through the
consortium Servicio de Radiotelefonia Movil (SRM), which holds 96% of
Cersa. There are two main reasons for the apparent reversal of Spanish
energy companies' diversification into telecommunications.

Late arrival of the paging service in Spain meant three large operators
with important investors emerged in the same year, just as the more
successful mobile telephone sector was taking off. This meant that
Cersa, with 25,000 clients, lost Pta420m ($3.5m) last year. One of
Spain's two leading paging companies is expected to buy the 27% of
shares to be put on offer - Mensatel, run by the semi-public
telecommunications giant Telefonia, or Sistelcom-Telemensaje, a
consortium which includes two utilities, Union Fenosa and Fecsa.

PGNIG IN FRESH NORWAY MOVE

Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo (PGNiG, Polish Oil and Gas) is
taking a fresh interest in Norwegian gas from the North Sea. The Polish
gas company sees construction of the 292 km, DM3bn ($2.20bn) Netra
pipeline as a fresh opportunity to achieve some of its long standing
ambition of diversifying gas imports away from Russia. The pipeline -
built by a consortium of BEB, Norsk Hydro, Ruhrgas and Statoil - links
the German North Sea terminal at Etzel with the gas distribution
network of the former German Democratic Republic at Salzwedel. This
brings Norwegian gas to within 70 km of the Polish border, so putting
in an additional link to Poland would be a relatively simple matter.

PGNiG hopes to start negotiations with owners of the Norwegian
gasfields in the next three to four months, aiming for deliveries to
start in two or three years. Whether these talks will succeed remains
to be seen. But PGNiG was confident the Norwegians could produce the
gas cheaply enough to deliver it at a price that would be attractive to
the Poles. That would be some $85-95/Mcm at the Polish border,
preferably either in the region of Szczecin or Gorzelec (Goerlitz).

Furthermore, Poland has made considerable economic progress in the last
few years and has made its peace with the London Club of private
creditor banks, thereby improving its credit rating. This should
forestall the kind of difficulties the Poles experienced when they
tried to buy gas from the British North Sea a couple of years ago.
Those talks failed when the owners required payment for three years
ahead, and guarantees of quantities to be bought further ahead than
that.

At the same time, the Norwegian energy minister Jens Stoltenberg has
noted Russian gas supplier Gazprom had grasped that its clients wanted
to diversify supplies and now saw this as a normal condition of doing
business in Europe. France takes no more than 30% of its gas from
Russia and Germany has adopted a similar target after its supplies were
disrupted by a dispute between Russia and the Ukraine, through whose
territory the pipeline feeding Germany runs.

The Poles get nearly 60% of their supplies from Russia, which provides
some 6 Bcm/yr out of a total Polish consumption of some 10.5 Bcm; the
remaining 4.5 Bcm is produced in Poland. It is unlikely any Norwegian
gas would get Poland's dependence on Russia quite as low as 30%. PGNiG
is looking to import perhaps 2 Bcm to 3 Bcm a year from the North Sea,
which would represent no more than 15-20% of demand by the time it
started landing since Poland's gas requirements are expected to rise
sharply - to perhaps 27 Bcm by 2010, depending on growth and fuel mix
assumptions made.

SUBSEA ROUTE FOR CADIZ GAS

Allseas Marine Contractors has been contracted by Repsol
Investigaciones Petroliferas to carry out major work on Gulf of Cadiz
gasfields. Involved are the Poseidon North and Poseidon South fields
some 40 km offshore. Allseas will design, fabricate and install three
subsea manifolds together with 63 km of 10-inch pipeline, split into
three sections. Tie-in work is also involved, both at wellheads and
manifolds. Control umbilicals will also be laid. The work, in up to 132
metres of water, will be carried out early in 1997, using the Lorelay
and Trenchsetter barges. Cost of the development, start-up and
production rates have yet to be released. All gas will flow to shore

INTERCONNECTOR TRANSIT INTEREST

Belgium's Distrigaz will shortly invite companies to indicate interest
in subscribing for transit pipeline capacity in Belgium linked to the
proposed UK-Zeebrugge Interconnector gas pipeline project. Responses
will be required by February next year at latest. Distrigaz gas supply
and sales director Jean Vermeire last month said he wanted to "remove
some uncertainties that may still exist with respect to our position
on, and the progress of, the planned enhancement of our transit
capacities". He told a Financial Times natural gas conference in London
work on Belgian grid reinforcements required for transit gas flows
associated with the Interconnector was on course.

"I can assure you that all studies and preparatory work are on schedule
to put the required transit capacity in place by October 1998, or such
later date as may be determined by the effective start-up of the
Interconnector or the readiness of new onward connections in transit
destination countries (referred to as the Commissioning Date)," he
said. "In order to determine which transit capacity the market may
require and hence to finalise design and size of new pipelines and grid
reinforcements, Distrigaz will very shortly solicit formal expressions
of interest in subscribing for transit capacity with a view to
concluding long-term transit contracts."

Vermeire said potential shippers willing to enter into such long-term
commitments by the end of second-quarter 1996 - the point at which pipe
and other equipment orders would have to be placed - would then be
assured of availability of the requested transit service from the
Commissioning Date. Subsequent shippers would get different terms. A
detailed information memorandum on transit services on offer was being
made available to potential shippers before end-1995. This would
provide relevant information for shippers to allow them to declare
their interest by February 1996 at the latest. Earlier, he said the go-
ahead decision for the Interconnector could double the gas transit flow
through Belgium - an estimated 15 Bcm this year - by around the turn of
the century.

Dr Burckhard Bergmann, board member of major German gas supplier
Ruhrgas, told the conference many issues still remained open on the
Interconnector (IGR 288/6). These included the destination of the
volumes and how they would be moved on from Zeebrugge. Outlets appeared
feasible which led to a higher netback than the current spot price at
the UK beach. But the question was to what extent it made sense for
producers to commit themselves to these prices on a long-term basis.
There was a wide spectrum of driving forces.

But what was unsatisfactory was that these forces were not geared
towards sustainable developments. Instead, they originated in a UK
disequilibrium which had not ensued from a misjudgement of supply and
demand "but from permanent regulatory intervention. It would be naive
to assume that the currently low spot prices in the UK are the outcome
of liberalisation and the result of high efficiency gains. They are
instead the consequence of a supply overhang resulting largely from the
permanent regulatory corrections made once the privatisation structure
of British Gas in 1986 was found to be unsatisfactory".

Bergmann continued: "What disturbs us, therefore, is not that a
balanced liberal gas market should have repercussions for the west
European Continent via the Interconnector but that there is exposure to
the disequilibrium of the current regulatory transformation and finally
also a growing marginal cost approach to the Interconnector itself."
One key issue, he said, would be whether producers who had participated
in the Interconnector increasingly viewed the investment as a sunk
cost.

Nevertheless, Ruhrgas expected the disequilibrium, and hence the
effects for the north-western part of Continental Europe, to be reduced
via the Interconnector. Although the spot market would not completely
disappear, it would most probably remain confined. The destination for
Interconnector gas on the Continent was still unclear. "Many look to
the German market, the largest but also well-supplied market. A great
deal will depend on whether a substantial quantity can be supplied to
Italy via France. It remains to be seen whether a separate transit
pipeline through Belgium to Germany also materialises.

"There are also other interesting transport opportunities for companies
wishing to obtain gas for Germany from the Interconnector. It must be
borne in mind when constructing a separate pipeline via Belgium - as
with the Interconnector - that the carrying capacity commitments will
cover a longer period than the prospective duration of deliveries."
Bergmann noted that Central European countries were also interested in
obtaining gas from the UK continental shelf. "We support their efforts
in this respect but the long distance makes it very hard to find an
economical solution."

STORAGE WINS GRONINGEN TIME

Development of DFL2.5bn ($1.59bn) worth of natural gas storage in the
Netherlands will meet short to medium term supply needs but extensive
compression, possibly costing DFL4bn, will be needed on the giant Dutch
Groningen field in about a decade to meet future requirements. That is
one of the conclusions of an assessment of Dutch gas storage needs by
consultant Wood Mackenzie*. Main driver is a decline in peak delivery
capacity of leading Dutch gas marketer Gasunie. Dutch oil and gas
company NAM and Amoco of the US are currently working to bring three
peak shaving storage facilities on stream in 1997 (IGR  288/14).
WoodMac notes that with the exception of the Maasvlakte LNG facility,
no dedicated peak shaving/gas storage facilities have been developed in
the Netherlands to date.

This has been avoided by availability of large local gas reserves
together with high production capacity, flexible supply contracts and a
comprehensive infrastructure. Seasonal and short term demand rises have
generally been met through higher output directly from producing
fields. With Dutch output dominated by Groningen, this field has been
conserved as a strategic reserve and swing producer. Last year 42% of
the total annual gas volume (82.1 Bcm) bought by Dutch gas marketer
Gasunie was produced from Groningen. The rest came from other onshore
fields (19%), offshore fields (35%) and imports from Norway (3.5%) and
the UK (0.5%). But during peak demand periods Groningen provides about
75% of deliveries.

As of 1 January 1995 some 2,070 Bcm of gas had been produced in the
Netherlands but Gronigen still holds estimated remaining recoverable
reserves of some 1,275 Bcm, says WoodMac. A further 700 Bcm is held
within other developed fields and future Dutch developments. At current
production rates, reserves are sufficient to supply domestic and export
markets for nearly a quarter of a century. Over the next five years the
analyst expects total gas sales in the Netherlands to rise 5-6% from 44
Bcm in 1995 to 46 Bcm in 2000. With the Netherlands established as a
major gas exporter, Gasunie in 1994 exported 38.3 Bcm, 47% of total
sales; of this 59% went to Germany, 14% to Belgium, 13% to France, 14%
to Italy and 1% to Switzerland. Overall exports are expected to stay
relatively flat in the medium term.

WoodMac reckons domestic Dutch production will rise about 7% from some
82 Bcm/yr currently to about 88 Bcm/yr in 2000. Current imports of
about 3 Bcm/yr from Norway and the UK are expected to rise notably in
the next five years, although not to much over 6 Bcm/yr or 7% of total
Dutch supply. However, these deliveries have relatively limited
flexibility in terms of swing to reflect demand variations. Import
capacity is also partly constrained by Gasunie's role as a transporter
of some 10 Bcm/yr of gas for third parties, including Norwegian
deliveries to France and Belgium.

Moreover, although Dutch output is expected to rise, output from
existing offshore fields and onshore fields other than Groningen is
expected to fall in the late 1990s and after 2000. Consequently,
greater demand will be placed on Groningen production. In the absence
of a major upturn in exploration/development activity, which the
analyst does not currently foresee, or substantially increased imports
(such as could potentially arise through the UK-Belgium
Interconnector), output from Groningen, while falling in the short
term, is expected to rise to about 40 Bcm/yr in 2000.

At the same time, however, the flexibility provided by Groningen is now
being limited by the fall in reservoir pressure in the field and this
problem will be compounded when the higher output levels are needed,
says the report. Therefore, despite its access to more than sufficient
gas volumes to meet projected overall demand for many years to come,
Gasunie has had to initiate projects to maintain its delivery capacity
in order to keep supply and demand in phase as the flexibility of older
fields, particularly Groningen, to provide necessary swing falters.
"This decline in delivery capacity could affect Gasunie's supply
commitments," says WoodMac; "indeed, without the provision of new peak
shaving facilities there is a real possibility that Gasunie would be
unable to supply sufficient gas during a severe winter from 1996."

Of the three new gas storage facilities now planned (see table), two
will be operated by Shell/Esso joint venture NAM (50% holder of
Gasunie) - one at the partly depleted Langelo/Norg gasfield in the
Drenthe concession in the north of the country, the other at the
Grijpskerk gasfield. Amoco will develop the third project at the
Alkmaar field in the Bergen concession, strategically located close to
the large industrial market in the west of the country, notes WoodMac.
The three are due to be phased in from 1997, becoming fully operational
by winter 2000/01, at which stage they should hold some 7 Bcm of gas
and provide peak delivery capacity of 184 MMcmd, the additional
capacity representing about 30% of expected peak demand for Dutch gas
in 2000. In the longer term, Alkmaar could be extended to provide 500
MMcm of storage and a maximum delivery rate of 36 MMcmd, says the
report.

In overall terms, these developments will not boost total delivery
capacity substantially over recent levels, it says. But they will in
general compensate for the declining flexibility of producing fields.
In addition, Gasunie's new export contracts incorporate a lower level
of swing than older contracts, helping relieve pressure on delivery
capacity. However, as gas to gas competition increases in Europe, a
decline in delivery flexibility could cut the competitive advantage
held by Gasunie, warns WoodMac.

The new facilities will provide a solution for the company's gas
delivery capacity problems in the short to medium term and provide
extra flexibility in the longer term at a cost of about DFL2.5bn in
money of the day (mod). Their development has allowed a delay in
installation of extensive compression facilities at Groningen.
"However, this compression, which could cost around DFL4bn (mod), is
expected to be needed around the middle of the next decade in order to
meet future supply requirements and ultimately improve the recovery
factor of the field." WoodMac also notes provision of gas storage in
the Netherlands is a new area of opportunity for upstream companies to
expand their role downstream and add value to the gas they supply.

NOW TOTAL GAS DEAL CLOSE?

Total is reported to be close to signing a deal (possibly in
partnership with Spain's Repsol) to exploit the Tin Fouye Tabankort
(TFT) field in the Algerian Sahara, southeast of Hassi R'Mel, near the
border with Libya. The field is estimated to contain 144.6 Bcm of
natural gas, 15.6m tonnes (t) of gas which can be turned into LPG, and
16.6mt of condensates. This deal would be based on the same legislation
that made BP's contract at In Salah possible (see separate story).
Since gas is considered a national asset in Algeria, it took a special
law to allow Sonatrach to go into partnership with a foreign oil
company. As soon as the BP deal was signed, Algeria's oil minister
Ammar Makhloufi said it should serve as a model for other deals.

Algeria is keen to exploit its gas, which accounts for some 95% of its
export revenues. Indeed, the country plans to increase liftings from
some 30 Bcm in 1995 to 60 Bcm by 2000. That is why contracts are being
signed. At the same time, signings are proof the recent election
victory of President Liamine Zeroual has reassured western oil
companies Algeria will enjoy a sufficient measure of political
stability.

Elsewhere, Total has announced it plans to invest some 15% of new funds
in Asia, with a view to making 20% of its operating profits in the
area. Gas will figure prominently. In particular, the natural gas
liquefaction plant at Bontang in Borneo is to be extended with a
seventh and eighth liquefaction line. The oil company also plans to get
involved in building gas-fired electricity generating stations in the
region.

QATAR IN PHILIPPINES TALKS

Qatar is considering supplying LNG to First Gas Holdings Corp (FGHC) of
the Philippines, according to FGHC officials cited by Reuters. Qatar
energy and industry minister Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah met with
corporation officials on a visit to the Philippines, it said. First Gas
is a joint venture of First Philippine Holdings and British Gas and has
been planning gas fired power generation in the Philippines.

Meanwhile, Qatar hopes to sign a $680m loan with international banks in
March for offshore facilities for the Qatar Liquefied Gas Company
(Qatargas) LNG project, the country's first, according to an energy and
industry ministry official. The loan would be a mix of buyers credit
and commercial debt, covering 70% of the offshore portion of the
project, he told Reuters. Qatargas is to sell 4m tonnes (t)/yr of LNG
to Japan's Chubu Electric over 25 years from January 1997 and another
2mt/yr to seven other Japanese power and gas utilities for 25 years
from mid-1998.

A consortium of Japan's five major shipping firms is to invest Y250bn
($2.42bn) to build 10 tankers to ship Qatari LNG to Japan, economic
daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. The five are Nippon Yusen KK,
Mitsui OSK Lines, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, lino Kaiun Kaisha and Showa
Line. The tankers will ship 6mt/yr starting in 1997.

FIRMS PLAN AMMONIA PRODUCTION

Mozambique's state owned National Hydrocarbons Company has signed an
agreement with Canada's Scimitar Production and Zarara Petroleum
Resources of the United Arab Emirates to build an ammonia production
plant targeted at exports to Zimbabwe by end-1997, according to Maputo
daily Noticias. It quoted Mozambique deputy energy and mineral
resources minister Castigo Langa as saying the Zimbabwean market was
guaranteed and work would start "very soon".

The plant, expected to produce 100 tonnes/day of ammonia for export to
Zimbabwe, will use natural gas reserves in Buzi district southwest of
port city Beira. A pipeline will also be built from Buzi to Beira where
gas will generate electricity for the city. Zarara's Shukri Saleh
cautioned, however, that known Buzi gas reserves would support ammonia
production for only eight years. He urged Mozambique to start searching
for other gas reserves believed to exist in the area.

Mozambique towards end-1995 separately signed an agreement with Enron
Corp of the US for development of its Pande gasfield, targeted at
feeding markets in South Africa via a 1,300 km pipeline. Customers have
yet to be lined up.

SOUTH AFRICA GROUP EYES MOSSGAS

South African chemical and synthetic fuel firms Sasol Ltd, AECI Ltd and
Sentrachem Ltd have set up a group to talk with the South African
government about buying the financially troubled Mossgas oil-from-
natural gas plant. The Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs lately
decided to seek a buyer (IGR 289/20). Mossgas has said that unless the
complex is sold it will have to be mothballed when current gas supplies
are finished in 1997 or new offshore fields must be exploited.

The government believes the $3bn plant could be sold for about $675m,
then turned into an oil refinery or a methanol producer. A recently
finished study found methanol production from it was feasible at
internationally competitive prices. The bidding group reckons its
methanol route would require only 25% of the gas needed to make
synthetic fuels.

MORE GAS SET FOR PETCHEMS

Egypt is prepared to supply more gas to Israel for use as a
petrochemical feedstock but the exact amount will depend on needs.
Potential customers had until end-December to provide the Israeli
energy ministry with estimates of their demand, following meetings
between Israeli and Egyptian officials. Earlier last year Israeli
energy minister Gonen Segev said he had received official confirmation
from Egyptian General Petroleum Corp, Agip and Amoco on supply of 2.5
Bcm/yr of Egyptian gas for 20 years (see also separate story). At that
time he said up to a fifth of the gas would be used for petrochemicals,
mainly ammonia. Israel has long been pressing for a supply of natural
gas from Egypt, notably for production of electricity. For some years
it has received a modest regular supply of Egyptian oil.

United Meridian Corp (UMC) has sunk an eighth consecutive successful

and two Pathere field gas wells on stream, the company anticipates
production of 20,000 b/d of oil and 24 MMcfd of gas at start-1996. The
B-3 well followed recently successful sixth and seventh holes (IGR
283/12).  The new wildcat flowed 5,970 b/d of oil and 4.6 MMcfd of gas
through a 56/64-inch choke from 63 net ft of gas pay and 169 ft of net
oil pay in a new fault block over a total depth of 10,419 ft. B-3 also
confirmed the presence of Senonian gas sands 4,000 ft southeast of the
B-1 Lion discovery well.

MAGHREB LINE WINS NEW CREDITS

The Maghreb-Europe natural gas pipeline from Algeria to Spain and
Portugal won two new credit lines before the New Year. First the
European Investment Bank conceded a Pta22.2bn ($187m) credit to Spain's
industrial gas operator Enagas to help finance the section that will
run from Tarifa on the southern coast into Portugal. Then Spain's
Instituto de Credito Offical (ICO) agreed a $200m credit to help
finance the section of the pipeline being built in Morocco. Enagas, 91%
owned by Gas Natural, is financing the Spanish section which will run
from Tarifa via Cordoba to Portugal through the Spanish regions of
Andalucia and Extremadura.

The guarantors of the loan are the Grupo Gas Natural, the European
Investment Fund and a banking syndicate. The Spanish stretch of the
pipeline will cost $400m of the total amount of $2.6bn The ICO credit
for Europe Maghreb Pipeline Ltd, jointly owned by Portugal's public
company Transgas and Spain's Sagane, will help finance the 540 km
section that runs from the Algeria-Morocco border to Moroccan
international water limits in the Strait of Gibraltar.

Meanwhile, oil, gas and chemical conglomerate Repsol - which owns 45.3%
of Gas Natural - has agreed to change the route of a local pipeline
which is to link two gasfields in the southwest province of Huelva to
the national network. The line would have passed through the Donana
national park, one of Europe's most important wetlands for migratory
birds. Repsol's announcement, which will mean extending the line by
nearly 30 km, followed protests from the park authorities and
ecologists.

PRICE HITCH FOR PIPELINE PLANS

Much trumpeted plans to pipe Qatar and Iran gas to Pakistan have run
into further trouble with the two countries demanding a higher price
for gas they plan to supply to Pakistan. This obstacle has been created
in the early stages of the project, sources close to the Pakistani
government said. An official of the petroleum and natural resources
ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said both Iran and Qatar
had come up with new demands for the gas price and expressed their
inability to sell at the previously agreed tariff. He said negotiations
between the three countries were, however, continuing.

Chaudrhy Nisar Ali Khan, former minister of petroleum and natural
resources in the government of Nawaz Sharif, said the Bhutto
administration had signed agreements for supply of gas from Iran, Qatar
and Turkmenistan which provided for completion of feasibility studies
in 12 months. But three months had elapsed and they were still not
complete. The question of gas tariff had also been sorted out at that
time but the government had allowed it to become an issue, he claimed.
Sources close to the government said that besides the question of gas
tariff, there were other issues hampering implementation of memoranda
of understanding Pakistan signed with Iran and Qatar. However, they
declined to discuss them.

TWO BIDS FOR PAK-IRAN LINE

The Pakistani government has so far received two bids from
multinational oil companies for construction of the planned 1,700 km
Pak-Iran gas pipeline project for import of 1.6 Bcfd of gas from Iran.
The companies bidding include a consortium of four firms comprising
British Gas, Gaz de France, Shell International and Calgery of
Malaysia. The other bidder is Australia's BHP. Industry sources said
last date for submission of bids with proposals for import of gas from
Iran to Pakistan was 30 November, but on the request of bidders the
date was extended to 12 December, as they were busy finalising issues
among themselves.

Sources in the petroleum and natural resources ministry said BHP
submitted its bid on schedule - 30 November. Initially, the government
had issued letters of intent to six companies including Canada's Nova
Gas in September but that company pulled out of the project, while most
of the rest of the firms decided to establish a consortium. The
proposed Pak-Iran gas pipeline project would import 1.6 Bcfd of natural
gas at an estimated cost of $3.5bn. The 1,700 km pipeline is expected
to be completed by 2002.

Industry sources said bids would be opened in mid-January. The
successful company would be asked to start construction of the pipeline
by June 1996. The firm would also be responsible for operation and
maintenance and the project would be based on a build-own-operate
basis. The agreement package would include purchase of gas from Iran
and its delivery to Pakistan at an agreed point at a price consistent
with the price offered by other gas exporters such as Qatar and
Turkmenistan.

The Bhutto government is negotiating with Turkmenistan and Qatar for
import of a similar quantity of gas to meet growing demand in the
country. Discussion with the Turkmenistan government is in early
stages, industry sources said. But negotiations with Qatar authorities
have been delayed for more than a year due reportedly to a dispute
between the Qatari government and sponsor of the gas pipeline project,
Crescent Petroleum Co, which would be responsible for importing gas to
Pakistan, over the price for gas it will pay Qatar.

QATAR/TURKEY LNG DEAL 'CLOSE'

Qatar and Turkey will shortly sign a deal for a sales and purchase
agreement (SPA) on supply of 2m tonnes (t)/yr of Qatari LNG to Ankara,
according to a Qatari official. "We believe we can come to an
understanding shortly on 2m tonnes later," Jaber Al Marri, vice
chairman of state-owned Qatar General Petroleum Corp (QGPC) said. QGPC
and its joint venture partner Mobil Corp signed a preliminary
memorandum of understanding with Turkish pipeline company Botas in
January under which Turkey would buy an initial 2mt of Qatari LNG for

EGYPT-ISRAEL ACCORD FLAGGED

A letter of intent vis a vis planned supplies of Egyptian gas to Israel
is likely to be signed this coming week, according to Israeli sources.
The document will define "late 1996 or early 1997" as deadline for
negotiations but will not refer to prices or quantities. Sources also
say Israel has virtually completed assessments of its gas needs, having
completed a survey of major potential consumers. Meanwhile, there has
been growing activity in Israel by groups interested in the project. On
18 December Israel's largest private fuel company Paz, announced a
cooperation agreement with Amoco, one of the companies with gasfields
in Egypt slated for the Israeli market. Paz is two-thirds owned by the
Liberman-Bino group and one third by Renaissance-Claridge and others.

Apart from being the largest gasoline retailer, it holds 35% of the
country's total LPG market and 40% of the residential LPG market
(600,00 households). Amoco's Cairo-based vice president (Mideast
natural gas) Tony Barrett said Paz and Amoco had "been exploring
opportunities in various segments of the natural gas industry -
including transmission, storage and distribution to the end markets".
Energy minister Gonen Segev has ruled out the possibility of any group
controlling both transmission and distribution of the gas, so the new
consortium will have to choose in which area it wishes to compete.

Paz board chairman Mordechai Ben Shach described Amoco's approach to
the gas project as "vertical" but added "we are waiting for a decision
by the state. Whatever tender we decide to bid for, the partnership
will be on a basis of equality, both regarding ownership and
investment". The Paz-Amoco deal caught most energy observers by
surprise as Amoco was expected to team up with a big company consortium
comprising the Mashav, Delek and Dankner groups with whom it had been
negotiating for more than a year.

However, leading Israeli business daily Globes reported subsequently
that - despite the Amoco-Paz deal-the consortium was still negotiating
with Amoco about involvement in setting up gas-fired power stations in
the region. And two days after the Paz-Amoco announcement, Enron's
executive in charge of negotiating an LNG deal with Israel, Rebecca
Mark, said the Mashav-Delek-Dankner group and Enron had a cooperation
agreement regarding import of LNG from Qatar. Together with Enron, the
consortium would invest in a $300m plant in Israel to gasify LNG.

Marks said that - for economic reasons-Enron would prefer the facility
to be located at Eilat or Aqaba rather than Ashkelon, the site
preferred by Israel's energy ministry. This would enable Jordan to
participate in the project and lower the gas price. Mark reportedly
said that "in principle" Enron preferred Eilat to Aqaba. If Aqaba was
chosen, an 8 km pipeline connection to Israel would be needed and Enron
would seek Jordanian partners for the gasification project. (Press
reports said negotiations with Enron were deadlocked because Israel
considered the price being asked for the LNG - more than $4/MMBtu - as
excessive).

Meanwhile, on 2 January Globes reported Gaz de France (GdF) was on the
verge of signing an agreement with the Mashav-Delek-Dankner group for
joint activity in the tenders relating to import of Egyptian gas. The
paper quoted unidentified energy sources as saying GdF's involvement
could be problematic because in 1994 a GdF-affiliated company,
Sofregaz, had carried out the feasibility study for the Egyptian gas
project on behalf of the Israeli energy ministry. The sources said the
issue would probably have to be decided by the government's legal
adviser. However, energy minister Segev "does not believe GdF's
participation in tenders will represent a problem", according to
Globes.

COST CUTS MAY FORCE MERGERS

Uncertainty over MTBE prices and the need to keep methanol production
costs in check (IGR 270/14) is forcing Sabic to take another look at
the structure of its industry. Now, in an attempt to cut administration
costs, the company is mulling the merger of two subsidiaries based in
al-Jubayl. If the plan goes ahead, methanol producers Ar-Razi and Ibn
Sina will merge, as will MTBE producers Ibn Zahr and Ibn Sina.

Unclear is whether Sabic intends to split Ibn Sina's methanol and MTBE
sides so as to form a single methanol producer and a single MTBE
manufacturer. Even larger cost savings should be possible if all three
firms come together. One problem facing Sabic, however, is the
ownership structure of the companies. Ar-Razi is 50% owned by a
Japanese consortium led by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical. Ibn Sina is 25%
owned by Hoechst Celanese with another 25% in the hands of Panhandle
Eastern.

Ibn Zahr is 10% owned by Neste, 10% by Ecofuel and 10% by Apicorp.
Sabic reckons it might be necessary to cut back on the foreign
shareholdings in order to effect mergers. That assumes a willingness to
co-operate on the part of the foreign partners. It also assumes Sabic
could do without the marketing expertise (and in some cases markets)
provided by those partners. Unitisation might provide the answer but
the mood in Saudi Arabia at present is not in favour of foreign
ownership in general.

SHIP CHARTER SLASHES COST

Oman LNG has scrapped plans to build dedicated LNG tankers for its
planned LNG-export scheme. That, says general manager Tony Hanna, will
cut overall costs from $6bn to $5bn. To handle the 3m tonnes/yr
intended for Korea Gas, chartered ships will be used instead. Detailed
terms for the 25-year contract are currently being negotiated, says
Hanna, but it is already decided that outside finance will be sought
for 70% of the cost. Oman LNG shareholders will put up 30% - $1.5bn -
in proportion to their holdings. That pans out at $765m from the Omani
government (51%); $510m from Shell (34%); $90m from Total (6%); $45m
each from Mitsui and Mitsubishi (3% each); $30m from Partex (2%); and
$15m from Itochu (1%).

PETRONAS DETAILS NEW LNG PLANT

Malaysia's third LNG plant, for which a deal was signed last month (IGR
289/33), will have two liquefaction trains of 3.4m tonnes (t)/yr
capacity each, boosting Malaysian LNG output to 22mt/yr. Mohamed Hassan
Marican, president and chief executive of Malaysian state oil and gas
firm Petronas, said gas from the new project was expected to be taken
up by traditional buyers Japan, South Korea and Taiwan and also new
markets like India, China and Thailand. Asia Pacific area LNG demand,
currently 56mt/yr, was forecast to rise to about 80mt/yr by 2005, he
said.

The new LNG plant at Bintulu, Sarawak will be owned 60% by Petronas and
10% each by US parented Occidental LNG (M), Japan's Nippon Oil Co,
Shell Gas BV and Sarawak state. Hassan gave no project cost but said a
guide was the 17bn ringgit ($6.7bn) investment in Malaysia's second LNG
plant. An initial deal between Petronas, Nippon and Oxy was reached in
1993 with Shell, already a major LNG player in Malaysia, invited in
later with Sarawak. The new plant will process gas from fields found by
Oxy, Petronas, Nippon and Shell offshore Sarawak.

At the same time as the LNG signing, Petronas (60%) signed a deal with
local firm Land & General Bhd and Japan's Mitsui and Co (20% each) for
a $300m, 0.4mt/yr capacity vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plant targeted
at commercial production start by late 1998. Officials said Mitsui and
Land & General would spend another $100m to set up a separate polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) plant for which VCM is a feedstock. The two plants will
be at Kertih in Trengganu state which, Hassan said, Petronas aims to
turn into SE Asia's largest petrochemicals centre. He said a
"worldscale" 0.6mt/yr ethylene plant would be built at Kertih, while an
existing ethylene facility in the area would be expanded from 0.32mt/yr
capacity to 0.4mt/yr.

TENNECO WINS GASLINE LICENCE

Australia's Queensland state said it had granted a pipeline licence to
Tenneco Energy Australia Pty Ltd, part of US Tenneco Inc, to build a
750 km, 90 petajoules/yr capacity gasline between Ballera in southwest
Queensland and Wallumbilla, near Roma. Tenneco had indicated
construction work would start immediately targeted at operation of the
line by end-September 1996, state minerals and energy minister Tony
McGrady said. Tenneco was chosen as preferred developer in late 1994.
Construction of the line would mean gas markets in southeast and
central Queensland were assured of future access to plentiful gas
supplies as existing reserves around Roma were depleted, said McGrady.
The line's capacity was over double current east coast market demand,
he added.

YACHENG GAS FEEDS HONG KONG

China on 1 January started piping natural gas from the South China Sea
Yacheng 13-1 field offshore Hainan Island to Hong Kong under a 20 year
contract to feed power generation, according to officials of state
owned China National Offshore Oil Co (CNOOC). Owned 51% by CNOOC, 34.7%
by US parented Arco China and 14.3% by Kuwait Foreign Petroleum
Exploration Corp (Kufpec), the $1.2bn Yacheng 13-1 development has
annual production capacity of 3.4 Bcm and total reserves of about 82
Bcm, according to CNOOC.

Some 2.9 Bcm/yr shipped via a 790 km gasline will feed the Hong Kong
Black Point power plant of Castle Peak Power Corp, a 50/50 joint
venture of Hong Kong's China Light and Power and Exxon Corp of the US.
The remaining 0.5 Bcm/yr will feed power and chemicals plants on Hainan
Island via another 91 km gasline. According to Xinhua news agency,
Hainan plans to invest 10bn yuan ($1.2bn) to build three synthetic
ammonia and urea plants on the island in the next five years, fed by
natural gas.

Using some 2.2 Bcm/yr these plants would, on completion produce about
0.45m tonnes (t)/yr of synthetic ammonia and 0.78mt/yr of urea, said
Xinhua. Hainan also planned to build a methanol plant of 1mt/yr
capacity, a chemical works and acetylene salt chemical works. Annual
natural gas output in the area round Hainan was expected to reach some
10 Bcm by end-century and 21 Bcm by 2007, it said.

DABHOL D-DAY LOOMS - AGAIN

The fate of the Dabhol power generation project is likely to be decided
on 6 January. Maharashtra Chief Minister Manohar Joshi says a special
meeting of the state cabinet has been called that day to consider the
matter. Later, as IGR went to press, local reports quoted an unnamed
state minister as saying a revised deal had been approved by the state
and announcement was a formality. The state government has been pushed
into a decision before 15 January when arbitration proceedings at the
behest of the US project promoters Enron, Bechtel and GE are scheduled
to resume in London. The promoters had earlier agreed to postponement
of the proceedings until 10 December, the deadline set by Joshi for
decisive action (IGR 289/4).

But the opinion of senior state government officials to seek more
capital cost and tariff cuts than agreed with an experts committee
compelled him to pursue an apparently tough negotiating line. Extra
mileage gained in the negotiations can also yield electoral dividends
to the ruling Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party coalition which is keen
to rake up the corruption issue in coming elections against the main
rival Congress party whose government approved the Dabhol deal.

Sources say a compromise has been reached after Enron Development Corp
president Joseph Sutton conveyed to Joshi in late December that it
would not yield further on cost and tariff cuts. This provides for a
marginal reduction of tariff from the Rs1.89 ($0.054) levelised tariff
agreed earlier with the experts negotiating group. In return,
Maharashtra State Electricity Board will agree to lift power at more
than the 90% Plant Load Factor mentioned in the original Power Purchase
Agreement. This arrangement will keep intact the internal rate for
Dabhol Power Co.

natural gas in Agra and Ferozabad towns of northern state Uttar
Pradesh. GAIL and the private sector promoters are to hold 26% stakes
each in the 2:1 debt-equity venture, estimated to cost Rs650m
($18.57m), with the balance of 48% equity to be subscribed by the state
government, local bodies and the public. The project is part of a 10-
point programme to reduce atmospheric pollution in the Taj Trapezium
area. GAIL says it will provide pipelines to city gate stations at the
outskirts of Agra and Ferozabad and the joint venture will further
distribute the gas to industrial units. The government has allocated
0.6 MMcmd of gas for distribution in the two towns.

UNION TEXAS/OXY IN LPG PLAN

Two US oil firms - Union Texas and Occidental Energy Venture Corp -
will set up an LPG extraction plant with a production capacity of
130,000 tonnes (t)/yr and a 132 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant
at Badin, Sindh province. Total estimated cost of the two projects will
be $180m. A delegation of representatives of the two companies met
petroleum and natural resources minister Anwar Saifullah Khan in
Islamabad recently and said the proposed project would be based on
indigenous petroleum streams from the Badin Petroleum Concession block
awarded to Union Texas recently.

Saifullah said the Bhutto government would provide all possible
assistance for completion of the two projects. He asked the joint
venture delegation to ensure local private sector involvement in the
scheme as it would provide an opportunity to Pakistan's private sector
to learn technical know-how as well as encourage it to invest in the
petroleum sector.

PAKISTAN SET FOR NEW ROUND

Pakistan will shortly invite a second round of bidding for offshore oil
and natural gas projects, a petroleum and natural resources ministry
announcement said. "We hope to attract investments worth $9bn in oil
and gas exploration, $4.5bn in domestic pipelines and $6bn in refinery
facilities to cope with growing energy demand over the next 30 years,"
it added. The announcement further said international companies would
be invited to conferences in Houston and London in April to bid for
offshore oil and gas exploration in Pakistan. Preliminary response from
firms had been encouraging, it said.

FIELD NARROWS FOR $700M PROJECT

Nineteen out of 34 international consortia vying for the $700m natural
gas utilisation scheme in Burma have made it to the shortlist of the
Rangoon regime. The list includes seven Japanese heavyweights like
Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, a South Korean league of Daewoo, Hyundai
and Samsung, and groups consisting of Total and Unocal, Bechtel, Norsk
Hydro, British Gas as well as the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
and the Thai giant conglomerate Charoen Pokphand, according to sources
participating in the tender.

The bid calls for the rights to engage in the so-called "three-in-one"
project to utilise natural gas from Burma's known largest gasfield
Yadana, some 320 km south of Rangoon in the Gulf of Matarban. The
scheme involves construction of a 200 MW gas-fired power plant, a
570,000 tonnes (t)/yr urea fertiliser plant and a 250 km gasline to
transport Yadana gas ashore to the project site near the Burmese
capital.

Rangoon authorities have indicated to bidders they would be able to
announce a final decision on the choice of bidders in late January or
early February 1996. Due to magnitude of the scheme, the Burmese
government is expected to pick as many as five companies to undertake
work, rather than awarding the entire contract to just one company.

Industry sources clarified that Mitsui remains one of the contenders
though it may have provided some feasibility studies for the scheme to
Slorc last year (IGR 282/17). The three-in-one project will be based on
the 125 MMcfd of Yadana gas supply which the field production sharing
contractors including Total, Unocal Corp and PTT Exploration &
Production Plc (PTTEP) of Thailand will deliver to Rangoon under an
accord signed in February 1995 (IGR 269/21).

The majority of Yadana gas supply will be piped to Thailand under a 30-
year export contract concluded last February. The deal is for delivery
of 525 MMcfd of Yadana gas which will be used primarily for power
generation in Thailand. Yadana gas production is scheduled to start in
mid-1998.

UNIQUE/MITSUI CHASE MARKETS

Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Plc of Thailand and Japan's Mitsui & Co
will use their first joint venture on LPG and ammonia marketing in
Vietnam to spearhead into a wider range of energy-related businesses in
this socialist state. This strategic plan was outlined by senior
executives of the two firms specifically in a bid to capitalise on
extensive market opportunities in the country of 73m people.

That conforms with Unique Gas' target to expand its businesses in this
region and diversify its business lines beyond LPG and ammonia to
include other speciality gas, chemical and other products to become one
of Southeast Asia's leading chemical and energy concerns. Earlier last
year, Unique Gas formed a joint venture with Malaysia's state oil firm
Petronas to develop a network of service stations in Thailand offering
a full range of petroleum products under the Petronas brand name.

For Mitsui, the joint venture with Unique Gas in Vietnam forms an
integral part of its expansion of its businesses there where it has
been active in marketing fertiliser, among other areas. Unique Gas and
Petrochemicals (Vietnam) Co, equally owned by Unique Gas and Mitsui
group, early in December opened its $5.02m LPG and anhydrous ammonia
terminal in Long Thanh district of Dong Nai province, about 70 km south
of Ho Chi Minh City.

The terminal serves as platform for the joint venture to launch its LPG
and ammonia marketing in Vietnam where demand for those products is
expanding dramatically. Unique Gas president Phaibul Chalermsaphayakorn
and Mitsui & Co (Thailand)'s Hiroyuki Maruko said they were convinced
about "bright" economic growth potential.

Maruko said Unique Gas and Mitsui would broaden product lines in
Vietnam to include products like fuel oil in the near future. However,
execution of such a project was very much subject to Vietnamese
authorities' approval, a difficult and time consuming process, he said.
In spite of that, Mitsui, on its own part, will start looking into the
viability of setting up what would be the first LPG cylinder production
plant in Vietnam.

It has also been eyeing opportunities for establishing a natural gas
separation plant in Vietnam to process indigenous natural gas produced
from oil and gas fields off the country's southern coast, he added. For
Unique Gas, Phaibul noted the company has been assessing the
possibilities of establishing businesses including LPG distribution in
neighbouring countries, particularly Burma.

Established n 1982, Unique Gas has been active in distribution of LPG
and ammonia in Thailand. Vietnam is the first foreign country where
Unique Gas has an investment. The Unique Gas and Mitsui alliance in
Vietnam has had a firm plan to enlarge its operations in the country in
line with the expected dramatic jump in consumption of LPG. Phaibul
announced the joint venture plans to inject some $2m in additional
capital to boost the LPG storage capacity of its Long Thanh terminal
from the current level of 400 tons by 200 tons in February 1996 and
another 400 tons in 1997, so that at end-1997 combined capacity will be
1,000 tons.

Unique Gas Vietnam targets industrial users, especially those located
in Go Dau industrial zone where its terminal is situated, as its main
clientele for LPG, accounting for roughly 60% of its expected sales
volume of some 6,000 tons in 1996. The remaining 40% would be sales to
residential and commercial sectors in the form of cylinders. Unique Gas
Vietnam general director John Lu said total LPG and ammonia demand in
Vietnam was expected to more than double by 2000 and the company hoped
to grow with the market.

An industry estimate puts present LPG demand in Vietnam in the range of
4,000-5,000 tons a month. The Thai-Japanese joint venture expects to
capture a 10-15% share in Vietnam's LPG market currently dominated by
local suppliers like Saigon Petro, Elf Gas and Petrolimex - all with
local government participation.

Initial LPG supplies to Unique Gas Vietnam are from Thailand, Malaysia
and Indonesia. There is no local production of LPG in Vietnam. Unique
Gas Vietnam is the first wholly-owned foreign venture in LPG and
ammonia business to be licensed by the Vietnamese authorities. The
company's terminal covers an area of 111,000 sq metres; only a fraction
has been utilised. In Thailand, Unique Gas operates two LPG/ammonia
terminals in Bang Pakong and Surat Thani, two LPG tankers, 55 LPG road
tank trucks and 63 LPG bottling plants.

PTT MULLS HIGHER BURMA TAKE

Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) is considering raising its
purchase of natural gas from Burma's offshore Yadana field by 200-300
MMcfd over agreed contractual levels. PTT governor Pala Sookawesh spoke
of the possibility since the Yadana field developing group expects
higher gas productivity from the field and in light of additional gas
demand spurred by private power plant operators in Thailand under the
independent power producer (IPP) and small power producer (SPP)
programmes. He said recent information obtained from Yadana operator
Total indicated the field, some 320 km south of Rangoon in the Gulf of
Matarban, could prove additional gas reserves and deliverability.

According to PTT, Yadana's present certified recoverable gas reserves
are put at 5.7 Tcf. The 30-year contract PTT concluded with the Yadana
developing group in February 1995 calls for initial gas delivery of 141
MMcfd in mid-1998 before building up to 525 MMcfd 14 months later (IGR
268/16). Total executives have said earlier that Yadana is quite
productive and does not require Total to drill as many wells as
expected. Only some 10-15 wells would be needed in the initial stage to
achieve the contractual production level of some 500 MMcfd (IGR
270/18). Meanwhile, Pala said he had received assurance from parties
concerned that production and delivery of Yadana gas to PTT would start
within the contractual date.

Lately, Burmese ministers have also assured the PTT governor the
problem of most concern to PTT and the Yadana developing group - laying
of part of the gasline over areas in southeastern Burma where ethnic
Karen and Mon guerrillas have been waging war against the Rangoon
forces - would no longer pose a threat. They reportedly said the
southern part of the area holding most of the onshore section to the
Thai western province of Kanchanaburi was now controlled by ethnic Mons
allied with the Rangoon regime. The only problem at the border was the
minority Christian Karens who still dominated the area north of the
gasline route, though their Bhuddist faction had defected to the
government's Slorc. Pala said work related to the Yadana gas project on
the Burmese side, including the $1bn field development and the 300-plus
km off/onshore gasline was well under way.

CAMBODIA MULLS PTT MODEL

Cambodia has started considering establishment of a state oil firm to
manage its indigenous petroleum resources, particularly offshore
natural gas, which could be discovered and developed in future. Pou
Sotirak, Cambodian industry, mines and energy minister, said the
government had accepted it was the right time for the country to have a
"national" oil firm, possibly similar to those created in neighbouring
Asean states such as the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT). He
indicated the starting point would be when the country discovered
"practical" size resources, perhaps of Thailand's scale. "If we don't
have any reserves, then there is no need for a national oil company,"
he added.

Sotirak said he was "still thinking very hard" about the role of the
proposed national oil body. But generally Cambodia wanted to optimise
its economic exploitation of natural gas and petroleum, if it had any.
"It must serve the benefits of the public and the government." He said
he had asked PTT governor Pala Sookawesh if PTT could "teach a few
tricks" on establishing a national oil firm and developing personnel to
run the organisation.

"Right now we are still searching for petroleum (offshore); if we
discovered something I have to quickly visit Mr Pala to learn to
establish a national oil firm," he added. Cambodia has high hopes of
finding substantial natural gas reserves at locations near the so-
called overlapping areas of Thai-Cambodian territorial claims in the
Gulf of Thailand, given the fact Unocal Thailand has been producing gas
and condensate from the general area. Bangkok and Phnom Penh are still
unable to resolve their disputes over the offshore territorial claims,
said to be highly gas prospective.

Phnom Penh has mooted the idea that Thailand and Cambodia adopt a
"Joint Development Area (JDA)", as Thailand Malaysia have done, in
resolving the disputes in the southernmost part of the Gulf of
Thailand. Thailand has not accepted this, insisting on its claims on
the overlapping tract covering tens of thousands of square kilometres
(IGR 285/21).

HONDO WARNS GASLINE IN DOUBT

Hondo Oil & Gas Co this week warned completion of a Colombian natural
gas pipeline it plans with Amoco of the US is now in doubt because of
changes in Colombian regulations on pipeline tariffs and natural gas
prices. It also said the planned Opon 5 development well in the country
had been delayed indefinitely because of right of way disputes with
landowners. Hondo cited adoption of new regulations by recently formed
government agency Comision de Regulacion de Energia y Gas, part of the
mines and energy ministry.

It said the regulations set a ceiling price for natural gas and a
maximum 12.5% rate of return (before Colombian taxes) for pipeline
tariffs. The ceiling had been interpreted to include costs or fees for
natural gas processing, so that process costs could not be passed on to
buyers. "These new regulations will reduce the amount the company
expects to receive for natural gas and pipeline tariffs in the future,"
said a Hondo statement.

Earlier, Hondo said the new regulations affected terms agreed in a
memorandum of understanding announced last summer with Colombian state
oil and gas firm Ecopetrol for construction of an 88 km pipeline from
the Opon Association Contract (OPC) area to Ecopetrol's refinery at
Barancabermeja. This called for recovery of pipeline investment via a
tariff. Negotiations were continuing with Ecopetrol on relief from the
regulations' effects and meantime pipeline work was continuing, said
Hondo. Plans for 1996 OPC area exploration and development projects
would be reconsidered during the first quarter.

NEB DETAILS EXPORTS IMPACT

Total volumes of Canadian gas to be exported under long term contracts
up to 2014 represent 11% of remaining and undiscovered western Canada
reserves, according to the National Energy Board (NEB). Known and yet
to be found reserves totalled an estimated 164 Tcf at 1 November 1995
of which 63 Tcf was remaining reserves and 101 Tcf undiscovered, said
the board. Authorised volumes under long term contract totalled 18.2
Tcf. The volume did not include licences for gas exports from the
Mackenzie Delta totalling 9.2 Tcf. NEB said volumes authorised for long
term export to the USA included 40% to the northeast, 32% to the
midwest, 15% to California and 13% to the Pacific northwest.

HANSON SELLS SUBURBAN PROPANE

Industrial conglomerate Hanson has announced plans to sell a majority
equity stake in Suburban Propane, third biggest retail propane
distributor in the USA, through a public offer. Hanson expects to raise
about #500m ($776.3m) through the offer and a related debt issue. The
public offer will represent about 62% of equity in a new 'master
limited partnership' dubbed Suburban Propane Partners LP. Suburban will
also issue $425m of senior debt maturing in 2002-2011. Hanson will keep
an approximate 38% combined subordinated and general partnership
interest in the new MLP, it said.

The structure would enhance Suburban's ability to expand by using
partnership units to acquire other propane distributors. Suburban is
third largest retail and wholesale distributor of propane gas in the US
for residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural uses. Its
retail operations are run through 353 sales and service centres serving
nearly 0.8m customers in 39 states. Suburban has about 6% of the US
retail propane market, said Hanson. A substantial slice of net proceeds
from the unit offering and debt issue would be used to make payments to
Hanson subsidiaries.

FLYING START FOR MARITIMES LINE

A recent open season for Phase I of the planned Maritimes & Northeast
Pipeline project resulted in nominations for over 410 MMcfd of natural
gas transportation services, according to lSource Development Co, a
unit of Panhandle Eastern Corp, one of the line sponsors, early last
month. With announced initial capacity on Phase I just 60 MMcfd,
nominations far exceeded expectations, said 1Source. Phase 1, due to
start transportation services in 1997, comprises 63 miles of 24-inch
gasline linking Dracut, Massachusetts with Wells, Maine. Other sponsors
of the project to market natural gas from the Sable Island area
offshore Nova Scotia are Westcoast Energy Inc, Mobil Corp, Shell Canada
and Eastern Enterprises.

1Source said the open season response demonstrated the strong demand
for natural gas service in Maine and New Hampshire and the variety of
shippers nominating was evidence of a rapidly emerging, competitive
natgas marketplace there. "This is good news for the Maritimes &
Northeast project as a whole since Phase I is the project's gateway to
major markets in the eastern United States," said lSource. For Phase I
sponsors will now look to seal binding precedent agreements with future
Maritimes & Northeast customers, with federal approval to proceed
expected to be sought this month.

1Source said sponsors were keen to move ahead on Phase II for which it
expected the response in Maine and the Maritimes to be as encouraging.
The overall project will eventually involve construction of a 630 mile
underground pipeline crossing areas in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick in
Canada, Maine and New Hampshire before interconnecting with the North
American pipe grid in Massachusetts. Scheduled pipeline capacity is 400
MMcfd with service due to start in November 1999. Sable Offshore Energy
Project companies are Mobil, Shell Canada, Petro-Canada Inc, Imperial
Oil and Nova Scotia Resources Inc. They aim to tap about 3 Tcf of
recoverable natural gas from six fields in the Sable Island area.

CORPOVEN PLANS NGLS LEAP

State owned PDVSA unit Corpoven says it plans to boost natural gas
liquids (NGLs) output by some 160% over the next 10 years with output
expected to reach 6.22 Bcf in 2005 from 2.36 Bcf currently. It said the
forecast was based on "large proven reserves of natural gas" in
Venezuela totalling 138 Tcf of which Corpoven held 62%. The company
planned to invest 262bn bolivars ($771.6m) in various projects to boost
NGLs output. Main project was the Eastern Cryogenic Complex, or Accro,
in eastern Monagas state.

Its latest component, a $300m cryogenic plant, was inaugurated at Santa
Barbara last November. Third and final phase is due complete in 2004.
Accro output was expected to reach 290,000 b/d of NGLs by 2005 against
82,000 b/d now. Up to 30% of Venezuelan gas liquids are exported,
mainly to the USA. Corpoven estimates market capacity in the Americas
at about 150,000 b/d.

SHV CALOR EXPANDS IN BRAZIL

The international LPG joint venture of Calor Group of the UK and Dutch
SHV Energy is spending $62m for a 49% stake (with 50% voting rights) in
Supergasbras Distribuidora de Gas, Brazil's fourth largest LPG
distributor. The two partners in SHV Calor Brasil are investing $31m
each. The deal follows acquisition last August of a majority stake in
Minasgas, Brazil's fifth largest bottled gas supplier. Calor said the
two firms would be operated as separate companies but it would
encourage the rival suppliers to make cooperation arrangements for the
future. The two supply a combined total of 1.35m tonnes/yr of LPG to
over 40m people.

Last summer Calor unveiled plans to spend about #70m ($108.7m) on
projects in Asia and Latin America, in conjunction with SHV which has a
controlling stake in Calor, seeking to reduce its dependence on the UK
LPG market. Calor financial controller John Taylor this week said the
group had about #40m to spend on other projects, mostly in Asia.

CPUC SEEKS POWER COMPETITION

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is back in the
precedent-setting business with a late December move to bring
competition to all electric power sales in the Golden State. The broad
deregulation plan, a refinement and stretch-out of the pioneering free-
market initiative launched by the commission last April, will affect
virtually every aspect of the $20bn California electricity market. In
the process, it may be the beginning of the end for CPUC itself, at
least as presently constituted. And, like so many other things
Californian, it is likely to serve as a bellwether for other state
commissions seeking a roadmap to successful deregulation of their own
electric utilities.

For gas interests, the CPUC move is expected to result, at least
eventually, in a further proliferation of small-scale, independent
power production facilities, most of which are likely to be fired by
natural gas. "Market mechanisms", said CPUC, will be used "to minimise
transition costs [and] utilities will be allowed the opportunity for
full recovery of the transition costs associated with existing power
contracts and prior regulatory commitments".

The commission added it would also permit "accelerated recovery of net
book value of undepreciated assets combined with a reduced cost of
capital". However, the new plan was approved on a sharply divided 3-2
vote of the commissioners, signalling lengthy fights before
deregulation in California becomes a fait accompli. And the plan must
receive concurrence from California Governor Pete Wilson and from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc).

Timing of the transition to open markets remains ambitious:
deregulation would begin in less than two years, on 1 January 1998,
continuing through the first day of 2003 when power markets would
become completely open. In a repeat of part of its original proposal
that resulted in extensive criticism from various energy industry
sectors, the new CPUC plan includes preferences for "renewable" fuels
and penalties for failure to achieve minimum purchase requirements for
power generated using environmentally benign technologies.

The new regulatory regime would also use "performance-based" criteria
to spur operational efficiency at the state's utilities. CPUC said it
would strive during first-quarter 1996 to achieve a "California
Consensus" among state and local officials and electricity customers.
The commission pledged to submit the envisaged consensus to Ferc in
what it termed "a spirit of cooperative federalism", and what cynics
suggested was an end run to co-opt the Washington regulators.

Rather than phasing the deregulation plan in by customer classes, the
new CPUC plan would select a "representative" group from all customers
for participation in the first phase two years hence. That initial move
into uncharted waters would last just one year, during which selected
customers could shop around among electricity providers for the best
deals. After that, full open market conditions would be implemented.

State regulation of rates and services would continue in instances
where true competition did not occur, said CPUC, although traditional
cost-of-service standards would be supplanted by overall performance
criteria. In the CPUC view, that would lead to increased profit
potential for the most efficient producers and investor penalties for
those who failed to cut costs sufficiently.

To assure open transmission access for all power producers, the CPUC
system would establish an "independent system operator" (ISO) to assume
control of utility-owned transmission assets and manage the use of
those resources. The ISO would also be responsible for assuring
adequate power supplies and reliability of transmission facilities, as
well as fixing any problems that develop. In short, major utilities
could continue to own transmission properties but could not operate
them independently of the ISO.

In an element likely to be among its most controversial, the CPUC plan
would require California's Big Three electric utilities - Pacific Gas
and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and
Electric - to divest half their fossil-fired generation facilities if
they wish to avoid "market power" accusations. Another "politically
correct" aspect of the CPUC decision would require a "public goods
charge" on retail electricity sales, with proceeds to be used to fund
energy conservation and efficiency initiatives "not provided by the
competitive market that are in the broader public interest".

CPUC also mandated that electric rates include a "competition
transition charge" that could not be bypassed in sales transactions.
That charge would be collected from all power consumers, whether they
receive conventional bundled service from utilities or buy power
directly from independent producers. As the dust began to settle on the
CPUC announcement, gas industry analysts were hedging their bets on
exactly what the impact might be on gas use.

However, most observers concurred that if the plan is endorsed by the
governor and by Ferc, the increased access of independent generators
would inevitably favour greater gas use in California. If other states
choose to copy California once more, the consensus is that gas use for
power generation could increase substantially, with few observers
willing to speculate on precise growth figures.

COLD SPARKS PRICE SPIKE

Abnormally cold weather in the eastern half of the US, combined with a
perception among traders that gas storage inventories are declining
rapidly enough to raise questions about sufficiency of gas supplies
through the 31 March end of the winter heating season, produced an
unprecedented upward spike in gas futures prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange during the week before Christmas, with high prices
for the January futures contract climbing close to $4/MMBtu in daily
trading before settling back into the $3.00 range for the week.

The abrupt jump also marked the highest gas futures prices on the Nymex
since trading in those instruments began. As the New Year's holiday
weekend began, gas futures contracts were trading back in the $2.50
range. Traders appeared more worried this season about the "early" cold
snaps that have occurred in the eastern US. While periods of
exceptionally cold weather in the last several years have often been
colder and more prolonged than those in recent days, they occurred
closer to the end of the winter season, when concerns about the season-
long adequacy of gas supplies were less severe.

Questions along the lines of "can we make it until April?" have
occurred with increasing frequency. For the week ending 22 December,
the American Gas Association reported gas in storage totalled 2,257
Bcf, or 70% "full". For the same reporting period last year, storage
volumes were nearly 400 Bcf higher, and inventories stood at 83% full.
Spot wellhead gas prices rose by 25 cents/MMBtu to $2.30 during the
week before Christmas, closing at 83 cents more than the year-earlier
week. For the week between Christmas and New Year, prices rose another
29 cents to $2.59, closing at $1.15/MMBtu above the year-end week of
1994. Meanwhile, figures for average spot wellhead prices for full year
1995 came out at $1.45/MMBtu.

The dramatic increases in gas futures prices during the year's last
fortnight gave rise to a formal complaint filed by an ad-hoc group
calling itself "the Nymex floor members", seeking an investigation by
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission into the volatile fluctuations
in gas futures contract prices just before the end of the year. The
leap of 94.4 cents/MMBtu registered by the January gas futures contract
between 18 December and the closing of the January contract on 21
December brought the contract price to $3.448/MMBtu, a record for the
contract. Representatives of Nymex insisted the price volatility was a
natural result of exceptionally strong gas demand, rather than any
mismanagement or wrongdoing on the part of the exchange or individual
traders.

NEW PIPE TALLY 8,000 MILES

More than 8,000 miles of new US natural gas transmission line or
pipeline looping have been built, are under construction or are
proposed, according to the American Gas Association (AGA) in its latest
annual report on new construction. Additionally, AGA lists 47 proposed
natural gas storage projects in various stages of development to add
more than 500 Bcf of working gas storage capacity and, if built,
increase total US working gas storage capacity by nearly 20%.

Through 1993 and 1994, more than $9bn of new gas pipeline construction
projects were in various stages of development. AGA classifies these
projects as either built in 1993 or 1994 and operational, or currently
under construction, proposed and pending. In aggregate, the projects
total 8,087 miles of new line and looping, 1,098,940 hp of additional
compression, and 15.3 Bcfd of additional capacity. The existing US gas
transmission network consists of more than 2,984,500 miles of line and
more than 14m hp of compression with a total book value of nearly
$54bn.

ENGINE IN SCHOOL BUS EXAM

Engineers at South-western Research Institute, San Antonio are
developing an electronically controlled natural gas engine for school
and commercial buses. Based on an existing PowerTech Deere natural gas
engine, it is part of an Energy Department-funded project to build safe
school buses powered by natural gas. The modified 8.1 litre engine has
electronic fuel injection, an electronic drive-by-wire throttle
actuator, an electronically controlled wastegate and a direct-fire,
coil-on-plug ignition system.

So far, it is said to have demonstrated low emission levels with better
performance and fuel efficiency than any heavy-duty, natural gas engine
commercially available. Deere plans to produce a commercial version of
this engine this year. The engine is currently undergoing lean-misfire
and knock-limit tests to determine operating limits. Researchers are
also identifying the influence of various engine components on
performance and emissions with the goal of lowering nitrogen oxide
output while maintaining engine efficiency.

During the next several months, they will evaluate different control
strategies for keeping the desired air-fuel ratio, spark timing, boost
pressure and other parameters during steady-state and transient
operation. They are also developing systems for knock and misfire
detection and catalyst efficiency monitoring. Once proven, the engine
will go into a prototype, ultrasafe bus being designed by Blue Bird
Corp. Natural gas will be stored in four composite-wrapped aluminium
cylinders located within the frame rails underneath the bus which is
expected to have a range of more than 300 miles. Besides sporting a new
engine, the ultrasafe bus will be lighter weight for optimum fuel
efficiency.

ELTRON IN NEW SYNGAS R&D

Eltron Research Inc is developing a 'ceramic membrane reactor' (CMR)
technology for electrochemical conversion of humidified natural gas to
synthesis gas. In addition to the yield being up to 90% in a single
pass, the reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous and therefore
requires no externally imposed voltage. Further, it needs no external
source of pure oxygen, cutting production costs by 30-50%, says project
manager Michael Schwartz. Maintained at some 900oC, the CMR is equipped
with a tubular mixed-conducting membrane with methane held inside and
the air (for O2) outside.

The methane side of the membrane is coated with a partial-oxidation
catalyst, while the outer side contains a reduction catalyst. The high
conductivity of the membrane materials for electrons and oxygen ions
permits the reaction of oxygen with methane while preventing direct
contact between methane and oxygen. In addition, oxygen becomes
separated from atmospheric nitrogen via the membrane. Eltron is seeking
partners to build a largescale CMR prototype.

BUYERS TO HOOK INTO US SYSTEM

Late this year, Mexico's PMI Trading Co hopes to take delivery of the
first NGLs shipped through newly-formed Rio Grande Pipeline Co. The
latter is a new joint venture formed by Mid-America Pipeline, Amoco
Pipelines and Navajo Pipeline companies to link the US NGL grid to its
southern neighbour. Liquids will originate at Hobbs Station, Texas and
other points on Mid-America Pipeline's 16,000 km system to the Pemex
Gas y Petroquimica Basica Mendez terminal in Ciudad Juarez.

To achieve this, Rio Grande is buying Navajo's existing 8-inch pipeline
from Odessa, Texas to a point near El Paso. A new 8-inch line will link
this point to the Mendez terminal in Mexico. Mid-America will be
operator of the system. Volume to be moved has yet to be announced.

NEW INDIANA PLANT ON STREAM

PSI Energy and Destec Energy have begun commercial operations at their
joint venture coal gasification plant at West Terre Haute in Indiana.
The Wabash River plant has taken two years to build and will convert
2,7000 tonnes/day of high-sulphur coal - supplied from Peabody Coal's
Hawthorn mine in the state - to an ultimate 262,000 kW of electricity.
The latter will stem from PSI's existing Wabash River coal-fired plant,
being converted to a syngas-fired combined-cycle unit. Destec
technology is being used throughout. In the gasification plant, the
company claims to remove 98% of the coal's sulphur content prior to
gasification.

That seems set to be sold for use in fertiliser production. Air
pollution is said to be just a fraction of the limit set for 2000 by
the Clean Air Act. Acid rain pollutants are also said to be reduced
significantly. A further by-product is ash derived from the
gasification plant. This is converted to an inert vitrous aggregate
said to be ideal for road building. Now Destec aims to use the same
technology to use unsaleable residues from refineries as basic fuel for
gasification.

CMS BUYS PETAL STORAGE

CMS Gas Transmission and Storage Co has bought Chevron's Petal Gas
Storage Co for an undisclosed sum. As part of the sale agreement,
Chevron will continue to receive long-term storage service from Petal,
which owns a high-deliverability peak-shaving storage unit in Forrest
County, Mississippi. With a capacity of 3.2 Bcf, the salt-dome cavern
provides up to 320 MMcfd delivery for up to 10 days and can be refilled
in 20 days. At present it is connected to two interstate pipelines -
Tennessee Gas and Koch Gateway.

Access to other pipelines is being mulled by CMS, along with the
possibility of expansion. "We believe Petal's high-flexible peaking
type of service is what the market wants," says William Haener,
president at CMS Gas Transmission & Storage. The company complements
CMS' existing storage business and will allow the latter to tailor
specific services to satisfy a wide variety of customer needs, he adds.

BECHTEL LANDS LNG EPC CONTRACT

Atlantic LNG Co of Trinidad and Tobago has taken two major decisions
which will ensure it maintains its deadline for delivering LNG to its
two customers, Cabot and Enagas, by first-quarter 1999. One is choice
of the Phillips optimised cascade system, developed by Phillips
Petroleum Co, as the preferred liquefaction process for the 425 MMcfd
plant. Overseas Bechtel, one of three companies asked to submit front
end engineering design for the plant, based its proposals on the
Phillips process and has been awarded the engineering, procurement and
construction (EPC) contract.

Negotiations on an overall contract price will begin with Bechtel in
January, led by Atlantic's recently-appointed vice president for
engineering and construction, David Jamieson. Ground should be broken
for construction early in the second quarter. The other major decision
is to break that ground elsewhere than at La Brea, the site in
southwest Trinidad originally chosen for LNG, mainly on the insistence
of the last government, which wanted to develop the area.

But the abandoned wells left behind from discontinued oil and gas
operations could not be cleaned up in time and the existence of the
nearby Pitch Lake meant the area would remain inherently unstable
geologically. The LNG site has been shifted five miles further down the
southwest coast to Point Fortin, where ample reclaimed land and good
harbour facilities, which have accommodated oil tankers for decades,
are available.

The move will also help provide alternative jobs for workers made
redundant by closure of Petrotrin's Point Fortin refinery, which is
imminent because no one seems interested in buying it. Bechtel beat two
other contenders to the prize contract, likely to be worth close to
$1bn. Chiyoda Corp/Hudson Engineering had offered an LNG design based
on the Air Products and Chemicals liquefaction process and a joint
venture of MW Kellogg and JGC Corp also submitted a bid.

Atlantic believes its strategy of inviting engineering designs first
and then awarding an EPC contract was the best way to control project
costs. As David Wight, president of Amoco Trinidad, whose associate
company, Amoco Trinidad LNG, owns 34% of Atlantic, says: "We now have a
good idea of what our costs are going to be and can control them."

GASLINE PLANS 'MAKE PROGRESS'

Negotiations on the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline continue apace and
according to a consultant close to the action there has been concrete
progress "with all technical and planning aspects in place". He was
referring to the pipeline being built in two Brazilian sections, with
completion of the Corumba-Sao Paulo section before that from Sao Paulo
to Port Alegre instead of simultaneously. The pipeline diameter has
been fixed at 32 inches (instead of 28 inches) permitting a maximum
volume of 30 MMcmd rather than 16 MMcmd.

The source said: "There are no problems with existing legislation for
the pipeline to go ahead; all that is really needed is long term
distribution contracts with utilities. All the partners (Enron, YPFB,
Petrobras, British Gas, Tenneco and BHP) are basically in agreement."
Asked about the pipeline's timetable, the consultant put a dateline of
mid-1996 for all existing problems to be overcome and a "very
conservative and cautious maximum timescale for contracts for gas power
projects to be signed and capable of seeking finance by April 1997".

One major reason for cheerfulness for the companies involved in the
gasline project was a decision by Brazil's federal electricity holding
Eletrobras to include gas-fired power for the very first time in its
revised long-term plan (1996-2004) to be published this January. Enron
has always argued the Bolivian pipeline must be primed by electricity
generating projects from day one of operation so that it is producing
money from the start while industrial and residential markets are
developed.

The Eletrobras plan for gas-fuelled generation consists of 1,800 MW in
the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, 450 MW in Mato Grosso and
390 MW in Mato Grosso do Sul. The Bolivia pipeline will enter Brazil at
Mato Grosso do Sul (Corumba) and go straight to the contiguous state of
Sao Paulo where the main market is. Sao Paulo currently takes gas from
Rio de Janeiro state but when Bolivian gas arrives this flow is planned
to be reversed.

A branch pipeline will probably leave the Bolivia-Brazil main pipeline
within Bolivia (between Santa Cruz de la Serra and Puerto Suarez) in
order to serve Mato Grosso state, probably entering Brazilian territory
at the river port of Caceres. Enron is understood to have signed
protocols of understanding for establishing gas-fired power stations
with the state electricity companies of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do
Sul.

There are apparently two issues still to be resolved. One is the
question of the gas price to distribution companies. Negotiations are
centred on the equation of volume and prices. The pipeline project
companies have been arguing for high volumes and lower prices while
distribution company estimates of demand have tended to be conservative
and consequently the price offered has tended to rise. The use of gas
in power stations will go some way to breaking this particular log-jam
by raising initial throughput and lowering the price.

Another problem, aired for some time, has been the allegation that
Bolivian reserves will be insufficient for the projected gasline flows.
Opponents of the gas pipeline say the certified reserves (by
Netherlands, Sweel and Associates of Dallas) do not cover the estimated
100 Bcm Brazil would consume over the 20 year contract period. The
respected Dallas company put Bolivian reserves at 80.8 Bcm proven; 30
Bcm probable and 25.9 Bcm possible. The consultant was confident this
problem "could be settled fairly quickly", without specifying how.

GAS VEHICLE PRODUCTION OK'D

Brazil's mines and energy minister Raimundo Brito has authorised the
motor industry to start production of natural gas fuelled cars and
trucks. Until now only buses have been purpose-built to use gas while
taxis could be converted to the fuel. Ministry officials expect the
cars will be produced with the option of alcohol use in order to
increase their range outside major cities. One of the reasons given for
allowing gas-fuelled car production is the increasing levels of
pollution in the two Brazilian cities with developed natural gas road
vehicle infrastructure: Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

US INVOLVEMENT NOW LIKELY

One at least of the new ammonia/urea complexes planned for location at
Jose in Antzotegui state Venezuela is set for US participation (IGR
287/25). Pequiven has signed a letter of intent with Arcadian to
jointly study feasibility of a $700m project involving a 700,000
tonnes/yr (t/yr) urea plant, fed by twin 600,000 t/yr ammonia units.
Assuming the study is positive and finance can be secured, Arcadian
sees a construction period running to three years. The move, says
Arcadian president Doug Campbell, would allow the company to move into
the fast-growing Latin American market for agriculture fertilisers,
with Venezuela's hefty gas reserves making that country a natural place
from which to operate.

CRISTOBAL NEEDS HIGHER PRICE

Partners in Sucre Gas SA, the joint venture backing the planned
Cristobal-Colon LNG export project, will wait until late 1996 before
committing themselves to a go-ahead. So says Ronald Pantin, planning
chief at Petroven, whose Lagoven subsidiary holds 33% of Sucre. For the
project to be economically viable, says Pantin, prices in the US will
have to be $2.50/MMBtu, while those in Europe will have to hit
$3.50/MMBtu. On recent forecasts (IGR 288/18), pipeline gas from almost
any source will undercut the European price suggested, US prices may
well top the $2.50/MMBtu level by end-century (IGR 285/30) but the
spate of new gas being released by the price-rise-inspired exploration
hike puts some doubt on higher prices lasting for long.

DEMAND FOR CANADIAN NATURAL GAS

Canada -  Demand for Canadian natural gas, including exports, will
require aggressive drilling programmes for the next 15 years, Canada's
National Energy Board (NEB) predicts.

In a supply/demand study covering 1993-2010 it says operators have
found about 3.5 Tcf/yr since 1987. But that is 1 Tcf less than the
volume needed to keep reserves from declining.

It forecasts Canadian gas production will increase from a current 4.5
Tcf/yr to more than 6 Tcf/yr by 2005. On the price side, it projected
prices rising to about $4/Mcf by 2010, or $2.50/Mcf after adjustment
for inflation.

THAI LPG PROJECT

Thailand - Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) recently awarded a
$2.02m contract to Foster Wheeler International Corp of the UK to
provide engineering consultancy services for LPG and oil depot
projects.

The LPG project involves a $22m investment to expand storage capacity
at PTT's Khao Bor Ya terminal in Chon Buri, about 100 km east of
Bangkok, by 5,000 tons.

Installation of three additional LPG spheres and related loading and
unloading facilities as part of the expansion of Khao Bor Ya terminal
is expected complete by 1997.

The expansion facilitates a significant increase of LPG throughput
volume at the terminal, resulting from a substantial rise in locally-
produced LPG and the need to export surplus LPG which is expected to be
453,000 tons.

Norway - Following start-up of a 0.5 tonnes/day demonstration unit last
June at Norsk Hydro's Porsgrunn complex, UOP and Hydro are offering
licences for their new natural gas to olefins process.

The MTO process uses methanol produced from natural gas to extend the
reaction to produce ethylene and propylene. In effect it is an add-on
to the usual natural gas to methanol route, allowing petrochemical
firms to vary end product according to state of the markets.

Using a fluidised-bed reactor and a highly-selective molecular-sieve
catalyst, the process is now reckoned to be commercially proven.

SIAM CEMENT AND DOW CHEMICAL JOINT VENTURE TO PRODUCE LLDPE

Thailand - Siam Cement, one of Thailand's largest conglomerates, and US-
based Dow Chemical announced a 4.75bn baht ($190m) joint venture to set
up a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) production facility in
Thailand.

The new plant, designed to produce 30,000 tonnes/yr (t/yr) of LLDPE,
will strengthen SCC's production capacity of polyethylene and propylene
and its derivatives to 1mt/yr in 1999, said to be the largest scale in
Asia.

According to SCC petrochemicals vice president Apiporn Pasawat, SCC and
Dow have incorporated Siam Polyethylene Co with a registered capital of
1.5bn baht to carry out the venture.

The two parties have an equal share in the scheme, to be located in Mab
Ta Phud Industrial Estate, Rayong. The plant, to be built on
technologies supplied by Dow, is scheduled on stream in 1999. Dow has
already been a partner with SCC in four other petrochemical projects.

Thai Polyethylene Co, part of Siam Cement, is currently the country's
sole producer of LLDPE with an annual production of 80,000 t/yr.

MITI to strengthen supervision of power plants+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will
instruct operators of electric power facilities under its
jurisdiction to establish a safety system for their operation, a
senior MITI official said Monday.
     MITI will urge power plant operators to step up training and
inspection to prevent accidents, and ensure a system for an immediate
reporting to the ministry in the case of emergency, said Tomio
Tsutsumi, vice MITI minister, during a news conference.
     Tsutsumi was apparently referring to the recent attempt by the
operator of the Monju prototype fast-breeder reactor to cover up the
extent of an accident.
     Monju and other atomic power plants are under the jurisdiction
of the Science and Technology Agency while ordinary power reactors
are supervised by MITI.
     A large amount of sodium leaked at Monju on Dec. 8, forcing the
plant's shutdown.
     A government organ in charge of running Monju has been under
fire for deliberately editing or withholding videotape taken inside
the plant shortly after the accident.

Crude Oil imports fall 8.8% in Nov.++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's imports of crude oil in November decreased 8.8% from a
year before, posting the fourth consecutive month of year-to-year
declines, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
said Monday.
     The decline was in reaction to a sizable year-to-year gain of
14.6% registered in November last year when domestic fuel oil demand
surged due to a drought in the nation earlier in the year, MITI
officials said.
     The United Arab Emirates was the biggest supplier of crude oil
in November with 37.61 million barrels, down 9.5% from a year before.
     The UAE was followed by Saudi Arabia with 24.34 million
barrels, down 19.4%, Iran with 13.96 million barrels, up 5.2%, and
Indonesia with 11.28 million barrels, down 23.3%, MITI said.
     Of the total imports, those from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries accounted for 82.3%, up from 80.6% in October,
while imports via the Strait of Hormuz represented 72.1%, down from
72.7%.
     Imports from the Middle East reached 78.9%, unchanged.
     The amount of crude oil processed during the reporting month
came to 128.32 million barrels, down 3.3%, MITI said.
     Production of fuel oil in November sank 3.0% to 119.57 million
barrels, the first decline in three months, MITI said.
     Output of naphtha, jet fuel oil and heavy oil decreased but that
of gas oil and gasoline hit record highs.
     Domestic sales of fuel oil came to 130.89 million barrels, up
3.6%.
     Sales of fuel oil B and fuel oil C slid but others increased,
with gasoline, naphtha, gas oil and jet fuel oil reaching record
highs for any November.
     Imports of fuel oil surged 39.2% to 19.00 million barrels but
exports sank 10.8% to 9.62 million barrels, MITI said.

TEPCO to pay more than 2 bil. yen over labor dispute+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) signed an agreement Monday to
pay more than 2 billion yen in compensation to 165 employees for
discriminating against them on grounds that they are communists.
     The agreement, reached out of court under a proposal by the
Tokyo High Court after a 19-year legal battle, also calls for
promotion and fair treatment for those still on the payroll.
     ''This has been a very long legal battle that lasted 19 years
and two months and we all are happy now.  I'm confident that this
will help promote liberty and democracy for the basic rights of
workers,'' said Hideo Nihei, who led the plaintiffs.
     ''We decided to reach an out-of-court settlement in view of the
circumstances surrounding the case such as the court proposal and the
long duration of the trial,'' a TEPCO spokesman said.
     The plaintiffs first took their case to court in 1976, demanding
the company pay a total of some 3.7 billion yen in damages for
discriminating against them in wages and promotion due their beliefs
as members of the Japanese Communist Party.
     TEPCO had justified the wage differentials, saying they
reflected the employees' job performances.
     The high court recommended an out-of-court settlement last
December.

MITI to rectify notorious LPG trading practices+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will try to
rectify practices related to the trading of liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG), ministry officials said Monday.
     To answer consumer criticism that the LPG price system is
unclear, the ministry is considering revising the Law Concerning the
Securing of Safety and the Optimization of Transactions of Liquefied
Petroleum Gas.
     When the ministry reviews the law, it plans to include penalties
to prevent inappropriate trading practices from having adverse
effects on consumers.
     The move will be made because a subcommittee of the Petroleum
Council, an advisory body to the international trade and industry
minister, called for rectification of LPG transactions in its interim
report issued Monday.
     The report proposed that how LPG prices are calculated should be
written on paper, which traders will issue when they sign contracts.
The ownership of pipes and equipment in houses will also be made
clear, the report also said.
     The ministry will issue a ministerial ordinance to force traders
to make clear on paper such things as prices and ownership of pipes
and equipment.
     To punish traders who do not issue such papers, the ministry
will revise the law.  A bill designed to revise the law will be
presented before the next ordinary Diet session.

Oil industry makes political donations to ruling parties+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The Petroleum Association of Japan disclosed Friday it has made
political donations to two conservative parties in the ruling
coalition in response to their requests.
     The association of oil producers and distributors said 60
million yen went to the Liberal Democratic Party, the main force in
the tripartite ruling coalition, and 3.5 million yen to New Party
Sakigake, the coalition's smallest party.
     Last year, the association donated 50 million yen to the LDP.
It increased its donation in order to strengthen its ties with the
party in response to a request by the powerful Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), association officials said.
     Keidanren asked member organizations and corporations to
contribute funds to help the LDP repay 10 billion yen borrowed from
commercial banks to finance its campaign for the general election in
July 1993.

Miyagi Pref. takes dim view of leak at reactor+

SENDAI, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Miyagi prefectural authorities said Monday they take a
''serious view'' of a leak of water at a reactor operated by Tohoku
Electric Power Co. in the prefecture in northern Japan despite the
company's assurance that it involved only a minute release of
radioactivity.
     The leak occurred near a hygroscopic moisture heat separator on
the plant's No. 2 reactor at Onagawa, a light-water, boiling water
type with an 825,000-kilowatt power output.
     Operators began shutting down the reactor manually on Sunday
night after the leak was discovered and completed the process by
midday Monday, after which they began investigating the cause of the
leak.
     Yutaka Suto, head of the company's nuclear power division, told
a press conference that radioactivity in the coolant water amounted
to ''a mere trace.''
     Prefectural officials counter by saying they view the case as
''an extremely serious mishap'' since the reactor had only recently
begun operations in July.
     An investigation by prefectural and company officials indicates
that the site of the problem was a device that adjusts the high water
mark on a drain tank on a second stage heater forming part of a
hygroscopic moisture heat separator installed to more effectively
remove steam generated in the reactor.
     At 6:15 p.m. Sunday, operators found water leaked from the
heater between the high- and low-pressure turbines.
     When the most recent inspection was carried out Dec. 10, no
abnormality was found.

Antinuclear group calls for Monju reactor closure+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A citizens' group opposed to the development of nuclear power
plants petitioned the head of the Science and Technology Agency on
Monday, demanding the fast-breeder nuclear reactor Monju be closed
immediately.
     The Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, in a letter to agency
chief Yasuoki Urano, also demanded that the agency reconsider its
plans to use plutonium in nuclear reactors in Japan's energy
development plans.
     Jinzaburo Takagi, executive director of the center, said the
agency should have known that the government-funded Power Reactor and
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (Donen), which operates the prototype
reactor, was concealing the accident.
     ''If (the agency) did not know, it has lost its power as a
manager,'' said Takagi.
     On Dec. 8, liquid sodium from the reactor's secondary cooling
system leaked and forced a shutdown of the reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui
Prefecture along the Sea of Japan coast.
     The group is also demanding that information concerning
investigations into the accident be made available to the public.
     ''The agency has not answered criticism from the outside, and
has given birth to a situation in which it is essentially protecting
Donen,'' said Takagi.

Donen rapped for improper system to handle Monju leak+

FUKUI, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Fukui prefectural government, host to the prototype
fast-breeder reactor Monju that was shut down after a huge sodium
leak, criticized the reactor's operator Monday for lacking the
necessary system to deal with such accidents.
     The prefectural government made the criticism against the
government-funded Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.
(Donen) in a report on the Dec. 8 accident at the plant located in
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast.
     In the report, the local government said that the management of
sodium coolant is basic to operating a fast-breeder reactor, but with
the present system and equipment at the Monju reactor, Donen is
unable to act promptly after a sodium leak.
     The prefectural government also rapped Donen for its delay in
informing the public of the accident.
     Donen reshuffled three senior officials who withheld videotapes
taken at the site of the accident.  The three officials withheld the
videotapes in an attempt to cover up the extent of the leak.
     A panel of the three-party ruling coalition discussing the Monju
accident agreed Monday to send a fact-finding mission to the reactor
site in Tsuruga early next year, coalition officials said.
     The coalition panel also agreed to reconsider, if necessary,
government policy promoting nuclear fuel recycling, in which
plutonium is removed from spent nuclear fuel to be reprocessed for
use as nuclear fuel again, they said.
     It is one of Japan's major energy policies, and the government
aims to put the system into practical use in the first half of the
21st century.
     Meanwhile, Donen officials said the corporation is considering
diverting more than half the plutonium shipped from France three
years ago for use at the Monju reactor to other reactors.
     The officials said Donen is considering the move due to the
indefinite delay of operations at Monju following the sodium leak.
     Donen decided to shift the plutonium because Monju requires
high-grade plutonium and current stocks could degrade if stored for
an long period, the officials said.
     Japan shipped 1 ton of plutonium from a reprocessing plant in
France amid protests from countries along the shipping route.
     At the time, Donen and the Science and Technology Agency said
the shipment was a vital replacement fuel for Monju.
     But because of delays at a factory in Japan making plutonium for
Monju, the processing of the imported plutonium did not begin until
December 1994.
     Some 600 kilograms, or more than half the transported amount, is
still unprocessed and in storage at the village of Tokai in Ibaraki
Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo.
     A Donen official said the fuel could be used at an experimental
fast reactor known as Joyo at Oarai in Ibaraki Prefecture and at a
prototype heavy-water reactor known as Fugen in Tsuruga.
     The diversion of the fuel would not involve major problems in
regard to nuclear fuel treaties with France and the United States,
but Japan would have to explain its actions to gain international
understanding, the Donen officials said.

Agency publishes revised report on Monju sodium leak+

TSURUGA, Japan, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Science and Technology Agency on Tuesday published a
revised report on a coolant leak at the prototype fast-breeder
nuclear reactor Monju after the first report submitted by its
operator turned out to have been falsified.
     The revised report was submitted to the agency Monday by the
operator, the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development
Corp. (Donen).  It contains corrections on the first report submitted
last week.
     The revised report says the time at which the first inspection
at the accident site was made was 2 a.m. Dec. 9, instead of 10 a.m.
on the day as reported previously.
     The new report also includes detailed chronological records on
contacts between Donen and the local and central governments since
immediately after the accident in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, on the
Sea of Japan coast.
     Meanwhile, Donen on Tuesday dismissed another senior official in
charge of the controversial nuclear plant over the cover-up attempt
to conceal the extent of the sodium leak that forced the shutdown of
the plant Dec. 8.
     Donen, which has been accused of editing and withholding videos
taken inside the plant shortly after the accident, said Tadao
Takahashi, a director in charge of Monju operations, will be replaced
by Atsuhiko Kishida.
     The corporation dismissed three officials last weekend over the
issue -- Yasuhito Omori, who headed construction works at the Monju
plant, his deputy Isao Sato and Futoshi Maeda, a section chief.
     At the Monju plant, a specially established working group of the
government's Nuclear Safety Commission launched a probe into the
accident Tuesday.
     The group has been set up to clarify the causes of the accident
and recommend steps for the prevention of a recurrence.
     The group will conduct a separate investigation, independent of
the Science and Technology Agency's inspection team.
     Meanwhile, the Tsuruga municipal assembly handed agency chief
Yasuoki Urano a statement saying that the city will not allow the
reactor to be restarted until after it is convinced of its safety.

2nd high-level nuclear waste shipment to Japan postponed+

AOMORI, Japan, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The planned second shipment of high-level nuclear waste from
France to Japan's nuclear recycling plant in the village of Rokkasho
in northern Japan has been delayed, electric companies and Japan
Nuclear Fuel Ltd. said Tuesday.
     France's state-owned nuclear fuel company COGEMA, which
reprocesses Japan's spent nuclear fuel, has not yet drawn up a plan
for the transportation, Japan Nuclear Fuel officials said.
     In April, the British ship Pacific Pintail, owned by British
Nuclear Fuels Ltd., carried the first shipment of high-level
radioactive waste in 28 vitrified blocks from France, where it was
created as a byproduct of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel on behalf
of Japanese electric power companies.
     The shipment of the waste is the first of several that Japan has
planned over the next decade, in which over 3,000 vitrified blocks of
waste will be shipped to Japan after spent nuclear fuel is
reprocessed by COGEMA and British Nuclear Fuels.
     Another 96 vitrified blocks were to be brought to the Rokkasho
plant in Aomori Prefecture in the second half of fiscal 1995, through
the end of March 1996.
     The waste would then be buried deep underground, but a final
storage site has not yet been decided.
     The April shipment drew strong protests from the countries
along the shipment route as well as from environment protection
organizations and local residents in Aomori Prefecture.

IN FACE OF MSHA CIVIL PENALTIES, FINES
J&T COAL CO. FILES FOR CHAPTER 7

     A Lee County, Va. coal company faced with more
than $320,000 in civil penalties, and even more in
potential criminal fines from a fatal roof fall, has
filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in federal court.
     J&T Coal cited a lack of assets for its filing.
J&T's deep mine in St. Charles, Va. was the site of a
massive roof fall that left four workers dead (MRR
3/1/91, p. 85).
     Earlier this spring J&T was convicted in U.S.
District Court on six criminal counts in connection
with the fatal accident (MRR 3/26). That ruling
could increase the cost to the company anywhere
from $600,000 to $3 million in additional fines.
     The bankruptcy filing could complicate
government efforts to collect the fines.
     Also U.S. District Judge Samuel Wilson has
refused to back off an 18-month prison sentence for
mine superintendent Garry Williams. Williams'
lawyers had asked to delay formal entry of judgment
for 30 days, so they could file a motion for
reconsideration of the sentence.
     Defense lawyers had earlier agreed to a lighter
sentence endorsed by federal prosecutors, but the
federal judge is not bound to adhere by such plea
agreements.
     Wilson had issued the tougher sentence after
reading an MSHA letter regarding unpaid safety
fines from operations Williams had run in the past.
Williams' lawyers still have until June 19 to appeal
the sentence, officials said.
     Wilson stood by his sentence during court
proceedings June 9.

PAYMENTS REQUIRED UNDER NEW FUNDS LAW ARE 'TAXES,'
HAVE BANKRUPTCY PRIORITY

     The recently enacted Coal Industry Retiree Health
Benefit Act, which imposes costs on coal mining
companies in order to stabilize the UMW retiree
health funds, applies to a company in Chapter 11
reorganization proceedings.
     The U.S District Court for the Southern District
of New York rejected LTV Steel Co.'s argument that
the new funds law does not apply to it. The court
also held that required contributions are "taxes"
entitled to first priority under the Bankruptcy Code,
and the obligations imposed by the new law should
be given first priority in LTV's bankruptcy
proceeding (MRR Document No. 0529).
     LTV Steel was a signatory to several industry-
wide wage agreements, which were the product of
multi-employer bargaining by the Bituminous Coal
Operators Assn. with the UMW. LTV filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1986 and sought
to terminate health benefits to retirees.
     In 1991, LTV won a court battle when a federal
appeals court held it was not required to provide
retiree benefits after January 1988 when the 1984
wage agreement expired. However, the new funds
law enacted in late 1992 makes all companies that
once signed any wage agreement with the UMW
liable for perpetually funding the retiree health care
system on a per-head basis. Under the new law,
contributions are paid to the UMW Combined Fund
which in turn provides benefits to retirees.
     LTV is now preparing to emerge from Chapter 11
and has scheduled a confirmation hearing on a plan
that does not provide for payments under the new
funds law, which LTV claims will be at least $12
million annually.
     LTV argued that any claim the Combined Fund
has against it is a "pre-petition claim" and barred
because it was not filed on time. However, the court
ruled the Combined Fund did not have a "claim"
before LTV's bankruptcy petition was filed because
any claim "simply did not exist" until the funds law
was enacted in 1992.
     The court also agreed with the Combined Fund
that contributions required by the new law are
"taxes" imposed by the federal government and,
therefore, are administrative expenses entitled to first
priority under the Bankruptcy Code. "Coal Act
obligations are appropriately described as 'taxes' due
to their overwhelmingly involuntary nature, their
explicitly stated public purpose and their obvious
potential to be imposed pursuant to the taxing
power," the court said.
     The court added that LTV's charges under the
new law are a "direct consequence of its continued
corporate existence," noting the law only imposes
obligations on signatories which are still "in
business," and are therefore best classified as
"administrative expenses."
     LTV and other companies have also attacked the
new funds law on constitutional grounds (MRR 2/12,
p. 56; 4/9, p. 167).

PARTNERSHIP MAY STILL BE LIABLE FOR
INCOAL'S WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY

     A partnership under "common control" with
Incoal Inc. may still be liable for Incoal's $810,610
withdrawal liability to UMW pension plans after a
recent federal appeals court decision.
     The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit ruled the lower court erred in
letting Double A Farms off the hook based on its
finding that there was no economic connection
between the two entities.
     The D.C. Circuit stressed it is not necessary to
find an economic connection in order to establish
that an enterprise is a "trade or business" under
common control with an employer and liable for its
unpaid withdrawal liability (MRR Document No. 0525).
     The court refused to decide the merits of the issue
and sent the case back to the U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia to rethink its finding that
Double A Farms was not a "trade or business."
     However, the D.C. Circuit said it was inclined to
side with the trustees of the UMW pension plans
who sued Double A Farms to collect Incoal's unpaid
withdrawal liability.

Incoal conceded liability

     Incoal, owned by the Adkins family, went out of
business in 1985 and conceded withdrawal liability
to the pension plans under the Employment
Retirement Income Security Act. The Adkins family
established Double A Farms in 1979 after acquiring
several hundred acres of land in Kentucky, and the
family claimed it bought the land for recreational and
investment purposes.
     Under ERISA, when an employer incurs
withdrawal liability, a "trade or business" under
"common control" is also responsible for paying the
withdrawal liability to the pension plans. The district
court ruled that Double A Farms was not a "trade or
business" under ERISA because there was no
economic connection with Incoal (MRR 2/14/92, p.
62).
     Reversing the lower court on this issue, the D.C.
Circuit said any inquiry into an economic connection
between the two enterprises is "irrelevant" in
determining whether Double A Farms is a "trade or
business" under ERISA.
     The appeals court sent the case back to the district
court to "find the facts" on this issue. However, the
appeals court set forth several guidelines and pointed
to a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court decision interpreting a
similar "trade or business" provision of the Internal
Revenue Code.
     The Supreme Court said the "primary purpose for
engaging in the activity must be for income or profit"
and that there must be "continuity and regularity" of
involvement.
     The D.C. Circuit said these factors appear to be
fulfilled in this case, noting Double A Farms
reported tobacco and cattle sales for at least seven
consecutive years.
     The court added it is not dispositive that the land
is used partly for recreational purposes and warned
the lower court not to base its findings on the
family's "self-serving" statement that they did not
intend to start a trade or business.

FOURTH CIRCUIT DENIES BENEFITS TO
WIDOWS IN TWO SEPARATE CASES

     In two separate cases, the 4th U.S. Court of
Appeals denied benefits to widows seeking
survivors' benefits under the Black Lung Benefits
Act.
     In a decision issued June 2, the court found that
substantial evidence supported an ALJ's decision that
Bramble Grizzle died from lung cancer and that
pneumoconiosis was not a substantially contributing
cause or factor leading to his death.
     Grizzle worked in coal mines for 35 years before
his retirement and subsequent death in 1983. The
ALJ found that Grizzle had pneumoconiosis to some
degree at the time of his death, that he also suffered
from severe emphysema and heart disease, and that
the direct cause of his death was a pulmonary
hemorrhage caused by lung cancer.
     Grizzle's widow presented the testimony of the
miner's personal physician that black lung disease
weakened his heart and lowered his resistance so that
he could not withstand bleeding caused by his
cancer. Grizzle's physician added that
pneumoconiosis caused the miner's emphysema and
heart problems and may also have caused his lung
cancer.
     However, the ALJ relied on the reports of two
other physicians who stated that the miner was
totally disabled by emphysema caused by cigarette
smoking; that his lung cancer was also caused by
smoking, not by his black lung disease, and that he
had only a mild case of pneumoconiosis.
     The ALJ found that Grizzle's pneumoconiosis
was not a substantially contributing or a
complicating factor in his death under 20 CFR
718.205(c)(2) and he denied his widow's claim.

Widow urged use of 'true doubt rule'

     Appealing to the 4th Circuit, Grizzle's widow
argued that her physician's diagnoses raised at least
some doubt that black lung disease substantially
contributed to her husband's death and that she was
entitled to the benefit of the "true doubt rule."
     However, the court, while affirming the use of the
"true doubt rule" in limited situations, refused to
apply it to the widow's claim, noting the ALJ clearly
found the opinions of the employer's doctors far
more persuasive than the contrary view of Grizzle's
physician.
     The court also rejected her argument that a
treating physician's opinion is entitled to greater
weight than the reports of non-treating doctors.
     One judge dissented, stating the case should be
remanded in light of the recent 4th Circuit decision
in Shuff v. Cedar Coal Co., in which the court held
that pneumoconiosis is a "substantially contributing
cause" of death if it hastened the miner's death in any
way (MRR 7/17/92, p. 337).
     In an unrelated decision issued May 26, the 4th
Circuit ruled that Eula B. Lester failed to show her
husband had suffered from complicated
pneumoconiosis. Under Sect. 921(c)(3) such a
showing entitles a claimant to an irrebuttable
presumption that pneumoconiosis caused death or
disability (MRR Document No. 0521).
     The widow relied on a conforming chest X-ray
reading, but the court noted that all the other medical
evidence, including biopsy and autopsy results,
showed that, at most, her husband suffered from
simple pneumoconiosis.

PYRO FOREMEN HIT WITH $2,000 FINES;
MUST PAY FOR PROBATION SUPERVISION

     Four Pyro foremen received $2,000 fines and
three must pay for their supervision costs for their
role in conditions leading to the methane explosion
that killed 10 miners in September 1989.
     Despite the differing number of counts against
each man, they each paid the same $2,000 fine, and
three paid supervision costs of $1,383. All four also
paid a special assessment.
     An information filed March 10 against three of
the foremen charged them with violating 30 CFR
75.324 and 75.1802 for knowingly and willfully
stating in the preshift, onshift and daily report book
that no hazardous conditions had been observed by
or reported to them, when in fact methane was in
excess of 2% and had caused equipment to
deenergize.
     Chris Johnson, 33, of Nebo, Ky., was sentenced
on June 1 to one year of probation and a special
assessment of $125.
     The information on Johnson said that on five
occasions, March 31, 1989, April 1, 1989, May 11,
1989, June 22, 1989 and Sept. 11, 1989, methane
was reported to and observed by Johnson, in
concentrations at or above 2% in the working
section, and that mining equipment had been de-
energized from the methane.
     Perry Ray, 36, from Clay, Ky., was also
sentenced June 1 and must pay the fine, supervision
costs and a $25 special assessment for not reporting
methane problems. He was a foreman on a
continuous mining unit when methane had been
above 2% and equipment had de-energized on May
12, 1989.
     Eddie Frank Barber, 36, of Earlington, Ky., was
fined and put on probation for one year for not
reporting methane conditions on July 14 and July 22,
1989. Barber had to pay a special assessment of $50.
     These three foremen had to pay $1,383.60 for the
costs of their supervision.
     The fourth foreman, Gary Johnson, 39, of
Mortons Gap, Ky., was sentenced to four months of
home confinement as part of a one-year probation
term. He had to pay a special assessment of $150.
     Gary Johnson was charged in a six-count
information with violating:

     -- 30 CFR 75.324, for failing to report high
        concentrations of methane.
     -- 75.1315(a), for firing shots outside the confines
        of a borehole.
     -- 75.1313(b), for ordering the improper storage
        of explosives.
     -- 75.1310(c), for firing explosives with an
        impermissible blasting unit.
     -- 75.316, for ordering the operation of two
        longwall shearers at the same time in violation of the
        methane and dust control plan.
     -- 75.1101-23(c), for failing to conduct mandatory
        fire drills and reporting in the "Fire Drill Record
        Book" that fire drills had been conducted.

     Johnson was sentenced in accordance with a plea
agreement, in which he agreed to cooperate in the
continuing investigation and related prosecutions
stemming from the explosion.

SCHOOLS IN W.VA. BENEFIT FROM SENTENCE

     A mine operator will pay a $50,000 criminal fine
and provide computers to Mingo County, W.Va.,
schools as part of the sentence stemming from a
blasting accident that injured one miner in 1989.
     The company, Meador Energy, pleaded guilty to
four counts of violating the Mine Act at its No. 1
mine near Newton, W.Va. The company had been
charged with five counts in a criminal information
filed Feb. 3 (MRR 2/12, p. 59).
     The Sept. 8, 1989, blasting accident injured one
miner whose arm was broken in four places. The
company pleaded guilty to using faulty pillar
recovery methods; firing unconfined explosives;
placing primed explosives without deenergizing
nearby electrical equipment; and allowing an
unqualified miner to fire shots.
     The company also gets four years' probation. As
part of the probation, the company volunteered to
provide 25 personal computers to five Mingo County
schools, along with installation and training.
     The company had faced a $1 million fine.

JUDGE THROWS CONTRACTOR INTO JAIL

     Saying coal dust sampling fraud must stop, a
federal judge in Beckley, W.Va., sentenced a
contractor to one year in jail and three years'
probation.
     West Virginia contractor Glen Morgan, who
operated under the name Kanawha Valley
Enterprises and later General Safety Services had
pleaded guilty in March to submitting false dust
samples to MSHA on behalf of operators as recently
as June 1991 (MRR 4/9, p. 168). Morgan also
admitted to providing false certification for required
miner training.
     U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Hallanan also fined
Morgan $5,000. Following his prison term, he cannot
engage in training miners or coal mine dust sampling
for three years.
     Morgan had faced a $250,000 fine and five years

COAL VENDOR PLEADS TO RACKETEERING

     Sentencing is scheduled Aug. 31 for a
businessman who has pleaded guilty in connection
with a racketeering scheme which bilked coal
companies of more than $900,000.
     Robert S. Painter, owner/operator of Bluefield,
W.Va.-based Abbs Valley Electric, entered the plea
recently before U.S. District Judge Samuel Wilson in
Abingdon, Va.
     Painter, along with other defendants, are said to
have defrauded several companies of more than
$900,000 over a five year period. Companies burned
in the scheme included Peabody Coal, Eastern
Associated Coal, Island Creek, CONSOL, Canada
Coal and Pittston subsidiary Sea B Mining.
     "The investigation revealed that Painter provided
cash kickbacks, prostitutes, and other items to coal
company employees to induce them to direct their
employers' business to Abbs Valley Electric,"
according to a government statement.
     False billings generated proceeds which were then
used by Painter to pay cash to the coal company
employees. Painter also pleaded guilty to conspiracy
to defraud the government of income taxes, and
illegal dumping of hazardous wastes.
     Also pleading guilty on conspiracy or income tax
charges were Painters' daughter and son-in-law,
Sherri and David Bailey; Abbs Valley salesman
Gerald Tabor; ex-Island Creek purchasing agent
Howard Cook; and Painter's brothers-in-law Richard
Weiner and Albert Harless. Nine defendants were
originally indicted.

ALJ IMPROPERLY AWARDED BACKPAY TO
MINER ON REMAND, FMSHRC RULES

     An ALJ erred in awarding backpay to a miner
when he reconsidered his decision on remand from
the commission, FMSHRC ruled.
     The miner, Ronny Boswell, won his
discrimination complaint filed against National
Cement Co., but ALJ Roy Maurer, in his initial
decision in February 1991, found the miner was not
entitled to backpay. Maurer found that the operator
had illegally disqualified Boswell from his job as a
utility laborer and reassigned him to a position as a
payloader operator based on a series of protected
work refusals.
     The operator appealed the case to the commission
and the panel sent it back to Maurer, asking him to
reconsider whether a particular incident involved
protected activity (MRR 3/13/92, p. 110).
     On remand, Maurer again sustained Boswell's
complaint, but this time he decided the miner was
entitled to a $6,094 award of backpay and interest, in
addition to his prior award of reinstatement (MRR
4/24/92, p. 188).
     The commission agreed with National Cement
that Maurer lacked jurisdiction to reexamine the
issue of Boswell's damages. The miner never
appealed the ALJ's initial ruling that he was not
entitled to backpay and that ruling became a final
commission decision, FMSHRC said.
     The panel also noted that it directed Maurer to
answer two questions on remand relating to the
merits of Boswell's discrimination complaint and
never ordered him to reopen the issue of damages.
FMSHRC vacated his supplemental damages award
and refused to review his other rulings in favor of the
miner.

SIXTH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS ALJ DECISION

     A federal appeals court affirmed an ALJ decision
that a miner was illegally discharged for making
safety complaints.
     In a brief, unpublished decision, the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Kem Coal Co.'s
claim that it discharged Charles T. Smith for
swearing at his supervisor (MRR Document No. 0528).
     The court said that ALJ William Fauver
"correctly pointed out that [the supervisor] provoked
Smith's outburst by flatly denying that he had ever
ordered Smith to work under falling coal."
     The court also found that "Smith's complaint
about the hazards of the falling coal, [his
supervisor's] denial of his order to work under it and
Smith's reaction" by swearing "are inseparable."
     The 6th Circuit added that the company's
affirmative defense fails because the miner's
swearing "cannot reasonably be isolated as an
independent motive for the discharge."
     The commission had denied Kem Coal's petition
for review of Fauver's decision and the company
appealed the decision to the 6th Circuit.

MAY ACCIDENTS CLAIM SEVEN LIVES;
36 HAVE DIED SINCE JANUARY

     Seven miners lost their lives in May mining
accidents, with two deaths in underground mines and
five deaths at surface operations.
     Year-to-date reports show 36 fatalities since
January, with 15 miners dying in metal/nonmetal
accidents and 21 dying in coal accidents. Twenty-
one of the YTD deaths occurred at surface operations
and 15 at underground operations.
     Two miners were killed in machinery accidents in
May.
     David Workman was killed May 10 at the
Murphy No. 1 Preparation Plant of Min, Inc. in
Wharncliffe, W.Va. He had only one month of
experience.
     Workman, who was a general laborer for Fielding
Hydroseeding, was washing a Bowie hydroseeder
when he fell into the augers through an opening on
top of the tank. An access cover on top of the tank
had been removed.
     Roger D. Smith, Jr., a repairman for Limousine
Coal, Inc., was killed May 13 at the No. 3
underground mine in Dayhoit, Ky. He had three
years' experience and had been with the company for
one year.
     Smith was performing maintenance work with a
bolting machine and was positioned across a drill
boom. When his filter SCSR and lamp belt became
entangled in the controls, the boom raised and pinned
him to the roof, crushing him in the chest area. He
died less than two hours later.
     Three miners died in power haulage accidents in
May.
     Bruce E. Schoolcraft was killed May 12. He had
14 years' mining experience.
     Schoolcraft was an underground mine foreman
for Cross Mountain Coal, Inc.'s No. 6 mine in Lake
City, Tenn. He was operating a six-ton battery
locomotive when he became caught between the
mine roof and the frame of the locomotive. He died
instantly from head injuries.
     Bret Hatfield was killed May 3. He was an
apprentice mechanic/welder for Stewart-Nuss, Inc.'s
Blackstone Pit and Mill in Fresno, Ca.
     Hatfield was driving a welding truck when he
collided with a haul truck traveling in the opposite
direction on a pit haul road. Hatfield's truck burst
into flames on impact, and he died instantly. He had
over three years' mining experience.
     Glen Baese died on May 10 when he was crushed
by a screw conveyor. He was a plant foreman for
Carl Schlegel, Inc.'s Clinton County Pit mine in St.
Johns, Mich. He had three years' mining experience.
     Baese and two other employees were
investigating why a sand stacking conveyor had
stopped. While a dewatering screw was still running,
the buildup of sand at the top end of the screw tanks
caused the support structure of the unit to collapse.
The two employees assisting Baese jumped to safety
and escaped uninjured.
     Bill Anderson, a superintendent working at
Hardin County Materials Co.'s Plant No. 2, died on
May 17. Anderson got up on a conveyor belt to
examine spillage from a primary crusher and fell 14
feet to the ground. He had 30 years' of mining
experience.
     Thomas Reaska was killed May 27 at Midwest
Material Co.'s Lacon Plant in Lacon, Ill. He had 13
years' mining experience.
     Reaska, a mechanic at the mine, was dismantling
a crane boom to extend its length for other work.
When he drove an assembly pin out of the boom, the
boom fell on him.
     Reaska's accident was the third fatality involving
a boom this year.

BLAST DEBRIS KILLS CAR PASSENGER

     MSHA and OSM investigators are looking into a
blast at the Sugar Ridge Coal Co. surface mine in
Tennessee that caused small boulders and mud to fall
onto Interstate 75, killing a car passenger.
     The mine had been closed for more than a week
while MSHA tried to interview all the miners. The
accident occurred June 4, a Friday, and MSHA was
at the site that weekend.
     Investigators were supposed to conduct
interviews June 8. But as of June 14, one miner did
not want to be interviewed until his attorney got back
from vacation.
     Killed was Brian Agujar, 16, of Louisiana. He
was travelling with his family on vacation.
     MSHA said the company was blasting 240 feet
from the road, which is the legal distance. However,
blasting must be strictly controlled so debris does not
leave a blast site.

MSHA EXTENDS FINAL RULE STAYS

     Industry has been given a temporary reprieve on
provisions in the controversial explosives and
ventilation final rules.
     MSHA has stayed nine explosives provisions for
metal/nonmetal mines until Dec. 31 and stayed two
ventilation provisions for underground coal mines
until July 1, 1994.
     On the explosives rule, stayed are:

     > 30 CFR 56./57.6000, the definition of a "blast
site," which industry asked MSHA to clarify.
Industry asked MSHA to add language that unloaded
holes are not part of a blast site unless they are
within 30 feet of a loaded hole.
     > 56./57.6130(b) and 56.57.6131(a)(1) for
explosive storage facility provisions which may be in
conflict with other federal regulations.
     >  56./57.6202(a)(1), which would require that
vehicles containing explosives be structurally sound
and well maintained.

MSHA DIST. 6 INSPECTORS ACCUSED OF
HARASSING COAL MINE OPERATORS

     MSHA says it is looking into complaints that
MSHA inspectors are harassing operators in Dist. 6
out of Pikeville, Ky.
     According to a letter written by David Gooch,
president of the Kentucky-based trade group Coal
Operators & Associates Inc., Dist. 6 operators have
had "problems with plans, enforcement and threats.
 ... Most of the difficulties seem to be traceable to
Jesse Cole, the District Manager."
     MSHA spokesperson Kathy Snyder said Cole is
an "experienced and highly respected manager with
MSHA," but added that the agency is investigating
Gooch's concerns.
     Gooch said his group has had meetings with Cole
regarding his policies and "taken as many as 40
operators with us at times." He said he even went to
MSHA headquarters in Arlington, Va., to meet with
Cole's superiors.
     Gooch says he is out to get evidence that
operators are being harassed, and he has put his
members on notice that they need to document
problems.
     "We need to be able to prove there is a pattern of
harassment, a pattern of inspectors and supervisory
personnel who have intentionally gone above and
beyond the scope of their authority, a pattern of
inspectors being allowed to do their jobs in an
improper manner," Gooch said.
     Gooch said an "improper manner could be
anything from loafing all day on your job, asking for
something of value, making threats, writing citations
and orders for non-existent violations and other such
improprieties."
     Operators have been told to keep a record of
inspections and write down what the inspectors do
while they are at the mine site. "If he sits in your
office three hours drinking coffee and leaves, write
that down. If he makes a threat or says anything that
is not according to regulations and policy, write that
down."
     But all of the documentation the industry group
wants, Gooch said, will all be kept confidential
because many of the operators "are afraid of
retaliation from MSHA."
     Meanwhile the local American Federation of
Government Employees union warned MSHA
inspectors to "be careful."
     Hugh Smith, the AFGE union president, told
MSHA inspectors in a memo: "It is evident that there
are coal operators trying to gather information
against you that could mean your job. Let's be
careful out there. Write what you find and
document!!!"

EASTERN FILES NLRB CHARGES AGAINST UMW; COURT GRANTS
PEABODY RESTRAINING ORDER

     Eastern Associated Coal Corp. has charged the
UMW with threatening and intimidating the
company's suppliers and vendors, while Peabody
Coal Co. was able to get a court order limiting strike-
related activity.
     The union has been on strike at these mines since
June 2.
     In charges filed with the National Labor Relations
Board, Eastern says UMW actions violate previously
issued NLRB orders from strike-related cases with
other companies.
     Eastern is seeking to halt what it calls strike-
related misconduct at its Federal No. 2 Mine in
Monongalia County, W.Va.
     The company filed four charges against the UMW
international and its affiliated members.
     The company filed two charges against the
international and UMW Local 1570.
     Eastern said the union has conducted "mass
picketing in numbers as high as 40 to 50" at Berry
Trucking of Rivesville, W.Va. Eastern said the
UMW has threatened to use violence against Berry
Trucking owners and threatened to damage Berry's
property.
     Berry Trucking is an independent contractor for
Eastern and "has a preexisting relationship to haul
coal before the strike," according to the filing.
Because of this, the union is actually conducting a
"secondary boycott," which violates Sect. 8(b)(4) of
the National Labor Relations Act, Eastern said.
     Eastern spokesperson Tom Gallager said the
charges were filed against the international and local
because local UMW members were picketing at
Berry's property. Picketing must be authorized by the
international. There was no evidence the district was
involved.
     Two other charges are aimed at the international,
the district and the local.
     In this case, Eastern charges the three union
affiliates with interfering and threatening suppliers
and employees who try to enter or leave the mine.
The union is also charged with trying to damage
vehicles that have attempted to cross the picket line.

Traffic on public roads halted, says Peabody

     In the Peabody case, the Warrick County, Ind.,
Circuit Court granted a temporary restraining order
preventing the UMW from obstructing traffic at the
company's Lynnville No. 1 mine near Lynnville, Ind.
     The court ordered the union to limit the number
of picketers to no more than two at any of the three
intersections where the obstructions have occurred.
     In its filing with the court, Peabody said that
UMW members were walking in "a slow and close-
file line" at the mine entrance and at county road
crossings adjacent to the mine. The union was
refusing requests to let traffic through and forced
drivers to wait up to three hours, according to the
company statement.

PEABODY, CONSOL HIT IN LATEST ROUND
OF UMW SELECTIVE STRIKES

     The UMW has expanded its selective strike to
more than a dozen additional mines for Peabody
Holding Co. and CONSOL in West Virginia, Illinois
and Kentucky.
     The fifth wave of the UMW strike against the
Bituminous Coal Operators' Assn. affects an
additional 3,000 miners and brings the total number
of strikers to 12,000. The job action adds
subcontractors to the list of operations being struck,
and the union said it will strike Peabody
subcontractors.
     "We have targeted the two largest coal producers
and the leadership of those companies, George 'Sam'
Shiflett at Peabody and Bobby Brown at CONSOL,
who are principal spokespeople for the BCOA," said
UMW President Richard Trumka.
     "And you can always tell when a strike is having
an effect when the coal companies become more
frantic in their actions," Trumka said of Peabody's
action against 163 miners in Kentucky.
     CONSOL operations hit in this latest phase
include Burning Star No. 2 in Illinois and Robinson
Run in West Virginia.
     Peabody operations hit include Baldwin mine and
Randolph preparation plant and related surface
facilities in Illinois, and the Martwick mine in
Kentucky.
     Eastern Associated was hit at Tygart River,
Lightfoot No. 1 and Colony Bay mines as well as the
Rocklick plant in West Virginia. "The UMWA-
elected officials are trying to damage Eastern
Associated but in the process, they may be cutting
off future job opportunities for our employees," said
Eastern President Peter Lilly.

PEABODY BACKS OFF FIRING 163 UMW MINERS, INSTEAD
ISSUES FOUR DAY SUSPENSION

     Peabody Coal Co. has backed off its initial plans
to fire 163 union members who allegedly tried to
shout down company President Sam Shiflett.
     Having originally announced it was suspending
the Camp No. 1 employees with intent to fire,
Peabody downgraded the punishment to a four-day
suspension without pay.
     In explaining its decision, the company said the
June 3 episode was probably instigated by union
leaders, but individuals miners must be held
accountable for their own actions. The mine resumed
operation Wednesday June 9 after being idle the
previous Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday.
     "We're glad they have come partially to their
senses," said UMW spokesperson Greg Hawthorne.
The union will still appeal the suspensions because
the miners were exercising "protected" activity, he
said.
     Peabody had announced plans to fire the miners
for insubordination after they refused to give Shiflett
their attention during a company meeting, by
chanting "contract, contract." UMW President
Richard Trumka the Peabody move a "high-handed
tactic befitting a plantation owner."
     But the critique by industry sources wasn't much
kinder.
     One lawyer said Peabody was smart to back off
its original hardline because attempting to sack the
miners would be a "grievous blunder in labor
relations."
     There was no way the firings would have ever
passed muster with the National Labor Relations
Board, the attorney said. It's silly for Peabody to
expect union miners would "sit there and listen to a
propaganda speech" while there's a strike going on.
     Another official expressed fear the UMW could
make potential firings into the type of rallying issue
similar to cancellation of retiree health benefits
during the Pittston strike. The episode also adds fuel
to the UMW argument that it's involved in an unfair
labor practices strike, at least in connection with
Peabody, the source said.

DECERTIFICATION ELECTION UP IN AIR FOR
BUCK CREEK COAL CO. MINERS

     The lawyer for a group of Buck Creek Coal
employees who want out of the UMW has renewed a
request for a decertification election, but the National
Labor Relations Board said no such vote will happen
soon.
     A May 6 decision by a three-member panel of the
NLRB was a mixed verdict for Buck Creek and the
UMW.
     The panel upheld an ALJ ruling that Buck Creek
implemented a flex schedule without first bargaining
with the union -- but also struck down the judge's
decision to add nine months onto the union's
"certification year." That's the time period in which a
union has to reach a labor contract with a newly-
organized operation.
     As a result of the latter development, Jim Hanson,
a lawyer for the "Vote No Committee" at Buck
Creek, has renewed his request that the NLRB
proceed with a decertification election.
     The board has yet to respond to Hanson's letter,
but "at this point it does not look like there's going to
be an election any time soon," said an NLRB
official.
     Before the petition could move forward Buck
Creek must comply with NLRB's May order. Also
current unfair labor practice charges filed by the
NLRB must be cleared up before any decert vote.
The union went on strike against Indiana's biggest
deep mine in April. Although the operation was
organized in late 1991, the two sides have failed to
reach a contract.

VOTE SCHEDULED AT ZEIGLER SUBSIDIARY ON HEELS OF
SUCCESSFUL MARROWBONE VOTE

     With the UMW on an emotional high from its
apparent victory at Marrowbone Development, a
certification vote is set June 28 for another non-
union subsidiary of Zeigler Coal Holding.
     Zeigler's SMC Mining stands behind the decision
of management at Wolf Creek Collieries to
"vigorously oppose" the UMW drive, said company
official Vic Svec.
     Wolf Creek is located just across the Kentucky
line from Marrowbone. The National Labor
Relations Board confirmed that Marrowbone
employees had voted 256-to-151 to join the union.
There were 33 challenged ballots. The company had
not announced by press time if it planned to
challenge the election or the campaign leading up to
it.
     Industry opinions vary on whether Marrowbone
signals a brighter day for UMW or was merely a
flash in the pan.
     An official with a rival coal company subscribes
to the latter theory. The UMW had some "really
stupid management helping them" at Marrowbone,
he said. The source thinks the UMW also has an
excellent chance at Wolf Creek.
     Wolf Creek returned to work in late-May
following a two-and-a-half week walkout sparked by
changes in retiree medical benefits, officials said. It's
hard to say how the Marrowbone vote may affect the
Bituminous Coal Operators' strike. Most officials
think it will hearten the UMW. Others think BCOA's
B.R. Brown could use it as evidence that the UMW
can organize mines without extensive job rights at
non-union operations.
     Marrowbone has filed formal objections to the
way the union conducted its campaign leading up to
the certification vote. The company claims UMW
officials made unlawful threats and promises
throughout the campaign.
     Among the claims in the two-page document is an
allegation that the union said it would add 10 years
eligibility toward the UMW pension after two years
of credited service, as an inducement to vote pro-
union. "By such conduct, petitioner unlawfully
interfered with employees in their exercise of free
choice in the election."

BCOA FILES SUIT TO STOP AMAX WITHDRAWAL; AMAX SAYS IT
WILL BARGAIN WITH CYPRUS

     The Bituminous Coal Operators' Assn. has filed a
lawsuit against AMAX Coal Co. to prevent AMAX
from exiting the multi-employer bargaining group.
     AMAX announced last week, following a
decision to merge with Cyprus Minerals Co. of
Englewood, Colo., that it would withdraw from the
BCOA. Cyprus bargains independently of the
BCOA, and its current contract does not expire until
July 1.
     "If I were on BCOA I'd be furious and I'd file
suit," said an industry source the day before the suit
was filed.
     BCOA has accused the union of "inducing" AMAX to
withdraw from BCOA in the midst of contract talks to
enable the nation's third-largest coal producer to
negotiate its own agreement. BCOA said the law is
clear, and that once negotiations begin, companies in
a multi-employer group must be bound by the contract
negotiated by that group. They cannot cut their own
deals.
     AMAX said last week it is withdrawing from the
group because it will be governed by the labor
agreement that its merger partner, Cyprus Minerals,
is negotiating with the UMW. Cyprus is talking with
the union about its Emerald and Cumberland mines
in Pennsylvania and the Kanawha mine in West
Virginia.
     But the provision that limits AMAX's or any
other company's right to leave BCOA is a murky
area of labor law. Defections are acceptable under
"unusual circumstances" -- a term that has never
been explicitly defined by the courts. Some think the
Cyprus-AMAX consolidation constitutes such
circumstances.
     One industry source finds the AMAX defection
from BCOA more puzzling now than if it had come
before the merger announcement. AMAX's presence
would have given the Cyprus-AMAX hybrid insight
into BCOA bargaining. The source also described
AMAX as a "fairly soft" member of BCOA -- while
Cyprus Minerals has not been reluctant to lock horns
with unions in the past.
     The same industry official thinks it does the union
little good to knock off contract deals one-by-one.
The union doesn't appear to have the ability to
conduct more than one set of major talks at once, the
source said. Furthermore, the UMW is still not going
to make any real gains without eventually going
through Peabody and CONSOL, the source said.

conditions, test for methane and oxygen deficiency,
and determine if the air is moving in its proper
direction, at the following locations.
     Due to the deteriorated conditions and roof falls
in the intake entry in the 2nd Submain East
immediately adjacent to the room necks, travel in
this entry would be unsafe. The company proposes to
establish two continuous monitoring stations with
both audible and visual alarm signals to monitor the
air passing through the affected area [Docket No. M-
93-66-C].
     Hearing requests are due July 12.

methane, at 20-minute intervals, before equipment is
energized, taken into, or operated in a working place.
The tests must be made at the last permanent roof
supports, unless the ventilation plan requires them to
be made closer to the working face.
     The company proposed to have a qualified person
test before an auger machine is deenergized and to
use the machine's continuous methane detection
sensor to test air before auguring begins. The
company would have continued testing at intervals of
20 minutes (MRR 1/29/93 p. 40) [Docket No. M-92-
188-C].

IRREBUTABLE PRESUMPTION PROVISION OF
KY. LAW CONSTRUED BY STATE COURT

     The Kentucky Court of Appeals held that a miner
must show exposure to coal dust caused his disability
in order to be entitled to the irrebutable presumption
of total disability set forth in KRS 342.732(1)(c).
     The miner argued he submitted the required X-ray
evidence and met the necessary spirometric test
values to trigger the statute's irrebutable
presumption. However, the court read into the statute
the requirement that a claimant must also prove that
he contracted pneumoconiosis from work-related
exposure to coal dust (MRR Document No. 0527).
     The court remanded the case and ordered the ALJ
to determine whether the claimant's disability was
caused by his cigarette smoking or exposure to coal
dust. If his disability was caused by both factors, he
is still entitled to an award of benefits if coal dust
exposure was a "medically significant cause of the
respiratory impairment," the court said.
     The court read the necessary causation
requirement into the statute, finding the legislature
left it out as an "oversight."
     The court reversed an ALJ's award of total
permanent disability benefits that was affirmed by
the Workers' Compensation Board.
     Four judges dissented, stating that KRS
342.732(1)(c) is "clear upon its face" and should be
read "precisely as written." Under the statute, an
irrebutable presumption of total disability resulting
from exposure to coal dust is triggered if the required
X-ray evidence and respiratory impairment test
results are submitted, the dissenting judges said,
finding "nothing absurd or unreasonable in this
result."

ALABAMA COURT UPHOLDS BENEFITS AWARD TO MINER WHO
EARNED MORE AFTER INJURY

     A miner who returned to his same position and
earned more money after he injured his arm may still
keep his award of workers' compensation benefits
based on a finding of 31% loss of earning capacity,
an Alabama Appeals court ruled.
     The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals said that
when a worker's post-injury earnings equal or exceed
his earnings at the time of the injury, there is a
presumption of earning capacity commensurate with
earnings.
     However, the miner rebutted this presumption by
introducing independent evidence that his post-injury
earnings were an unreliable basis for estimating his
earning capacity, the court said (MRR Document No. 0519).
     The miner showed his post-injury increase in
earnings resulted primarily from collective
bargaining salary increases; his working hours
increased since his 1986 accident; and he received
assistance from co-workers, the court noted. A
vocational rehabilitation expert also testified that the
miner had lost access to a "significant number of
jobs" because of his injury.

Judges' Decisions

(will become final in 40 days unless ordered
reviewed)
     MSHA v. ADAMS STONE CORP., 6/9/93. Civil
penalty proceedings: A judge ordered a small
Kentucky limestone operator to pay $3,425 in
penalties for six violations of Part 56 standards,
discovered during an MSHA investigation of a
serious accident at the quarry (MRR Document No. 0534).
     An MSHA inspector issued six Sect. 104(d)(1)
citations and orders after investigating the accident in
which the assistant quarry superintendent fell 30 feet
from the top of a primary crusher and suffered
permanently disabling injuries.
     The judge found that the operator committed an
S&S violation of 30 CFR 56.15005 because
unrebutted evidence established that the assistant
superintendent was not wearing a safety belt or line
when he fell. He agreed with MSHA that the
operator was guilty of "unwarrantable failure"
because the assistant superintendent was an agent of
mine management and knew his actions were unsafe.
He fined the company $1,600 for the violation.
     MSHA cited the operator for a second S&S
violation of 30 CFR 56.15005 after the inspector
observed two miners working on top of the crusher
without wearing safety belts or lines the day
following the accident. The judge agreed the
violation was S&S and also caused by the operator's
unwarrantable failure, finding that mine management
had an obligation to ensure that miners who
continued to work on the crusher after the accident
wore safety belts and lines to prevent another serious
accident. He fined the operator $1,000.
     The judge ruled the operator also violated 30 CFR
56.18009 because the inspector found six miners
dismantling the primary crusher for repair without a
"competent person" in charge as required by the
standard. He ruled the violation was S&S, but not the
result of unwarrantable failure because one member
of the crew, the crane operator, was an experienced
and trained employee who could take over in the
event of an emergency. He assessed a $225 civil
penalty.
     The judge also assessed penalties totaling $600
for three violations of explosives standards. He held
that the company violated 30 CFR 56.6313, because
two large limestone boulders had been drilled and
charged with explosives and left unattended and
unbarricaded for one week; 30 CFR 56.6320,
because the operator exceeded the 72-hour time limit
between charge and blast times; and 30 CFR
56.6305, because unused explosive materials were
not moved to a protected area within a reasonable
time after the boulders were charged.
     The operator argued that three separate citations
were not justified because they concerned a single
condition. However, the judge found the cited
standards impose separate and distinct duties on the
operator and he ruled the three citations were not
duplicative. He said the violations of 30 CFR
56.6313 and 56.6305 were S&S, citing the hazards of
a premature detonation. However, he said MSHA
failed to prove that the operator was aware that the
boulders had been drill and charged, and he ruled the
violations were not the result of its unwarrantable
failure (Koutras, Judge; Nos. KENT 92-604-M and
92-770-M).

     JERRY IKE HARLESS TOWING INC. v.
MSHA, 6/2/93. Contest proceeding: A company that
dredges sand from a riverbed is an operator under the
Mine Act and must file a legal identity report with
MSHA as required by 30 CFR 56.1000, a judge ruled
(MRR Document No. 0515).
     The judge ruled the company violated 30 CFR
56.1000 and ordered it to filed the required report
within 21 days.
     He rejected as "frivolous" the company's
arguments that sand is not a mineral and that it
extracted sand in liquid form. The judge noted that
MSHA routinely oversees sand and gravel dredging
operations and said the company's extraction and
preparation of sand through its filtering process are
clearly activities covered by Sect. 3(h)(1) of the
Mine Act.
     However, the found that another corporation
owned by the same individual that stores and sells
the sand is not subject to the Mine Act (Feldman,
Judge; No. CENT 92-276-RM).
     MSHA v. MULLINS AND SONS COAL CO.,
6/3/93. Civil penalty proceeding: A judge agreed
with a coal company that its conceded S&S
violations of coal dust standards 30 CFR 75.400 and
75.402 were not the result of its "unwarrantable
failure" (MRR Document No. 0535).
     An MSHA inspector cited the operator after he
discovered loose coal, coal dust and float dust
accumulations ranging from three to six inches deep
for a distance of 180 feet. He described the
accumulations as black and found no evidence of
significant rock dust content.
     The inspector based his unwarrantable failure
charge on the fact that the accumulations were noted
in the pre-shift examiner's book. However, the judge
found that the notation acknowledging the
accumulations was a mitigating factor in assessing
the degree of the company's negligence.
     The judge also noted that the accumulations had
existed for only three hours and that the operator's
scoop was out of service and being charged.
     While not guilty of unwarrantable failure, the
judge found the operator was moderately negligent
and assessed a total of $1,000 in penalties (Feldman,
Judge; No. KENT 92-669).

     MSHA v. QUARTO MINING CO., 6/7/93. Civil
penalty proceeding: A judge fined a coal mine
operator $800 for an S&S violation of 30 CFR
77.1606(c) because of a defective steering wheel on
a front-end loader (MRR Document No. 0533).
     The inspector discovered the malfunction when
he asked the equipment operator to demonstrate the
steering on an idling Caterpillar 988 front-end loader
in the mine's supply yard. When the steering wheel
was turned to the right, it locked in position, forcing
the equipment operator to use both hands to break
the lock. Then the wheel would spin very fast,
causing a potential loss of control of the vehicle, the
judge found.
     The equipment operator told the inspector the
condition was intermittent and that he had reported
the malfunction to the shop foreman, who was
unable to correct the problem.
     The judge found that the malfunctioning steering
was an obvious safety defect. He ruled the violation
was S&S because it presented a hazard to the
equipment operator, to pedestrians and to other
vehicle drivers. He also found the operator guilty of
"unwarrantable failure" because the shop foreman
knew of the defect for several months and failed to
correct the defect or remove the loader from service
(Fauver, Judge; No. LAKE 92-309).

BONDS FROM TENNESSEE INTERIM
PROGRAM MUST BE FORFEITED TO OSM

     An insurance company must forfeit two
reclamation bonds to the federal government, even
though the bonds were issued when the government
did not require bonding, a federal court ruled.
     U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Tennessee upheld an IBLA ruling that the bonds were
"statutory bonds," and OSM became the
successor-in-interest to the bonds when it took over
Tennessee's program (MRR Document No. 0517). Exchange
Insurance Co. had challenged the IBLA decision
ordering the company to forfeit two bonds worth
$81,000.
     Tennessee had enacted its program in 1980, only
to kill it on Oct. 1, 1984. Exchange issued two
performance bonds for two mining permits filed
during the state's interim program. The bonds were
issued when a bond was required by state law, but
not by federal law.
     When the federal government was taking over the
state's program, it announced in the Federal Register
that it would not assume responsibility over interim
program bonds. In addition, the state's attorney
general said that bonds in which no forfeiture
proceedings had started before Oct. 1, 1984, were
voided by the legislative repeal of the Tennessee
program.
     But the attorney general also noted that the
federal government succeeded to any permanent
program bonds in which forfeiture proceedings had
not yet started.
     Although the bonds were originally issued under
the interim rule, they were used to support second
permits under the final rule. It was this point when
the bonds became "statutory bonds."
     Exchange tried to argue that when the federal
government took over the program it required
permittees to change the payee of the bonds to
include the federal government as "co-payee" within
30 days of the effective date of the new program.
     Exchange never complied with this order, but it
was also never challenged by the government for not
complying. Exchange said that this is evidence that
the government did not consider the original bonds
payable to it.
     But because the bonds had been transferred to
second permits, with Exchange's consent, to support
permanent program permits, this made them
statutory bonds, and OSM the successor in interest.

ANDALEX TRUCK ROUTE TOO DANGEROUS
BECAUSE OF SCHOOL, RESIDENTS SAY

     Residents are up in arms over Andalex's plan to
run double-trailer coal trucks through their town
which is 100 miles away from the coal-rich Kaiparowits
area in southern Utah.
     Nearly 200 residents of Hurrican, Utah, which
lies on the state route that would be used to reach
rail loadout points, turned out for a protest meeting
last week.
     Townspeople say the 45-ton trucks would wear
out the roads, cause air and noise pollution and add
to the congestion already a problem with traffic
heading to and from Zion National Park.
     But they were particularly upset about the safety
of children at the school, which is at bottom of a
steep two-mile long 8% grade hill on the truck route.
They say the grade increases the danger of a runaway
truck.
     Their concern was backed up by the Southern
Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) who used
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety statistics
showing double-trailer trucks are two to three times
more likely to have an accident than single-trailer
trucks.
     The alliance has been fighting development of
coal-rich Kaiparowits for decades.
     A representative of a trucking firm working with
Andalex said the latest trucks are better able to
negotiate the steep inclines because they have more
braking power per ton than those built a few years
ago.
     The noisy protest meeting early this month added
to the controversy surrounding Andalex's plan to
mine 400 million tons of coal from Smoky Hollow
which lies between two wilderness areas and next to
a national recreation area.
     Andalex wants to use the trucks to get the coal to
rail lines in Utah and Nevada.

CALIFORNIA DESERT MUST BE PROTECTED FROM MINING,
EXPLOITATION, SAYS BABBITT

     Land exchanges will be used to preserve areas of
the Southeast California desert if legislation makes it
through the House and Senate.
     Desert protection legislation would create 74
wilderness areas and upgrade Joshua Tree National
Monument and Death Valley National Monument to
national park status.
    The House version would make the East Mojave
Desert a national monument and the Senate version
would make it a national park. The Senate version is
the most restrictive of the two, which the
administration prefers, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt told the House subcommittee on national
parks June 15.
     Most of the land owned by the government, more
than 7 million acres, would be designated as
"wilderness," closing the land to mining. If the land
is designated a "national park," then mining may be
permitted.
     Babbitt noted that in the California desert, "You
can still see roads cut through sand by Conestoga
wagons," and "scars mark the mines that delivered
fortunes to claim settlers who would not be turned
away."
     The interior secretary said the desert is threatened
by "those who would pillage its subtle beauty."

Many forms need protection, says Babbitt

     Babbitt agrees with environmental groups that
legislation is needed to protect sand dunes, extinct
volcanos, archaeological sites and rare plant and
animal life, and that protection is needed from
mining and grazing.
        Babbitt also stressed that the entire "ecosystem"
needed protection, and not protecting one area would
harm an entire region.
     Additions proposed for the Joshua Tree National
Park would include the Coxcombe Mountains, Pinto
Basin and Pinto Mountains, Little San Bernardino
Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
     "Resource protection would be greatly enhanced
here with the full ecosystem included under one
management entity," Babbitt said.
     But Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., sees taxpayers
ending up with a huge bill to acquire the land or
giving up valuable federal lands in land exchanges.

Company, schools own large parcels

     One of the debates centered around land owned
by the Catellus Corp.
     Babbitt supports land exchanges for the Catellus
land and California school lands, which are the two
entities that own the vast majority of non-federal
land in the area.
    Lewis said that 355,000 acres owned by Catellus
are worth between $750 and $1,500 an acre.
     But Babbitt called these figures "absurd," and said
the department would work out exchanges providing
Catellus with federal land that had similar
characteristics to the Catellus land that would be part
of the protected area.
     There is another area of the desert, however, that
poses a different problem.
     The Lanfair Valley area contains about 1,000
small, individually owned private parcels. Babbitt's
concern is that these will be developed once the park
is established.
     Babbitt said the government must think of an
"innovative approach" to deal with the private land
holdings or purchase the properties through
condemnation.
     Although Babbitt did not directly say that he
supports "zoning" the area, he did say that he
supports a "comprehensive land use plan for the
valley to promote park purposes while affording
private landholders the maximum flexibility to
continue traditional and appropriate uses of their
land."

COURT CONSIDERS AMAX PERMIT

     With AMAX having mined out its Skyline Glady
Fork reserves, resolving the environmental concerns
delaying a new permit at the Tennessee operation has
taken on a new urgency.
     While lawyers for AMAX and OSM argue the
merits of the company's toxic materials handling
plan in a Knoxville courtroom, Skyline employees
are shipping from coal stockpiles to the Tennessee
Valley Authority's Widow's Creek.
     "Basically, we've finished mining, we're mined
out," said AMAX spokesperson Kevin Feeney.
Skyline finished work on the Glady Fork section in
mid-May. The company has enough stockpiled coal
to satisfy the customer for several weeks, Feeney
said.
     Interior Dept. ALJ David Torbett is considering
Skyline's permit request to commence mining on the
Big Brush section now that Glady Fork is mined out.
Earlier this year AMAX was successful in getting a
federal court order which reversed an OSM decision
that stopped mining at Glady Fork (MRR 2/12, p.
70).

OSM, MONTANA HOLD ENFORCEMENT MEETING;  MERIDIAN
SUSPENDS WORK UNTIL SEPTEMBER

     Montana regulators and OSM plan an informal
conference June 30 in Billings to discuss the state's
enforcement of SMCRA.
     Earlier this month Northern Plains Resource
Council asked OSM to take over that portion of the
Montana Dept. of State Lands program, which
oversees Meridian Minerals' plans for a major new
longwall operation (MRR 6/4, p. 285).
     OSM Acting Director Hord Tipton found merit in
the environmental group's concerns and instructed
the state to suspend the Bull Mountains No. 1 permit
because Montana was not effectively enforcing the
law.
     Meridian has "voluntarily entered into a cessation
of operations" until Sept. 1, said Bonnie Lovelace,
who oversees coal and uranium reclamation for the
Montana program. The company wants to commence
road construction at the coal complex prior to
Montana's snowfall season -- which hits high gear in
November, officials said.
     Meanwhile "we'll be making our points" at the
conference. The state will try to convince OSM that
Tipton's concerns have been addressed. It will also
question the legality of OSM potentially suspending
primacy in one regard to an individual permit.
     Montana officials say any shortcomings on
Meridan's Bull Mountains Mine enforcement, such
as failure to file certain public notices, hardly justify
potential suspension of primacy. State officials also
say the Resource Council has been involved in every
step of the permit process at Bull Mountains.
     OSM representatives have said their goal isn't
revoking Montana's primacy but merely ensuring
SMCRA is enforced properly.

EPA PROPOSES OFF-ROAD EQUIPMENT RULE FOR ENGINES
BIGGER THAN 50 HORSEPOWER

     It's finally come to this: a rule so big the
government can't or won't publish it in the Federal
Register.
     Twelve hundred pages of an EPA nonroad engine
regulation proposal, including uncondensable graphs
and diagrams, are available on computer disk. EPA
was kind enough, however, to publish the proposed
rule's 36-page preamble.
     According to the preamble, nonroad equipment
with engines more than 50 horsepower, including
construction, logging and mining machines, would
be regulated for nitrogen oxides (NOX) and smoke
emissions.
     Engines that would be excluded from regulation
include those that are regulated by MSHA for
underground use.
     Under authority of the 1990 Clean Air Act, which
by the way was just 313 pages long, EPA began
studying emissions from nonroad engines and
vehicles and determined that the equipment kept at
least one area of the U.S. from meeting national
ambient air quality standards for ozone and carbon
monoxide.
     A critical part of the problem, the agency said, is
the formation of ozone in and downwind of big
cities. EPA said these emissions can also cause areas
outside big cities to fall below federal standards.
     But the American Mining Congress disagrees
with EPA. Mines are located mostly in remote,
undeveloped areas and do not cause those regions to
fall below the federal ambient area standards, an
AMC source said.
     While the optimal engine cutoff size has not been
determined, engine manufacturers and other industry
sources have suggested a cutoff in the range of 450
to 750 horsepower -- a far cry from the 50-
horsepower minimum under the EPA proposal.
     Engines used to propel vehicles or power
equipment, such as mobile cranes, or those used as
auxiliary engines, such as for refrigerated trailers,
would be regulated as well.

Emission credit program proposed

     EPA has proposed an averaging, banking and
trading program for large nonroad compression-
ignition engines in the hopes of providing
manufacturers "flexibility in meeting the proposed
NOX standard without reducing environmental
benefits."
     The program would allow manufacturers to earn
emission "credits" and bank them for future
averaging or trading. The credits could then be
applied to engines that are difficult to standardize.
     Engines in California would be excluded from the
credit program because the state requires that all
engines sold there meet the NOX standard.
     If manufacturers use the program, changes in
equipment design would be minimal, according to
EPA. There would be no effects on 50- to 100-
horsepower equipment, while flexibility would be
allowed for those engines requiring substantial
changes.
     Given that all manufacturers participate in the
emission credit program, the average annual cost to
develop and make engines meeting NOX and smoke
emissions standards would be $29 million.
     EPA assumes that manufacturers will pass any
increased costs of regulation to the consumer by
raising the prices of their engines. EPA's estimated
average price increase for 1996 is $110 per engine.
     AMC says the mining industry disputes this
figure and believes that the real cost per engine could
be much higher.
     EPA's Selective Enforcement Auditing program
would require nonroad engine manufacturers to test
newly assembled engines for emissions compliance.
This section of the proposed rule was designed to
establish an annually limited number of audits for
each manufacturer.
     EPA will hold a hearing on the proposed
regulation in Ann Arbor, Mich., on June 25. Written
comments to EPA are due July 27.

ASARCO NAMED PRP AT TRIUMPH

     ASARCO Inc., the Idaho Dept. of Lands and
Triumph Minerals Inc. have been named as the
potentially responsible parties at the Triumph Mine
Tailings Piles site, which was recently proposed for
Superfund listing.
     EPA is continuing a search for PRPs and is
planning an expedited protective action to prevent
continued exposure to residents.
     A risk assessment identified arsenic as the
primary contaminant of concern. Several areas,
including tailings piles, a mine process foundation
area and several residential yards, pose acute and
chronic exposure risks from arsenic levels.
     Preliminary bioavailablity study results show
arsenic is more readily absorbed than lead. The study
was done by feeding dirt from the site to pigs.
     EPA is evaluating results of the risk assessment to
identify the arsenic concentration that should be used
as the action level for expedited response.
     For additional information contact: Chris Field,
EPA on-scene-coordinator at 206-553-1674.

Discovery

     UNITED STATES V. MIKE POLESCHOOK
AND PETER POLESCHOOK, 4/12/93, CACA
29892. OHA declared a placer mining claim void
because of lack of valuable discovery of gold,
despite the placer holder's willingness to expend
more time and effort to locate valuable mineral
deposits.
     The government brought the case before OHA on
the basis of a finding of an inspector from the U.S.
Forest Service that the Bend Ten placer mining claim
in Butte County, Calif., cannot be mined at profit.
This finding was made on the basis of the value of
the gold so far extracted and despite the fact that
Poleschook testified that he believed the gold could
be found in a deep hole on the site.
     OHA noted Poleschook had not mined in that
hole and that the hole is in accessible. This means it
would not be possible to mine it in a manner that
would be economical according to the standards of
"the prudent person." Further, the appeals panel
found, "Mr. Poleschook's willingness to expend his
labor and means is not in itself enough to meet the
prudent person test."
     U.S. V. JOHN R. PICHOWICZ, 5/12/93, A MC
303306-303313. OHA ruled eight mining claims to
be null and void for failure to discover valuable
mineral deposits, after rejecting the contestee's claim
that the government should have gone beyond the
mining work done by the contestee to identify more
valuable samples.
     OHA found BLM presented a solid prima facie
case that valuable gold deposits had not been
identified. BLM's mineral report and cost analysis
showed John Pichowicz would have to expend
$3.59/cubic yard to mine the claims, which were
located within Arizona's Muggins Mining District.
That fact was not rebutted by Pichowicz. OHA said,
though, the analysis might have underestimated the
cost to mine the claims because reclamation,
operating dry concentrations and other issues were
not taken into account.
     OHA felt BLM also overestimated the value of
the gold by failing to account for a 5-15% loss in
gold recoverability that would result from the dry
placer methods Pichowicz proposed to use. The
highest gold value BLM identified was $2.44/cubic
year. So, using the best sample, it would be expected
Pichowicz would lose $1.15/cubic yard of material
mined, OHA said.
     The contestee did not offer any substantial
evidence of discovery, but instead criticized BLM's
sampling methods for failing to reach the bedrock.
But, OHA held, "a government mineral examiner has
no obligation to explore or sample beyond the
mining claimant's workings or to perform sufficient
work to reach a definite conclusion as to whether a
valuable mineral deposit does or does not exist"
within the claim. "If a valuable mineral deposit
exists, it is incumbent upon the claimant to discover
it" at the time of the hearing, OHA held.
     OHA also rejected Pichowicz's request for
compensation for the fair market value of his claims.
"The federal government may withdraw its land from
mineral entry regardless of any right a prospector
may have to exclude others from the claim under the
doctrine of pedis possessio," OHA held.

Jurisdication

     CONSOLIDATED COAL CO. V. OSM, CH 91- 9-R,
4/12/93. OHA rejected a challenge to a NOV because the
challenge should have been brought not before the
hearings division but in a U.S. district court.
     OSM issued a NOV charging that Consolidated
Coal Co. failed to: regrade, protect and stabilize all
areas disturbed by coal mining; control discharge to
stop erosion; establish sediment control for a
haulroad; establish a permanent vegetative cover on
a disturbed area; and compact material used to
backfill and maintain drainage for the northeastern
portion of the permit area.
     Consolidated did not dispute the facts. Rather, it
claimed that OSM did not have the power to issue
the NOV because SMCRA does not authorize OSM
to issue such NOVs in states with approved
regulatory programs, such as Pennsylvania, unless
there is a finding of widespread enforcement
deficiencies within that program and no such finding
has been made, Consolidated argued.
     The ALJ said however, that Consolidated's
challenge must fail because it is well settled that a
challenge to SMCRA regulations must be brought in
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
Circuit within 60 days of promulgation of the
regulations (30 U.S.C. Sect. 1276(a)(1)(1982)). "The
District of Columbia circuit has exclusive
jurisdiction over such challenges," the judge said.

Placer Mining

     U.S. V. JAMES UBERT, RITA AUBERT,
RENEE AUBERT AND JASON OTEN, 4/12/93,
CA MC 244967-244968. OHA ruled a placer mining
operation should not be allowed when it was found
to be unprofitable, while at the same time it would
reduce the income from recreational use of a river
within the permit area.
     BLM's California office transmitted to the
Hearings Division a dispute involving the Mote A-B
and Mote C placer mining claims, which were
located in a power site withdrawal on the
Mokelumne River.
     Despite adequate notice the contestees (the claim
holders) did not appear at the hearing.
     At issue was the question whether the mining
operations would substantially interfere with other
uses of the lands covered by the claim. A BLM
geologist testified that the mining operations would
disturb nearly a mile of the Mokelumne River,
interfering with recreational uses of the river. Also,
an official with the East Bay Municipal Utility
District said siltation generated by eight suction
dredges to be used in the operation could impact the
storage capacity of the downstream Pardee
Reservoir.
     The OHA administrative law judge looked at the
revenues over five years from recreational activities
-- $2,000,000 -- that would be substantially reduced
by the mining activity. He compared that with the 20
people who would be employed by the mining
activity and the $100,000 loss the gold mining
operation would suffer over five years. Based on this
comparison, OHA found "placer mining would
substantially interfere with other land uses and that
placer mining should be prohibited" in the areas in
question.

Reclamation

     GATLIFF COAL CO. V. OSM, 5/11/93, NX 92-
6-R.     OHA sustained a NOV after ruling that
OSM's prima facia case that permit violations had
occurred was not refuted by a claim that actions
taken in violation of a permit were just as effective
as the original requirements in reclaiming the land.
     OHA faced review of a NOV for drainage
problems on a permit. OSM cited Gatliff Coal Co.
for:

     > "Failure to construct and maintain Basin 703 in
       accordance with approved plans.
     > Failure to construct [diversion ditch] No. 18 in
       accordance with approved plans."

     An OSM inspector said that Basin 703, which
was depicted in the permit as a permanent
impoundment, had been mined through. The
inspector further found that the diversion ditch
drained into Basin 704, instead of Basin 703 as the
permit required.
     The NOV required reconstruction of Basin 703
and a change in drainage from the diversion ditch.
Gatliff completed the first remedial measures and
filed for review of the NOV.
     OHA noted that in reviewing the NOV, the
burden of establishing a prima facia case would be
OSM's, while the ultimate burden of persuasion
would rest with the challenger.
     OSM "clearly carried its burden of proof," the
OHA administrative law judge held, because it
provided unrefuted evidence two aspects of the
permit were violated. Gatliff did not provide
evidence rebutting that prima facie case and
"attempted to show only that the structures it had in
place were just as effective as those which should
have been constructed." Since the rebuttal failed, the
NOV was sustained.

UNUSED FORFEITED BOND COULD BE RETURNED IF SITE IS
MINED BY ANOTHER OPERATOR

     Kentucky has submitted proposed amendments to
OSM on bond forfeitures and general provisions for
inspection and enforcement.
     Under bond forfeiture, the permittee and\or
operator, not just the operator as it stands now,
would be liable for the additional cost necessary to
achieve reclamation if the amount of the forfeited
bond is insufficient to pay the full cost of the
reclamation.
     It would also require that an unused forfeited
bond be returned to its owner if the state has not
completed the reclamation plan on the forfeited site
and the site is completely over-lapped by another
permit and completely disturbed by that over-lapping
permittee.
     Under inspections, the federal section of the rule
states that regular monthly partial inspections need
not be continued at minesites that are in temporary
cessation, although quarterly complete inspections
must continue.
     However Kentucky program rules do not provide
for a reduced inspection frequency at minesites in
temporary cessation. If approved, the new
amendment will provide reduced frequency of
inspections at such minesites.
     Copies of this file are available at the Lexington
Field Office, OSM, 2675 Regency Road, Lexington,
Ky. 40503-2922.
     Hearing requests are due June 28.

CIVIL PENALTY MODIFICATION APPROVED

     OSM has given Ohio final approval on civil
penalty language.
     The rule allows the Ohio Reclamation Board to
forward penalties or remaining penalty balances to
the Dept. of Natural Resources for deposit in the coal
mining reclamation fund.
     Other amendments had called for revisions to 13
sections of the Ohio Revised Code which concerns
the retention of State civil penalties; refund of permit
fees, confidential information regarding exemption
requests for incidental coal extraction; and both the
Reclamation Supplemental Forfeiture Fund and the
Coal Mining Performance Bond Fund.
     It also concerns the limitations on award of costs
and expenses, reclamation contracts with surface
mine operators, reclamation of interim forfeited
areas, and many others.
     However, these statutory provisions are to be
incorporated into a state bill, which had not yet been
drafted. OSM will make a decision on the language
once the legislation is introduced and a copy of the
bill sent to OSM.
     Information on the language can be obtained from
the Columbus Field Office, OSM, 2242 S. Hamilton
Rd., Room 202, Columbus, Ohio 43232.

AMENDMENTS FACE COURT CHALLENGE

     The Pennsylvania Coal Assn. is challenging
OSM-approved provisions of the state's surface
mining program that go by the adage "ignorance is
no excuse."
     An OSM-approved amendment allows the state to
assess individual civil penalties against corporate
officers who do not knowingly and willfully
participate in a violation.
     Changes also approved by OSM override
Pennsylvania's "dual opportunity" appeal process.
The state has eliminated an operator's right to appeal
a violation when a civil penalty is appealed.
     Stephen Allen of Buchanan Ingersoll said this
provision is directly contrary to a 1988 court
decision, Kent Coal Mining Co., which upheld an
operator's right to appeal both a violation and an
excessive penalty.
     The association has asked the court to
permanently enjoin the state and OSM from
enforcement of both provisions and is asking for
attorney fees.

BONDING LANGUAGE PROPOSED

     OSM has received two proposed amendments
from Pennsylvania regarding self-bonding and
financial instruments permitted for posting
performance bonds.
     The new amendment would provide the permit
applicant with the option to use a self-bond as the
financial tool instead of a surety or collateral bond
for the performance bond. Performance bond's are
must be presented before a coal mine permit may be
issued or coal mining activities can begin.
     The state also wants to amend what is accepted as
a financial instrument for a performance bond.
     The state would like to add the options of life
insurance policies, annuities or trust funds as
acceptable financial instruments for posting
performance bonds.
     Comments are due by July 7, hearing requests

TESTS CONFIRM SAGA HAS MAJOR GAS FIND IN 6406/2

Saga Petroleum, operator of last year's most significant Norwegian
discovery - 6406/2-1, southwest of Smoerbukk - is believed to be taking
a more sober view of likely recoverable reserves after an extensive
test programme confirmed reservoir variability.  According to the NPD,
a seven-DST test programme proved that reservoir quality varies greatly
over the thick gross pay section with some zones very dense while
others exhibit good production qualities.

Nevertheless, preliminary estimates confirm the find to be of major
importance containing recoverable reserves in the order of 50-100 MMcm
of oil equivalents, reports the NPD.  Informed sources suggest this
range is too conservative and 100 MMcm may be a more realistic
estimate.  Most of the reserves are in the form of gas, but large
quantities of condensate are also present.  The results of the well
currently being drilled into the southern part of the structure -
6406/2-2 - will allow the find's size to be estimated with more
certainty, according to the NPD.

The test programme is said to have yielded maximum gas flowrates of
27.534 MMcfd and 1,572 b/d of condensate through a 28.58-millimetre
choke.  It is believed the water contact proved to be higher than first
thought and the Tilje formation was a disappointment.  As expected
before testing the Ile proved to be the best zone and contains the
majority of the reserves.

Exploration well 6406/2-1 first discovered gas last Spring, but was
suspended short of TD in March due to fisheries and environmental
restrictions (NSL 1000/13).  The well was re-entered late in August
with the semisub Ross Isle and deepened to a TD of 5,766 metres, making
it the deepest exploration well ever drilled on the Norwegian Shelf.
More core material was recovered than on any other Norwegian well -
over 600 metres.  The well was finally suspended on January 7 and the
Ross Isle is preparing to spud Smoerbukk prospect appraisal well
6506/11-4S for Statoil.

AKER, ABB AND MARITIME TENTECH WIN MAJOR AASGARD SHIP CONTRACT

A consortium comprising Aker, ABB and Maritime Tentech has won the
prestigious contract to build the world's largest monohull production
vessel for Statoil's Aasgard oilfield development.  The contractors
will form an alliance with Statoil to implement the project, sharing
profits above a target price for the facilities as well as the risk of
cost overruns.  Maritime Tentech has been given responsibility for
delivering the hull, which will be built by Hitachi in Japan.  This
contract is valued at Kr 1.52bn ($239m).  Aker Engineering and ABB will
have responsibility for engineering and purchase of the plant to be
installed on the deck of the vessel, a contract which amounts to around
Kr 140m.  Aker Stord will assemble and hook-up the vessel - work valued
at Kr 300m.

The contracts with ABB, Aker and Tentech, which are subject to
government approval of the field development plan, include options of
around Kr 450m for further fabrication and marine installation.  The
vessel's deck plant, due to be purchased this Spring, is not included
in the contracts awarded to date.

The oil production vessel for Aasgard is due for delivery from Stord at
end-May 1998 for first oil in August 1998.  The ship will have a
production capacity of around 200,000 b/d of oil and gas processing
capability of up to 16 MMcmd.  Storage will be provided for 150,000 cm
of oil.  The vessel will measure 276 metres long by 45.4 metres across
the beam with a draught of 26.6 metres.

Aker also announced the Kr 380m contract for electrical work on the
Aasgard Field had been awarded to Aker Elektro.  The company will
supply systems for the production vessel and the gas platform with the
contract encompassing engineering, follow-up work at the shipyards,
hook-up, testing and commissioning plus an option for operating
maintenance and the supply of spare parts during the operational phase.
 Preparatory work will begin at once and the project is planned to
start in March 1996.  The gas platform is due for completion in October
2000.  Aker Engineering and Cegelec UK will be Aker Elektro's main
subcontractors.

At the same time Aker said Statoil had awarded Aker Engineering a Kr
30m contract to design the production systems for the Aasgard Field gas
platform.  Design work will get under way immediately and continue
until April 1997.  The scope of Aker Engineering's contract may be
expanded, depending on how the project is implemented.  A decision on
whether detailed engineering and construction will be separate
contracts will be made later this year.  If they are, Aker will carry
out detailed engineering.

ESSO CONTRACTS ABB FOR SUBSEA PART OF BALDER

Esso Norway has awarded an ABB/Coflexip Stena partnership a Kr 650-700m
($102.3-110.2m) contract to design, procure and install all the subsea
equipment for the Balder Field development.  ABB will be responsible
for the wellhead equipment and controls, while Coflexip Stena will be
responsible for the risers and flowlines.  The contract was signed just
before Christmas and engineering work has already started.  The initial
phase of the work, comprising 15 wells, is to be completed by 1998,
with equipment for the first well to be delivered by October this year.
 There is an option for a second phase involving an additional 10-12
wells.

*  Amerada Hess is thought to be close to a contract award for the
subsea part of Durward/Dauntless, with Stolt Comex Seaway believed to
be well placed.

ROCKWATER PUTS VALUE ON TELFORD EPIC

The EPIC contract for the Telford development, awarded recently by
operator Amerada Hess to Rockwater, is worth #40m ($62m), the
contractor reports (NSL 1028/3).  The work includes the fabrication and
installation of two, 180-tonne manifolds, a 100-tonne shutdown valve
structure and a 150-metre, 220-tonne riser caisson which will be
installed on the Scott production platform.  Also included in the
workscope is the provision of flowlines, services lines, control
equipment and umbilicals and the supply of tie-in spools and jumpers.

Brown & Root will handle the initial design engineering phase of the
project which is worth #1.3m, while Barmac will undertake a #3m
contract for the fabrication of the structures and riser caisson.
Pipelay and trenching will be carried out by Coflexip Stena under a
#12m sub-contract.  Installation will be carried out using the Regalia.

TEXACO ISSUES NOTICE FOR PIPELINE SYSTEM WORK

Texaco, London, has advertised a requirement for the detailed
engineering, procurement, installation, testing and pre-commissioning
of oil and gas pipeline systems in the UK Central North Sea.  The entry
is thought to refer to the proposed Galley development in block 15/23.
The pipelines are expected to be between six inches and 12 inches in
diameter and are required for the export of processed oil and processed
or unprocessed gas.  The water depth is up to 150 metres.  Pipeline
length will be between seven kms and 30 kms. The workscope may include
the design and installation of spool connections, SSIVs and platform
riser installation.

Pipelay and pre-commissioning of tie-ins is to be completed by the
third quarter of 1997.  The pipeline will link a new installation to an
existing host platform.  Replies are due back by January 18 and ITTs
are expected to be dispatched in February.

MANNESMANN WINS CONTRACT TO SUPPLY BRITANNIA LINEPIPE

Britannia Operator has awarded Mannesmann Handel a contract for the
supply of 185 kms of 27-inch OD linepipe for the export trunkline from
the platform to Mobil's SAGE terminal.  A total of 50,000-55,000 tonnes
will be supplied by Mannesmann's Europipe mill in Mulheim, Germany.
First deliveries to a North Sea coating site will be made in June and
should be completed in mid-August.  The pipe coating contract is due
for award in April.  A pipelay contract was awarded to EMC last Autumn.

BOL said that careful timing of procurement and more functional
specifications had saved several million pounds on the contract.  The
choice of an outer diameter of 27 inches on its own had saved some #2m
($3.1m) compared with opting for the larger standard 28-inch diameter
linepipe.

BARMAC PLANS MAJOR INVESTMENT IN NIGG TO MEET CONSTRUCTION NEEDS

Barmac is planning a multi-million investment programme to upgrade
facilities at its Nigg yard in the north of Scotland.  The initiative
forms part of the company's strategic plan to address the needs of the
changing offshore construction market, which has seen the decline of
traditional fabrication markets due to depressed oil and gas prices,
new technologies and the maturity of the North Sea.  At the same time
this is being offset by a growing requirement for floating production
systems, decommissioning of redundant offshore structures, production
jack-ups, concrete structures and other dry-docking work.  The new
business could become equal in size to the old within the next five
years, it says.

The Ardersier yard will continue to concentrate on servicing the
reduced requirement for traditional structures, while Nigg and its
graving dock will form the focus for the new business areas.  "Although
the traditional market is in decline, we believe it will stabilise at
around 10m manhours a year to the year 2000.  With this volume of work
available and the continuous improvement in competitiveness we can win
enough work to sustain a viable and profitable business concentrated in
the Ardersier facility," says Barmac.

Up to #8m ($12.4m) is being targeted for modifications to the existing
graving dock at Nigg and for the creation of a custom-built
decommissioning facility.  It is expected that the funding will come
from Barmac's parent companies and the public sector.  Barmac aims to
obtain planning permission and a waste disposal licence for the Nigg
site, with a capital investment of around #0.5m envisaged to establish
a custom-built facility capable of the containment and collection of
waste materials for subsequent treatment and disposal.

Other opportunities for business in an upgraded dock include building
large production jack-ups similar to that used by BP for the Harding
Field.  Possible collaboration with civil contractors to build offshore
concrete structures is also being investigated, as are the
possibilities of drydocking large semi-submersible and jack-up rigs for
inspection and modification.  "This potential major infrastructure
investment is a clear indication of the confidence our parent companies
have in our ability to win a significant share of growing new markets,
of our employees' ability to adapt in order to capitalise on these
markets and of our determination to build a sustainable future for the
yards," says Barmac general manager Don Wright.

PHILLIPS TARGETS POSSIBLE JACQUI START-UP AT END-1997

Phillips' Jacqui prospect, in UK block 30/13, could be on stream by the
end of 1997 if reserves are firmed up by two back-to-back appraisal
wells to be drilled by the Galaxy 1, according to quadrant 30
development director Pat Dinan, in a house paper.  The drilling of the
second well is contingent on what is found with the first.  Of the two
wells drilled so far on Jacqui, one indicated a gas condensate
reservoir, while the other produced gas, he said.  A high pressure/high
temperature exploration well is being drilled by the Monitor on the
Jade prospect in block 30/2C.  If it is successful, two appraisal wells
will be drilled on Jade in 1997, with first production planned for late
in 1998.

Trafalgar John Brown and Kvaerner Engineering have recently completed
some conceptual engineering studies for Phillips to help identify the
best way of developing some of the remaining quadrant 30 prospects,
confirming Phillips' view that they would benefit from a shared
development plan.  Added impetus is given by the fact that the
Judy/Joanne processing and transport system is now in place.

STATOIL ENGINEERS SEEK PATENTS FOR VESSEL AND LIFTING SOLUTIONS

Patents are being sought by Brian Stead and Ove Gudmestad of Statoil
for vessel and lifting solutions which are claimed to offer cheaper
removal and transport of topsides and jackets to land.  For the largest
platforms a U-shaped main hull is proposed with a smaller removable
hull inside.  For topsides weighing less than 1,500 tonnes a
submersible barge or ship with eight-metre steel shafts, plus a shear
leg, is proposed.  Stead, in a recent house paper, says dayrates for a
barge/ship and a shear leg would be only 10-15% of the daily cost of
the large semi-submersibles.  For jacket and subsea template removal
the suggestion is a supply vessel with winches or wire jacks attached
to its sides.

BHP ACHIEVES FIRST GAS FROM LIVERPOOL BAY HAMILTON NORTH FIELD

BHP Petroleum achieved first gas from the Liverpool Bay Hamilton North
Field on December 20.  The initial output is being used to commission
systems and pipelines offshore and onshore and subsequently PowerGen's
new power station at Connah's Quay before full contract deliveries
begin in mid-1996 (NSL  1033/5).  Oil from Douglas and Lennox is
expected to flow in the next few weeks marking the start-up of first
oil production off Britain's west coast.  Gas production from the
Hamilton Field is scheduled for early this year and from Lennox in
several years' time.  Recoverable gas reserves from the development are
estimated at 1.2 Tcf.  Peak gas capacity of the offshore development
and Point of Ayr terminal is currently 300 MMcfd.

months ahead of project schedule.  The small field will produce oil and
gas from two horizontal development wells.  Roar has been developed as
an unmanned satellite of the Tyra Field using a slimline STAR design
wellhead platform.  Oil and gas are separated and sent via two

AMERADA AND DONG ASSESS POTENTIAL OF NEW DANISH GAS SYSTEM

Amerada Hess and DONG have agreed to investigate jointly the technical
and economic feasibility of building a new natural gas transport system
in the Danish sector of the North Sea.  Depending on which technical
solution is the most attractive, the system could require an investment
of some DKr 1.5-2.5bn ($269-449m).  A new transport system would be
able to gather gas from Amerada's South Arne Field, on which a
promising production test was run last year, as well as other smaller
fields and could also be linked to the Norwegian system.  There may be
a further possibility to transport gas to Denmark from the UK, German
and Norwegian sectors.

The existing Danish system has an annual transport capacity of about
7.5 Bcm of gas, which corresponds to the total amount of gas which DUC
(until now DONG's sole supplier) is able to deliver to DONG from 1997.
With these deliveries the existing system will be nearing its capacity.
 From the turn of the century, DONG expects to be able to sell
additional gas in the region of 2 Bcm a year.

STUDY SHOWS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF AASGARD GAS WILL BE LIMITED

The environmental impact of processing gas from the Aasgard Field will
be limited regardless of whether it takes place at Kaarstoe, north of
Stavanger, or Kollsnes, near Bergen.  This is the conclusion of the
impact assessment submitted by Statoil and Saga Petroleum to the
energy/industry ministry in December.  The study covered expanding
existing gas processing facilities at the two sites as well as exports
and onshore pipelines.  Aasgard gas is relatively high in carbon
dioxide and because Kaarstoe has limited opportunities for diluting
this content by mixing in other export gas, the carbon dioxide may have
to be removed after 2005.  This does not pose a problem at Kollsnes,
which would be able to add Troll gas low in carbon dioxide before
onward transmission to Continental Europe.

The possible cost of a new fractionating plant at Kollsnes is put at Kr
4.3bn ($677m), including the landfall.  Taking the gas to Kaarstoe
would cost Kr 3bn, involving new construction and modifications to
existing facilities.

IEA FORECASTS NEW PEAK FOR NORTH SEA OIL PRODUCTION

North Sea oil output is set to reach new heights by the end of the
decade, according to the International Energy Agency.  In a new
forecast, the Paris-based agency says production will peak in 1999 at
the earliest, at around 7m b/d, or some 1.6m b/d higher than last
year's level.  Just under half of this - 3.2m b/d - will come from the
UK sector and the rest from Norway, with small amounts from minor
producers such as Denmark and the Netherlands.  The IEA believes this
year's increase will amount to 740,000 b/d, "split almost equally
between the two sectors".

The agency says the common view has long been that North Sea production
would reach its peak in the mid-1990s and fall away quite sharply after
that.  But the new peak "is substantially higher and later than recent
conventional wisdom would have suggested, with consequent repercussions
for the medium-term oil market".  The IEA also expects that the
subsequent decline will be more gentle than forecast as more large
fields are brought on stream and smaller satellite fields are developed
alongside existing ones.

The IEA says earlier estimates suggested the decline rate for the North
Sea would be more than three times as large as that now predicted.  It
attributes the surge in North Sea oil production to improvements in
recovery technology, a highly skilled local workforce and heightened
fiscal incentives for offshore oil companies.  The growing role of gas
also enables more mixed oil and gasfields to be developed.

The study also shows that original reserve estimates have tended to be
too conservative.  Technology-induced cost reductions have enabled
companies to re-classify as economically recoverable oil that was once
considered to be uneconomic to produce.  The agency notes that of the
400 oil and gas prospects identified in the UK sector during the past
30 years, only 143 had been brought into production by the end of 1994.

NIGG TERMINAL CARRIES OUT FIRST TRANSFER OF ALBA CRUDE

The first Alba ship-to-ship crude oil transfer to use the Nigg terminal
in northeast Scotland took place last December, Chevron reports.  Using
a berth at the terminal, 510,000 barrels were transferred from the
shuttle tanker Tove Knudsen to the 97,000-tonne Vesta for onward
shipment to a Chevron refinery in the Gulf of Mexico.  Previously, Alba
cargoes destined for buyers outside Europe were transhipped through the
Norwegian port of Mongstad.  But with new Norwegian fields coming on
stream the Alba asset team had to look elsewhere for a transhipment
facility.  Alba's current average production of 86,000 b/d requires
offloading from the FSU to the shuttle tanker every seven days.

*  A further #0.5m has been shaved from Britannia drilling costs
following the elimination of the entire 133/8-inch casing string from
well M4, drilled by the Sovereign Explorer at the subsea centre
location.  The drilling programme, which also involves the Sedco 711,
is already 11% ahead of schedule.

CHEVRON WINS APPROVAL TO SWITCH FROM UNST TO SCATSTA

The Shetland Islands Council has agreed to Chevron's proposal to use
the airfield at Scatsta for transfers of flights between Aberdeen and
Northern North Sea oilfields.  As a result, from April 1 this year the
company together with joint venture partners Unocal and Oryx will cease
using Unst.  Chevron procurement and logistics services manager Brian
Mountain said the decision had been based on economic factors.  The SIC
also granted outline planning permission for a hangar for two
helicopters which will be erected after flights begin.  The contracts
for airline services on the new route have yet to be awarded.  The use
of Scatsta allows the joint venture to be expanded by the inclusion of
BP, which further enhances the economics of the new routing.

CONOCO UPS MURDOCH RESERVES ON BACK OF NEW WELL

Conoco has increased its estimate of gas reserves in the Murdoch Field
from a 1994 figure of 222.5 Bcf to 351 Bcf following results from a new
production well and better-than-expected reservoir performance.  Well
D6 was drilled in an area initially thought to be unpromising after an
early discovery well performed poorly and the area had been avoided
when the field's five original producers were drilled.  However,
analysis of the geology and the results of a major 3D seismic survey
suggested the initial well had intersected a badly-faulted area,
missing the high permeability sweet spots in the reservoir.

D6 was drilled horizontally and has become the best performing well in
the field, and possibly even the best producing Carboniferous well in
the Southern North Sea, says Conoco in a house paper.  With a
horizontal section of 1,635 ft, it is also the longest horizontal well
drilled in the formation, it adds.  Existing production wells have also
performed better than expected and it is estimated they will ultimately
recover more than 90% of the gas to which they are connected.

Murdoch's field life is also likely to be extended by a number of years
following the installation of a compression platform this year and
commercial agreements with other operators to use the facilities as a
hub for developments in the area.  Agreements are being finalised for
Murdoch facilities to handle production from Shell's Schooner Field and
there are several other potential tie-in prospects in the area, none of
which would be economic on a stand-alone basis.  Further 3D seismic
will shortly be evaluated and three more exploration wells are likely
to be drilled over this year, with perhaps two more in 1997.

*  The decision to pipe excess associated gas in MacCulloch rather than
flaring it put the cost of development above Conoco's #6 ($9.3) a
barrel development target, the company says.  However, during the
design and construction phase the project will be fine-tuned to reduce
costs to meet the #6 target.

JOHN SHAW BACK IN MARKET AFTER SHELL DEFERS KINGFISHER START

The Sonat Offshore semi-submersible John Shaw is back in the market
from November 1996 as a result of Shell deferring plans to develop the
Kingfisher Field in the UK sector.  Drilling of an initial six
development wells was scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 1996
and a provisional letter of intent had been issued to Sonat for the
John Shaw subject to the project go-ahead (NSL 1037/10).  It is
understood that Shell deferred the project after the failure to find a
satisfactory export solution and concerns over prevailing low gas
prices.  No details are known of any revised schedule for the
development.  The John Shaw is currently on contract with Amerada Hess
in the UK until the end of October 1996.

Shell still has potential requirements for semi-submersibles for Curlew
Field drilling from the fourth quarter of 1996 and a possible
exploration programme starting in the second half of the year.  The
John Shaw together with the Sedco 711 are likely to be a candidates for
both these programmes should they be progressed by Shell.

TOTAL TAKING SOVEREIGN EXPLORER FOR UK AND EIRE DEEPWATER PROGRAMME

Total Oil Marine is finalising the fixture of the Sedco Forex semi
Sovereign Explorer for a five-well deepwater drilling programme in the
UK and Eire starting around August 1996.  The contract is expected to
last around a year and includes three deepwater wells in the UK sector
west of Shetland plus a well in the Porcupine Trough west of Eire.  The
programme is also understood to include a high pressure well in the
northern UK sector of the North Sea.  It is possible that one of the
west of Shetland slots could be assigned to another operator and it is
understood that Conoco could be one prospect.

The Sovereign Explorer is currently drilling development wells for
Chevron on the Britannia Field together with the Sedco 711.  Based on
current progress both rigs are expected to complete the Britannia work
in the third quarter of 1996.

ELF INVITES BIDS FOR ELGIN/FRANKLIN DRILLING

Elf has issued tender invitations for two heavy-duty jack-up
requirements for Phase II development drilling on its Elgin/Franklin
project starting in 1997 and 1998.  Water depth at the central UK
sector location is 92 metres and the programme involves drilling of
deep high pressure, high temperature wells lasting about six months
apiece.  Rig 1 is planned to start in mid-1997 and Rig 2 in mid-1998.
Both units are being offered a firm contract of 30 months plus four,
one-well options plus a further six, one-month completion options.  The
closing date for the submission of bids is February 19.

Elf has already fixed the jack-up Galaxy I for Phase I development
drilling starting in October 1996.  The Santa Fe unit has been
contracted for a firm period of 18 months but this could be extended to
six years.  It appears that, depending on the approach adopted, one of
the Phase II requirements could be against the extension of the Galaxy
I.  However, it is also possible that Elf could opt to use three rigs
on the project by drilling simultaneously on Elgin with two jack-ups.

Availability of suitable existing rigs for Elf's requirement is fairly
limited.  Another Santa Fe jack-up, the Magellan, should be free in the
third quarter of 1997, while the Rowan Gorilla II and Rowan Gorilla IV
are both currently available in North America and Trinidad from the
third quarter of 1996.  The Rowan newbuilding Rowan Gorilla V is due
for delivery in 1998.

The Maersk Guardian is expected to complete the firm phase of its
current contract with Amoco Norway in March 1998, while the Maersk
Gallant is firm with Phillips Petroleum Norway until October 1997.
However, both rigs have extension options outstanding.  A number of
contractors are planning to offer newbuilding units to Elf, but these
would only be an option for the mid-1998 programme given the lead times
involved.

BP RENEWS BENREOCH FOR A FURTHER 12 MONTHS TO MAY 1997

BP has negotiated a new fixture of the semi Benreoch for 12 months from
May 1996.  The rig was bought recently from Ben Line by Stena Offshore,
which has negotiated the new deal with BP.  The Benreoch is currently
on contract with BP until April.  It has completed a one-well
assignment to Texaco and is waiting on weather to return to BP to drill
well 9/9C-16, which is expected to last about 90 days.  The rig is then
due to undergo inspection and survey before beginning the new BP
contract.

BP still has gaps in its drilling sequence with the Benreoch but is
examining the requirements of its internal asset groups before making
any firm moves to assign slots externally.  However, it is understood
that both Conoco and Shell could be interested in taking sublets of the
rig in 1996 should the opportunity arise.  In addition to the Benreoch
fixture, BP still has a requirement for a semi to drill an HPHT well in
central UK sector block 22/25 spudding around September 1996.

*  BP has confirmed a one-well extension of the jack-up F G McClintock
retaining the rig in the southern UK sector until May 1996.  Thereafter
BP's plans are not yet firm, but it is thought likely the operator will
retain the Neddrill 7 through the year while releasing the McClintock.

of the field before proceeding in 1997 with a floating production
development.

BP is currently carrying out an early production programme on the
Machar Field with the TAPS group and the Sedco 707.  TAPS is also
slated to carry out an extended test programme on the Clair Field from
April 1996 using the Sedco Explorer.

ROWAN SECURES DUTCH FIXTURES FOR JACK-UP RIGS

Rowan Drilling has secured fixtures for two of its jack-ups in the
Netherlands.  The Cecil Provine has been contracted by Elf Petroland to
drill two wells starting early in March plus an option for a third
well.  The Rowan California has been fixed by Wintershall, also for a
two-well programme, but starting at the end of January and with options
for up to three additional wells.  The firm wells are in blocks K/10
and L/8 and are expected to last a total of 160 days.

Both jack-ups are currently in the UK but their transfer to Holland is
indicative of increasing demand in the Dutch market taking up the slack
in the UK being created partly by concerns about the gas price.  The
Rowan California is currently stacked off Great Yarmouth after being
released by Phillips Petroleum.  The Cecil Provine is drilling its
final well for Amoco after the operator chose not to exercise its last
one-well option.

Elf Petroland in turn has chosen not to exercise its final one-well
option with the jack-up Ensco 85, which it will now release early in
March.  The rig will then enter the yard a modification programme,
expected to last 10-20 days, prior to beginning a one-year contract
with NAM.

MAERSK OIL CHECKS MARKET AGAINST EXPIRY OF DANISH JACK-UP CONTRACTS

Maersk Oil & Gas has circulated a check of jack-up drilling rig
availability for potential one to three-year contracts beginning during
1996.  It is interested in rigs able to drill year-round in the Danish
sector in up to 200 ft of water.  The firm contracts of all four jack-
ups working for Maersk Oil in Denmark are due to expire during 1996.
The Shelf Explorer contract runs out in April but still has two, one-
year options available.  The Maersk Endeavour has a one-year option
left to run from June, while the Neddrill 10 has two, one-year options
from October and the Maersk Exerter a one-year option from November.

*  Conoco is still seeking partner approval to drill a wildcat in its
remaining Dutch sector acreage, probably now spudding in the second
quarter.

BHP ISSUES INQUIRY FOR UK JACK-UP PROGRAMMES

BHP Petroleum has issued a market inquiry for two UK sector jack-up
requirements.  It is interested in rig availability for one well in
Irish Sea block 110/13 spudding in April 1996 and for a four to six-
month programme in the Southern North Sea starting in June 1996.
Replies including indicative dayrates are requested by January 12.

BHP's rig options for the Irish Sea well appear to be limited.  The
Glomar Adriatic XI is already committed for much of 1996 and is
pencilled in for BHP in the fourth quarter of the year.  There appears
to be little prospect of a slot opening up for BHP in the second
quarter.  BHP already has the Trident XIV on contract through 1996 on
Liverpool Bay development work and there are currently no other jack-
ups in the Irish Sea.

A number of jack-ups are due to come available in the North Sea
including the Maersk Enhancer in February/March and the F G McClintock
in May.  However, contractors may be unlikely to make a competitive
offer to mobilise a rig from the North Sea for just one well unless it
can be pegged back-to-back with BHP's Southern North Sea programme.

NORSK HYDRO REMAINS OPEN FOR EXPLORATION SEMI FOR 1997

Although it has not made any formal moves in the market, Norsk Hydro is
looking for a semi for general exploration work in Norway in 1997 for a
period of up to one year.  The programme is not yet firmed up and
ultimately the duration of the contract is also likely to depend to
some extent on the rig selected.  With Norwegian rig availability very
tight, Hydro is keeping a close watch on the market and is maintaining
ongoing discussions with contractors to enable it to make a quick
decision when the right rig becomes available at the right price.

Norsk Hydro is also part of a consortium with Statoil and Saga awaiting
for the announcement of Norwegian 15th round licence awards before
proceeding with the fixture of a rig for a shared deepwater drilling
programme on the Voering Plateau starting end-1996 or early in 1997.

*  Amerada, Conoco, Deminex, Mobil and Shell continue to discuss the
prospects for sharing the term fixture of a semi-submersible to drill
one or two wells apiece in the Norwegian sector from around the second
quarter of 1996.  Rigs which could be available include the Byford
Dolphin or at a later date the Nanhai VI, which is in China.  However,
it remains to be seen whether rates sought by contractors to cover the
cost of the significant upgrading required for Norway will be within
the limits set by the likes of Conoco and Shell which have already
abandoned one tender round late last year as rates bid were considered
to be too high.  While examining the options for rig sharing, all five
operators also remain open to sublet opportunities on an individual
basis.

WEST ALPHA EN ROUTE FROM CHINA TO NORTH SEA

The semi West Alpha has left China and is en route to Singapore to pick
up a wet tow back to the North Sea.  The journey is scheduled to last
about 90 days.  The rig is committed to Esso Norge for a two-year
development drilling programme on the Balder Field starting in mid-
April.  Ahead of the West Alpha, the Byford Dolphin is due in the UK or
Norway between January 17 and 27 subject to weather after mobilising
from the Far East.  Dolphin is due to receive bids from seven yards for
upgrading work including installation of additional columns and a
derrick extension.  The rig is planned to be available in the North Sea
from March 1996.  The Transocean Seeker is due in the North Sea at the
beginning of February at the end of its journey from the Far East.  It
too is still available and is expected to enter the market in April.

Elsewhere in the market, the Ocean Alliance is due out of the Cromarty
Firth at the weekend to return to work for BP, while the Sedco 704 is
due in the Firth for survey work before resuming operations for Shell
on the Gannet Field as a drilling tender.

Northwest European jack-up drilling rig utilisation dipped slightly at
the end of 1995 with the release of the Rowan California by Phillips
Petroleum in the UK and the entry of the Ensco 70 to the Verolme yard
in Holland for upgrading.  The Ensco jack-up is due to return to work
for NAM at the end of February equipped with a new 15,000 psi BOP stack
among other improvements.  The California is stacked off Great Yarmouth
until the end of January when it is due to mobilise for Wintershall in
Holland.

SIRI DISCOVERY COULD BE FAST-TRACKED FOR 1998 START

Siri-1 is a "substantial" discovery, which "appears commercial" and
could be on stream by 1998, according to operator Statoil Denmark.  The
find, which late last year tested at rates of 5,988 b/d of oil (NSL
1037/20), is estimated by the operator to contain 150m barrels of
recoverable oil.  The discovery well is understood to have intercepted
a thick section of sands in a well defined but are really limited
structure.  Reservoir permeability is reported as very good.   The find
has been made in Palaeocene sandstones, outside the Central Graben
area, generating considerable excitement in the Danish Energy Ministry.
 Most Danish fields produce from chalk.

Statoil is already looking at a floating production project for Siri.
Svein Larsen, head of operations in Denmark, said:  "We will be
establishing a core team soon to get Siri quickly on stream and our
ambition is to begin production by 1998."  At the moment the favoured
concept for the field, which lies in around 60 metres of water, is an
FPSO.  This Spring Statoil will shoot 3D seismic and is planning an
appraisal in the Autumn.

The semisub Deepsea Bergen abandoned Siri-1 on December 24 and is now
back with Statoil in the Norwegian sector, where it spudded exploration
well 25/10-6S on December 26.  The  well was abandoned because the hole
was too small in dimensions for production purposes.

AMOCO ABANDONS NOEKKEN DUSTER

Amoco is in the process of abandoning Noekken prospect exploration well
2/8-15 as a dry hole, the NPD confirmed this week.  The semisub Vildkat
Explorer has been delayed by weather but is due off location later this
week when it will head to exploration well 34/11-2S for Statoil.  Well
2/8-15 was drilled to a TD of 3,725 metres and completed in rocks of
Upper Cretaceous age, said the NPD.  There was no test.

HYDRO PREPARES TO RUN ONE TEST ON OSEBERG AREA DISCOVERY

Norsk Hydro is preparing to run a single test on exploration well 30/8-
1Sre, having reached a TVD of 4,767 metres with the semisub Treasure
Saga.  The well encountered gas in Brent formations before being
deepened to examine the Statfjord beneath (NSL 1031/9).  Given that the
Brent shows were described as a significant discovery, it is likely
this horizon is being tested, which could imply the Statfjord proved
barren.  The operator would not confirm the interval which it was
intending to test.

Meanwhile, on the western side of block 30/8, Hydro has abandoned
wildcat 30/8-2 with the semisub West Vanguard, having drilled down to a
TD of 2,405 metres.  The well is untested and understood to be a
disappointment.  The West Vanguard was earlier this week waiting on
weather to get off location.  It goes next to the Oseberg Field for
development drilling duties.

VESLEFRIKK WILDCAT TURNS UP SMALL FIND

An exploration well drilled from the Veslefrikk platform to examine a
separate structure to the west, has turned up a small find, according
to the NPD.  Well 30/3-7S encountered hydrocarbons in Mid-Jurassic
sandstones before being suspended (NSL 1036/12).  The NPD said the find
was probably small, but a planned production test will establish the
type of hydrocarbons present and reservoir characteristics.  Positive
test results would lead to the well being tied back to the Veslefrikk
platform for production.  The well was drilled to a TVD of 3,994
metres.

DRILLING ACTIVITY UPDATE, NEW SPUDS AND COMPLETIONS

In the UK sector Amerada has spudded Fife development well 31/26A-A7
with the semisub High Seas Driller having completed development re-
entry 31/26A-A4 on December 28.  The semisub Kan Tan IV on December 30
spudded exploration well 21/16-4, south of the Durward prospect, for
Amerada.  The rig had previously abandoned Chevron's Irish sector
wildcat 56/15-1 after disappointing results (NSL 1037/14).  Amoco
reports the jack-up Cecil Provine completed Bessemer development well
49/23-E2 as a gas producer on December 23 and the same day spudded
Beaufort development well 49/23-E3.

Arco is waiting on weather to move off tight exploration well 50/26A-7,
which is now complete.  It is thought the well, which is believed to be
untested, will be abandoned.  The rig goes next to spud exploration
well 49/28-17 for Arco.  BP reports it is expecting the semisub Ocean
Alliance out of Cromarty by next week to spud west of Shetland
appraisal 204/25B-6.  It is not clear at this stage what prospect this
well is appraising.  It lies to the east of last year's tight
exploration well 204/25B-5, southeast of Foinaven.  Elsewhere, BP is
expecting the semisub Benreoch shortly from Texaco to spud exploration
well 9/9C-16.  The rig is carrying out some construction work in the
Erskine area, having completed development well 23/26B-20.  BP also
reports the semisub Transocean 8 has completed Andrew development well
16/28-A3 and on January 1 spudded 16/28-A4.

British Gas spudded Crosby prospect exploration well 110/14-5, with the
jack-up Glomar Adriatic XI, on December 26.  The rig abandoned
Laggantulloch prospect exploration well 111/15-1 as a tight hole on
December 23.  The well is understood to be dry (NSL 1037/14).  Over the
Christmas period Chevron has completed two more Britannia Field
development wells - 15/30-M4, with the semisub Sovereign Explorer, and
16/26-B5, with the semisub Sedco 711.  The former spudded 15/30-M5 on
December 26, while the latter spudded 16/26-B6 on December 28.

Conoco has reached TD on exploration well 15/19-7, to the north of the
MacCulloch Field.  The semisub Sedco Explorer is operating.  This well
is understood to be targeting a Piper prospect.  There has been no news
yet of any planned test programme.  On exploration well 22/19B-5,
Conoco kicked off a mechanical sidetrack with the semisub Drill Star on
January 2.  The rig is now drilling ahead.  Kerr-McGee spudded the
second back-to-back Janice prospect appraisal 30/17A-12, with the
semisub Transocean 9, on December 30.  Appraisal 30/17A-11 was
suspended after a successful test programme (NSL 1036/12).

Phillips completed Deborah development well 48/30-14, with the jack-up
Rowan California, on December 21, releasing the rig to stack.  Oryx has
been delayed completing Lyell workover 3/2-A08z, with the semisub
Neddrill 6.  This well is being converted from a producer to an
injector.  Depending on the weather the operator now expects to be able
to finish operations next week.  Shell has run into mechanical problems
on both of its current Central North Sea E&A wells.  Shearwater
appraisal 22/30B-15 has still not managed to get started on a test
programme.  The jack-up Galaxy 1 has been operating at TD since mid-
November.  NSL now estimates this well is likely to be operational
until late-February, unless Shell postpones the testing programme.  On
deep exploration well 22/29-6 the semisub Henry Goodrich is plugging
back and preparing to kick off a second mechanical sidetrack having run
into problems downhole.

In the southern basin, Shell may soon have better news to report.  The
jack-up Britannia is reported to be operating at a TD of 10,768 ft on
Hamlet prospect exploration well 49/24-20 having run 7-inch liner,
which could imply a test programme.  In the Northern North Sea Shell
reports the semisub Sedco 712 has spudded Osprey development well
211/23A-P7, having completed P4.  Texaco is understood to be close to
completing exploration well 15/29A-11, with the semisub Glomar Arctic
III.

In the Norwegian sector Amoco is drilling the first new well from the
Valhall WP platform - 2/8-F1.  The jack-up Maersk Guardian completed
batch setting casing early in December.  In the Dutch sector Amoco
reports the jack-up Arch Rowan spudded exploration well P/11-2 on
December 29.  Occidental spudded exploration well L/11-A2 on December
23, with the jack-up Neddrill 3 and NAM reports the jack-up Ensco 70
suspended exploration well L/13-17re as a gas well, following a test,
on December 21.  The rig is in port undergoing an upgrade.

ENTERPRISE BOOSTS NELSON AREA ACREAGE IN FARM-IN DEAL WITH BP

Enterprise Oil is acquiring licence interests in four blocks close to
its Central North Sea Nelson Field.  Under a farm-in agreement with BP,
Enterprise is acquiring significant equity stakes in blocks 21/9 (30%),
21/15A (30%), 21/15B (35%) and 22/12A (40%).  In return, the company is
paying BP's share of the costs of a major 3D seismic survey covering
the three blocks (NSL 1023/10).  The survey, which got under way in
October but was suspended the following month due to poor weather, is
scheduled to be re-started early this year.

In a separate deal, Enterprise is acquiring Kerr-McGee's equity in
block 21/15A, bringing its stake in the acreage to about 36.25%.  In
addition, the company has secured a 45% holding in block 22/7,
immediately northeast of Nelson.  The interest was acquired through an
acreage swap with Elf in 1994 and a cash purchase from Total in 1995.
Following the deals, Enterprise will have equity interests in 14 blocks
in the Nelson area.

"These deals provide an excellent opportunity to capitalise on our
knowledge of the Nelson area where we will now have the leading acreage
position," says Mark Hope, Enterprise's UK general manager.  "We
believe interpretation of the new seismic, together with a thorough
review of all existing data, will provide new drilling opportunities in
an area where existing infrastructure would allow small discoveries to
be developed profitably," he adds.

The Nelson Field, discovered in 1988, has been producing oil at rates
of up to 190,000 b/d since coming on stream in February 1994.  Two
existing oil finds - 21/15-2, drilled in 1981, and 22/12-1, drilled in
1988 - are to be evaluated with a view to further appraisal in the
future.

HSE INVESTIGATES UK YARD BLAST THAT CLAIMED THREE LIVES

The Health and Safety Executive is investigating the death of three
workers at Amec Process and Energy's Howdon yard, Tyneside, on December
21, following a catastrophic pressure release.  The men were carrying
out pressure tests on the pipework of a new module for Maersk Oil and
Gas's Tyra West project, when it is understood high-pressure nitrogen
escaped into the atmosphere at high velocity.  Four other men suffered
minor injuries and shock.  The HSE said:  "Our investigation will
continue until we have found the reason for the accident.  The
investigation will not only look at the physical evidence, but those
working at the site will be interviewed.  We will also examine whether
there have been any breaches of health and safety law."

The yard remained closed over Christmas and New Year, following the
tragedy, but re-opened on January 3.  However, work on the Tyra module
involved remained suspended until the end of last week while the HSE
continued its investigations.  The HSE is expected to publish a report
on its preliminary findings shortly.

ENSCO 92 ACCIDENT VICTIM DIES

The crewman injured on board the jack-up Ensco 92 late last year (NSL
1037/18), died in hospital shortly afterwards, Arco British has
confirmed.  The rig was working for Arco on exploration well 50/26A-7,
which has now been completed.  The rig is waiting on weather to move
off location to exploration well 49/28-17.  The HSE continues to
investigate the circumstances of the accident.

The crewman is believed to have suffered serious head and neck injuries
when he was hit by a high-pressure release of nitrogen gas from a
cylinder during a lifting operation.  Initial reports suggest a
"nitrogen quad" (a rack of 48 bottles of nitrogen) was being lifted by
a crane when one of the slings caught under a valve releasing gas at an
estimated pressure of 4,400 psi.  The casualty was knocked back against
the engine room bulkhead.

CONTRACTORS AIM TO TRANSFER SHARE OF RISK BACK TO OPERATORS

Contractors who have shouldered an increased burden of the contractual
and insurance risks involved in the process of offshore drilling are
now seeking to take advantage of improving market conditions to reduce
their risk profile.

At the beginning of the 1980s contractors enjoyed a period of high
dayrates and were required to carry minimal risks under typical
drilling contracts with oil companies.  With the collapse of the rig
market from the mid-1980s, contractors were forced to accept lower
rates and then increasingly onerous contractual liabilities.

Responsibility for insurance and legal requirements such as third party
risk and pollution were passed to the contractor who also had to accept
"catch-all" cancellation clauses which would allow early contract
termination under virtually any eventuality and in any event at as
little as 30 days notice.

Since the beginning of 1995, led by the North Sea, the worldwide
drilling rig market, particularly for semi-submersibles, has swung
heavily in favour of the contractor.  Rising demand, notably for deep
water operations, and tightening supply as worldwide activity picks up
have transformed the market fundamentals.

Firstly dayrates began to rise and then as availability became
increasingly perceived to be a problem, contractors have been able to
negotiate long-term contracts to replace the well-to-well fixtures
which have been the standard fare for the past 10 years.

With profitable operations and a degree of employment security ensured
for the immediate foreseeable future, contractors are now turning their
attention to off-loading some of the contractual risk as contracts come
up for renewal.  While this is being resisted by some operators, there
are contractors who consider the changes are no more than ofair and
equitable.

However, contractors may find it harder to win back the contractual
ground ceded in the 1980s than to secure higher dayrates and longer
contracts.  Oil company contracts managers are familiar with the market
and accept that circumstances have changed.  However, insurance and
legal managers are perhaps less influenced by commercial factors and
may never have known a time when oil companies shouldered most of the
risk burden in a drilling contract.

1995 IS YEAR OF NORTHWEST EUROPEAN MARKET RECOVERY

The past 12 months have been marked by a major recovery in the
Northwest European mobile drilling rig market.  This was most
pronounced in the semi-submersible sector where fleet contraction in
recent years left supply unable to cope with the increase in demand,
driving up dayrates and drawing in equipment from around the world.  In
the jack-up market the improvement was more modest and indeed it took a
recovery in Dutch and Norwegian activity to sustain the market in the
face of a fall in UK activity.

During 1995 NW European semi-submersible drilling rig demand totalled
34.6 rig years, up 23% on the 1994 total of 28.1.  In spite of this
recovery NW European semi demand is still at a relatively low level
historically.  Since 1981, annual demand has only been lower in 1987
and 1994 but activity over the past year should be viewed in the
context of a continuing recovery in demand which began towards the end
of 1994.

Further evidence of the turnaround in the NW European semi market is
signalled by a semi mobilising into the region for the first time since
1992 and 1995 was the first year since 1992 that there was a net growth
in the semi fleet which increased from 44 to 45 units.  The increase in
the number of rigs being actively marketed increased more substantially
as two cold stacked semis rejoined the active fleet during the year and
two others are being reactivated at year-end.  In addition, at the end
of the year no less than three semis are en route to the North sea and
two others are committed to follow.

Semi departures in 1995, in spite of the tightening North Sea market,
were a reflection of the growing worldwide demand for high
specification units.  Increasing deep water drilling activity in the
US, West Africa and South America created competition for rigs which
drove up rates and severely limited opportunities to mobilise rigs back
into the North Sea.

1995 NORTH SEA SEMI-SUBMERSIBLE MARKET

While semi demand rose substantially in the UK in 1995, this was partly
offset by a fall in Norwegian demand.  However, this at least ensured
that surplus Norwegian units were able to provide some relief in an
over-heating UK market.  In the UK semi demand totalled just over 26
rig years in 1995, up 42% from the 1994 total of 18.3.  In Norway, a
reduction in development drilling cut semi demand from 9.01 rig years
in 1994 to 7.91 in 1995, a fall of over 12%.

The marked increase in UK semi activity in 1995 was entirely due an
increase in demand for development drilling.  In 1994, 9.95 rig years
of UK semi demand was absorbed by exploration and appraisal activity,
while development and re-entry requirements accounted for 8.36 rig
years.  In 1995, the exploration total was almost unchanged at 9.94 rig
years while development demand increased by 93% to 16.1.

Big increases in development drilling were posted by Agip, Amerada,
British Gas, BP, Chevron, Shell and Texaco.  It is likely that
exploration demand would have also increased in 1995 but the heavy
fleet commitment to long-term development work meant there was a
shortage of equipment for short-term exploration drilling so that
postponements were not uncommon.

In Norway, there was actually a slight increase in exploration drilling
with semis in 1995 to 4.13 rig years compared with 3.73 the previous
year.  However, reductions in development operations by Conoco, Elf,
Shell and Statoil cut demand from 5.3 to 3.8 rig years.

The reduction in domestic demand and rise in UK activity and rates
encouraged Norwegian contractors to move rigs to the UK.  West
Vanguard, Maersk Jutlander and Transocean 8 moved to the UK early in
1995 on the heals of the Sovereign Explorer and Ross Isle which made
the switch in 1994.  Having faced the mobilisation of the West Alpha
and West Delta to the Far East in 1994, Norwegian operators made early
moves in 1995 to secure rig availability for a planned increase in
development drilling activity from 1996 to the end of the decade.

Statoil negotiated an historic 10-year co-operation deal with
Transocean initially signing up four semis for long-term periods
including the return of the Ross Isle from the UK.  Norsk Hydro and BP
followed with fixtures to bring the West Vanguard and Maersk Jutlander
back from the UK.  Later in the year Esso booked the return of the West
Alpha from China in 1996 for development drilling on its Balder Field
while Statoil further imposed itself on the market by fixing the
Deepsea Trym for three years.  The rig is due back in the North Sea
from Mexico in April 1996.

The return of the Ocean Alliance, Kingsnorth Explorer, Ocean Nomad and
Ocean Princess to the UK was secured on the basis of confirmed
contracts but by the end of the year the owners of the Byford Dolphin
and Transocean Seeker were prepared to take the speculative risk of
beginning to mobilise from the Far East to the North Sea without a
contract.  This was as much a reflection of the weak floater market in
the Asia/Pacific region as the drawing power of the North Sea.

The great importance of a relatively small number of operators in
underwriting the bulk of UK demand was again emphasised in 1995.  The
top three operators of semis, Amerada, BP and Shell accounted for 55.1%
of total UK semi demand in 1995.  This was slightly down on their
market share in 1994 of 56.8% but in absolute terms these `Group 1'
operators clocked up a total of 14.34 rig years of semi demand in the
past 12 months compared with 10.4 rig years in 1994.

The next tranche of UK operators generating more than one rig year of
demand have been classed above as `Group 2'.  In 1995, there were four
operators in this group, Chevron, Mobil, Texaco and Total amassing a
total of 5.62 rig years of semi activity.  In 1994, only two operators,
Kerr-McGee and Texaco accounted for 2.45 rig years in this intermediate
category.

The remaining operators with less than one rig year of activity apiece
are classed as `Group 3'.  In 1995 there were 12 companies in this
category accounting for a total of 6.08 rig years of demand compared
with 17 companies and 5.46 rig years of demand in 1994.  The reduction
in the number of smaller operators and the below average increase in
activity by Group 3 operators is believed to be a consequence of the
tight semi market in the UK in 1995 which prevented a number of smaller
operators proceeding with short-term exploration programmes.

The forecast of UK activity split in 1996 is based on current drilling
intentions with an adjustment to allow for the postponement of some
planned work due to high rig rates, lack of availability and failure to
secure partner approval.  Any curtailment in activity resulting from
tight availability is expected to impact particularly on Group 3 plans.

An analysis of Norwegian operator activity reveals that the big three
of Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Saga actually sustained semi activity in
1995 at 6.43 rig years compared with 6.39 the previous year.  The
reduction in Norwegian activity was in fact due to a drop in demand
from other operators from 2.62 to 1.48 rig years.

Dayrates surge in 1995 on back of semi shortage

While it was November 1995 before every marketed semi in the region was
on contract and working, it was as early as February 1995 that 100% of
marketed semis had a contractual commitment.  Apart from a slight blip
at the end of the year when Rig 42 re-entered the market (although it
is not operational until April 1996) the `contracted utilisation' has
remained at 100% ever since.  Since March 1995, the North Sea Rig
Forecast Availability Index which measures rig availability in the
upcoming three month period has remained almost continually at zero.

With `contracted utilisation' at 100% and availability at zero, the
inevitable consequence was strong upward pressure on dayrates which
effectively doubled during the course of the year.  At the beginning of
the year the dayrate range for a standard short-term fixture of a third
generation rig in the UK was #20,000 ($31,200) to #36,000 ($56,000).
The fixture which set the top of the range was scheduled for an August
start while the bottom the range was fixed by a one-well fixture of a
second generation unit.  A third generation semi was fixed in January
for a 12-month period at $40,000 a day, while a similar unit was fixed
to drill a high pressure, high temperature well at #28,000 ($43,680).

As operators scrambled to secure availability for 1995 and beyond rates
rose rapidly.  As early as March a second generation semi was fixed for
three months from mid-year at $70,000 a day.  A number of operators
attempted to resist the dayrate tide, setting negotiating limits at
$60,000 and then $70,000 only to see these swept aside.  Towards the
end of the year the acceleration in rates inevitably levelled out so
that the range for short-term, standard fixtures finished the year at
#44,500 ($69,000) to #48,500 ($75,000).  The range for term fixtures
for this class of rig at the end of 1995 was #48,500 ($75,000) to
#54,800 ($85,000).

While activity in Norway fell in 1995, dayrates were buoyed by UK
demand and the rise in UK rates.  However, taking account of higher
operating costs, Norwegian sector rates generally lagged UK rates for
much of 1995, a reversal of the historical norm.  The squeeze on rig
availability in the region did ensure that at least some Norwegian
contractors were able to secure contributions from operators towards
the mandatory pipe-handling upgrades which came into force in 1995.

In January 1995, the dayrate range for a short-term fixture of a third
generation semi in Norway was $55,000 to $60,000.  By the end of the
year the range is considered to be $85,000 to $91,000.  Term fixtures
of third generation units began the year in the range $65,000 to
$72,000 and ended the year in the range $75,000 to $95,000.

While Statoil agreed standard term fixtures with Transocean for four
semis starting in 1996 at rates between $75,000 and $85,000, late in
the year an operator grouping of Conoco, Shell and Elf dropped plans to
fix a semi for two years because they were not prepared to pay in
excess of $85,000 and in some cases over $100,000 for an upgraded
second generation semi.  Shortly after,  Statoil stunned contractors by
fixing a 20-year old semi Deepsea Trym (ex La Muralla) for three years
at $75,000 but it remains to be seen whether Statoil's message to the
market has the salutary impact that may have been intended.

No Norwegian semi fixtures broached the $100,000 barrier in 1996,
partly due to operator resistance and partly the lack of pure fourth
generation demand.  However, in the UK a number of semi fixtures were
concluded at dayrates above $100,000.  The contract which led the way
was for deepwater drilling in 1997 and 1998.  Mobil fixed the Jack
Bates for five wells in water depths up to 4,500ft west of Shetland at
a dayrate of $118,000 plus a lump sum of $12.5m to cover mobilisation
and upgrading.  A slot was assigned to Marathon for a deep water well
off Eire at a rate believed to be in the region of $144,000 including a
pro rata apportionment of the lump sum costs.

At the beginning of 1995 rates for short-term, high specification
fixtures in the UK were in the range #28,000 ($43,000)to #43,500
($68,000).  By the end of the year the range was #52,000 ($80,000) to
#71,000 ($110,000) for fixtures starting in 1996, a virtual doubling
over the course of the year.  At the end of 1995 deep water demand
remained high worldwide maintaining upward pressure on rates at the top
of the market.

INCREASE IN DEMAND IN HOLLAND AND NORWAY OFFSETS UK REDUCTION

In spite of an 8.6% fall in UK activity, demand for jack-ups offshore
Northwest Europe grew in 1995 by 8.4% compared with the previous year.
Rising demand in Holland and Norway compensated for the UK slippage.
There was also a slight reduction in Danish demand while the first well
was drilled offshore France for 10 years.

In 1995 jack-up demand in the region totalled 31.79 rig years, compared
with 29.33 the previous year.  UK activity slipped back from 17.86 to
16.33 rig years with one factor being the initial impact of the
reduction in UK gas prices arising from the continuing privatisation of
the gas supply industry.  In Holland, there was a recovery from the
very low level of activity in 1994 when there was concern about the
fiscal regime and prospectivity.  As a result demand rose in 1995 to a
total of 7.06 rig years compared with 4.88 the previous year, an
increase of almost 45%.

Norway also posted an increase in jack-up activity in 1995 as long-term
development drilling operations got underway on a number of fields in
the Southern Norwegian sector of the North Sea.  Demand totalled 4.74
rig years including time spent in the yard by two rigs which were
upgraded on contract.  This compared with a total of 2.67 rig years in
1994.

Danish activity slipped back slightly in 1995 to 3.46 rig years
compared with 3.92 the previous year but after a cutback to three
drilling units in 1994, Maersk Oil & Gas resumed a four-rig operation
in the fourth quarter of 1995.  Amerada Hess was the only other
operator to drill offshore Denmark with a jack-up in 1995 although
Statoil drilled a well at the end of the year with the semi Deepsea
Bergen.

In the UK, British Gas has lost two-thirds of its market share in the
industrial gas supply sector and now faces the loss of its domestic
monopoly from 1997, some five years earlier than previously expected.
As a result the former state utility has over-contracted and is faced
with managing a growing surplus of gas.  While the problem is a
temporary feature of the liberalisation of the supply industry it is
expected to take some years to work through the system.

As a consequence of the fall in gas prices Conoco deferred plans to
develop the Viking Fs field, where two development wells were planned,
and suspended its contract with the Neddrill 4.  Gaps opened in Shell's
drilling sequence with the jack-up Britannia as drilling to sustain
contract deliveries to British Gas was deferred.  In the second half of
the year some operators experienced problems securing partner approval
for planned exploration wells due to the weak medium term outlook for
UK gas prices.  Other early consequences such as Phillips postponement
of additional drilling on the Judy Field and Shell's delay in the start
of its planned Shearwater development had no impact on the 1995 jack-up
market.

The NW European jack-up fleet was relatively stable in 1995, starting
the year totalling 34 units and ending the year at 35.  Early in 1995
the Neddrill Trigon left for Argentina and a contract with Total.
Effectively this was the only departure of a North Sea rig during the
year although the Perro Negro 5 arrived from Italy to drill a well for
Elf in the Bay of Biscay offshore France and then left again.  Apart
from the brief visit of the Saipem jack-up there were two other
additions to the jack-up fleet.  Global Marine completed the extensive
upgrading of the former British Gas accommodation/slant drilling unit
Bay Driller which entered competitive operations as the Glomar Adriatic
XI.  Santa Fe brought its heavy-duty jack-up Monitor back from
Australia where it had been mobilised by Esso in 1994.

Looking at UK jack-up demand in terms of operator activity, just three
companies, Mobil, Phillips and Shell maintained more than two rig years
of activity during 1995.  In total these three `Group 1' companies
accounted for 7.05 rig years of activity.  There were five companies,
Amoco, Arco, BHP, BP and Conoco in the `Group 2' middle range which
each clocked-up between one and two rig years with jack-ups in the UK
accounting for a total of 6.83 rig years of demand.  The remaining
eight `Group 3' operators which generated less than one rig year of
activity apiece accounted for a total of just 2.3 rig years of activity
in 1995.

This profile of operator activity is somewhat different from 1994 when
overall UK activity was slightly higher.  Group 1 activity was less in
1994 with just two operators, Phillips and Shell amassing a total of
5.7 rig years between them.  There was more Group 2 activity with six
companies, Amoco, Arco, BP, Conoco, Elf and Mobil maintaining a total
of eight rig years of jack-up activity.  Group 3 comprised a total of
13 companies which generated a total of 4 rig years of demand.

Like the semi market the UK jack-up market in 1995 was reliant on a
smaller number of operators.  There were fewer operators drilling just
one or two wells in 1995 than in 1994.  This was a consequence of a
drop in UK jack-up exploration activity (see below) which may have been
partly due to smaller operators dropping planned wells due to reduced
gas price expectations and partly due to the generally tight North Sea
jack-up market which left few opportunities to secure a rig at short
notice.

The outlook suggests no individual operator will sustain more than two
rig years of demand during 1996, increasing the proportion of Group 2
and Group 3 operators in the market.

UK jack-up development drilling up, but exploration down

Development drilling and production related operations using jack-up
units increased in the UK in 1995 by almost 27% in spite of the slight
overall drop in UK demand.  The converse is that jack-up exploration
operations measured in terms of rig demand dropped by 47% compared with
1994.

Increases in development drilling and re-entry operations by Amoco,
Arco, Conoco, Lasmo, Mobil and Phillips lifted activity to a total of
11.9 rig years in 1995.  However, an across the board fall in
exploration drilling resulted in jack-up demand for e&a work falling
from 8.5 rig years in 1994 to 4.5 in 1995.

Partly exploration fell in 1995 because the UK upstream activity cycle
had moved into a development drilling phase, but in the second half of
the year fears about weak gas prices in the medium term had an impact
on exploration.  The tight rig market in the region also left few
opportunities for smaller operators to pick up a rig at short notice.
It is evident from the analysis above that fewer small UK operators
drilled with jack-ups in 1995.

Development drilling and production-related activity with jack-ups also
increased in the Netherlands in 1995.  In 1994, there was just 2.37 rig
years of jack-up demand on development operations but in 1995 this
increased to 4.33 as a result of additional activity by Unocal,
Wintershall, Occidental and NAM with only Elf Petroland bucking the
trend by increasing its commitment to exploration in 1995.  There was
also a slight increase in jack-up demand for exploration drilling in
Holland in 1995 with 2.67 rig years of demand generated compared with
2.52 in 1994.

Jack-up rates rise on balanced market

The Northwest European jack-up market maintained a fairly close
supply/demand balance in 1995 and while rates rose significantly at the
beginning of the year they quickly reached a plateau.  Although
utilisation levels were broadly similar to the semi market, the jack-up
market lacked both the severity of the short-term semi shortage and the
fears about medium term availability which sustained the semi rate
rise.

In 1995, utilisation of jack-ups averaged 87.2% calculated on the basis
of rigs in employment and 98.8% based on the percentage of marketed
rigs with current or future contract commitments.  This compared with
83.8% and 92.5% respectively for the same measures in 1994.

After being weak for much of 1994, jack-up availability began to
tighten at the end of the year and then all but disappeared by March
1995, at least on a short-term basis.  The North Sea Rig Forecast
Availability Index which remained in the range of 20-40% throughout
1994, fell to 18% at the end of 1994 and then quickly to zero by the
end of March 1995.

At the beginning of 1995 the dayrate range for short-term jack-up
fixtures for standard UK sector operations was $26,000 to $29,000.  By
March 1995 the range was $35,000 to $45,000 and changed relatively
little the rest of the year apart from some firming of the bottom end
of the range to a maximum of $41,000 in the fourth quarter.
In spite of the rising rates and tight short-term availability there
was no switch in the UK from short-term to long-term fixing and through
much of the year fixture volume remained low so that there was little
upward pressure on dayrates after the initial hike in the first
quarter.  The term fixtures that did take place mirrored or slightly
lagged the short-term range indicating contractors shared operators
views that medium and long-term availability was not a concern.  At the
very end of the year there were indications of the bottom-end of the
range falling away slightly due to rising first quarter availability
but this was based on evidence from the Dutch sector.

The market for heavy-duty jack-ups in the UK in 1995 was influenced
more by semi rates than the jack-up market.  Short-term rates began the
year in the range $55,000 to $65,000 and ended the year between $80,000
and $90,000.  The peak rate for this class of rig during the year was
for a long-term contract starting in the fourth quarter of 1996 which
was fixed in October 1995 at $105,000.  In the first half of the year a
term fixture was concluded for Central UK sector operations in 1996 at
$75,000.

In Norway, rates for heavy-duty jack-up fixtures ranged from a low of
$72,000 for a one-well in-fill fixture, to a high of around $106,000
for one-year plus options starting in the fourth quarter of 1996.
However, two other term fixtures in Norway were closer to the bottom
end of this range at initial rates of $75,000 and $82,000.

Dayrates in the Netherlands in 1995 were similar to those in the UK
ranging from just over $30,000 at the beginning of the year to a peak
of just under $42,000.  Two term contracts were agreed under floating
rate mechanisms linked to the market.

NORTH SEA RIG FORECAST via NewsNet
January 9, 1996

NORWEGIAN SEMI SUPPLY COULD INCREASE FURTHER

Statoil's fixture of the semi Deepsea Trym (ex La Muralla) for a three-
year period from May 1995 ensures the return of yet another semi to the
Norwegian sector in 1996 although it will be nine years since the
Odfjell purchase last worked in the North Sea as the Nortrym.  The
Deepsea Trym is due to leave Mexico in February to mobilise to the
North Sea.

The Norwegian sector semi fleet currently totals nine units but  with
the confirmation of the mobilisation of the Deepsea Trym is on course
to increase to at least 12 by May.  The West Alpha left China in the
first week of 1996 to begin a three month tow back to the Norway where
it will begin a two-year contract with Esso in April.  The Maersk
Jutlander has for some time been committed to return from the UK to
Norway in May 1996 to begin a 27-month contract with BP.

While the current forecast for Norwegian activity in 1996 is based on
12 rigs in operation from May, it remains possible that the total could
be 13.  Without a 13th semi moving into Norway it will be difficult for
Amerada, Conoco, Deminex, Mobil and Shell to drill planned exploration
wells in 1996.  However, Conoco, Shell and Elf earlier abandoned a
tender to fix a semi for two years from 1996 due to high dayrates and
the low technical merit so of the rigs offered.

Now Conoco and Shell are considering the options again with a view to a
potential co-operation with Amerada, Deminex and Mobil.  Drilling rigs
under consideration are believed to include the Byford Dolphin,
currently en route speculatively from the Far East, and the Nanhai VI,
currently in China but being marketed by Stena Drilling against a
potential purchase.  Whether a contract is agreed is very much
dependent on the commercial aspects of the deal.  All the operators
also remain interested in sublet opportunities with other Norwegian
operators.  For example, it may be that Statoil could have some slots
available in its schedule with the Deepsea Trym but this is not yet
clear.

A number of other issues remain outstanding before the 1996 Norwegian
sector semi picture is finalised.  Statoil has still to fix a second
additional exploration semi contract to start during 1996.  The fourth
generation Transocean semi Ross Rig remains available from the third
quarter of 1996 and would appear to be the most flexible solution for
Statoil if commercial terms can be agreed.  Norsk Hydro, Saga and
Statoil await the outcome of the 15th Licence Round awards before
selecting a rig for anticipation deep water operations from the end of
1996 or early in 1997.  While Saga remains a proponent of the EfEx
approach of using a converted second generation unit, it is thought
Statoil may prefer a more conventional fourth generation unit.  This
might be another reason for fixing the Ross Rig for 1996 exploration
slot.

Statoil is also considering bids from Halliburton, Smedvig and
Transocean for construction and operation of a novel Swath catamaran
vessel for completion and workover operations on the Aasgard Field.
However, it is understood that tender prices are well above the level
that Statoil envisaged in its initial evaluation of the concept and it
remains to be seen whether the project can survive a higher capital
cost.

In the UK, some of Shell's plans for the latter part of 1996 remain
unclear.  The company has deferred its planned Kingfisher development
on which pre-drilling was scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of
1996.  A letter of intent had been awarded to Sonat Offshore for the
semi John Shaw to drill at least six wells.  The John Shaw is now back
in the market but Shell could still take the rig for one of two
potential outstanding requirements.

It needs a semi for four to seven wells on the Curlew development,
again from the fourth quarter of 1996 but it is not yet clear whether
Shell will operate the semi itself or will leave that to the lead
contractor for the project development as a whole.  Shell also has a
requirement for an additional semi for an exploration programme in the
UK from sometime in the second half of 1996.  If no suitable rigs are
available from Shell's Win 90s lead drilling contractors then this
programme could be deferred.  However, as well as the John Shaw from
Sonat, the Sedco Forex semi Sedco 711 is also available from the third
quarter.

Shell is also understood to have indicated an interest in taking an
assignment of the Benreoch from BP but it is not yet clear whether any
slots will be available.  BP has extended the Benreoch for 12 months
from May 1996 but as yet does not have a full programme for the rig.
Vacant slots could still be filled internally by BP but it is
understood that both Conoco and Shell have been approached as potential
sub-lessors should BP fail to fill the schedule.  Elsewhere BP
continues to await development approval for the Schiehallion Field
before making rig commitments for the drilling programme from late 1996
and early 1997.

TRENT CUTBACK ILLUSTRATES UK JACK-UP MARKET FRAGILITY

The vulnerability of UK jack-up demand in 1996 to cutbacks was
illustrated in December by Arco's decision to terminate its contract
with the Maersk Enhancer.  Arco has decided to drill one less well on
the Trent platform so that the rig is available from early February
although the notice period for contract termination is not up until mid-
March.  Previously Arco had planned to drill on Trent until June
followed by some exploration drilling during platform installation
before returning, potentially with the Enhancer to undertake completion
tiebacks until late in the year.

Ranger's Southern UK drilling plans for 1996 have been blowing hot and
cold as the implications of the gas price outlook are digested by the
operator and its partners.  Until late in 1995, Ranger was planning
more than one well in the third quarter of 1996.  Then the whole
programme appeared in danger but now it seems to be back on the rails
though with perhaps just one well surviving.

Uncertainty also surrounds Wintershall's Windermere development in
blocks 49/9B and 49/4B.  Project go-ahead is still outstanding and the
longer it is delayed the more difficult it will be for Wintershall to
start development drilling in 1996.

In November, BP cutback its southern UK sector drilling plans and
trimmed the F G McClintock contract back from one year from November
1995 to just one well.  Now BP has firmed-up a second well for the rig
and will keep it until May 1996.  BP's Southern UK jack-up programme
still remains somewhat uncertain thereafter.  It is expected that it
will retain the Neddrill 7 in the second half of the year but is
thought likely to release the McClintock.

While some southern UK gas exploration and development drilling plans
for 1996 continue to be fragile, increasing Dutch activity continues to
take up the slack.  Allowances made for anticipated UK cutbacks and
assumptions made about Dutch activity mean that there is no net change
in the 1996 forecast of jack-up demand which remains at 34 rig years.

As expected Occidental has extended the Neddrill 3 in Holland from June
until February 1997 and is shortly due to take delivery of the Neddrill
4 for a one-year programme.  Elf Petroland has fixed the Cecil Provine
for two wells plus an option from March 1996 when the rig is due to be
released by Amoco in the UK.  However, the Arch Rowan, which in
December moved from the UK to Holland to drill a well for Amoco, is
likely to return to the UK for Amoco in the first quarter before
crossing back to Amoco in Holland in the second half of the year.

Wintershall is close to fixing a jack-up for a Netherlands programme of
two firm wells plus three optional wells from March 1996, an earlier
start than previously expected.  The Rowan California is believed to be
emerging as a front-runner for the contract.  The rig was stacked off
Great Yarmouth in the UK at the end of 1995 after being released by
Phillips Petroleum.  Conoco Netherlands is still waiting for partner
approval to drill a 21-day exploration well which is unlikely now
before the second quarter at the earliest.

The Neddrill 9 still has a two to three-month gap in its schedule from
April ahead of a well for RWE-DEA and a 300-day contract with Clyde
Netherlands which is due to start in August although a start as late as
October is still possible.

In the UK, Elf has issued tender invitations for the provision of two
jack-ups for the second phase of development drilling on the
Elgin/Franklin project, each for a firm period of 30 months plus
options for four six-month wells and six one-month completions.  One
rig is for delivery mid-1997 and the other mid-1998.  It is believed
that one of the requirements is effectively a market check against the
Galaxy I which Elf has already fixed for a minimum of 18 months from
October 1996 but this has not yet been confirmed.  Newbuildings are
expected to be bid to Elf for the 1998 commencement but this could
prove to be in competition with the Galaxy.  The earlier start date
could suit the Magellan or the Rowan Gorilla II and Gorilla IV (both in
the US) while the Rowan newbuild Rowan Gorilla V is not due to be
delivered before 1998.

It is now clear the jack-up Neddrill Trigon, currently in Argentina,
will return to the North Sea in 1996 although the arrival date is still
subject to Total options.  The earliest arrival is May and the latest
is September.  The rig is believed to be in line for a two-year
contract with Saga in Norway for a development drilling programme on
the Varg Field, although possibly not starting until late 1997.
However, Saga has yet to confirm the fixture although it is expected to
do so later in January.

STATOIL SENDS MARKET SIGNAL WITH DEEPSEA TRYM FIXTURE

Statoil sent a strong signal on rates to Norwegian drilling contractors
when it fixed the second generation semi Deepsea Trym (ex La Muralla)
for a firm three year period from May 1996 at a fixed dayrate of
$75,000.  The rig is currently in Mexico and it appears that Statoil
will not directly compensate mobilisation and upgrading costs likely to
be well in excess of $10m.  Odfjell Drilling purchased La Muralla
against the Statoil contract for a price believed to be in the region
of $27m.

Other Norwegian contractors have recently been bidding second
generation rigs into Norway at rates in excess of $100,000 a day.
Apart from making a significant saving over a three-year contract
Statoil may also be hoping that it can use its dominant market position
in controlling half the Norwegian sector semi fleet to put a cap on
rapidly rising rates.  It would appear to be signalling to contractors
that it is not prepared to accept any rate even if it might be dictated
by the market at large.

In the UK a term fixture of a third generation semi confirmed the
current market range at up to $85,000 while a fourth generation semi
was fixed for a deep water well west of Shetland in 1996 at a rate of
$110,000.

Rates for jack-up fixtures in Holland in December are thought to have
been coloured by the anticipation of increasing rig availability in the
first quarter of 1996.  As a result fixtures were agreed at rates
believed to be around $38,500 and $39,000 a day.  In the UK a short-
term fixture was agreed at a rate believed to be in the region of
$41,000 based on a tender round which closed at the end of October.

N.Y. RESTRUCTURING RECOMMENDATION: ISO TO OVERSEE MOVE TO RETAIL ACCESS

Establishing an independent system operator to formalize wholesale
competition in New York and ensure transition to retail access is a key
part of restructuring the state's electric industry, according to a state
judge and a state regulator.
   The recommended decision in the state's Competitive Opportunities
proceeding also calls for separating transmission and distribution from
generation and for recovering stranded costs with an access charge imposed
by a distribution company (Doc. No. 95-E-0952).
   The recommendation was filed Dec. 22 by the state's Dept. of Public
Service Administrative Law Judge Judith Lee and Ronald Liberty, deputy
director for the Energy and Water Division. Subject to review by the Public
Service Commission, it aims to lower New York's high electricity rates and
keep industry in the state.
   No timetable for the ``as soon as possible'' transition to retail access
has been established, however, a PSC spokesperson told Northeast Power
Report.
   Key parts of the more than 200-page review are:
   -- Strandable costs ``may be made unrecoverable by the transition from
regulation to a competitive market for electricity.'' These costs could be
recovered by a separate mechanism outside the market, such as a
non-bypassable access charge or wires charge imposed by a distribution
company.
   -- Transmission and distribution should be separate from generation ``in
order to limit the exercise of market power,'' and T&D companies will need
to serve all would-be buyers in the short term.
   Lee said she saw as ``critical'' the reliability of the bulk power
system, noting that it should not be sacrificed in any way in order to
achieve the potential price reduction that may be associated with a system
of retail access. Therefore, ``effective competition at the wholesale level
should be established first, with an eye toward adding retail access as
rapidly as possible once a market is established and reliability is
ensured.''
   Lee's recommendation was a ``tremendous disappointment'' to New York
industrials ``and to any advocate of full and open retail competition,''
said Barbara Brenner, counsel to Multiple Intervenors, the industrial users
trade group. ``It delays, without schedule, retail competition and, in
fact, appears to delay even the implementation of wholesale competition for
two years,'' she said.
   Utilities, on the other hand, like the proposal. Their trade group, the
Energy Association of New York State, applauded the law judge's
recommendation as ``a thoughtful approach to what is clearly an incredibly
complex series of issues.''
   ``Wholesale competition to the extent that the Energy Association has
been talking about is far more significant than what might exist today in
New York--and in most other places,'' said Howard Shapiro, the
association's president.
   On the legislative front, New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
(D-Manhattan) unveiled a proposal calling for an immediate freeze of
electric rates and setting a goal of cutting them by 25%.
   Further, under Silver's plan, utilities would be required to buy power
in a competitive wholesale market by September 1997. By September 2000,
``if conditions ensuring safety, reliability...and access to a reasonably
priced power are met,'' customers would be able to choose their own power
suppliers.
   Industrials reacted in similar fashion to Silver's proposal. ``We're
studying [it] carefully. We don't think it moves fast enough. We would like
to see retail competition by Jan. 1, 1997,'' Brenner said.
   The Energy Association's Shapiro said he was pleased that at least
Silver recognized that ``competition alone doesn't produce a dramatic
short-term reduction of rates and that other issues must be addressed.''
   Gov. George Pataki also weighed in on the issue in his Jan. 3 State of
the State address, calling restructuring ``a major sea change facing our
state and our nation,'' and citing the Long Island Power Authority's plan
to take over Long Island Lighting (NPR, 22 Dec '95, 1).

PSNH, CONNECTICUT VALLEY ELECTRIC SLAM N.H. PUC RULING ON UTILITY
FRANCHISES

   In a closely watched case, Public Service of New Hampshire and
Connecticut Valley Electric have filed detailed arguments to the New
Hampshire Supreme Court against a June 1995 Public Utilities Commission
determination that electric utilities in the state do not have exclusive
franchises.
   In a Dec. 18 filing in a case involving Freedom Energy's request to
compete against PSNH for retail customers (Doc. No. 95-610), PSNH charged
that a series of major state court opinions and legislative actions since
1911 had created a legal pattern ``incorporating the economic model of a
regulated monopoly in which service by a single provider was the essential
principle.''
   PSNH listed a long series of instances in which the state acted on the
assumption that exclusive utility franchises existed and said that the 1995
PUC decision against exclusive franchises ``in effect overlooked the forest
for the trees.''
   ``By insisting on a specific `tree' explicitly providing for exclusivity
in electric utility franchises,'' PSNH said, ``the PUC majority missed the
forest of authority'' that created an economic model based on exclusive
franchises.
   PSNH also said the court should dismiss PUC claims that the state
constitution guaranteed open competition in the electric utility sector.
   It said previous court decisions had recognized the unique nature of
electric service and the practical need for monopolies in the sector. The
creation of the PUC in 1911 to oversee such ``sanctioned monopolies'' was
in harmony with the other constitutional safeguards against monopolies.
   PSNH also invoked the state's ``administrative gloss'' doctrine, saying
that the PUC's consistent rulings in the past in favor of exclusive
franchises plus the legislature's failure to interfere with the
interpretation created a ``binding gloss'' which deprived the PUC of the
right to unilaterally change its policy now.
   It said this administrative gloss approach was needed because nothing in
state law explicitly authorized either competing franchises or exclusive
franchises. This ambiguity made the long-standing PUC interpretation of the
law the crucial element in determining current law.
   In a third major argument, PSNH said that the fact that the New
Hampshire legislature passed a detailed bill in June 1995 creating a
process to study ways to increase electric industry competition showed that
the PUC did not have authority to make decisions on the issue.
   It said that the authority given to the PUC in the bill to carry out a
retail wheeling pilot was restrictive and fell ``far short'' of the powers
claimed by the PUC to set policy.
   Instead, PSNH said, the message from the 1995 law was that ``the
legislature would set policy while the PUC would assault the legislature by
gathering relevant information through the pilot program.''
   In its filing to the state Supreme Court, CVE said that the PUC decision
on the franchise issue ``created an imbalance in the regulatory equation''
in the state. ``The PUC order revokes the utility's right to be the
exclusive supplier within its service territory, but does not relieve the
utility's corresponding obligation to serve all customers regardless of
economics.''
   CVE also noted that the legislature had a record of involvement in the
policy issues of utility franchise exclusivity and that unless it delegated
authority in this field to the PUC, the court should assume the power
itself.
   Representatives of the PUC and Freedom Energy are expected to file their
comments to the court in mid-January. The court will hear oral arguments in
the case in February (NPR, 10 Nov '95, 10).

   General Motors wants an outside party to install and operate a 25-MW
cogeneration system at its Linden, N.J., truck plant so it can cut costs
and focus on its manufacturing business.
   The project would be developed by Quixx Corp., a subsidiary of
Southwestern Public Service. Based in Amarillo, Tex., Quixx would own and
operate the plant, although GM said it may take an ownership stake. Most
power would be used in house, though some excess would occasionally be sold
to Public Service Electric & Gas, which now supplies the plant. PSE&G
charges industrials about 7.5 cents/kWh.
   GM has asked the N.J. Board of Public Utilities for an order declaring
that the project would not be regulated as a utility (Docket No.
EE95100486). This is a technicality that non-utility generators usually
seek in New Jersey, and GM pointed out that the plant would not supply
power or steam to other end users. However, the company is asking the BPU
for expedited treatment of the declaration, ``due to intense economic
pressures and the planning needs of GM Linden for a prompt go/no go
ruling.'' According to GM, the factory serves as its export plant for small
trucks and sport vehicles, a market ``which seems to gain new competitive
entrants each year.'' It expects that the cogeneration plant could be
brought on-line in 18-24 months.
   The factory was built in 1936, and it still uses the original thermal
plant to provide steam, heat and compressed air for vehicle production. GM
attorneys Potter & Dickson, Princeton, N.J., pointed out that the plant
employs 2,700 workers, and said, ``Without the [project], the long-term
viability of the Linden assembly plant remains jeopardized by competition
internal to General Motors and from competition by other producers of small
trucks and sport utility vehicles.'' Aside from the energy savings--which
were not disclosed--shutting down the old oil-fired boilers would reduce
emissions and compliance costs.
   Thomas Noble, manufacturing engineering manager, told the BPU that the
old energy plant will have to be replaced in the near future, and that such
an investment would detract from the plant's manufacturing business.
Instead, he said, ``installation of a new, state-of-the-art, on-site total
energy system, operated by a third party of experts, will enable GM Linden
plant managers and personnel to concentrate their time, attention and
investment decisions on GM's core business...''

MMWEC SEES TRANSMISSION, MARKET POWER ISSUES AS IMPEDIMENT TO NEPOOL
REFORM

   Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric, saying it was speaking for
consumer-owned utilities in New England, has warned the investor-owned
utilities in the region that no reform of the New England Power Pool system
will be possible without resolution of outstanding transmission and market
power issues.
   In comments presented to the NEPOOL executive committee, MMWEC said that
the ``NEPOOL Plus'' plan for revising pool operations proposed by Northeast
Utilities veered from the group's basic purpose of assuring reliability at
the lowest possible cost for all consumers (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 3).
   It said that while NU's ``piecemeal'' plan would introduce bidding for
dispatch, it would also ignore other key issues.
   MMWEC predicted the NU plan would ``ultimately fail'' unless it included
a comprehensive solution to all pool issues. It said that the NEPOOL
management committee, where all members were directly represented, should
debate the proposed changes, rather than the executive committee.
   MMWEC said the bid-based pooling system would not work unless there was
regional network service, under which all participants had equal access and
equal pricing.
   It said this could be done through contractual arrangements such as
those discussed in previous regional transmission group negotiations. Such
a system, run by a neutral entity, should eliminate unequal contract path
and pancake pricing problems while still compensating owners of
transmission for their investments, MMWEC said.
   A bid-based system, as proposed by NU, would not work well in a truly
competitive market, MMWEC said, because larger NEPOOL members would have
the ability to manipulate the system by controlling either a significant
amount of generation or specific functional resources, such as 10-minute,
non-spinning reserves.
   MMWEC said manipulative actions or improper responses to market signals
by large members ought to be prohibited. It said that this rule could be
policed by a neutral body which would hear complaints and levy sanctions.
   The muni group said that pool rules should be made in the interest of
the end user and that voting representation should remain limited to
members which serve retail load. This would avoid giving power inside the
group to players in the market which did not have a direct responsibility
toward retail customers.
   MMWEC said that any plan for bid-based dispatching must require
disclosure of spot market and bilateral deals, including price information
and availability of bids.
   It noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already
raised questions about NEPOOL transmission rules, most recently rejecting a
plan to allow increased bilateral energy sales in the region because the
transmission implications had not been addressed.
   While the MMWEC proposals present a challenge to the large New England
utilities, they also contradict many points contained in the NEPOOL reform
plan proposed by the Competitive Power Coalition of New England which calls
for more rights in NEPOOL for non-utility members, the formation of an
independent system operator for transmission and a totally free market
approach to the pool.

NUG/MARKETER GROUP WANTS INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR TO REPLACE NEPOOL

   The debate over the future of the New England Power Pool heightened last
week when the Competitive Power Coalition of New England circulated a draft
proposal calling for replacing NEPOOL with an independent system operator
(ISO).
   Titled ``A Blueprint for a Competitive Electricity Supply System in New
England,'' the report said it offers ``an alternative to mere incremental
adjustments currently being proposed by NEPOOL incumbents.''
   The Boston-based advocacy group for independents and power marketers
dropped out of NEPOOL reform talks in October to pursue its own plan
because it believed the group was moving too slowly, according to John
Howat, CPC executive director. Northeast Utilities recently proposed a more
modest reform that introduces bidding for NEPOOL dispatch in a two-phase
process. Called ``NEPOOL Plus,'' that plan has won widespread support among
NEPOOL members, according to NU (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 3).
   CPC planned to meet this week with utilities to discuss its blueprint,
which it describes as ``evolutionary not revolutionary,'' keeping the
strong elements of NEPOOL and transforming them into an independent system
operator. For example, the ISO would probably maintain the same personnel
that are now employed by NEPOOL and use the same facilities.
   However, the ISO would coordinate transmission delivery based on
contracts between buyers and sellers, rather than NEPOOL's current economic
dispatch. A FERC-regulated network, it would have no corporate or business
link with utilities or other market participants and no members, governance
board or voting rules.
   To maintain system reliability, the ISO would control some generation,
procured through competitively secured contracts, or calls on generation
assets.
   The blueprint envisions an electric power system with six components:
supply, supply aggregation, system operation, load aggregation,
distribution and consumers.
   While delivery would be provided at regulated prices, supply would be
fully competitive, with energy service providers serving as the chief
interface with customers. The report envisioned many entities filing the
energy service provider role, including marketers, aggregators and utility
spin-offs.
   The energy service providers would contract with generating companies,
transmission companies and distribution companies to buy power and delivery
services that could then be packaged and resold to retail customers. Energy
service providers might also provide additional services, such as bundling
a power sale with metering and associated equipment services.
   The blueprint also gives customers the option of bypassing the energy
service provider and buying power directly from the wholesale market, an
approach more likely to be pursued by large customers than small
customers.
   CPC recommended that utilities unbundle generation, transmission and
distribution assets through divesture, a concept that some major New
England utilities have already rejected. CPC said it supports stranded
investment recovery and opposes forced contract re-negotiation between
independents and utilities, an approach pushed by some utilities to lower
stranded costs.
   ``Our members are willing to look at renegotiations where a
renegotiation would result in a mutually beneficial position,'' Howat said.
``A pressure for forced renegotiation is really not a good way to move
toward a system that is based on contracts. What does that say to the
financial community?''
   ``Clearly had prices gone up dramatically, instead of gone down, and had
demand for power risen dramatically, I don't think the entities that are
clamoring now for renegotiations of contracts would be singing that tune,''
he said.
   CPC expects to issue a final report in early January.

D.C. PSC OPENS COMPETITION PROCEEDING; SEEKS WRITTEN COMMENTS BY END OF
MARCH

   The District of Columbia Public Service Commission has opened a formal
proceeding on electric competition and is seeking written comments from
interested parties (Case No.945). Those will be due 90 days after the PSC
issues its order on the Dec. 15 pre-hearing conference, which is expected
early in the new year.
   In launching the case, the PSC cites open-access rules proposed by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last spring. Although these only apply
to wholesale transactions, ``the impact that the adoption of the rules
would have on retail electric sales should not be overlooked,'' the PSC
stated. Although electric rates from Potomac Electric Power are low for the
region--averaging 7.2 cents/kWh--the PSC ``recognizes that, if this fact is
to remain true, the commission must be prepared to take steps to allow a
greater reliance on competition and customer choice.''
   Further, ``increasing competition among sellers of electricity will
result in increasing choices for buyers,'' the PSC said. However, it could
also affect reliability, planning, economic development and the
environment. Allowing retail competition could also allow new suppliers to
lure away PEPCO's larger commercial customers, stranding fixed costs that
would fall on remaining ratepayers. Therefore, the PSC wants to explore
these issues before taking any steps to open the system.
   Among the questions that the PSC would like to address are: whether the
PSC should refrain from instituting retail wheeling until wholesale markets
develop; what impact retail wheeling would have on various classes of
ratepayers; what specific steps the PSC could take to encourage wholesale
and retail wheeling; and whether the commission should order PEPCO to
disaggregate generation, transmission and distribution.
   In addition, the PSC would like estimates on how much capacity would be
stranded, and how those costs should be allocated. It also seeks comments
on whether demand-side management and environmental programs should be
continued under competition, and how they would be funded. PEPCO said it
welcomes the investigation, though it noted that questions regarding the
role of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) must be
addressed by FERC.
   Comments should be addressed to the Commission Secretary at the District
of Columbia Public Service Commission, 450 Fifth St., N.W., Washington,
D.C., 20001. Correspondence should reference Case No. 945 and the title
``In the Matter of the Investigation into Electric Services, Market
Competition and Regulatory Policies.''

GREEN MOUNTAIN POWER RESTRUCTURING PLAN WOULD PUT GENERATION UP FOR BID

   Green Mountain Power has filed a restructuring plan with Vermont
regulators which proposes to use an auction system to determine the value
of stranded generation investments and power purchase commitments.
   The auction would not be a forced asset divestiture and the owner of the
generation assets being sold could bid against other groups to retain
them.
   The plan, filed with the Vermont Public Service Board Jan. 2 (Doc. No.
5854), would deregulate generation and the sale of electricity while
keeping transmission and distribution service under state regulation.
   Retail customers would be offered competitive options for power
supplies, one of which would be a ``basic electric service package,''
including regulated services from the franchise distribution company and
``lowest cost available'' power supplies.
   GMP said the division between regulated and competitive sectors would
let the marketplace establish pricing for those parts of electric service
which would benefit from competition while preserving a single provider
system where that would be more efficient.
   In a statement, GMP said the auction approach is intended to avoid a
major hang up over the issue of how to determine stranded costs and
revenues. Instead, it said, the market would take care of that
determination.
   GMP said its plan was based on 14 principles for restructuring reached
last July by a Vermont state roundtable on electric industry restructuring.
This included utility recovery of ``reasonable'' stranded costs and the use
of a monthly wires charge to fund conservation, renewables and low income
support programs.
   GMP said that under its plan, the distribution companies would have
direct responsibility for carrying out such service programs.
   The Conservation Law Foundation, which consulted with GMP on the
restructuring plan, immediately issued a statement supporting the GMP
proposal, saying it would continue GMP's demand-side management effort at
about its current $4 million/year level.
   CLF said that by supporting a committed stream of stable funding for
conservation and renewables, GMP was taking a position already supported by
New England Electric System in its restructuring model for New England,
issued in October, 1995.
   The PSB proposed in December that utilities in the state submit
restructuring plans by mid-May 1996. It also proposed a series of
roundtable discussions early in the year after which it will issue
recommendations for specific restructuring plans (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 8).
   GMP is the first utility in the state to submit a full plan and clearly
hopes to get an edge in guiding the upcoming discussions and PBS decisions
over the next six months. It said it hoped to work with other groups in the
state to turn the Green Mountain plan into the ``Vermont Plan.''
   While Vermont Gov. Howard Dean (D) had proposed going to retail choice
by the end of 1997, the PSB has not yet proposed a date for actual
restructuring to begin.

GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION TO BE SPLIT WHEN BGE AND PEPCO
COMBINE

   Baltimore Gas & Electric and Potomac Electric Power will split
generation, transmission and distribution into distinct units when the
companies merge, which is expected in 1997 (NPR, 29 Sept '95, 1).
   They said this separation will ``position the company to better serve
specific customer needs and to be prepared for potential changes in the
utility industry as competition increases.'' The gas business will also be
operated separately, and there will be a distinct District of Columbia unit
to focus on the district's ``unique'' regulatory, legislative and community
relations needs.
   The utilities have also announced that the merged company will be called
Constellation Energy Corp. That is now the name used by BGE's independent
power subsidiary, which has 276 MW of equity in 27 operating plants and 10
more projects under development. The utilities did not say how that unit's
name will be affected.
   After the merger, BGE chairman Christian Poindexter will serve as chief
executive officer of Constellation and PEPCO chairman Edward Mitchell will
be chairman of the board. John Derrick, PEPCO's president and chief
operating officer, will fill those same offices with Constellation, while
Edward Crooke, BGE's president and COO, will become vice chairman of
Constellation, overseeing strategic planning and subsidiaries.
   In the separation of electric functions, the following appointments were
made: Robert Denton, senior vice president for generation; Ronald Lowman,
vice president, fossil; Charles Cruse, vice president, nuclear; William
Sim, vice president, generation support; Thomas Brady, group vice
president, distribution; Andrew Williams, group vice president,
transmission; and Sharon Hostetter, vice president for marketing.

HOLYOKE MUNI WANTS TO TAKE OVER DAM FROM NORTHEAST UTILITIES SUBSIDIARY

   The city of Holyoke, Mass., has begun an effort to take control of the
30.8-MW Hadley Falls hydroelectric station on the Connecticut River which
is now owned by Northeast Utilities subsidiary Holyoke Water Power.
   The 50-year federal license for the dam expires in 1999 and Holyoke said
it plans to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to award the new
operating license to municipal utility Holyoke Gas & Electric.
   Under the plan, the Holyoke muni would add 33 MW of new capacity to the
dam and use the power both to lower costs for its own customers by 17% and
attract new power users to the area based on the low-cost supplies.
   At the same time, NU officials said that Holyoke Water Power intends to
apply to FERC to renew its license to operate the dam. Applications must be
filed to FERC by June 30, 1997.
   The city of Holyoke's plan won support from local voters by a 4 to 1
margin in a non-binding referendum in November 1995. During the campaign,
the city claimed the project would provide benefits to the city of between
$160 million and $250 million over the first 25 years through a combination
of lower cost power, job creation and improved property values.
   It also stressed that the benefits of the dam should go to the city
residents, a clear dig at NU, HWP's out-of-state corporate ownership.
   The city has begun a process to get input from public groups and
agencies and prepare a plan for presentation to FERC. It has asked for
comments by Jan. 28.
   In initial discussions, an intervenor committee for the city of South
Hadley, Mass., which is across the river from Holyoke, has said it will
emphasize in its comments the need for the eventual licensee to remain
financially viable during power industry restructuring in Massachusetts.
   South Hadley also said it wants a full exploration of the environmental
issues involved in expanding the capacity of the dam and whether it would
be environmentally preferable to end all power production at the site.
   Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric has assisted the city with
developing plans for financing the takeover and may possibly provide
financial assistance if the project went ahead.

MOODY'S SEES FALLING UTILITY RATINGS RESULTING FROM INDUSTRY DEREGULATION

   Credit ratings of utilities in the Northeast are particularly vulnerable
to electric industry restructuring, according to a new Moody's Investors
Service report.
   Compared to those in neighboring regions, investor-owned, municipal and
state electric utilities in the Northeast ``with above-average costs are
likely to experience a deterioration in credit quality as some investments
are unrecoverable from customers through rates,'' the agency said in a
prepared statement announcing publication of its report, ``Northeast
Break-Even Analysis,'' authored by vice president and senior analyst Julie
Doetsch, and Tim Fremont.
   Contributing to this deterioration are expensive nuclear and fossil fuel
assets and power purchase contracts with independent producers, much of
which may end up as stranded following deregulation, Moody's said. It
estimated that stranded costs in the Northeast total $43 billion, or 145%
of the combined equity of the utilities in the region. This represents a
quarter of all stranded costs of all U.S. investor-owned utilities.
   ``Moody's does not believe that the Northeast utilities can be shielded
from the negative impact of price competition,'' the agency said. It added
that it expects ``that many of these utilities...will be forced to bear
some of the financial pain associated with the transition. This scenario in
turn may result in a diminished equity cushion available to debtholders,
thus pressuring ratings.'' It said the weighted average rating for
utilities in the region is ``Baa1,'' below the industry average of ``A3.''
   In analyzing the Northeast, Moody's examined ``all major rated utilities
within two transmission interconnnects of Consolidated Edison of New
York,'' including 25 investor-owned utilities in Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island and Vermont, plus two public power and two Canadian utilities. The
utilities represent over $153 billion in assets, $29.7 billion in equity
and $48 billion in annual revenues.
   Moody's looked at each utility's cost structure to find what price it
must charge for electric power to ``break even'' and cover its variable and
fixed costs. Hydro-Quebec and the New York Power Authority, relying
primarily on relatively cheap hydropower, fared best cost-wise in this
analysis, while United Illuminating and Long Island Lighting, both at
$105/kW, and Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric, at $99/kW, had the
highest break-even costs.
   Moody's also found that power purchase contracts with NUGs affect the
cost structures of two out of three utilities in the region. ``The most
severely impacted are the small northern New England utilities. When
purchased power is included,'' Moody's said, ``the break-even prices for
Central Vermont Public Service, Central Maine Power, and Bangor
Hydro-Electric each increase over 400%.''

CALPINE SEEKS EWG STATUS FOR PLANTS IN N.J. IT WOULD ACQUIRE FROM O'BRIEN

   Calpine Corp. has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to
classify two New Jersey projects as exempt wholesale generators. However,
it plans to sell all capacity from the projects to Jersey Central Power &
Light under renegotiated contracts that cut rates, but obligate JCP&L to
pay all gas costs.
   The 122-MW project at DuPont's Parlin facility and the 52-MW Newark
Boxboard plant would be acquired from O'Brien Environmental Energy, which
is under Chapter 11 protection of the federal bankruptcy code.
   Last summer, Philadelphia-based O'Brien agreed to sell all of its assets
to Calpine for $107 million and the assumption of $90 million in debt (NPR,
21 July '95, 13). However, NRG Energy, the affiliate of Northern States
Power, later challenged the sale and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark,
N.J., agreed to hold an auction, where other firms could bid for O'Brien.
The court was scheduled to begin hearings on Jan. 3 to consider the offers.
Calpine general counsel Joseph Ronan said he is optimistic, since O'Brien
had rejected an NRG offer before the original takeover deal was struck.
   Although EWG status allows power producers to operate ``merchant''
plants, selling to various buyers, that is not Calpine's intention,
according to Ronan. He said the San Jose, Calif., firm plans to sell all
electric output from the plants to the current buyer, JCP&L. However, it
wants to avoid disputes over qualifying facility status under the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA).
   That law requires certain efficiency standards for both electric and
thermal output, and JCP&L challenged the QF status of both O'Brien plants
after prolonged outages due to a fire in Newark and technical problems at
Parlin. If a project loses its QF status, the utility can revoke contract
terms and pay only its avoided cost--as Rochester Gas & Electric recently
sought to do to a Kamine/Besicorp project, before a federal court granted a
temporary QF waiver (NPR, 8 Dec '95, 11). Calpine had already faced the
problem when its Watsonville, Calif., plant lost its steam host, Ronan
noted.
   Before applying for EWG status for the New Jersey plants, Calpine
renegotiated the power sales contracts with JCP&L, Ronan said. The new
terms provide JCP&L with more dispatching at Parlin and rate changes at
both facilities. Under the new Parlin contract, only 41 MW of the 122-MW
plant will be considered ``base capacity (though that can rise as high as
50 MW under certain conditions), while the balance is divided into several
levels of dispatch capacity.
   For the Parlin base load, JCP&L will make capacity payments of 5.97
cents/kWh during the on-peak period, and no payments off-peak. For the
dispatchable capacity, the utility will make fixed capital payments of
$9.90/kW/month through 2003, and $6.40 afterwards, though Calpine may elect
to levelize all payments at $9.02. In addition, JCP&L will pay $3.50 in
1995 for operations and maintenance, adjusted annually.
   At the Newark plant, JCP&L will pay a base rate of 4.325 cents/kWh,
adjusted according to various indices. In the original O'Brien contract,
JCP&L was paying 6.17 cents.
   In both cases, JCP&L would pay for all costs of natural gas, supplying
the projects from the gas pool that parent company General Public Utilities
has set up (NPR, 15 Sept '95, 14). Although it started that pool to cut
costs for its own peakers, GPU said it would also allow non-utility
generators to participate if they agreed to renegotiate contracts.

JCP&L SEEKS $18-MILLION RATE RECOVERY FOR BUYOUT OF CROWN/VISTA CONTRACTS

   Jersey Central Power & Light has asked the New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities to let it collect $18 million in rates to cover the buyout of two
100-MW contracts with an independent power producer.
   JCP&L reached a settlement with the developers of the Crown/Vista coal
project after a long dispute that wound through the BPU, state courts and
the state legislature (NPR, 15 Sept '95, 9). The 362-MW coal project was
originally proposed by Mission Energy and Fluor Daniel in 1989, but Fluor
Daniel later sold its stake to Ahlstrom Development and Entergy Power
Development. When the partners concluded they could not bring the twin coal
plants on-line by the 1997 ``sunset dates,'' they were granted an extension
by the BPU.
   The utility--which chose 200 MW of the project in a 1989
solicitation--said it no longer needed the capacity and successfully
challenged the extension in state court (NPR, 26 May '95, 6). The
developers then got the backing of some state lawmakers to force the
extension, but the buyout was announced before their bill cleared the
legislature.
   To terminate the contracts, JCP&L agreed to pay $17 million, but it is
asking to collect $18 million in rates, to cover all of its costs. That
would be recovered in blocks of $6-million over each of the next three
years. The utility defended the request, saying purchases from the
Crown/Vista project would have cost $700 million above market prices over
the lives of the contracts.
   JCP&L is looking to collect the funds through the Levelized Energy
Adjustment Clause (LEAC), which passes along energy costs and other
expenses without profit. In its $37.7 million request, the utility is also
looking to recover $19 million in demand-side management costs.
   Metropolitan Edison, another unit of General Public Utilities, also
terminated its 100-MW contract with the Crown/Vista developers, and has
asked the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for rate recovery. That
buyout cost $30 million because of the different timing of the contracts
and the costs incurred by the developers.

N.Y. PSC CONSIDERS RECOMMENDATION TO REVISE AVOIDED-COST CALCULATIONS

   An administrative law judge in New York's Public Service Department is
recommending new long-run avoided cost calculation methods that would more
accurately reflect industry costs. Adoption by the Public Service
Commission of the new method could result in an increase in the costs
incurred by utilities and ratepayers in doing business with independent
power producers, according to the recommendation.
   The recommendation, issued Dec. 19 by administrative law judge Rafael
Epstein, is part of another recommendation to establish a process for
setting fuel targets and buyback rates. Both cases (93-E-0912; 93-E-1075)
were combined in January 1995. Briefs opposing the recommendations are due
Jan. 8, 1996; final briefs are due Jan. 25.
   The recommendation to revise calculation methodology endorses in
principle independent power producer Sithe Energies' proposal to adopt the
`firm method' for estimating avoided energy costs, not the `non-firm
method' now employed by the PSC and favored by the utilities and staff.
Epstein recommends exploring the firm method's application before using
it.
   The recommendation calls for a generic annual proceeding based on a
unified data base, a conclusion supported by staff and Sithe, but opposed
by the utilities. As it is now, fuel targets and buyback rates are
determined in utility-specific rate proceedings. Epstein recommends that
the commission should narrowly limit the permissible scope of
company-specific adjustments prompted by individual utility's objections
provided in the computer model's data base produced in the generic case.
   Epstein also recommends that the commission adopt four previous rulings
as the basis for determining which computer model inputs should be deemed
trade secrets. He urged that data ought to be considered a trade secret
only if the information is competitively useful and would not be readily
ascertainable by competitors in an unregulated market.

NEES CANNOT CHARGE FIRM TRANSMISSION RATE FOR PART NON-FIRM SERVICE: FERC

   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has told New England Electric
System that it cannot charge a full firm transmission rate for service to a
group of Massachusetts municipals unless it actually provides them with
firm service.
   In a Dec. 29 order, FERC said that NEES could not charge the firm
service rate to carry 35.4 MW of preference power to the munis from the New
York Power Authority since it was providing firm service for only 17.7 MW
of the load (Doc. No. ER96-200-000).
   It approved for filing a firm service charge for the 17.7 MW and
required NEES to file within 30 days a new, lower cost rate for the
less-than-firm service it was offering for the rest of the load.
   NEES originally filed the transmission rate proposal on Oct. 31, 1995,
saying that it was the result of negotiations with Massachusetts Municipal
Wholesale Electric.
   According to NEES, it was not obliged to offer any firm service to the
municipals and as part of the negotiations it had voluntarily agreed to
provide the 17.7 MW of firm capacity at MMWEC's request. In return, MMWEC
agreed to pay the firm rate for the entire 35.4-MW load.
   The group was under pressure to secure the capacity to bring in the
low-cost power from NYPA's Niagara Falls and St. Lawrence projects.
However, the town of Norwood questioned the arrangement and said that in
the past FERC had always required NEES to provide lower rates to the group
for non-firm service.
   In its order, FERC agreed with this argument, saying that the mere fact
MMWEC agreed to pay the high rate did not make it legally acceptable. Also,
the fact that NEES was voluntarily offering 17.7 MW of firm service as part
of the deal ``was not a sufficient justification for charging a firm rate
for transmission that is less than firm,'' FERC said.
   According to FERC, NEES could collect the full rate for the firm
service, but it had no right to charge ``excessive'' rates for the non-firm
service.
   FERC also granted a waiver of the normal 60-day notice period to allow
the rate to take effect at once. The parties had originally aimed at
beginning service by Nov. 1, 1995.
   Currently, the NEES firm transmission tariff is about $16/kW/year. The
FERC order said that NEES did not have to offer the municipals its standard
non-firm rate but instead could propose a rate reflecting the fact that the
non-firm service agreed to in the negotiations with MMWEC would provide
some advantages over normal non-firm service.

HOULTON, ME., WATER CO. GAINS NEPOOL MEMBERSHIP; BUYS FROM BOUGHT-OUT NUG

   The New England Power Pool has agreed to allow the Houlton Water Co. in
Houlton, Me., to become a member, although it is not located within the
NEPOOL control area.
   The publicly owned utility in northern Maine is connected to the rest of
New England through New Brunswick Power and was asked to make specific
promises to NEPOOL on meeting capacity responsibility requirements in order
to join the group.
   In 1994, Houlton decided to drop wholesale purchases from Maine Public
Service, which is located in the same area. Instead, it decided to take
12.5 MW of supplies from a biomass power plant in Fort Fairfield, Me.,
taken over by Central Maine Power through an earlier buyout deal.
   Houlton switched to the CMP supplies effective Jan. 1, 1996, and under a
proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Dec. 11,
1995, it will become a NEPOOL member Feb. 1.
   NEPOOL said in its FERC filing that because of the link through Canada,
Houlton would require scheduling arrangements inside the NEPOOL dispatching
system different than those used by other members. These were being worked
out with Houlton.
   Also, NEPOOL said, Houlton would not have to include in its adjusted
load 3.4 MW from the Maine Yankee plant which is backed up by New Brunswick
Power resources.
   Separately, Houlton and MPS are continuing a dispute before FERC over
the level of transmission costs MPS will be able to charge Houlton for use
of its system to wheel power from the Fort Fairfield plant (Doc. No.
ER95-836-000).
   MPS proposed a general transmission tariff in April, 1995, based on a
levelized rate calculation system which would result in a $35/kW/year
charge (NPR, 14 April '95, 5).
   Houlton claims this rate is exorbitant and called it a ``back door
attempt'' by MPS to cover stranded investment costs.
   With the case still before the judge, no FERC decision on the
transmission rate is likely for several months. Under the current
arrangement, Houlton begins accepting service from MPS on Jan. 1 at the
proposed MPS rate. But it will be entitled to a rebate if FERC later
decides to lower that rate.
   In its arguments to FERC, MPS stressed that its proposal was based on
new FERC guidelines for transmission ratemaking. Also, it said that former
wholesale customers such as Houlton were not entitled to special low rates
from MPS and should pay the same generic rate offered to other customers.
   Houlton argued that because MPS' transmission plant is old and heavily
depreciated the levelized system did not apply. But MPS said that it
planned major new improvements to its transmission system and a levelized
approach was appropriate.

MAINE YANKEE OUTPUT TO BE LIMITED TO 90% DUE TO COOLING PUMP CONCERNS

   The Maine Yankee nuclear plant will only be allowed to operate at 90% of
full capacity, or 820 MW, when it returns to service early in 1996 after a
12-month outage to repair cracked tubes in the plant's steam generator.
   The derating is being imposed on the plant by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission based on claims by an anonymous whistleblower that the plant's
emergency core cooling pumps could not handle the reactor if it was
operating at full power.
   The claims, received by the NRC in early December, said that plant
operators knew about the problem in the late 1980s but nevertheless asked
NRC to upgrade the plant capacity to 910 MW. The derating will effectively
put the plant back to its original rating.
   The derating will be in effect until the NRC does a thorough review of
the situation, including the computer modeling techniques used to determine
proper safety levels. It is not clear how long the review will take.
   In the meantime, Maine Yankee officials were awaiting a memo from the
NRC detailing the exact operating conditions for the plant. Once they
receive it they expect to restart the reactor immediately.
   Maine Yankee has just completed a major project to sleeve the tubes in
its two steam generators to prevent cracking (NPR, 26 May '95, 10). The
project cost plant owners, including Central Maine Power, Northeast
Utilities and New England Electric System, $30 million in repair costs and
$60 million in replacement power costs.
   The loss of the 90 MW of capacity due to the derating will create a new
financial burden although plant officials could not predict the cost at
this time. A spokesman for CMP said that the actual cost will depend on
whether the winter is colder than usual and more peaking power is needed
and also on the availability of extra hydro capacity in the region based on
higher than usual water levels.
   The claims about the coolant system have no connection to the steam
generator repairs which plant officials said went well and came in only a
few days late and under budget.
   Maine Yankee president Charles Frizzle said that with the sleeving done
there was no reason to think that the plant would not be able to function
normally for the rest of its license period, which ends in 2008.
   Anti-nuclear groups have questioned this. Also, Standard & Poor's has
raised concerns about Maine Yankee's ability to maintain plant performance
over the long term, issuing a downgrade of Maine Yankee's corporate credit
rating in December.

1,100-MW SALEM NUCLEAR UNITS TO RETURN TO SERVICE IN SECOND AND THIRD
QUARTERS

   Public Service Electric & Gas expects to bring the Salem nuclear units
back into service in the second and third quarters of 1996. Each unit
generates 1,100 MW for a consortium of utilities that includes PSE&G (43%
ownership), PECO Energy (43%), Atlantic Electric (7%) and Delmarva Power
(7%).
   The plants were shut down in May and June for unrelated problems with
heat removal equipment and switch gear cooling fans (NPR, 23 June '95, 7).
Although these were not major flaws, station operator PSE&G came to an
agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to keep the plants down
for extended outages in order to thoroughly inspect the problems and take
preventive steps (NPR, 4 Aug '95, 10).
   The Salem station has been plagued by recurring shutdowns, and the
restart plans call for improving human performance, operations,
maintenance, equipment reliability and other areas.
   PSE&G originally expected Unit 1 to be operating by the first quarter of
1996 and Unit 2 by the second quarter, but those schedules have now been
pushed back. The utility has been purchasing power in the wholesale market
to make up the shortfall, while PECO already has excess generating
capacity.

PSE&G OPENS 150-MW CAPACITY BLOCK IN ITS DSM `STANDARD OFFER' PROGRAM

   Public Service Electric & Gas will be seeking 150 MW of capacity from
energy efficiency projects over the next two years.
   That block was set by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in a
recent ruling on the utility's demand-side management program for 1996-97
(Docket No. EE95090415). PSE&G had originally requested a one-year, 75-MW
standard offer, but DSM advocates pushed to expand the plan and the BPU
agreed.
   Under the standard offer program, PSE&G makes blocks of capacity
available and pays its avoided cost to energy efficiency projects. Since
1993, the utility has been accepting bids for a 150-MW block, and in the
recent case the BPU expanded that Standard Offer No. 1 to 185 MW for
proposals submitted by Jan. 2, 1996.
   The new 150-MW solicitation is designated Standard Offer No. 2, and will
be broken into three 50-MW blocks. These will provide declining payments,
since additional capacity will reduce the value of savings to the company,
and thereby, its avoided cost. That figure now stands at $5.45/kW/month for
capacity and about 2.6 cents/kWh for energy. However, the first 50-MW block
of the new standard offer will set prices 27% lower, while the second block
will be priced 33% below Standard Offer No. 1 and the third block will be
set 38% below it.
   The BPU made allowance for a fourth block with no defined size at prices
that would be 44% lower than Standard Offer No. 1. There will also be a
15-MW residential ``carve-out,'' with at least half of that reserved for
low-income residences. For those projects, prices will be set 14% higher
than Standard Offer No. 1 for the first half of the contract period and 33%
lower for the second half.
   In addition, PSE&G will accept up to 10 MW of fuel-switching projects,
but only at government-owned facilities. It will also accept up to 1 MW of
projects that displace electric air conditioning in summer with chillers
powered by waste heat from cogeneration plants. These must involve existing
cogeneration facilities that exceed 50% efficiency, and they must not
result in incremental fuel use or emissions.
   If New Jersey opens up retail competition, PSE&G will continue to make
standard offer payments to projects whose hosts choose an electric supplier
other than the utility. However, that pledge would only apply if PSE&G is
still allowed to recover its standard offer payments through some type of
system benefits charge. DSM proponents in many states are lobbying for such
charges on distribution services to maintain efficiency programs in the
face of retail access.
   PSE&G accepts standard offer projects on a first-come, first-served
basis, though they must be qualified by PSE&G for technical merit and
savings potential. They may be installed by users themselves or by energy
service companies. One ESCO that is active in the program is PSE&G's own
subsidiary, Public Service Conservation Resources Corp. (PSCRC), which
works with customers on standard offer projects and provides financing.

MONITOR: CON ED IS SLOW ON CLEAN-UP, AND CRACKS DOWN ON WHISTLE BLOWERS

   A court-appointed environmental monitor has found that Consolidated
Edison's environmental programs still have significant shortcomings and
that the utility has discouraged proper reporting of environmental
mishaps.
   ``In at least one instance,'' the monitor states in his first report
since being named last spring, ``there has been direct retaliation against
an employee who reported information to me.''
   Appointment of the monitor, Mitchell Bernard, came as part of the
sentence handed down after Con Ed pleaded guilty to having conspired to
cover up the release of asbestos in a 1989 steam pipe explosion. The
utility was also fined $2 million. U.S. District Court Judge John Martin,
who sentenced Con Ed, received the monitor's report Dec. 18.
   The monitor writes that Con Ed generally cooperated with his
investigations, as required by the court. But he cites some notable
exceptions: a few employees were ``less than open'' in answering questions;
and Con Ed ``failed to comply'' with the court's direction that it not
penalize an employee in any way for providing information to the monitor.
   Con Ed ``has taken a number of commendable steps to promote
environmental compliance,'' the monitor notes. He recognizes the creation
of an internal mechanism for investigating reports of environmental
misconduct and the hiring of a new vice president for environmental
affairs, among other actions.
   ``At this point, however, Con Edison is without many of the basic
elements of an effective program to prevent and detect violations of
environmental laws,'' the monitor concludes. Key problems include:
ineffectiveness in the company's new Compliance Administrators Program;
indications of ``an ongoing destructive corporate culture''; and problems
handling asbestos.
   ``We take this report very seriously,'' said a Con Ed spokesman. The
report ``acknowledges that we have improved our environmental awareness but
that we have a lot more to do,'' he added.
   Episodes of improper treatment of employees who reported possible
environmental hazards, brought to the company's attention by the monitor's
report, have resulted in a number of specific disciplinary actions. Con Ed
explained, in a response that was also filed with the court, that two
supervisors have been suspended without pay, and that other individuals
have been disciplined.
   ``These were isolated instances,'' the spokesman said. However, any
similar incidents in the future in which an employee is punished or
intimidated will result in dismissal of the supervisor. ``We will not
tolerate intimidation of employees who bring forward environmental
complaints.'' The spokesman acknowledged that ``we have to educate our
employees about our company's environmental policies.''
   The most serious of the incidents of intimidation involved spilled oil
and water that leaked down a drain at a Con Ed service center and a problem
in the company's asbestos abatement program.
   Overall, the monitor writes that he ``uncovered significant problems.''
The most common, he concludes, were related to the cleanup of
polychlorinated biphenyls and to asbestos abatement projects.

SPOT U PRICE IN U.S. RISES ABRUPTLY; DOC CLEARS ENTERGY LEU SHIPMENT

By:
Michael Knapik, Washington; Ray Silver, Toronto; Ann MacLachlan, Paris

The spot uranium price in the U.S. rose in the last weeks in December. The
Uranium Exchange Co. raised its spot U3O8 price to $12.10 per pound on
December 18; Washington Nuclear Corp. raised its U3O8 price December 21 to
$12.50/lb. Some analysts thought that latter figure was high, but most
agreed that the market was clearly trending upward.
   In deals completed before the holidays, Cameco apparently selected
several suppliers to fill its request for offers for 700,000 U3O8, but will
probably not buy the entire amount. The mining company, sources said,
didn't see any offers below $12/lb and will probably buy much of the
material at a price around $12.25/lb, plus or minus 10 cents. Some offers
reportedly as high as $12.50/lb were considered, but several others with
prices a $1 or so higher than that were dismissed.
   British Nuclear Fuels reportedly also selected more than one supplier,
reportedly for more than 200,000 lb U3O8. One source suggested that the
company may have bought as much as 500,000 lb U3O8 equivalent at prices
ranging from $12.20/lb to slightly above $12.40/lb.
   San Diego Gas & Electric is said to have selected a supplier for U3O8.
(The utility had been looking for offers to supply 223,000 lb.) The price
is said to be at or slightly above $11.85/lb, the TradeTech value at the
end of November. Said one source, ``San Diego and Wisconsin Public Service
(which is still evaluating offers) may have seen the last of the
under-$12/lb uranium.''
   At press time there was a report that Consumers Power was out looking
for a supply of 600,000 lb U3O8.
   Fermco, the company in charge of cleaning up the DOE defense facility at
Fernald in Ohio, solicited offers last month for the purchase 484,061 lb of
excess normal uranium, which is in various forms including derbies, ingots,
recyclable metal, and UF4. The minimum acceptable price, the solicitation
said, was $2.04/lb--$1.36/lb for the material and $0.68/lb for analysis,
handling, and packaging. Bids were due December 20. According to sources,
Fermco received expressions of interest from four companies.
   In NuclearFuel's judgment, significant open-market transactions in the
U.S. during the forward two-week period could be concluded within the range
of $12.00-$12.40/lb U3O8, a rise from the range reported two weeks ago of
$11.80-$12.10/lb. So-called unrestricted buyers, those able to use uranium
from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), could probably conclude
a deal within the range of $10.00-$10.30/lb, a slight rise in the range
reported two weeks ago of $9.90-$10.20/lb.

DOC Clears Import Of Entergy LEU
   A shipment of low-enriched uranium (LEU) destined for use in one of
Entergy's reactors was finally released December 21 by the U.S. Customs
Service after the import was cleared by the Department of Commerce. The
material, enriched at Eurodif and imported by Cogema Inc., contained
uranium originally from Kazakstan and/or Uzbekistan. Sources said DOC
cleared the shipment after Entergy agreed to match an equal quantity of the
uranium with newly produced U.S. uranium. Neither DOC nor Entergy officials
were available to confirm that report, however.
   Under the terms of the antidumping suspension agreements with those
countries, the origin of the uranium does not change when it is enriched in
a third country and therefore, the uranium can only be imported right now
into the U.S. under the quota systems in both suspension agreements.
   Joseph Spetrini, DOC deputy assistant secretary for import
administration, has been trying to negotiate an agreement to grandfather
some of the so-called bypass Uzbek and Kazak uranium. In October, Spetrini
proposed to grandfather 75% of the uranium utilities contracted for before
March 27, the date the Kazak agreement was signed. The remaining 25% could
come in if the utilities matched the uranium with newly produced U.S.
uranium. The mining company petitioners, including Cogema Inc.'s Pathfinder
Mines, protested to Spetrini and told him that they would agree to
grandfathering only under certain conditions.
   Spetrini found himself in a bind and, according to one source, was
facing the threat of a lawsuit by Entergy if the shipment was not cleared.
   (Washington Nuclear reported that Customs cleared the five containers of
Entergy's LEU that had been held up at Portsmouth, Va. since December 8.)
   On the Entergy shipment, DOC, according to one source, ``used chewing
gum to patch together'' the settlement, allowing Commerce to make the call
to Customs to clear the shipment. The mining companies apparently didn't
agree to the settlement and still maintain that there is no legal basis to
let the uranium in.

Miners' Conditions For Grandfathering
   The ad hoc group of U.S. uranium mining companies, petitioners in the
antidumping cases, submitted a confidential set of conditions that they say
must be met for them to agree to any grandfathering of Uzbek or Kazak
uranium (NF, 18 Dec. '95, 2). The miners say these conditions represent ``a
firm position of industry.'' Among the conditions, sources said, are the
following: The quantity of grandfathered material is not to exceed
9.5-million lb; the material to be allowed in without restrictions must be
only 75% of the nominal quantity contracted for; the matched sales to allow
import of the remaining 25% must be done by June 30 and must be matched
with newly produced U.S. uranium; the utility contracts for the purchase of
Uzbek or Kazak uranium concluded after March 27 and those not brought to
DOC's attention in response to September 22 Federal Register notice would
not be eligible for grandfathering; and the DOC must reverse its
interpretation of the Uzbek agreement--and an interpretation that allows
for a doubling quota amount to 1.88-million lb U3O8 per year after 1996.
   ``There are limits to industry's willingness to accept mechanisms which
will flood the U.S. market with dumped CIS uranium,'' the miners said.
``Those limits have been reached.''

Australian Analysts See $14.25/lb U Price in 1996
   Analyst Daniel Stubbs of the Australian Bureau of Agriculture & Resource
Economics is predicting that the average spot uranium price will rise to
(US)$14.25/lb U3O8 in 1996 from $11.50/lb in 1995. Stubbs and fellow
analyst Charles Millsteed are predicting that in the longer term, the spot
price will increase to $19.70/lb ($17/lb in 1995 dollars) by the end of
2000. Rising prices will lead to increased production from Australia's two
operating companies--Energy Resources of Australia and Western Mining Corp.
The cost of production in Australian uranium mines is estimated to be in
the range of $10-$15/lb U3O8. Production is expected to rise from 4,700
metric tons U3O8 to 6,300 MT in 1999-2000, the analysts say. The articles
about uranium appeared in the December 1995 issue of the journal Australian
Commodities.

INI: Price Spike In 1998, But Softening Thereafter
   International Nuclear Inc. (INI), whose president is ex-Nuexco analyst
David Schramm, has recently completed an analysis of the market that
forecasts a spot market price spike by 1998, but with the price softening
after that. INI says it believes the spot price in constant 1995 dollars
will be in the $16.50 range by 1998 but will fall by the year 2000 to
around $14.80/lb U3O8. The spiking will occur, INI believes, because of
pressure to produce more uranium as utility stocks get used up over the
next two years. The softening will occur, however, as more blended-down HEU
enters the market under the formula called for in the pending U.S.
Enrichment Corp. privatization bill and as more uranium enters the U.S.
from Kazakstan and Uzbekistan under their suspension agreement quotas, INI
believes. INI, as do most analysts, foresees essentially flat requirements
over the next five years.
   INI also believes there could be a rising premium for longer-term
contracts, and it forecasts a base price for those types of contracts in
the mid-$18/lb range by 1998.

ESA Advisory Group Elects New Officers
   The Euratom Supply Agency's advisory group met last month to elect new
officers and hear updates on various items of interest, but took no new
initiatives, participants reported.
   Elected chairman was Jose-Luis Gonzalez of Enusa; new vice chairmen are
Stig Sandklef of Vattenfall Fuel and H. Blackwell Gresley of Urenco Ltd.
   The committee heard a brief report on the U.S.-Euratom agreement for
nuclear cooperation, now under review by the U.S. Congress, and on
relations with Russia and the ex-Soviet republics that export uranium, but
a source said there is ``nothing new'' in the latter field. The committee
will have to tackle the issue during the coming year, to define whether and
how the ESA's ``common policy'' of limiting nuclear materials imports from
Russia must change when the overall European Union-Russian Federation
partnership and cooperation agreement enters into force, in principle on
January 1, 1997. The agreement calls for free trade between the two parties
on that date, but the EU insisted on a potential exemption for nuclear
trade if the required market conditions are not fulfilled.

Linder Fund Buys More Stock In URI
   Uranium Resources announced December 26 that one of its largest
stockholders--the Linder Dividend Fund Inc.--had exercised it rights under
a May 1995 warrant agreement to buy more common stock in the company. The
exercise of 500,000 warrants will infuse the company with $2-million in
working capital for project development and other purposes.
   URI said that it expects production to begin at its Kingsville Dome site
late in the first quarter. Combined with production from Rosita, URI said
it expects to produce more than 2-million lb in 1996. In 1995, URI said
610,000 lb U3O8 were produced at Rosita.
   URI's stock closed December 26 at 5 3/8, with 16,800 shares being
traded. Its 52-week high was 8 5/8.

Court Okays Denison Restructure
   Four days before Christmas, Denison Mines President Bill James announced
a new deal for shareholders who have been in financial limbo for four years
since Ontario Hydro canceled its long-term commitment to buy 100-million lb
of high-cost Elliot Lake uranium. With final approval from the Ontario
Court of Justice, General Division, James said the company could proceed
with a restructuring plan that will reclassify existing Class A, Class B
and preferred shares into new common shares. The new shares should be
listed for trading on Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges by January 3, he
said.
   ``It has been a long road and all stakeholders have paid a price. The
(federal and Ontario) governments have provided interest relief on taxes
and a postponement of taxes payable; corporate lenders and Canada Mortgage
& Housing Corp. have given interest, principal and repayment concessions;
preferred shareholders have agreed to eliminate a large amount of dividends
in arrears and their priority on liquidation; Class A and Class B
shareholders have accepted a significant dilution of their equity
interest,'' James explained. The provincial government have made
concessions in exchange for assurance that decommissioning of Denison
Mines' Elliot Lake mine-mill facility would be completed.
   ``As a result of the stakeholders contributions, Denison has been
preserved as a going concern and its capital structure have been
substantially improved,'' James noted.

Czech Deal With Cameco
   The first company in Eastern Europe to take its uranium conversion
business to Canada, the Czech electric power utility CEZ has contracted
with Cameco Corp. for conversion services at Port Hope, Ontario. Noting
that the Soviet Union previously met such nuclear fuel demands, Cameco
Chairman and President Bernard Michel said the CEZ deal ``reflects the
changing global marketplace as Eastern European countries open their doors
to Western business.'' Cameco would not say how much uranium would be
involved nor the dollar value of the CEZ contract.

MINATOM OFFICIAL CALLS FOR MAKE-OR-BREAK DECISION ON KRASNOYARSK RT-2
PLANT

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow

   Prospects for completing the RT-2 reprocessing plant at Krasnoyarsk-26
are bleak, according to a key official at the Russian Ministry of Atomic
Energy (Minatom).
   RT-2, with a design throughput of 1,500 metric tons heavy metal (MTHM)
per year, was supposed to reprocess spent fuel from VVER-1000 plants.
Construction began in 1987 but was stopped two years later for lack of
funds (NF, 4 Jan. '89, 5). Meanwhile, spent fuel is being stored at
reactors and at an interim storage facility adjacent to the RT-2
construction site at Krasnoyarsk-26.
   Evgeny Mikerin, who heads up nuclear fuel production at Minatom, said
last month the plant is about 30% complete. Since 1989, the project has
been modified to include design innovations, including safety improvements
in the aftermath of an explosion at a separation plant at Tomsk-7 (NF, 12
April '93, 1). If construction were to resume now, Mikerin said, RT-2 could
be completed by the end of 2003.
   Construction cannot proceed, however, until regulator Gosatomnadzor and
local authorities review reports required under Russia's new nuclear
licensing laws, passed in mid-1995. Mikerin said Minatom anticipates
difficulties in getting all consulting experts to agree on the contents of
an ecological report that must be submitted to licensing authorities.
   In the meantime, Mikerin said, Minatom has not appropriated any
construction funding for the project. Russian media reported in early 1995
that following a decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to complete
RT-2, that the central government, Minatom, and local and regional
authorities earmarked more than $100-million for the project. But Mikerin
said those reports were false.
   ``There is no money for RT-2 beyond the small amounts required to
maintain the infrastructure already there,'' he said. Mikerin added that,
because construction on the Siberian site had started nearly 10 years ago,
infrastructure maintenance must be funded at a higher level now in order to
prevent the equipment from deteriorating.

Taiwan, ROK Won't Take Back HLW
   There also is no longer an agreement inside the Russian administration
on the project's cost. Mikerin said that while costs associated with RT-1
have been rising, cost estimates for the construction and operation of RT-2
also have increased. But, he said, ``the government has taken no decision
on this as of yet.''
   He said Minatom still is looking for foreign partners wanting to
reprocess fuel at RT-2 ``because we cannot continue to depend upon
government support.'' Mikerin said on December 5, ``As of today, all those
(parties) we have discussed the project with have declined'' to be
involved.
   Mikerin confirmed that utilities in Germany and Switzerland have
formally declined to consider a reprocessing joint venture at
Krasnoyarsk-26. He said that talks also had been held with utilities in
Taiwan and the Republic of Korea (ROK). Those potential clients have not
categorically withdrawn from the talks, Mikerin said. But the two Asian
states are not yet willing to take back high-level reprocessing waste
(HLW), he added. That takeback is now required by Russian law.
   Mikerin also contradicted speculation that Japan, as part of an ongoing
review of its own reprocessing expansion program, might fund completion of
RT-2 to reprocess Japanese spent fuel. The Minatom official said that
nuclear political relations between Tokyo and Moscow are ``not good'' and
are hampered by a long-running dispute about Russian Navy low-level waste
dumping off Russia's Pacific Coast. Under these circumstances, he said, it
is not possible to strike a deal with Japan involving RT-2.
   Mikerin acknowledged that the slow pace of Minatom's nuclear power
development program since the Chernobyl accident in 1986 now poses problems
for the economics of the reprocessing project. At 1,500 MTHM/yr, RT-2 was
designed to be much too large for the current projected demand.
   ``It's time to make hard decisions about RT-2'' Mikerin said. ``If we
want to finish it, we should find the money and do so--now. If not, we
should give it up.''
   The interim storage facility at Krasnoyarsk-26 for VVER-1000 spent fuel
is 15% full, Mikerin said, compared to 13% at the end of 1994.
   As a result of a government-to-government agreement with Ukraine, about
half the spent fuel to be added to the storage facility will come from
VVER-1000 units in Ukraine, he said.
   Following a commercial contract two years ago, Ukraine is trying to pay
for the storage of its spent fuel at Krasnoyarsk-26. About half of the
payments it makes to Minatom are in cash. The rest are in barter, mostly in
food and stainless steel tubing provided in advance for RT-2, as well as
zirconium and a small amount of uranium ore.
   While RT-2 could be ready in eight years if approved and funded, Minatom
officials said, without foreign help, it will take longer for Russia to
digest the plutonium output of the plant in the form of plutonium-uranium
fuel.
   So far, Mikerin said, an experimental fabrication line for
plutonium-based fast reactor fuel at Chelyabinsk-65 has produced only two
to three assemblies per year. They have been loaded into the BN-600 fast
reactor at Beloyarsk, near Ekaterinburg. The reactor, like most other
Soviet-design fast reactors, has traditionally operated on uranium fuel
enriched to up to 25% U-235.

LA HAGUE SITE REACHES NOMINAL PRODUCTION; MELOX GEARS UP

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Cogema's La Hague reprocessing site reached its nominal capacity for the
first time in 1995, processing some 1,550 metric tons heavy metal (MTHM),
despite the labor unrest that slowed production in June, said Jean-Louis
Ricaud, the company's reprocessing chief.
   The UP3 plant that reprocesses foreign reactor fuel was commissioned in
1990 but reached its nominal capacity of 800 MTHM/year five years later.
UP2-800, commissioned in August 1994, took less than a year to reach the
same target, Cogema officials point out, saying this demonstrates the
company's mastery of the industrial process.
   Ricaud said that Cogema's mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication complex
also is gearing up, with the refurbished Cadarache MOX plant having
manufactured more than 30 MTHM of fuel for Electricite de France (EDF) in
1995.
   The much bigger Melox MOX plant at Marcoule produced low-enrichment and
medium-enrichment MOX pins last year, but complete fuel assemblies included
high-enrichment pins made in Cadarache, he said. About 70-75 fuel
assemblies were produced at the plant, or 20 MTHM equivalent of MOX fuel.
   But Melox will really begin full production in 1996, Ricaud said. ``We
are confident that the plant will be able to deliver 85 tons to EDF in 1996
with the label `Made in Melox,' as scheduled,'' he said.
   The nominal capacity of Melox is 120 MTHM/year. Cogema has announced
plans to increase that to 160 MTHM/year in the near term.

BNFL TAPS EXXON CHEMICAL VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE SLOT

   British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL) has confirmed the appointment of
international chemical industry executive John Taylor as its new chief
executive. His appointment will go into effect in March.
   Taylor, currently a vice president of Brussels-based Exxon Chemical
Europe Inc., replaces Neville Chamberlain. Last month Chamberlain left that
post for a promotion as deputy chairman of BNFL (NF, 4 Dec. '95, 11).
Chamberlain is combining both roles until Taylor's installation.
   BNFL is beefing up its top management in efforts to maximize overseas
opportunities. Taylor, 48, has been with Exxon Chemical for 26 years,
holding a number of senior international management positions in the U.K.,
U.S. and Belgium.
   Taylor said that BNFL's improved safety and environmental performance,
coupled with recent successes in winning international business, made it an
``exciting time...to move the company forward.'' BNFL was recently named
the U.K.'s fastest growing large exporter (NF, 23 Oct. '95, 8).
   Taylor's appointment coincided with BNFL's announcement that site work
has started on a revolutionary 360-million-pound (U.S.$560-million) plant
to treat intermediate-level radioactive waste (ILW). The plant is expected
to cut 500-million pounds from the lifetime costs of BNFL's ILW program and
to attract international business with its state-of-the-art technology.
   The Sellafield Drypac plant, scheduled to come on line in 2002, will
convert wet ILW into dry material that can be compacted, mixed with
concrete, and packed in 500-liter stainless steel containers. Main building
and civil contract work on the plant is due to start April 1997.

YEAR LATER PASSAGE OF WASTE BILL REMAINS AN INDUSTRY TOP PRIORITY

   The nuclear power industry has no ``Plan B'' up its sleeve in the event
nuclear waste legislation does not pass this year, said Joseph Colvin,
executive vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).
   ``There is a strong consensus across the nation this needs to be done,''
he said.
   A year after the industry trade association set waste legislation as its
top priority for 1995, a congressional fix of the faltering DOE waste
program still has top billing. But Colvin remains optimistic that can be
accomplished.
   Even as the Upton-Towns nuclear waste bill, H.R. 1020, became bogged
down in congressional budget battles on Capitol Hill, it remained one of
the strongest bipartisan bills making its way through the legislative
process, he said. Supported by the Republican leadership and such
influential Democrats as Reps. John Dingell of Michigan and Frank Pallone
Jr. of New Jersey, the bill has a hefty list of supporters.
   More than 230 members of the House are ready to move on the bill,
according to Colvin.

Breaking The `Scoring' Logjam
   NEI has sent suggested solutions to the House Commerce Committee in an
effort to break the ``scoring'' logjam that prevented the bill from moving
to the floor in 1995. Earlier Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich
(R-Ohio) had warned that the user fee provisions in the bill would require
about $4.2-billion in new offsetting budget cuts.
   Under H.R. 1020, money collected from nuclear utility ratepayers to fund
the DOE waste program would be limited to the amount the program spent the
year before. The provisions would eliminate the hundreds of millions of
dollars in surplus fees collected from ratepayers each year that are
scored, or counted against the federal budget.
   Colvin said that doing away with the new railroad spur called for in
H.R. 1020 would save $1-billion. That, coupled with the one-time payments
utilities are required to make to the DOE program, would put the scoring
difference at less than $1-billion, he said.
   He noted that NEI still has a lot more to do in working with the Senate
leadership on fixing the waste program. Sen. Larry Craig's (R-Idaho) S.
1271 is the companion to H.R. 1020 and will be tackled this year.
   Timing will be everything in both chambers. Colvin said NEI is
optimistic about getting a bill through the Senate early in the year,
before the political pressure of the presidential election year gets too
high. He noted there was no magic cutoff point for passing nuclear waste
legislation, but that the longer that effort dragged on the more difficult
it would be.

Increasing Industry Role
   The role the nuclear industry will have in the DOE waste program is
expected to increase in 1996. Colvin said that DOE is expected to issue a
request for proposals early in the year, seeking private sector involvement
or input on spent fuel transportation.
   DOE program director Daniel Dreyfus has noted that budget cuts would
force DOE to turn that work over to the private sector. The department also
will be terminating its multipurpose canister (MPC) program, also leaving
that work up to the private sector.
   Colvin said NEI plans to play a key role in the private-sector
development of spent fuel canisters that can be used to store, ship, and
ultimately bury the waste. NEI will be a key coordinator of work and is
expected to outline utility specifications for the canisters, much like
what the industry did for advanced light water reactor requirements through
the Electric Power Research Institute.
   ``Clearly NEI will have some type of catalyst role,'' said Colvin.

HOLTEC, SIERRA NUCLEAR, AND SEG-VECTRA MAKE MESCALERO PROJECT SHORT LIST

By:
Elaine Hiruo, Washington

   Three dry storage teams made it to the Mescalero project's short list
last month, keeping them in the running as potential suppliers for the
commercial spent fuel storage business planned for Mescalero tribal land in
New Mexico. Final selection is expected early this year.
   On the short list are Holtec International, Sierra Nuclear, and a team
made up of Westinghouse subsidiary SEG and Vectra Technologies Inc.
   A contract with the Mescalero-utility project could open doors
elsewhere. Northern States Power Co. (NSP), for example, is the lead
utility in the project and will only consider storage technologies tapped
for the Mescalero venture when it develops its own away-from-reactor
storage facility.
   Under Minnesota law, the utility must look for sites elsewhere in
Goodhue County, away from the Mississippi River, to store Prairie Island
spent fuel. The plant is in Goodhue County near the river. Jim Alders, NSP
manager of regulatory projects, said last week that the storage capacity at
the away-from-reactor site will be limited to 680 fuel assemblies.
   NSP, he said, expects to receive vendor bids in mid-January and to
select the winning technology by mid-March. The utility plans to submit a
license application to the NRC in October.
   Public opposition, meanwhile, is mounting against attempts to move
Prairie Island spent fuel away from the reactor site. A citizens advisory
group's draft report now circulating recommends that the state scrap plans
for an away-from-reactor storage facility, said Alders. The group is
scheduled to submit its final report to the Minnesota Environmental Quality
Board in mid-January.
   Alders said he did not know if a board decision to leave spent fuel at
Prairie Island would put the issue back in the lap of the Minnesota
legislature.
   Meanwhile, dry storage vendors expect the Mescalero Apache Tribe and its
utility partners to select more than one technology for the spent fuel
storage facility planned for New Mexico. The project is aimed at providing
limited storage relief to participating utilities, which feel they can no
longer rely solely on the faltering DOE nuclear waste program.
   The commercial venture is slated to have enough storage capacity to
handle 20,000 metric tons uranium of spent fuel. It will be built and
operated as a business, with an operating life of no more than 40 years.
   The short-listed companies already have links to utilities participating
in the project. Holtec, for instance, earlier sold its canister-based spent
fuel storage system to Commonwealth Edison, the largest nuclear utility in
the U.S. and a member of the Mescalero project. Sierra Nuclear and Vectra
storage systems, likewise, have been purchased by other project members.

IN MATTER OF YEARS, DOE STANCE SHIFTS FROM `OBLIGATION' TO NO CLEAR LEGAL
DUTY

   In 1984, DOE correspondence on the department's accepting utility spent
fuel in 1998 was peppered with such phrases as ``legal obligations.''
Despite being called for in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and in
contracts DOE signed with utilities, by 1993 those phrases were gone, and
DOE officials maintained they didn't have a clear legal obligation to take
the spent fuel by the 1998 contract date if DOE failed to have a place to
put the waste.
   Attorneys for states and nuclear utilities suing the department over its
1998 responsibility have submitted DOE correspondence to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that appears to show an
evolving policy. Plaintiffs in the case have asked the court to reinforce
what they consider a binding DOE obligation to begin taking utility spent
fuel by January 31, 1998.
   Oral arguments are slated for January 17.
   The following are excerpts from DOE correspondence in the joint appendix
plaintiffs' attorneys filed with the court or in DOE's response to a
Freedom of Information request.

May 30, 1984 letter from DOE General Counsel Theodore Garrish to Sen.
Bennett Johnston (D-La.), ranking Democrat on the Energy & Natural
Resources Committee:
   ``The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 was passed with the presumption
that a repository would be operational by January 31, 1998. The Department
fully intends to meet this congressional objective and is currently in the
process of taking the steps necessary to ensure that we fulfill all of our
corresponding legal obligations under the act....
   ``We believe the intent of Congress when formulating the act was
directed toward commencing disposal operations by 1998. The Department is
totally committed to achieving this objective. In light of this commitment,
we are not now in a position to analyze in any meaningful way the legal
consequences raised by your question as the act was premised upon the
existence of an operational repository by the January 31, 1998 date.''

June 21, 1984 letter from Johnston to Secretary of Energy Donald Hodel:
   ``For some time I have been concerned about the Department's nuclear
waste program. In pursuing this concern I have put several questions to
Departmental spokesmen. Recently I received a rather extraordinary letter
from your General Counsel, Theodore J. Garrish, responding to a request
that I had made of the Department for a memorandum on the Department's
interpretation of certain provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982.
   ``I had asked for an opinion on the legal obligation of the Department
and the Department's authority to take title to spent nuclear fuel in the
event that a repository has not commenced operation. Garrish's reply was as
follows: ``...(W)e are not now in a position to analyze in any meaningful
way the legal consequences raised by your question....
   ``The only sensible interpretation I can put on this response is that
the Department does not want to provide an answer to my question.''

Draft letter, dated June 29, 1984, from Hodel to Johnston [Eric Fygi, DOE
deputy general counsel under the current administration, later said this is
an unused draft of the response Hodel later sent to Johnston on September
7, 1984.]:
   ``My first reaction to your letter was sympathy. Lord knows that many
times I, too, have despaired at getting a `sensible interpretation' out of
the Office of General Counsel. As if that were not enough, the Office of
General Counsel has adopted its own version of the winemaker's adage, under
which `they'll not opine before it's time.'
   ``But as I actually turned to Mr. Garrish's repsonse [sic] of May 30 it
seemed to make a good deal of sense. It emphasized Congress' clear policy
objective that acceptance of spent fuel for disposal would commence by
January 31, 1998. Instead of trying to render a legal opinion in a factual
vacuum, Mr. Garrish's letter advised you, correctly, that the Department is
`totally committed to achieving this objective.'''

August 30, 1984 letter from Garrish to Johnston:
   ``The Department does not intend to breach the legal commitments it has
made in carrying out the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and, of course, to date
there has been no suggestion that it has defaulted on any of its
obligations. To the contrary, this administration's clear policy commitment
is directed to commencing waste acceptance `beginning in 1998.'...
   ``Since the clear policy commitment made by the Congress in formulating
the Act was directed to beginning repository operations in sufficient time
to commence disposal of spent fuel by 1998, and since the Administration is
committed to achieving precisely that objective, the issues that might be
presented by the unavailability of a repository at that time have an
abstract quality. We are not in a position now to analyze in any meaningful
way the legal consequences of unavailability of a repository wholly bereft
of a real factual setting necessary to aid our understanding of the
question. Section 302(a) (5) contemplates beginning disposal of spent fuel
by January 31, 1998, and the Department is fully committed to achieving
that objective.''

September 7, 1984 letter from Hodel to Johnston:
   ``In our original letter, the Department stated a firm commitment to
accept for disposal, on an orderly schedule, high-level radioactive waste
and spent fuel not (sic) later than January 31, 1998.''

March 12, 1987 letter from DOE General Counsel J. Michael Farrell to Rep.
Philip Sharp (R-Ind.):
   ``(A)cceptance of spent fuel for storage at an MRS (monitored
retrievable storage) facility beginning January 31, 1998 would comply with
the contract requirements that were based on the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act...''
   ``Thus we believe section 302(a) (5) (A) imposes a duty on the Secretary
after commencement of repository operations to take title to spent fuel
promptly on request, but does not foreclose the Secretary from taking title
to spent fuel in advance of commencement of repository operations if that
step is necessary and appropriate in fulfilling the terms of the contract
by which the program is implemented.''

April 1, 1987 letter from Farrell to Sharp:
   ``Had Congress intended in section 302(a) (5) to specify a date by which
a first repository was to begin operations, the logical point at which to
express this policy would have been in that section's subsection that deals
expressly with `commencement of operation of a repository.' Instead, it
refrained from specifying a date certain for commencement of repository
operations, but required only that, once a repository has begun operations,
the Secretary shall act with expedition to take title to spent fuel on the
request of the generator or owner of spent fuel.''

Prehearing questions and answers related to the April 23, 1987 hearing by
the Senate Environment & Public Works Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation.
Witness: Secretary of Energy John Herrington.
   Q: ``Do you view the MRS facility as either a `disposal' facility or a
facility in which to `dispose' of `spent nuclear fuel?'''
   A: ``No. The MRS is viewed as a DOE facility as defined in Article I 10
of the contract; which would be an integral part of the waste disposal
system. That definition expressly includes a facility to which spent fuel
`may be shipped by DOE prior to its transportation to a disposal facility.'
The purpose of that definition was described in the preamble of the final
rule adopting the contract terms `to expressly state, an accordance with
the act, that there may be an interim storage facility...which DOE may
utilize prior to emplacement in a repository.''

January 12, 1991 letter from DOE waste program director Daniel Dreyfus to
Commissioner Susan Clark of the Florida Public Service Commission:
   ``The Department does not have a clear legal obligation under the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act to accept spent nuclear fuel absent an operational
repository or other facility. However, the Secretary has acknowledged her
belief that the Department may have created such an expectation through its
implementation of the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel
and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR 961). The Secretary has further
indicated her intention to explore with affected utilities various options
and methods for offsetting a portion of the financial burden associated
with continued onsite storage in order to address expectations resulting
from currently projected waste acceptance schedules.''

December 29, 1993 letter from Dreyfus to Robert Butterworth, Florida state
attorney general:
   ``The Department shares your concern regarding the timely provision of
disposal services for the Nation's spent nuclear fuel. When the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act was enacted in 1982, the Department planned to have a
facility in operation and prepared to begin acceptance of spent nuclear
fuel in 1998. The Department does not have a clear legal obligation under
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to accept spent nuclear fuel absent an
operations repository or other facility.''

SOUTH CAROLINA STUDIES WASTE FEE OPTIONS

   Concerned about the lack of progress in the DOE civilian high-level
nuclear waste program, South Carolina last month became the third state to
look into withholding nuclear utility ratepayer contributions from the
federal Nuclear Waste Fund. The state Public Service Commission on December
20 approved Commissioner Warren Arthur's motion to establish the review
process. Arthur said the commission is obligated to determine if the waste
fee is in fact a ``prudent expenditure.'' He said that commission staff
will look into such things as the legal aspects, under South Carolina laws,
of withholding the ratepayer payments.
   Arthur said that, in the context of a rate case proceeding, the
commission might later pursue such options as barring utilities from
passing the fee on to ratepayers, or placing that money into a special
escrow account. Arthur said the staff has been asked to present its
preliminary report to the commission February 22. The final report is due
by June 1.
   The Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) became the first state
body to request such a study in July 1995. SCC staff was slated to present
the report to the commission late last week. The Minnesota Department of
Public Service (DSC) announced its probe of the fee issue in November. Any
DSC recommendation to change the way the fee is handled would have to be
taken up by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.

WESTINGHOUSE HANFORD AWARD FEE $1.5-MILLION

   The Westinghouse Hanford Co. received a $1.5-million DOE award fee last
month after receiving a rating of ``good'' for its work at the shuttered
Hanford nuclear arms plant in Washington state. The rating covers the
six-month period ending September 30 and is up from the satisfactory grade
the company received for the previous six months. The maximum award fee
possible for work done during this latest rating period was $5-million.
   The fee is one of several the company can receive, based on the caliber
of its work. Westinghouse Hanford is prime contractor at the DOE site. DOE
said that fiscal 1995 fees awarded to the company as of December 15
included: $11.7-million out of a possible $13.3-million for meeting
performance-based objectives; $9.4-million, based on a claimed savings of
$188-million (DOE said a cost savings validations is under way and is
expected to add to the cost-savings fee.); and $2.6-million out of a
possible $3-million for its handling of solid waste at the site.

HOLTEC WINS RERACKING JOB AT ANGRA-1

   The team of Holtec International and U.S. Tool & Die has received a
contract to install high density spent fuel storage racks at Angra-1 in
Brazil. Value of the deal has been estimated at $6-million. The reracking
will increase the in-pool storage capacity of the Furnas Centrais
Electricas S.A. unit from 363 storage locations to 1,252 slots. Holtec said
the racks are designed to store fuel in two regions of the pool: Region 1
will be designed for storing fresh fuel assemblies, and Region 2 will be
for assemblies taking credit for burnup.

NRC STAFF LOOKS TO FRENCH PROGRAM AS IT REVIEWS DOE WORK ON BURNUP CREDIT

By:
Elaine Hiruo, Washington; Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   NRC staff expects to soon be able to submit questions to DOE on the
department's topical report on burnup credit. When approved, the report
could serve as a valuable reference to dry storage vendors in the U.S.,
according to one DOE official.
   Late last month Charles Haughney, deputy director of the NRC spent fuel
program office, said he believed that DOE was on the road to addressing
issues surrounding the use of burnup credit. Key among them is
criticality.
   ``You really have to take an attitude that a criticality accident in the
public sector is absolutely unacceptable,'' Haughney said. Criticality
already is on NRC's roster of technical issues that must be addressed in
its licensing of such things as the spent fuel containers and the
repository itself.
   Any NRC approval of the DOE topical report is expected to have vendors
scrambling back to the drawing boards to redesign spent fuel baskets
already approved by the NRC. The credit could result in higher capacity
waste packages.
   Burnup credit is not now used in the U.S. Haughney was part of a
two-member NRC team that went to France in November to see how the issue is
handled there. The differences between the more mature French program and
DOE's would prevent any direct shifting of technology and ideas. But
Haughney said the visit left him wondering how some of what the French do
could be adapted to fit within the framework of the U.S. program.
   ``We went over there to get a little smarter, not to find the keys to
the kingdom,'' he said.
   French officials say that as fuel burnups increase, calculating the
residual uranium enrichment of spent fuel precisely can translate into
optimization of transport and consequent cost savings.
   Jean-Louis Ricaud, head of Cogema's reprocessing and engineering
operations, which also includes the Cogema group's transportation business,
said no special burnup credit was needed for fuels with an initial
uranium-235 enrichment of around 3%-3.5%, corresponding to today's standard
burnups of around 35,000 megawatt-days per metric ton. Standard spent fuel
transport casks and especially internal fuel baskets were designed to
prevent criticality accidents for such enrichment levels, he explained.
   But when utilities began moving to higher burnups, requiring initial
enrichments above 3.5%, the French company and its customers sought a
method to give credit for U-235 burnup in a reactor, in order to
demonstrate that spent higher-enrichment fuel does not in fact have a
residual enrichment greater than 3% and thus that no special measures are
required for its transport, such as loading the transport baskets with
fewer fuel elements.
   Ricaud said equipment has been developed to measure the dose rate from
assemblies in the reactor, calculate the fuel's content in fission
products, and deduce the amount of U burned and thus the amount remaining
in the assembly after discharge. The method requires monitoring fuel burnup
in-reactor. Ricaud said he didn't know how widespread the practice is in
France today; Electricite de France is only beginning to move to
higher-burnup fuel.
   Research staff of the Institute of Nuclear Safety and Protection (IPSN)
have participated in the development. IPSN is a semi-autonomous unit of the
Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) which works partly for the CEA and
other industry customers, and partly in a safety analysis function for the
French nuclear safety authority, DSIN.
   Ricaud said that following a criticality specialists' meeting in
Albuquerque, N.M. last September, technicians from the CEA and the NRC had
agreed to pursue discussions on burnup credit.
   Ricaud observed that the U.S. situation is ``fundamentally different''
from the French situation, because spent fuel is generally shipped in
France to La Hague after only one or two years' cooling. In the U.S., he
said, fuel cools longer at-reactor, so the capacity of each transport cask
is theoretically higher. An additional margin could be won if credit is
given for burnup in calculating the amount of fuel that can be loaded into
a given basket. But the real problem in the U.S., he said, is that
``there's no place to ship'' the spent fuel.

TOLEDO EDISON BEGINS LOADING THREE NUHOMS MODULES AT DAVIS-BESSE

   Toledo Edison Co., after being cleared by NRC, began the process of
loading three Nuhoms spent fuel storage modules December 26 at Davis-Besse.
The modules, made by Vectra Technologies Inc., will hold 72 assemblies and
allow the utility to maintain a full-core off-load capability when it
enters a refueling outage in April. The utility may need two or more
additional modules in early 1998 (before the next refueling outage) if a
federal interim storage facility is not available, a company spokeswoman
said.
   NRC declined to grant a request from the Toledo Coalition for Safe
Energy to halt the loading of the casks. The Toledo group had one lawsuit
dismissed in November challenging the NRC rule allowing the Nuhoms cask to
be used for spent fuel storage. However,the group November 30 filed a new
lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
claiming that NRC improperly allowed Vectra to alter a safety analysis
report commitment on cask wall thickness (NF, 6 Nov. '95, 17). Joining the
Toledo Coalition in its latest suit is the Maryland Safe Energy Coalition,
which seeks to block the use of Nuhoms modules at Baltimore Gas & Electric
Co.'s Calvert Cliffs.
   Separately, Vectra reported in mid-November a net loss of $1.9-million
for the three months ending October 1 on revenue of $24-million. In the
same period a year ago, the company earned $23,000 on revenue of
$32.5-million.
   In a filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, Vectra said
the revenue decrease was due partially to a decrease in nuclear engineering
services. Vectra President Ray Fortney said the company would have a
stronger fourth quarter.
   In September, the company negotiated a new $3-million loan, which it
says will be sufficient to meet all its commitments through the end of
1995. But the 10Q filing notes that operations in 1995 will not alone
generate sufficient cash to continue operations. But it adds that
``management anticipates that sufficient cash will be provided through
additional reductions in operating expenses, entering into a joint venture
or strategic partnership, or the sale of other assets. The company also
intends to explore alternatives for raising capital through preferred stock
or a rights offering.'' Fortney said he is confident that ``Vectra will be
in business in 1996.''
   Earlier in the year, the company sold its chemical decontamination
business, Plant Services Inc., to Westinghouse for $19-million, less
certain adjustments. Among other things, Vectra used the money to reduce
long-term debt.

USEC SALE SHOULD BE CANCELED, SAYS HARVARD STUDY OF HEU DEAL

By:
Wilson Dizard III

   The planned privatization of the U.S. Enrichment Corp. (USEC) is a bad
deal for the U.S. Treasury and for national security, according to a
forthcoming book by Richard Falkenrath and others of Harvard University's
Center for Science & International Affairs (CSIA).
   Falkenrath's study of the high-enriched uranium (HEU) deal and USEC's
role in it appears as part of Avoiding Nuclear Anarchy: Containing the
Threat of Loose Russian Nuclear Weapons and Fissile Material, to be
published by CSIA this year.
   According to a prepublication copy of the study provided to NuclearFuel,
``The U.S. government could resolve many of the problems with the U.S.
purchase of Russian HEU if it were simply to cancel the privatization of
USEC.
   ``Under this option, USEC would remain the executive agent of the HEU
deal, but the U.S. Treasury would remain USEC's sole owner. As a
government-owned corporation, USEC could be instructed to accept lower
profits for the foreign policy gains associated with the purchase of
Russian HEU--a trade the corporation would resist making if it were owned
by normal, profit maximizing investors.
   ``This solution, of course, would work only so long as the government
exercises more effective oversight of USEC's purchase of HEU from Russia
than was the case in 1994-95.
   ``Canceling the public sale of USEC is a less radical idea than it may
seem. Most if not all of the efficiency gains associated with
private-sector management were achieved in July 1993, when USEC was
established as a government-owned corporation out of the highly inefficient
government enrichment operation run by DOE. Few if any additional
efficiency gains can be expected by transferring the ownership from the
government to the private sector. Indeed, there are at least two reasons
why the public sale of USEC may be a poor choice for the government. The
first reason has already been noted: the White House could compel a
government-owned USEC to accept the lower profits associated with buying
Russian HEU, whereas a publicly owned USEC would resist this pressure.
   ``The second argument against privatizing USEC is that the net present
value of USEC as a government-owned corporation exceeds by a substantial
margin the net expected proceeds of the sale of USEC.''
   Falkenrath's analysis of the costs to USEC of buying Russian material is
based on his view that USEC's production cost for SWU hovers around $60,
compared to the current cost of SWU to USEC under the HEU deal of $82.50.
   The Harvard scholar's view that the sale of USEC will cost the U.S.
government more than it gains is based in part on a study of the
transaction conducted by the General Accounting Office last year (NF, 25
Sept. '95, 1).
   Other enrichment market analysts have raised the point that delaying,
rather than canceling, the sale of USEC could lead to increased revenue for
the U.S. government. Under one privately discussed analysis, the Treasury
would stand to gain as much as $1-billion by delaying the sale of USEC for
one year.

NRC Sees Certification Delay
   Another factor that could impair the privatization of USEC is the recent
announcement by NRC staff that completion of the review of the federal SWU
company's application for safety certification will be delayed by several
weeks.
   NRC's Executive Director for Operations, James Taylor, informed the NRC
commissioners November 28 that the certification schedule was likely to
slip several weeks from the previous completion date of February 29.
   NRC staff asked USEC 1,300 first-round questions about the second safety
certification application the federal SWU corporation submitted on
September 15. The first safety certification application was rejected in
April
   ``USEC has responded to a substantial number of questions,'' Taylor
wrote. ``However, responses to a number of substantive issues have not yet
been received. In addition, it is apparent from discussions with USEC that
certain issues raised by the staff's questions will not be easily resolved.
For example, the staff believes that substantial improvements are needed in
USEC's proposed technical safety requirements, particularly those needed to
ensure protection of workers from death or serious injuries from potential
uranium hexafluoride accidents.''
   Taylor said NRC staff would brief the commission before making a
decision on certification. He made his comments in Secy 95-279, ``Status of
Certification of the USEC Gaseous Diffusion Plants.''
   Separately, USEC announced that it has hired Donald Hatcher as director
of risk management. Hatcher will oversee insurance programs at USEC.

MINATOM EXPECTS EURATOM HEU DEAL; STATE DEPT. WON'T INTERVENE ON FRM-2

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow; Michael Knapik, Washington

   The Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) for the Russian Federation and
the European Union (EU) have begun negotiations over supply of weapon-grade
high-enriched uranium (HEU) to the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) and may soon
conclude an agreement, Moscow officials confirmed last month.
   According to an aide to Minatom head Viktor Mikhailov, negotiations on
supply of HEU for research reactor fuel to ESA might be concluded by late
January. The aide added, however, that scheduling and other details could
push back a final agreement until sometime in February.
   Diplomatic sources in Moscow said that so far Minatom had not attached
any ``unusual restrictions'' on the supply of the HEU to Euratom beyond
requiring the usual peaceful-use commitments. Accordingly, HEU supplied by
Minatom to ESA would be fungible under the terms of a peaceful-use
agreement, and it will be up to ESA to determine how the material would be
distributed.
   The sources said that, also conforming with usual practice for
peaceful-use agreements, Minatom would specify that HEU it supplied is
intended for use in research reactor fuel and would expect to receive a
list of where Euratom intends to store, process, and irradiate the
material.
   German opponents to the FRM-2 materials test reactor project, planned to
be built by the Technical University of Munich, have said the Russian HEU
would effectively relieve pressure from the U.S. to convert the reactor to
use low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.
   Following up high-level talks in September between Secretary of Energy
Hazel O'Leary and German IAEA representative Cornelia Yzer, U.S. and German
officials are expected to meet in Garching in mid-January to discuss the
prospects for building the FRM-2 with a slightly larger power rating and a
core using lower-enriched uranium. DOE hopes to see Germany agree to
re-design FRM-2 to use fuel proposed by the Reduced Enrichment for Research
and Test Reactor (RERTR) program. Argonne National Laboratory unilaterally
produced such a redesign last year at a meeting of the RERTR program
participants, raising protests from the FRM-2 sponsors and constructor
Siemens (NF, 25 Sept. '95, 7).

No State Department Action
   After the U.S. Department of State asked Germany to confirm a report
that Minatom and ESA had agreed to supply HEU for research reactors (NF, 25
Sept. '95, 7), diplomatic sources speculated that the State Department
would intervene--either to persuade Russia not to consummate a deal that
would challenge U.S. nonproliferation policy, or to request assurances from
ESA that FRM-2 would not be supplied Russian-origin HEU.
   But a senior U.S. official said last week that the State Department
would not take any action with Moscow. The official suggested that as long
as the U.S. is using HEU in some research reactors, U.S. objections to
FRM-2 running on the material are not credible. In the past this argument
has been pushed by European operators, who have said they are disadvantaged
commercially by the continued use of HEU in the U.S.
   Other U.S. officials say that the German desk at the State Department
has determined that proliferation concern about using HEU in FRM-2 is a
low-priority issue in U.S.-German affairs.

GAN IN NO POSITION TO TAKE RUSSIAN PHYSICAL INVENTORY

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow

   Gosatomnadzor (GAN), the agency appointed by President Boris Yeltsin to
watch over Russia's nuclear materials, has neither the means nor the
political clout to carry out a comprehensive material balance inventory,
Russian officials said last month.
   Yuri Volodin, head of the department of safeguards at GAN, said that
inspectors have been able to do only ``book audits'' based on data already
collected by operators of facilities under the control of the Ministry of
Atomic Energy (Minatom). In addition to the audits, GAN personnel can
conduct ``problem checks'' of data, to see how a facility operator obtains
and processes the information.
   ``In a few cases,'' Volodin said, facility operators ``measured
canisters for us,'' to verify the amounts of material declared to GAN. ``We
have been everywhere and seen everything, but not much of the inventory has
been verified,'' he said.
   There is no central data bank at Minatom or GAN for inventories of
nuclear material. GAN officials said that inventory data are in the hands
of plant operators. The only reporting obligation plant management has to
central authorities in Moscow, one official said, is an ``annual request''
by the Ministry of Finance to report on the production of materials for
customs purposes. GAN does not know whether Minatom facilities routinely
comply with those reporting requests, he said.
   GAN staffers complain that the agency has never seen some sensitive
inventory data that Minatom passed on to the U.S. DOE in mid-1995. That
information was given to the U.S. as part of a bilateral agreement related
to the transfer of weapon-grade uranium to the U.S. and the disposition of
Russian plutonium.
   There are also no plans at GAN to conduct a comprehensive physical
inventory in Russia. Volodin said that such an effort would require
technical means, political authority, and funding that is out of his
agency's reach. The cost of new equipment needed to take a complete
physical inventory would be about $6-million. GAN has nearly no resources
at all and is routinely two to three weeks behind in paying staffers, he
said.
   To meet payroll and routine expenses for the last several months of
1995, the central government had to scrape to find an extra 300-million
rubles (about $60,000 at current exchange rates). For safeguards efforts at
DOE or Euratom, Volodin said, ``this amount would be a pittance.''
   But it paid about 30 safeguards inspectors located in four Russian
regions that GAN has staffed up during the 24 months since Yeltsin made GAN
responsible for nuclear materials accounting. Permanent on-site inspectors
have been assigned to bulk-handling facilities at Tomsk-7, Krasnoyarsk-26,
Chelyabinsk-65, and Sverdlovsk-44.
   Regional centers have been set up in St. Petersburg for northeastern
Russia (Northern Fleet naval fuel inventories in Severodvinsk, all
RMBK-design reactors, and St. Petersburg research institutions); in
Novosibirsk for Siberia (11 fuel cycle processing facilities, including
Tomsk-7, Krasnoyarsk-26, and Angarsk; plus a uranium mining operation in
Chita); and Ekaterinburg for the Urals (fuel processing plants in
Sverdlovsk-44 and Chelyabinsk-65).

Naval Fuel Accounting Deficiencies
   A fourth regional center for the Far East is also being set up in
Khabarovsk, centering on the Komsomolsk shipyard at the mouth of the Amur
River. Officials said that GAN had gotten enough access to fuel assembly
operations for the Pacific Fleet to have determined that there is ``no
input control, no quality control for nuclear material, no check of the
quantity of material in single cores, and no accounting system'' during
preparation of naval propulsion fuel, another Russian official said.
   Through the St. Petersburg center, GAN is working with the Murmansk
Shipping Co. and the German firm Gesellschaft fuer Anlagen- und
Reaktorsicherheit mbH (GRS) to improve physical protection and accounting
measures for nuclear fuels associated with Russian icebreakers and other
non-military vessels.
   While Yeltsin at the outset had put GAN in charge of accounting for all
Russian nuclear materials, in October 1994 Yeltsin stripped GAN of
responsibility for military inventories and production facilities.
   Volodin downplayed the impact of the Yeltsin decision, calling it a
``relief'' that served to clarify questions about GAN's access and
eliminate a conflict point between GAN, Minatom, and the Ministry of
Defense (MOD). But other officials complained that Minatom had pressed
Yeltsin to keep GAN out of military activities. Minatom ``plays all kinds
of political games in Moscow'' to deny GAN funds and authority, another GAN
inspector complained. ``The basic problem we have is that Minatom just
doesn't believe in the need for an independent safeguards agency.''
   Just before Yeltsin cut off GAN's access to military activities, this
official elaborated, MOD had begun to work with GAN and had appointed a
representative on a joint committee to organize safeguards activities at
defense-related facilities. Now, MOD itself is in sole charge of safeguards
at these sites. GAN officials said that MOD, unlike GAN, does not have a
set of procedures for accounting for weapon-grade uranium and plutonium,
however. In the meantime, MOD has assured GAN that it will get complete
access to disarmament materials, once they are broken down from weapons
components.
   Minatom officials objected that, in the U.S., NRC also has no safeguards
access to defense-related materials. But GAN staffers replied that DOE,
unlike Minatom, has a complex defense material accounting and control
system that relies heavily on established safeguards practices.

Plutonium MUF Problems
   One result of Yeltsin's October 1994 ``clarification'' is that GAN has
been told it has access in principle to all inventories of UO2 and PuO2,
including those produced by defense-related facilities, officials said.
   According to Volodin, GAN's access is blocked once oxides are processed
into metal form. A discussion is underway between Minatom and GAN about the
point where GAN must forfeit access and the material becomes categorized as
defense material, Volodin said. ``But we have access to all the PuO2 stored
at all the reprocessing plants,'' he said.
   Regardless of access in principle to PuO2 inventories, lack of proper
equipment has prevented GAN and Minatom so far from accurately measuring
and verifying plutonium inventories at bulk-handling facilities. This has
contributed to a significant estimate of material unaccounted for (MUF) in
process inventories at the RT-1 reprocessing plant at Chelyabinsk-65
(Ozersk), for example, officials said.
   Surge tanks at RT-1 have a ring geometry that, one GAN official said,
prevents plutonium in solution from settling homogeneously, causing
significant reliability problems. In addition, the accuracy of equipment
used at RT-1 to weigh samples of material is only plus or minus 5 grams per
each 3-kilogram sample.
   The point of departure for Minatom's calculation of initial inventory at
any bulk-handling facility is the estimated amount of U-235 in fresh fuel
feedstocks. GAN has access to historical records of these estimates, but,
officials said, Minatom never used non-destructive or destructive analysis
to verify the estimates. The only reliable plutonium inventory figures
available for reprocessing plants are for the plutonium output itself,
which can be determined analytically.
   Independently of the battles over authority, GAN officials said that, at
the facility level, plant management is very cooperative with their efforts
to assess inventories. According to fuel cycle plant officials, however,
cooperation would be less if facilities were operating at Western capacity
factors. RT-1 last year ran at about 30% of design throughput. ``We have
plenty of time to show the inspectors around,'' said chief engineer Evgeny
Dzekun.

WITHOUT EC ASSURANCES, NRC MOVES TO SUSPEND COMPONENT EXPORTS

By:
Michael Knapik, Washington; Ann MacLachlan, Paris; Mark Hibbs, Bonn

   A jurisdictional dispute between the European Commission and certain
member states prevented Euratom from giving the U.S. legal assurances
required for certain nuclear reactor and fuel component exports before the
expiration of the U.S.-Euratom agreement for cooperation on December 31.
   As a result, the U.S. NRC was in the process, as NuclearFuel went to
press December 28, of suspending the general and specific licenses (those
licenses referred to as XCOM and XMAT) to export reactor components, heavy
water, and nuclear-grade graphite to all Euratom countries except Spain,
Sweden, and Finland. NRC's action could cost several companies
``potentially millions of dollars,'' said one agency staffer.
   A senior EC official said December 28 that member states are examining
two solutions but that neither would be in place when the original
U.S.-Euratom agreement expires, and with it the validity of the existing
letters of assurance.
   The list of so-called non-major or non-sensitive components is contained
in items five through nine of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 110. The items
include pressure tubes, zirconium tubes, such reactor internals as core
support structures, and reactor control drive mechanisms. Among the
companies most affected by the suspension are Siemens--which imports
zirconium tubes from the U.S. and has a large fuel fabrication business in
the U.S.--and Carpenter Technology, sources said.
   European Commission staff had hoped that an interim solution could be
worked out to avoid an interruption of trade in the affected items on
December 31. They had aimed at an ``interim measure'' under which the
Commission would have made the necessary assurances on behalf of European
Union (EU) member countries, while preparing a permanent exchange of
letters--to be submitted for formal approval by the European Council--that
would take effect with the new U.S.-Euratom agreement in the spring (NF, 18
Dec. '95, 8).
   Sources said, however, that France and Britain objected to the
Commission making the assurances on their behalf, because they touch areas
in which the Commission does not have jurisdiction, or shares it with
member states. This is notably the case for the assurance that the exported
items will be used for peaceful purposes only, since defense is a national
prerogative in the EU today.
   Pressed by Siemens, the German government approached the U.S. about
delivering a separate set of assurances so that exports could continue to
Germany. That solution became less attractive, however, when the Germans
were told that with such bilateral assurances, German companies could not
transfer the exported components to another country within Euratom without
U.S. consent.
   In addition to control over retransfers, the U.S. requires countries to
give assurances that the components will be under IAEA safeguards and will
be used for peaceful purposes. In the U.S., the fact that the new
assurances have not been given was described as ``disturbing and
mystifying,'' by a senior administration official.
   The assurances are necessary to satisfy U.S. law--which many Europeans
apparently find just as mystifying. The non-major components and materials
are not covered by the U.S.-Euratom agreement, which contains similar
assurances covering more sensitive nuclear materials, equipment and
technology. But the 1978 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act required
peaceful-use, safeguards and retransfer-approval assurances on the
non-sensitive items, too--hence the need for separate assurances covering
them.
   The current generic component assurances, given in 1979, are tied to the
expiring U.S.-Euratom agreement, although they are not a part of it.
   The U.S. entered into separate agreements with Sweden, Spain, and
Finland before they became members of Euratom. As a result, nuclear exports
can continue to those countries under the individual agreements, even in
the absence of any agreement between the U.S. and Euratom.

Authority Of EC Assurances Challenged
   One source following the U.S.-Euratom saga in Brussels said that the
Commission had produced a draft assurance package and submitted it to EU
country ambassadors at their regular meeting December 22. But certain EU
states maintain that the Commission does not have the authority to make the
required commitments. ``They can't make a peaceful-use commitment for us,''
said a French official. ``That's the prerogative of member states.''
   Worse, said one industry official, EU states didn't know there had been
an exchange of letters between the Commission and the U.S. government in
1979, containing such commitments on behalf of the states, until last July,
when the Commission was forced to make the old letters public in the course
of EU debate on the new Euratom-U.S. agreement for cooperation.
   The discovery that the Commission had unilaterally agreed to the U.S.
conditions in 1979 added to the tension surrounding the intra-Community
negotiation of the U.S.-Euratom text, member state sources said.
   ``We were astonished when we discovered the existence of that exchange
of letters,'' said an attorney for a major French nuclear company.
   The senior Commission official acknowledged that in fact the European
Council--the EU's collective political leadership--had been informed
officially of the existing exchange only at the beginning of November. And
a check following the protests of member states last summer turned up ``no
trace of a report to the Council'' in 1979, when the initial exchange was
accomplished, or since then, he said.
   The EC official said the history of the commitments was still unclear,
but ``it's possible it was considered as a measure for management of the
(U.S.-Euratom) agreement'' at the time. Such management measures can be
taken without the Council's approval.
   ``Obviously, that didn't improve the atmosphere'' between the Commission
and member states, which have criticized the Commission's negotiation of
the U.S.-Euratom agreement, the Commission official acknowledged. It also
didn't help, he said, that the matter was put before the EU ambassadors
``under pressure'' right before the Christmas break. ``People got a bit
irritated,'' the official said, and an agreement could not be found.
   French vendors aren't very affected by the Section 109b assurances,
industry sources said, because they export very few such components from
the U.S. But they are worried about the principles involved in the
assurances.
   One attorney for a French vendor, who appeared to believe there was
still some leeway in U.S. law to permit an alternative to the blanket
assurance letters, said he wondered if it would be simpler to provide
assurances case-by-case on affected components or materials destined for
export from the U.S. The industry does not like the fact that the letters
of assurance also list countries to which U.S.-origin components may be
freely re-exported, he said.

German Industry Sought Action
   According to a German fuel cycle official, German industry pressed the
German Foreign Ministry to submit independent assurances to the U.S.
``after it became clear that (the EU) would not act in time'' to prevent an
interruption in bilateral commerce.
   The German official said that difficulties had arisen during negotiation
of a ``consensus text'' of the letters among Euratom parties, noting the
objections by France and Britain related to their status as nuclear weapon
states. The official also said that German representatives had had
difficulty demonstrating to Euratom ``just how serious our situation is.''
   As of mid-December, he said, Bonn had been assured that the U.S.
Department of State would take action on the letter submitted by Germany.
   The official said that in anticipation of a December 31 cutoff, Siemens
had succeeded in stockpiling U.S.-origin zirconium in Germany for later use
in manufacturing fuel assemblies. But the company did not manage to arrange
for advance production and delivery of all UO2 fuel assemblies under
contract with European customers through the first few months of 1996, nor
in stockpiling enough UO2 to manufacture assemblies using its limited
capacity available in Germany.
   The EC official said the Commission and member states are considering
two alternatives: either a complete set of bilateral assurances, such as
those proposed by Germany, but only provided any potential obstacle to
intra-Community trade is removed; or ``collective assurances'' that would
be given by the Commission and member states together, ``each one according
to his jurisdiction.''
   Whatever is decided, an interruption in trade in the nonsensitive
materials and components is inevitable and will likely last for several
weeks, until the EU can formally approve a new set of assurance letters.

DOE POSTPONES DECISION ON ALTERNATIVE FOR TAKING BACK RESEARCH REACTOR
FUEL

By:
Michael Knapik, Washington

   Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary apparently decided December 22 not to
decide on a preferred alternative for dealing with about 22,000 spent fuel
elements of U.S.-origin fuel that have been used at non-U.S. research
reactors around the world. Sources said O'Leary wants some more analysis
from her staff.
   The fact that selection of a preferred alternative for DOE's final
environmental impact statement (EIS) was again delayed would typically be
criticized by advocates of those foreign research reactors facing a spent
fuel storage crisis. Instead, the non-decision was greeted with a sigh of
relief by those sources because, in their opinion, DOE was about to decide
on an alternative that would be ineffective, be open to legal challenge by
Greenpeace, and be fatal to the U.S.'s reduced enrichment in research and
test reactor (RERTR) program.
   Those points were made in a December 20 letter to O'Leary by Howard
Shapar, who along with Joseph Egan has provided legal assistance to a group
of 17 foreign research reactor operators--a group put together by Edlow
International--that have spent fuel covered by the EIS. Shapar told O'Leary
that he learned her staff was leaning toward an option that would have
forced operators in countries with a nuclear waste program to send their
fuel to the U.K's Dounreay plant for reprocessing. DOE would sign a
memorandum of understanding with the U.K. under which Dounreay would, in
the future, begin reprocessing low-enriched spent fuel. Reactors operating
temporarily on high-enriched fuel would have to down-blend to LEU with DOE
paying the cost of down-blending. DOE would reprocess the remainder of the
fuel at its Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina except for Triga
fuel, which would be shipped to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
   This option, Shapar said, ``would send a strong signal to the foreign
research reactor community that DOE has abandoned the RERTR program for all
but a few select reactors.'' He mentioned that government authorities in
Sweden and Denmark, and probably in Norway, will not allow reactor
operators in those countries to pursue the Dounreay option, ``largely for
political reasons.'' DOE, Shapar said, will have stranded these countries
with no alternative other than shutdown and/or HEU dry storage.
   Other operators, Shapar said, will stop efforts to convert their
reactors. ``They will not now expend millions of dollars on conversion,''
Shapar said, ``in the hope that DOE's MOU with Britain will produce an LEU
reprocessing stream at Dounreay by the time they are ready to ship their
LEU spent fuel. Instead, they will maintain operations on HEU fuel and
avail themselves of a certain HEU reprocessing stream, with reliance on
Russian HEU.''
   Shapar went on to note that Greenpeace, which is opposed to reprocessing
at Dounreay, would likely sue DOE ``for failing to consider the
extraterritorial impacts of its actions in the U.K.''
   Shapar said DOE should decide to bring all of the spent fuel (except the
Triga fuel) to Savannah River. ``Given DOE's recent decisions to keep one
of the reprocessing canyons open at the SRS...it is unlikely that the
state's congressional delegation will oppose taking the foreign research
fuel back,'' Shapar said. The governor of South Carolina could sue, ``but
we believe that to be very winnable litigation,'' Shapar said.

RT-1 OPERATION FACES COST CRISIS, UNCERTAIN FUTURE DEMAND SCHEDULE

By:
Mark Hibbs, Moscow

   A senior official at the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy
(Minatom) said last month that prices for reprocessing services at the RT-1
separation plant at Ozersk must be raised to justify further operation.
   Evgeny Dzekun, chief engineer at RT-1, told NuclearFuel that the
reprocessing plant, designed to handle a throughput of 400 metric tons
heavy metal (MTHM) of spent fuel from VVER-440 reactors, naval reactors,
and fast reactors, is currently allowed by local authorities to reprocess
up to 250 MTHM/yr spent fuel.
   During 1995, however, RT-1 handled far less than that amount, and in
1996 it will process still less spent fuel, officials in Moscow said last
month. Ozersk was earlier known as Chelyabinsk-65.
   Dzekun said that between 150 and 180 MT of spent fuel were reprocessed
at RT-1 in 1995. According to information from other Minatom fuel cycle
officials, the total was closer to 150 MT. At average discharge burnups for
VVER-440 fuel of 20,000-25,000 megawatt-days/MT, about 0.8% of the
recovered output is plutonium. Since Dzekun said that the amount of fresh
plutonium added to the stockpile at Ozersk during 1995 was just over 1 MT,
no more than about 150 MT of spent fuel could have been handled there,
these experts said.
   Dzekun had said previously that, up to 1990, the historical average
throughput at RT-1 was about 200 MT/yr; in 1991, he said, 170 MT was
reprocessed, and in 1992, 120 MT (NF, 4 Jan. '93, 4).
   Russia's overall economic situation, and the failure of nuclear power
plants to be paid for power they produce (Nucleonics Week, 7 Dec. '95, 1),
meant that plant management ``can no longer pay for reprocessing,'' Dzekun
said.

U.S. `Interference'
   Dzekun also claimed that U.S. government interference posed a threat to
his reprocessing operation, and he blamed Washington for persuading VVER
reactor management outside Russia to opt for dry storage of spent fuel.
   Officials in Finland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic all have
felt diplomatic pressure from the U.S. not to reprocess any more VVER fuel,
he said.
   Last month, under terms of a commercial contract with Finland's IVO, the
latest annual shipment of spent fuel from the Loviisa VVERs to Ozersk
occurred. The Finns are still considering whether to ship spent fuel to
RT-1 in 1996 (NF, 18 Dec. '95, 15). Dzekun said that, contrary to claims by
environmental groups, safety will not be a factor in Finland's decision.
Both IVO and regulator STUK have surveyed the RT-1 reprocessing operation
and found it ``safe and reliable.'' However, IVO can send the fuel to the
storage facility being built by Finland's other nuclear utility, TVO.
   In both 1994 and 1995, RT-1 took delivery of spent fuel from the Paks
VVER station in Hungary under a spent fuel takeback deal signed in 1994.
Dzekun said that Paks management has decided in principle to continue
reprocessing spent fuel at RT-1 in 1996 but that it is ``intimidated'' by
the consequences of Russian nuclear law, passed in mid-1995. The law
obliges RT-1's foreign clients to take back high-level reprocessing waste
(HLW) in vitrified form after 25 years of interim storage.
   Hungary ``must take this into consideration if it wants to keep
reprocessing,'' he said. GEC-Alsthom is building a vault-type spent fuel
storage facility for the Paks Nuclear Power Plant that Dzekun suggested
could be licensed to contain HLW.

Reprocessing Cost Inflation
   Dzekun said that, every three months, the cost of inputs for RT-1
reprocessing operations are adjusted upward because of continuing Russian
inflation and market price reforms.
   Real prices for electricity, chemicals, equipment, and transportation
have reached near-Western levels, he said, while RT-1 is tied to premarket
contracts and is not able to pass these increased costs on to customers.
``We will have to raise the price of reprocessing to Russian reactors to
continue justifying operation of the plant,'' Dzekun said. Dzekun said that
he was holding talks with Russian VVER plant managers in an effort to
``persuade'' them to pay more for reprocessing services.
   Dzekun would not reveal the price that VVER-440 stations in Russia pay
for reprocessing. According to unconfirmed reports from other Minatom
sources, however, in some cases reactor management pays as little as $50
per kilogram heavy metal (kgHM), compared to European reprocessors' going
rate of about $1,000/kgMH.
   Similar to steps taken by Cogema to hang on to its German reprocessing
clients (NF, 4 July '94, 1), Minatom will offer VVER-440 reactors a
``package deal'' involving an array of fuel cycle services, including fuel
fabrication, along with higher reprocessing prices, Moscow officials said.
   One senior Russian fuel cycle official qualified that because Minatom
has dropped the VVER-440 from its nuclear energy development plan, ``the
real issue for RT-1 is who its clients will be'' in the future.
   In the meantime, the RT-1 client base is expected to shrink further.
Minatom plans to decommission soon after 2000 the country's older VVER-440
reactors, including Kola-1 and -2, and Novovoronezh-3 and -4. These units
reprocess their spent fuel at Ozersk. Dzekun ``must convince foreign
clients to keep reprocessing'' to keep RT-1 operating, according to an aide
to Minatom head Viktor Mikhailov.
   The aide speculated that an alternative strategy would be to put RT-1 to
work on the huge inventory of spent fuel from the Russian Navy icebreaker
and submarine fleet. But he said that neither Minatom nor the Ministry of
Defense can fund major management of Russia's daunting propulsion reactor
fuel inventory.
   Evgeny Mikerin, head of Minatom's fuel cycle operations, said that
reprocessing of UO2-based icebreaker fuel at RT-1 poses no technical
challenges, but that a large inventory of spent icebreaker fuel presently
stored near Murmansk would be ``difficult to transport'' to Ozersk.
Uranium-zirconium fuels used in submarine reactors, Mikerin said, are
difficult to reprocess there.
   Dzekun also would not disclose prices paid by RT-1's foreign clients.
But Mikerin said that speculation that Hungary pays only about $200/kgHM
for reprocessing services is false. Mikerin said that both the Paks VVER
station and IVO are paying ``somewhat less'' than the Western price, adding
that the rates charged foreign clients are consistent with Minatom's policy
of slightly undercutting market prices.
   According to unconfirmed reports from other Moscow sources, IVO pays
about $700/kgHM for RT-1 reprocessing.
   At present, about 28 MT of separated plutonium from RT-1 VVER
reprocessing operations are stored at Ozersk, Dzekun reported. A little
more than 1 MT was added in 1995. Minatom will continue to stockpile the
plutonium there, he said, in anticipation of BN-800 fast reactors being
built at the Beloyarsk and South Urals sites--the latter adjacent to
RT-1--to absorb the material later as MOX fuel.
   According to Mikerin, however, no funding is allocated for BN-800
construction, and the units will not be built until sometime in the next
century.
   Three years ago, Dzekun said, reprocessing-related operations at
Chelyabinsk-65 employed about 18,000 people. Now the complex provides work
for 14,000; the other 4,000 employees have left for commercial work
elsewhere in the formerly closed city.

REPROCESSING CRITICS SAY MAYAK WILL DIE WITHOUT FOREIGN BUSINESS

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Official Russian recognition that the RT-1 reprocessing plant at Ozersk
is fighting for its future confirms predictions made by reprocessing
critics last year.
   In companion papers submitted to the recent Global 95 conference in
Versailles, Anatoly Diakov of the Moscow Institute of Physics & Technology,
and Oleg Bukharin of Princeton University, argued that without reprocessing
business from Hungary and Finland, paid for in hard currency, RT-1 ``would
be completely unprofitable,'' as Diakov put it.
   Ironically, Bukharin pointed out that the existing backlog of naval
spent fuel and submarine dismantlement--amounting to up to 350 submarine
reactor cores' worth of spent fuel within a few years--would provide enough
work for RT-1's naval fuel processing line for ``tens of years,'' even at
100% capacity. But ``this work does not add to the plant's revenues,''
Bukharin said, since the fees paid to RT-1 operator Mayak by the Navy and
the icebreaker fleet only cover production costs. He added that the Navy is
having trouble finding even that amount, independent of the problem of
shipping the spent cores.
   Reprocessing of HEU fuel, Bukharin said, is not favored by Mayak because
it must be funded by Minatom (the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy) and
is actually a drag on Mayak's own budget.
   Bukharin reviewed the situation with operators of VVER-440 reactors in
Russia and abroad, concluding that economic difficulties in Ukraine and
Bulgaria would diminish the economic value of any spent fuel takeback
arrangements with reactors there. As for VVER-440 operators in central
Europe and Finland, they are gradually moving toward alternative
arrangements, in light of Minatom's high reprocessing fees and the new
requirement for returning waste to reprocessing customers.
   ``Reprocessing of foreign spent fuel has become the principal source of
revenues for Mayak,'' Bukharin said, but those revenues ``cannot be assured
in the future....The loss of the foreign contracts would likely undermine
Mayak's reprocessing business.''
   Recently, Minatom officials--like some of their counterparts in the
West--have attempted to sell future reprocessing operations at RT-1 as part
of a global disarmament and waste management strategy involving mixed-oxide
fuel use and, potentially, advanced techniques of actinide incineration.
   Even if Mayak stopped processing spent fuel soon, Russia would still
have a weapons plutonium inventory of 125 metric tons--an amount destined
to grow in the future as plutonium is separated out from nuclear weapons
components--and a civilian stockpile totaling 72 MT, excluding plutonium
contained in about 8,000 MT of spent fuel stored at reactor sites,
according to Diakov's figures. As of October 1994, all newly produced
plutonium is supposed to be stored in oxide form. High-level Minatom
officials have argued that this plutonium represents a ``national
treasure'' whose use as fuel must be promoted.
   But Diakov argued that technical difficulties, including reactor design,
costs and licensing requirements, would foreclose the introduction of MOX
fuels in Russia's VVER-1000 reactor fleet. Minatom has essentially no
experience burning MOX in LWRs, an argument used by breeder reactor
enthusiasts to promote the recycling of plutonium in fast reactors instead
of LWRs (NF, 9 Oct. '95, 6).
   Diakov, however, contends that the high cost of MOX in a breeder
strategy also would kill that option. He cited an estimated cost of
$765-million for a new BN-800 fast reactor at Beloyarsk and a
multimillion-dollar cost for the so-called Shop 300 plutonium fuel
fabrication plant at Ozersk. An additional three BN-800 units planned for
the South Urals site, near the Mayak complex, would cost $3-billion, he
said.
   Diakov--a well-known opponent of reprocessing and bete noire of
Minatom--said that the nuclear ministry had requested $85-million as part
of its fiscal 1995 program to support a program for transforming ex-weapons
plutonium into MOX fuel. But as of last June 30, the ministry had received
less than 10% of the funds, he said.
   Another potential obstacle is Russia's new nuclear legislation, which
imposes more stringent environmental standards and consequently complicates
licensing of new fuels.
   Because of ``Russia's current chaotic political and economical
condition,'' the Moscow researcher wrote, ``it is unlikely that plans for
Pu utilization will be carried out soon.''
   Moreover, Diakov said, Minatom is not enthusiastic about non-reactor
options for plutonium disposition, such as vitrifying the material, which
it perceives as unsafe.
   Diakov predicted that ``in the next several decades...there will be no
plutonium use in Russia.'' For one thing, Russia's uranium production
capability can support 100 gigawatts of installed reactor capacity, while
the country has only 22 GW. For another, its stockpiles of high-enriched
uranium and uranium enrichment tails are estimated at 1,200 metric tons and
300,000 MT, respectively. Finally, Diakov said, Minatom has about
15-million SWU worth of enrichment capacity and the potential to fabricate
4%-enriched uranium fuel from 0.3% tails at a cost of $540 per kilogram.
   ``It is clear there is no economical motivation for Russia's nuclear
industry to reprocess spent fuel or use plutonium for fuel fabrication,''
he said. Diakov argued that the real question is whether Russia's nuclear
business will take a short- or long-term view of the plutonium disposition
issue. He noted that the main concern is ``to prevent diversion and reuse
of weapons-grade material in new weapons.''
   Rather than seek new uses for plutonium, Diakov contended, the Russian
government should ally with the U.S. to ``make a determined effort to set
up a reciprocal regime of plutonium storage under bilateral or
international control.''

NONPROLIFERATION, SPENT FUEL HANDLING KEY TO LWR SUPPLY CONTRACT WITH DPRK

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   Under a supply contract signed between the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization (KEDO) and North Korea in New York December 15,
KEDO will be responsible for providing fuel to and handling spent fuel from
the two light water reactors promised to Pyongyang.
   North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Ho Jon, and KEDO
Executive Director Stephen Bosworth signed the agreement following long and
difficult negotiations that began in Kuala Lumpur in September and resumed
October 16 in New York City. While the contract leaves many details about
the reactor deal unanswered, it paves the way for a possible
ground-breaking at the reactor site in North Korea as early as April, a
source close to the talks said.
   KEDO will finance the $4.5-billion reactor project. It still must enter
into a prime contract; select a ``program coordinator,'' as the
architect/engineer is being called; and finish the site characterization
underway at Sinpo. The Korean Electric Power Corp. is expected to be the
prime contractor, with a number of subcontractors. The supply contract says
that the program coordinator is to be a U.S. firm. The contract for program
coordinator is expected to be awarded based on open competition, with a
request for proposals going out in January or February, said one source
close to the talks. The contract calls for completion of the two reactors
by 2003.
   The contract specifies that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) will continue the freeze on its 5-MW research reactor and refrain
from building the two larger reactors that were planned, as well as
continue to cooperate in safely storing and canning the spent fuel from the
research reactor, Dan Poneman said at a news briefing in Washington, D.C.
on December 15. Poneman is senior director for nonproliferation and export
controls at the National Security Council.
   KEDO was established in March by the U.S., the Republic of Korea, and
Japan to finance the cost of constructing two 1,000-MW reactors promised to
North Korea under the October 1994 Agreed Framework between the U.S. and
North Korea. The Clinton administration negotiated the agreement to address
the nuclear weapons proliferation threat posed by the DPRK.
   The supply contract says that KEDO will provide nuclear fuel for the
initial loading of each LWR and then will assist the DPRK in obtaining LWR
fuel, other than that provided in the initial loading, through commercial
contracts. KEDO and the DPRK are to cooperate to ensure safe storage of
spent fuel. ``If requested by KEDO, the DPRK must relinquish any ownership
rights over the LWR spent fuel and agree to the transfer of the spent fuel
out of the DPRK through commercial contracts,'' a KEDO statement said.

Contract Prohibits Reprocessing
   Under the contract, the DPRK agrees to apply IAEA safeguards to the LWR
project. North Korea also agrees not to reprocess or increase the
enrichment level of any nuclear material used in or produced through the
use of any reactor or nuclear material transferred in connection with the
reactor project.
   KEDO officials insist that no target date has been set for the
ground-breaking, because there are still many uncertainties surrounding the
project. That decision will depend on the findings of the site
characterization teams and on the timetable for completion of the other
contracts and protocols that KEDO needs to negotiate.
   KEDO sent a third site characterization team to the survey area near
Sinpo City in South Hamgyong Province on December 16. The 15-member team
plans to remain in North Korea for a month, during which time it will
gather information for a topographical map and prepare boring work for the
next step of the site survey, KEDO officials said.
   Of the estimated $4.5-billion cost to construct the two reactors, it is
expected that South Korea will contribute about $3-billionz, Japan about
$1-billion, and the U.S. and other KEDO members about $500,000, plus the
cost of continuing shipments of heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea in
the agreedment, one source noted. However, the exact amounts of money
pledged by the two major players, as well as smaller donations pledged by
other countries, have not been made public.
   A KEDO spokesman declined to comment on the organization's finances or
to provide information on the contributions provided by member nations or
contributing countries. A South Korean embassy official said December 19
that a decision on the amount South Korea will contribute to KEDO has not
been made yet, because the exact cost of the project is not yet known. The
official suggested that a decision might be made following the KEDO board
meeting planned for mid-January.
   Among the key issues to be worked out before construction can begin are
the details of how North Korea will repay South Korea for the financing.
The supply contract states that KEDO will finance the cost of the
construction and will be repaid by the DPRK, interest free, over 20 years,
inclusive of a three-year grace period, beginning with the completion of
each LWR.
   ``Repayment may be in cash, cash equivalents or through transfer of
goods,'' a KEDO release on the agreement stated.
   Under the supply contract, KEDO is to provide a radioactive waste
storage building for low- and medium-level waste with a 10-year storage
capacity for the two LWRs; nuclear fuel for the initial loading of each
plant, including such fuel rods as may be necessary to preserve safety for
initial operation; and technical support services for the first LWR for one
year after its completion.
   The DPRK further agrees: to allow the IAEA to resume ad hoc and routine
inspections of facilities not covered by the nuclear freeze when the supply
agreement was signed; to remain a party to the Treaty on the
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to allow implementation of
its safeguards agreement under the NPT; and to come into full compliance
with its IAEA safeguards agreement when a ``significant portion'' of the
LWR project is completed, but before the delivery of key nuclear
components.
   The DPRK also agrees: to conclude a bilateral agreement for peaceful
nuclear cooperation with the U.S. prior to the delivery of key nuclear
components, if U.S. firms provide such components; to transfer spent fuel
from the 5-MW reactor from North Korea when the delivery of key nuclear
components for the first LWR begins; and to begin dismantling its
graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities upon completion of the
first LWR, and to complete the dismantlement upon completion of the second
LWR.
   The contract further states that prior to shipment of any fuel
assemblies, the DPRK will observe the provisions of Convention on Nuclear
Safety, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, the
Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological
Emergency, and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material.

CAMECO'S PORT HOPE REFINERY LICENSE RENEWED JUST DAYS BEFORE EXPIRATION

By:
Ray Silver, Toronto

   Cameco Corp.'s refinery at Port Hope, Ontario was granted a two-year
license renewal December 19, a dozen days before its operating permit would
have expired. The facility is the oldest of four large uranium processing
plants in the world.
   The license renewal had been deferred earlier in the month after area
residents voiced safety and environmental concerns at an Atomic Energy
Control Board meeting. Despite staff reports that the facility posed no
threat to the environment or to public health and safety, several residents
had concerns ranging from emergency response plans to the ultimate
decommissioning of the facility.
   The introduction of environmental issues into the license review
apparently stemmed from a 15-year debate on the disposal of low-level
refinery waste at Port Hope. The Port Hope license renewal was announced a
week after Canada's natural resources minister Anne McLellan said she would
ask the government early this year to consider a task force recommendation
that radioactive Port Hope refinery waste be buried at Atomic Energy of
Canada Ltd.'s Chalk River nuclear station.
   Cameco's predecessor company, Eldorado Nuclear, built the Port Hope
facility in 1932 to extract radium from pitchblende. The plant was modified
12 years later to refine the stockpiled residue and yellowcake to uranium
for the Manhattan Project in the U.S.
   In 1962 Eldorado began to produce uranium oxide (UO2) to fuel Candu
reactors and in 1969 to produce uranium hexafluoride (UF6) for light water
reactors. Both uranium trioxide (U03) from Cameco's Blind River, Ontario
facility and uranium from other producers feed the Port Hope refinery,
which produces 8,000-9,500 metric tons of fuel a year, most of it as UF6
for LWRs in the U.S. and abroad.

EXPERTS SUPPORT CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL SAFETY CONVENTION

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Vienna

   Nuclear safety officials from over 40 countries agreed in Vienna last
week to proceed ''step by step'' towards an international safety regime
that could eventually include a framework convention defining a common
nuclear safety approach and how to achieve it practically.
   German Environment/Nuclear Safety Minister Klaus Toepfer, who chaired
the Vienna meeting under the auspices of the IAEA, said the world is
waiting for all countries using nuclear energy to commit to a safety
regime, which he called ''the cornerstone of nuclear energy.''
   As expected, the conference did not endorse the idea of a binding
convention whereby nations would commit to meet certain minimum safety
standards and submit their installations to international audits--a
surprise proposal Toepfer floated at the conference's opening session (NW,
5 Sept., 1). But IAEA directors and conference participants hailed the
10-point agreement they reached on ways to bolster the international safety
''regime'' as the first tangible consensus of technical and political
nuclear safety experts on the sensitive subject.
   Participants in the meeting, called ''International Conference on
Nuclear Safety: Strategy for the Future,'' saw the unified approach as
indispensable to ensure there are no dangerous outliers among the world's
nuclear power plants and/or operators, which could suffer accidents that
would put the rest of the world's nuclear programs in jeopardy.
   Among the points the 350 experts agreed on were strengthening of
existing IAEA safety service programs, developing ''a common basis'' on
which to judge the safety of reactors built to earlier standards, more
exchange and dissemination of operating experience, and developing common
safety criteria for future reactor designs.
   They also agreed that safety is above all the responsibility of national
authorities, and that the IAEA should help promote ''sufficient national
regulatory oversight.'' They called on national operating organizations and
authorities to come forward to ''identify operating nuclear power plants
which do not meet the high safety performance levels of the vast majority
of operating plants and undertake improvements with assistance from the
international community.''
   Toepfer was visibly pleased at the result and, at a closing press
conference September 6, insisted that the momentum towards a convention of
a binding nature must not be lost. He firmly believes the world nuclear
community must have made clear progress towards such a text by next June,
when the United Nations Conference on Environment & Development meets in
Brazil to discuss, among other things, climate change and a possible
international convention on global warming. ''If you have no good answer
about the control of safety and about handling of nuclear wastes'' to bring
to a concerned world, he said, ''you won't be able to have'' nuclear
energy.
   IAEA Director General Hans Blix said that the earliest a convention
could actually be presented to the agency's Board of Governors and General
Conference would be in one year's time, but the task could well take two
years. Once the convention entered into force, separate protocols then
could be concluded to agree on such things as incident reporting, use of
severity scales, and safety reviews. ''The fewer things you try to do, the
easier it is,'' he commented.
   Although the Soviet-design plants of central and eastern Europe came up
repeatedly in the three days of debate, senior IAEA officials said that the
recommendations were aimed at all countries. Several participants named
India, Mexico, Argentina, and Cuba as countries considered worthy of closer
scrutiny and/or intensified help in the nuclear safety domain, because of
either their inexperience or the closed nature of their nuclear programs.
   The experts also agreed that socio-economic factors should not be used
to justify continued operation of a plant that does not meet agreed-on
minimum safety standards and that if sucha plant cannot be suitably backfit
with available resources, it should be shut down and alternative
electricity sources ''sought.''

But Who Decides?

   The group did not say who should decide all this to whose standards, or
who should provide the electricity, but German technical nuclear safety
chief Adolf Birkhofer said, ''We must judge (a plant's acceptability) on an
ad hoc basis using the best information available including (that of) the
IAEA.'' Toepfer said this might be a ''second-best solution'' awaiting the
agreement on universal standards, but said, ''That's what we have to live
with in political life.''
   Blix told journalists the initial shock the convention proposal
generated in some quarters may have stemmed from misinterpretation of the
word. ''Is a 'convention' an instrument to drive through joint
international standards, or an expression of states'' of their common
commitment? he asked. ''We can come a long way'' towards strengthening
nuclear safety worldwide with existing services and standards promulgated
by the IAEA, such as OSART (Operational Safety Review Team) missions and
NUSS (the agency's Nuclear Safety Standards series), Blix said, but ''a
convention gives it a more solid ground.'' He said a formal convention on
safety, like the conventions on early notification and mutual assistance in
case of nuclear accidents negotiated quickly after the Chernobyl accident
in 1986, would represent ''a higher level of development in the field of
nuclear safety.''
   It would also likely represent a higher level of expenditure for those
countries whose budgets are already being strained for other contributions.
Blix said one OSART typically costs $100,000 and that a program such as
outlined by the experts' meeting would surely cost ''millions of dollars.''
The agency's current program to review the safety of older VVER plants in
eastern Europe has been funded all off-budget, and Assistant Deputy
Director General for Nuclear Safety Morris Rosen said that one-third of the
60 professionals in his division--which absorbs only 6% of the regular IAEA
budget--are working on extrabudgetary programs.
   A major push to increase on-budget nuclear safety-related spending at
the IAEA would almost certainly provoke debate among members. The U.S.,
which contributes 25% of the agency's budget, is concerned about the
proliferation of expensive extrabudgetary programs at the IAEA, but at the
same time is apparently not ready to endorse budget growth for the agency,
which has been living with zero-growth budgets for the past six years.
   Blix said that ''if you run a great many'' of these programs, ''you
can't just run it on a shoestring.'' The agency's Chernobyl project and its
VVER-440 program ''started with nothing and we practically walked around
with a hat,'' he said. ''That's not the way to run a railroad.''
   The issue was to be debated late this week at the IAEA Board of
Governors' meeting before being taken up by the full General Conference,
which meets September 16-20.
   Some participants in the safety conference also questioned whether an
international safety program would be the most efficient way to get at the
real problem plants in the world. ''I'm worried that an international
organization largely funded by us is going to spend a lot of time looking
at us and not where they should be looking,'' commented NRC Commissioner
Forrest Remick, who led the U.S. delegation.
   ''If we're aiming at improving operating plants, setting standards won't
improve that in the short term. What those countries need is help in
implementing the standards we already have,'' Remick told Nucleonics Week.
And ''knowing that some international organization has standards isn't
going to enhance public acceptance of nuclear in the U.S.'' or elsewhere,
he added.

NOVOVORONEZH CALLED 'NO KOZLODUY' BUT SAFETY CULTURE FOUND LACKING

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   The first IAEA Safety Review Mission to a first-generation PWR
(VVER-440) plant in the USSR, at Novovoronezh, confirmed that conditions
there are nowhere near as alarming as those at the similar Kozloduy plant
in Bulgaria. But officials returning from the Novovoronezh safety mission
in early September said the Russian units still suffer from a number of
design deficiencies, notably lack of separation between systems and
inadequate fire protection. More fundamentally, the Novovoronezh operators
and management, while exhibiting competence and enthusiasm, showed a
disturbing lack of safety culture and safety philosophy as it is understood
in the West, the officials said.
   The conditions discovered by the IAEA team during their safety review of
the four Kozloduy VVER-440 Model 230 reactors in May-June were so
disastrous that they set off alarms all over western Europe and launched a
crash program to aid the Bulgarians to get their plant in order by the
winter. The program, under the auspices of the European Communities and the
World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), is already under way (NW, 29
Aug., 11). However, Germany is pressing for recognition by the Bulgarians
that the oldest Kozloduy units, 1 and 2, should still be shut as soon as
possible.
   An earlier review of VVER-440/230 units at Bohunice in Czechoslovakia
confirmed that the Czechs had made many safety improvements and had a
satisfactory safety culture. But the question remained open for the
first-generation Soviet VVER-440s at Novovoronezh and Kola (two units at
each site).
   The safety reviews are the final piece of a year-long IAEA-sponsored
''Study of the Safety of Older Reactors,'' focussed on the first-generation
VVER-440s, that is due to wind up in October. A safety review team left
Vienna September 7 for the Kola plant, in the far north of the USSR near
Murmansk.
   ''It's not Kozloduy,'' said a senior IAEA safety review official last
week in regard to the Novovoronezh station. ''The management is committed
to improvement and has sufficient resources and authority'' to do the job,
whereas Kozloduy had been plagued with attrition of senior staff to better
jobs and wholesale abandonment earlier this year by the Soviet experts who
had in effect been running the plant. Nevertheless, the IAEA source said,
the Novovoronezh team found housekeeping problems similar to those at
Kozloduy--indicating that the lessons of Kozloduy had not been taken into
account at the Russian VVER station--and confirmed the well-known design
deficiencies of the VVER-440/230 plants.
   The review covered Novovoronezh-3 and -4, the head-of-series twin
reactors on which Bohunice, Kozloduy, and the now-closed Greifswald
reactors in the former German Democratic Republic were based. Two earlier
prototype units at Novovoronezh, VVER-440 Model 179s, were decommissioned
in 1988 and 1990.
   On the positive side, the IAEA review team confirmed the existence of
conservatism in the early VVER designs due to large primary system water
inventories and a wide core design safety margin. They also found that
pressure vessel annealing as carried out in the USSR today appeared to be
''well established technology,'' according to a press release issued at the
close of the review, and approved backfits already carried out
   Nevertheless, the team said that the leak-before-break concept for
guaranteeing primary circuit integrity must be proven applicable at
VVER-440s in order to establish ''an acceptable safety level for the
long-term backfitting program'' at Novovoronezh. The Soviets have used
leak-before-break to justify the absence of full-pressure containments over
their early PWRs.
   The IAEA team also remained concerned over the potential for
common-cause failures that could affect safety functions, especially as
regards service water systems, boron injection pumps, electrical and
instrumentation & control cable rooms, and control room I&C. The team, a
source said, found a host of safety-related equipment, including safety
injection pumps, in the auxiliary building that also contained turbines and
condensers, with inadequate separation between them. The control room was
separated from the condensers in the turbine hall by a glass door, and fire
doors were blocked open all over the plant.
   ''They seem to have no idea about environmental qualification,
especially for electrical equipment,'' said an IAEA official. The team was
also chagrined at the lack of written procedures for both normal and
emergency operations, and recommended that such procedures be developed so
as to ''remove the reliance and burden placed on operators in needing to
recall operating instructions from memory.''
   The team also was concerned by the ''lack of understanding of safety
philosophy'' at the plant level, as one member put it. Plant management and
operators had no idea about severe accident analyses, saying that was the
business of the design institutes in Moscow, and were not particularly
worried because they had been assured that severe accidents were impossible
at their plant. The plant simulator--the first in the USSR and now
significantly obsolete, according to the IAEA official--cannot reproduce a
steam generator tube rupture beyond the very beginning of the accident
sequence.
   As a start, the IAEA team advised the Novovoronezh management to compile
a safety report for the plant. One never has existed, and safety-related
information is spread over several different institutes, including the VVER
scientific leader Kurchatov Atomic Energy Institute and architect/engineer
Atomenergoprojekt. The plant management produced 600 pages of
safety-related information for the IAEA review team the day the auditors
arrived, apparently the first time all the documentation had been collected
in a single report. ''We told them to pressure the design institutes for
safety studies. It's their plant, they have the right to the information,''
a senior IAEA official said. VVER experts from Kurchatov have been invited
to show up at the current Kola review with their safety documentation, the
official added.
   Members of the Novovoronezh mission are not likely to forget their stay
at the Russian PWR--not for reasons of nuclear safety, but because the
second week of the reviewencompassed the Soviet Union's most dramatic
events in over 70 years. Far from being apathetic about another change in
government as hard-liners were attempting to carry through a coup d'etat in
Moscow, the Novovoronezh citizens sprang to the defense of the USSR's
legitimate government. On August 19, a town meeting was broadcast live on
local television in which the usurpers were repeatedly denounced.
   Euphoria followed the failure of the coup two days later. ''I'll bet it
was the only time a safety review team will see reactor operators crying at
their stations--first from shame because of the coup, then for joy because
democracy had triumphed,'' an IAEA official remarked.

PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS BEGINS AS FINNS PREPARE FOR REACTOR ORDER

By:
Risto Valkeapaa, Loviisa

   Finnish power companies Imatran Voima Oy and Teollisuuden Voima Oy (IVO
and TVO) have begun the information campaign that, under Finnish nuclear
law, is the first step in preparations for the country's planned fifth
nuclear reactor.
   IVO and TVO sent 45,000 letters September 9 to households in the areas
of Loviisa and Eurajoki, their two current nuclear power plant sites. The
letters contain a general study of the planned new power unit as well as
notification from the Ministry of Trade & Industry of public hearings on
the issue October 15 in Eurajoki and October 22 in Loviisa.
   Preliminary public information meetings are also planned October 2 in
the two towns.
   IVO Managing Director Kalevi Numminen opened the event at an information
meeting in Loviisa and TVO Chairman Juhani Ahava, in Eurajoki, but the
interest center-of-gravity was Loviisa. IVO's predominant role in the
information process was underscored by the fact that even the information
material was produced mostly by IVO.
   Numminen confirmed that four plant types are in the Finnish competition:
ABB Atom's BWR-90; NPI-BWR, a Siemens-design BWR proposed by Nuclear Power
International (NPI); NPI-PWR, a Siemens-Framatome PWR also proposed by NPI;
and a modern VVER-1000 from Atomenergoexport of the USSR. It is commonly
known that IVO is keenly interested in being architect/engineer of the
planned reactor and that the company has very good knowledge of PWRs from
having operated the two Loviisa units.
   Numminen said the Finnish project must proceed speedily because new
generating capacity will certainly be needed after 1995. He said history
had shown that electricity needs grow after periods of recession and that
Finland's economy has been raised by improving industrial efficiency and
technical methods, all of which implies more electricity demand.

CASH-STRAPPED MCDERMOTT MAY SELL FRAMATOME MORE OF B&W VENTURES

By:
Ben A. Franklin, Washington; Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   McDermott International, Inc., the Louisiana-based oil service company
which now owns 50% stakes in the profitable Babcock & Wilcox subsidiaries,
B&W Nuclear Services Co. (BWNS) and B&W Fuel Co. (BWFC), is expected to
sell controlling interests in the two joint ventures to Framatome to raise
cash. McDermott and Framatome held out the possibility that the French
company would increase its holding in the two subsidiaries at a later
date.
   In 1989 McDermott sold half ownership in BWNS to Framatome and 49% of
BWFC to Virginia Fuel Inc., a consortium of Framatome, Cogema, and Uranium
Pechiney in which Framatome holds 40%.
   The deal now under discussion was said to be worth $70-million. It would
raise the French owners' stake in each B&W enterprise to 75% for now, with
a likely third helping later. BWNS and BWFC, which account for 85% of B&W's
civilian nuclear business, have been profitable and growing (NW, 13 June,
11).
   A Framatome official said that the French vendor is so pleased with the
performance of and prospects for the B&W ventures that ''if we had had to
take over all of McDermott's share, we would have done it.''
   B&W and Framatome said the parties expect to complete the transfer of
ownership by the end of this year and added the companies are ''discussing
arrangements whereby Framatome would have the opportunity to further
increase its ownership of both companies at a future date.''
   Framatome board chairman Jean-Claude Leny said his firm's increased
commitment to the B&W companies underscored its confidence in the future of
nuclear energy, especially in America. Leny said he believes a nuclear
revival ''inevitable'' in the U.S. and that it could start as soon as three
years from now. Framatome also is counting on expansion of the nuclear
services market with massive replacement of steam generators and
rejuvenation related to plant life extension.
   By joint agreement, BWNS and BWFC are to remain under the management of
current President Charles Pryor.
   ''The motive here is pretty clearly McDermott's need to improve its
balance sheet by adding cash,'' a Wall Street analyst said. ''They are
losing money in the oil service business. They sold the crown jewels of
B&W, Bailey Controls, to an Italian company, Finmeccanica, for $295-million
in 1989. But that and the earlier B&W spinoffs to the French apparently
just weren't enough.''
   Don Washington, a McDermott spokesman, said his company's guidance to
B&W in shedding its civilian nuclear business, which is based largely in
Lynchburg, Va., reflected McDermott's announced ''consideration of sales to
increase liquidity.''

FIFTH TEAM OF WNP-2 OPERATORS AGAIN FAILS REQUALIFICATION TEST

   A WNP-2 crew has failed one of three simulator tests, postponing reactor
restart for ''at least several more weeks,'' according to utility spokesman
John Britton. The outage, which began for refueling in April, is costing
the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) about $100,000 per day.
   When only three of the five required control room operator crews passed
NRC requalification exams last February and March, WPPSS had to postpone to
late August WNP-2's post-refueling restart of WNP-2. Instead, WPPSS resumed
retraining the two failed crews and prepared for re-exams (NW, 18 July,
6).
   On September 9, one of the two flunked crews again failed one of three
simulator emergency scenarios.
   Britton said one of the two crews given makeup requalification tests
this week was successful. But the second--the fifth crew of the five
required--did not do well enough in a late afternoon and evening simulator
challenge. ''They failed only one of three different emergency scenarios,''
Britton said, ''but making no apologies, the overall fact is that they
failed.'' He said WPPSS would begin immediately ''putting together a new
crew.''

BARSEBAECK BWR PUMP FAILURE
REHEATS COOLANT DURING REFUELING

By:
Mark Hibbs, Bonn

    A pump trip at Sydkraft AB' Barsebaeck-2 on September 6 led to
reheating of reactor coolant in the pressure vessel for several hours
during a refueling outage. The incident has been classified as level 1 on
the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
    Plant officials this week said that for about 3.5 hours on Friday,
September 6, failure of the one oprating residual heat removal (RHR) pump
operating caused the water temperature in the pressure vessel to increase
from 50 degrees C to about 98 degrees C. With the pump in operation after
the BWR had been shut down to begin the outage, water temperature had
fallen as planned to 50 degrees C.
    The two RHR pumps are periodically used during reactor operation to
circulate coolant through heat exchangers and ion filters. During refueling
outages they are used to lower coolant temperature prior to opening the
vessel.
    The pump failed to work after a suction valve began to close and
tripped the pump. The valve is pneumatic and nitrogen pressure dropped when
a pressure relief valve was tested. With the main circulation pumps shut
down at the onset of the refueling operation, water temperature in the
vessel began to increase when the heat removal pump failed. The second RHR1
pump was available and was started manually after the first pump was found
out of service, officials said, and coolant temperature was again lowered
to 50 degrees C.
    Operators in the control room during the beginning of the refueling
exercise did not notice that water temperature in the vessel had increased,
since temperature monitors were not located in a position on the residual
heat removal lines so as to record the temperature. The increase was
noticed only when the lid to the pressure vessel was removed and a ''small
release'' of steam occurred, the official said, but the release was below
the level which, would have triggered radiation alarms. After a short
delay, however, a fire protection alarm was triggered by the release, he
said.
   The refueling outage at the reactor was scheduled to take 13 days.
Because of the incident, however, the lengthj of the outage might be
increased, the official said.

SETTLEMENT ON GRAND GULF COULD RECOUP $90-MILLION FOR NOPSI

   An agreement in principle would permit New Orleans Public Service Inc.
(NOPSI) to recoup an additional $90-million of its Grand Gulf-1 nuclear
plant investment from ratepayers. NOPSI has already written off
$186.2-million of its $535.5-million share of Grand Gulf.
   The tentative agreement announced last week between NOPSI, the New
Orleans City Council, and the Alliance for Affordable Energy would end
three years of litigation over the city council's ''prudence'' disallowance
of $135-million of Grand Gulf-1 costs.
   The 1,306-MW General Electric BWR came on-line in 1985, and in 1988 the
city council disallowed recovery of $135-million after finding
$476.2-million imprudent. The utility had already written off $51.2-million
of the plant's costs, which were 15.3% of Grand Gulf's $3.5-billion.
   Appeals and counterappeals in the case were heard in both Louisiana and
federal courts, and the case is scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme
Court later this year.
   The agreement calls for NOPSI to reduce electric rates by $11.3-million
when the agreement becomes effective; but then allows rate increases of
$7.3-million in 1992, $6.7-million in 1993, $5.2-million in 1994, and
$4.4-million in 1995.
   In exchange for these increases, aimed at re-capturing Grand Gulf costs,
NOPSI will freeze any other rate increases for five years and concede to a
13.76% cap on earnings from electric operations.
   The New Orleans City Council has scheduled a public hearing on the
proposed settlement for September 19, with a decision expected around
October 3.

IRRADIATION ACCIDENT SHOCKS FRANCE; 'CRACKDOWN' ON SMALL USERS PROMISED

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Two men remained hospitalized in France this week after being severely
irradiated in August by electrons from a particle beam accelerator at an
industrial enterprise in Forbach, near Metz. France's environment minister
said the accident shows that insufficient attention has been paid to small
users of radioactivity and promised a ''crackdown'' on such uses.
   The estimated doses sustained by the workers, who came from the
temporary-employment agency Manpower and had apparently not received
training in radioprotection, were reported to be between 50 and 100 rem,
but an expert at the Institut de Protection et de Surete Nucleaire (IPSN)
said the exposures must have been much higher to have caused the
radiation-induced burns from which the patients are suffering. IPSN was
conducting biological exams of the patients early this week at the Percy
military hospital in Clamart, near Paris, to determine the doses with
greater accuracy. The accident is the most serious of its kind on Labor
Department record in France.
   A third person, a recently hired crew leader, was also irradiated but
much less severely and was not hospitalized with the others August 27. The
enterprise, Electron Beam Service (EBS), which used the beams to refine
carbon particles, has been ordered closed and responsibilities in the
affair are under investigation by the regional Labor Department and the
prosecutor general of Sarreguemines. The company, pleading human error on
the workers' part, says safety instructions forbade entering the beam hall
for 10 to 15 minutes after the beam was switched off, but local Labor
officials say the instructions were written in English and that EBS had not
declared the existence of the accelerator to the authorities.
   Environment/Risks Minister Brice Lalonde declared, ''I didn't know you
could have a particle accelerator in your attic. We have been paying so
much attention to the tree of nuclear power plants, we haven't seen the
forest of small users'' of radiation equipment. ''We are going to have to
really crack down.''
   The dose estimates of 50 to 100 rem reported in the French media over
last weekend were far too low, according to the IPSN expert, to have led to
the effects suffered by the two workers: skin burns several millimeters
deep and loss of hair. The results of the IPSN examination are covered by
medical confidentiality. But a radioprotection expert told Nucleonics Week
that skin burns, radiodermatitis, and other radioactivity-induced effects
imply irradiation to at least ''several tens of Gray'' with a minimum of 6
Gray. One Gray equals 100 rad. Grays and rads measure the energy absorbed
by irradiated matter; 100 rem is equivalent to 100 rad, but rem measures
the biological damage done to living tissue that has been irradiated.
Experts say that above 50 rem--at which level no biological damage is
observed--one should speak rather of rad, or Gray.
   By way of comparison, ''liquidators'' working on the Chernobyl nuclear
plant site in 1986 almost routinely received doses of 50 rem, but those who
contracted radiation sickness on the night of the catastrophe were said to
have received upwards of 600 rem (6 Gray).

CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT PLANS MIXED WASTE FACILITY AT HANFORD

By:
Richard R. Zuercher, Washington

   Chemical Waste Management, Inc. (CWM) plans to spend more than
$100-million to build and operate a facility to clean up waste that is both
hazardous and radioactive at DOE's Hanford nuclear reservation in
Washington.
   The company--a unit of Waste Management, Inc.--says the state-of-the-art
Tri-Cities Environmental Analysis & Treatment (Treat) complex will function
as an analytical laboratory and waste treatment facility for wastes
produced by DOE and other generators in the Pacific Northwest.
   ''We expect to invest over $100-million in CWM facilities at Hanford
over the next six to eight years to bring our world-renowned commercial
clean-up experience to serve DOE's needs as well as those of the Pacific
Northwest,'' said CWM Chairman Jerry Dempsey. ''Having these facilities
available will accelerate the cleanup of Hanford by years and reduce
overall restoration costs.''
   Dempsey said CWM expects to first build an analytical facility adjacent
to the Hanford reservation. Construction tentatively is set to start later
this year, with the facility to come on line in 1993. The facility will
provide laboratory analysis of mixed waste (low level radwaste also
designated as chemically hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency),
and will accommodate Treat management staff and CWM scientists who plan to
participate jointly in research with DOE's Pacific Northwest Laboratory.
   CWM currently is negotiating for purchase of the land, in the city of
Richland at the Port of Benton's Richland Airport, CWM said.
   The second major component of the Treat complex will be a waste
treatment facility on the Hanford reservation. That facility, to be
licensed by Washington state and built over the next two to six years, will
contain separation, sampling, records management, incineration,
stabilization, repackaging, and transportation operations needed to treat
mixed waste from Hanford and regional commercial generators. Construction
is expected to begin in 1993, CWM said.
   The waste treatment complex will be built in the center of the
560-square-mile reservation, about eight miles from the Columbia River and
agricultural areas of the Columbia Basin. CWM said the facility's advanced
effluent controls and the extensive buffer provided by the Hanford site
will do much to make the facility environmentally sound.
   ''The facility will be designed so that, as the Hanford mixed-waste
market grows and advanced technologies become fully available, enhancements
to the treatment complex can be made to safely maintain efficient
operations and high environmental standards,'' the company said. Residues
from the processing of waste will not be dumped at the Treat facility but
will be disposed of at off-site commercial hazardous, licensed low-level
radwaste facilities, or--in the case of Hanford mixed waste--be returned to
Hanford.
   While waste available for treatment in DOE's current inventory is small
compared to other Pacific Northwest markets--about 75 tons of hazardous
waste and 50 tons of mixed waste annually--this type of waste is expected
to increase significantly over the next few years, CWM said. CWM projects
that two-thirds of the waste it eventually will treat will come from DOE,
with the remainder from the commercial market. No tonnage projections were
available. Constructing the waste facility now will serve to avoid the need
for prolonged storage and the environmental risks that accompany it, the
company said.
   Dempsey said serving both DOE and Pacific Northwest markets is key to
the Treat complex's financial viability. The complex is expected to employ
some 200 workers, he added.

COURT ORDER ENDS SECRECY IN DOE PROCEDURES THWARTING FOIA

By:
Ben A. Franklin, Washington

   A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled this week that DOE--acting in
secrecy--wrote departmental procedures designed to shield from disclosure
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) the safety, health and other
records of the corporate contractors running its nuclear weapons program.
The court ordered an end to the concealment.
   The September 9 ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie denied
DOE's petition for summary dismissal of the suit. Instead, the court
granted all demands by the plaintiff in the case, the Committee to Bridge
the Gap (CBG), for the public release of DOE proposals for, and drafts of,
previously hidden rules and orders designed both to thwart FOIA requests
and to block public scrutiny of the department's process of concealment.
   The decision directs DOE henceforth to submit all directives and orders
affecting the public release of contractor data to formal rulemaking
procedure, and requires public notice and opportunity for public comment.
(Civil Action 90-3568-ER).
   Daniel Hirsch, president of CBG, the Los Angeles-based public interest
group that began the dispute in 1988 when DOE denied its FOIA
request--called the decision ''a tremendous victory for public oversight of
DOE.''
   ''Proposals to prevent public access to records of DOE's
contractor-operated facilities have been roundly defeated,'' Hirsch said in
a statement. ''This marks the end of DOE's practice of secretly making
rules affecting the public.'' The plaintiffs charged that DOE officials had
been proposing to shield from disclosure, among other things, data on
worker exposure to radioactivity.
   DOE seemed somewhat less excited by the court ruling. ''Our lawyers call
it a non-event,'' a departmental spokesman said. ''We were going to do this
anyway, and told the court so. But I guess the plaintiffs would say we did
not agree to that until they filed suit.''
   CBG said the irony was that DOE has been promulgating rules that tighten
its FOIA procedures, and doing so in secret. ''They were doing it by
calling the changes 'orders' instead of regulations so they could evade the
requirement that proposed regulations be published for public comment.''
Hirsch said.
   The lawsuit, given a preliminary hearing April 29 (NW, 2 May, 4), was
based in part on CBG's unofficial access through a ''leak'' of a
memorandum from Bruce Twining, manager of DOE's Albuquerque, N.M.,
operations office. CBG cited what it said was Twining's proposal that
contractors' documents on DOE weapons program activities be made virtually
invulnerable to requests under the FOIA, and even more tightly
''suppressed'' than suggested by top department officials in Washington.
   The litigation began when CBG submitted an FOIA request for copies of
changes proposed by DOE in its FOIA procedures and had both that request
and an administrative appeal of its denial turned down by DOE. ''We had to
file an FOIA request, an appeal of its denial, and finally had to go to
court to obtain a copy of DOE's proposed FOIA rule changes,'' Hirsch said.

SELIN BACKS LICENSING REFORM BILL DESPITE AMBIGUITY OVER NRC ROLE

By:
David Stellfox and Dave Airozo, Washington

   NRC can live with the Bush Administration's ideas on nuclear plant
licensing reform legislation even though the pending legislation that
brings about the change (S. 1220) is ''sort of ambiguous'' about NRC's
authority to make a final, overall, pre-operational safety finding.
   Though he concedes the ambiguity, NRC Chairman Ivan Selin isn't bothered
by it. What does have him uneasy is the possibility that the House of
Representatives will offer companion legislation that will gut one of the
keystones of the Administration-backed bill or that the Administration, in
its zeal to pass licensing reform, could ''inadvertently trash'' the
agency's new one step-licensing rule--a rule the commission believes is
adequate and not in need of legislative undergirding.
   Selin's comments to Nucleonics Week came by way of explanation of
previous and apparently contradictory statements on S. 1220.
   When Selin told a House subcommittee in July that the commission would
not object to certain changes in the bill, he appeared to contradict, or at
least back away from, previous commission support for the legislation.
   Secretary of Energy James Watkins, keenly aware of Wall Street's
leeriness about nuclear investments, thinks S. 1220 is fine the way it is
and could help spark a nuclear revival here. Selin's comments prompted
Watkins to dash off a letter--which quickly became public--taking issue
with Selin's statements, particularly his apparent endorsement of a
proposed change that might make it easier for intervenors to get a
post-construction hearing on a new plant.
   Post-construction hearings are anathema to nuclear power's boosters,
because of the uncertainty they create. Such hearings could drag on for
months or years, they argue, and the finished plant could sit idle,
generating nothing but additional interest payments, as has happened in the
past.
   Selin told Nucleonics Week last week that the difference in positions is
only apparent and that he was speaking in the abstract when he testified to
the House subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D-Pa.)
    ''Kostmayer asked a number of questions about (whether) we would
support certain kinds of legislation,'' Selin said. ''I'm sure he asked
them in the context of his interpretation of S. 1220, but they're not
necessarily our interpretation of S. 1220. So I just took them on the face
of it.
   ''It did not seem appropriate...(to) argue with him as to whether his
questions described a particular piece of legislation,'' Selin continued.
''I answered them as, if faced with such legislation, what would our
reaction be. When Secretary Watkins wrote to me, he was talking about a
specific piece of legislation, which is somewhat different from the piece
of legislation described by Chairman Kostmayer in his questions to me and
therefore elicits somewhat different answers.''
   In fact, the answers were sufficiently different as to appear
contradictory--supporting on the one hand S. 1220, which increases the
burden on intervenors seeking hearings, and Kostmayer's suggested changes
to S. 1220, which would lower those same thresholds.
   Congressional sources found Selin's explanation lacking. ''Chairman
Kostmayer's understanding is, and the transcript shows, that that is what
he was trying to get to,'' one source close to the matter said. ''He has
deep concerns about the hurdles intervenors would have to jump under the
legislation.''
   Selin said some of Kostmayer's questioning was aimed at trying ''to put
a little daylight between the commission and the Administration in saying
'you don't really support this bill that's up there, do you?'''
   Selin reiterated NRC's support for S. 1220 last week, but told
Nucleonics Week supporting the Administration's view is not NRC's job.
''The commission's view, from a regulatory point of view, (10 Code of
Federal Regulations) Part 52 is quite adequate, and we still believe that.
On the other hand, we don't have a judgment as to what it is going to take
to have the industry invest or for people to raise money. That's DOE's job.
If it is their judgment that legislation would make it more likely to
foster an attractive competitive climate, we neither agree nor disagree,
that's not our job. So when we make our statement that (Part) 52 is
adequate, we're not making a business judgment, we're making a regulatory
judgment.''
   With that qualification, Selin said the commission could support S. 1220
as it now stands, adding however that the commission is concerned about
what will happen with legislation in the House. He said it's clear
Kostmayer wants the bill amended so that the opportunity for a second,
pre-operational hearing would be mandatory--a requirement that would
''displease'' the commission.
   Some NRC sources believe S. 1220 would unduly tie the commission's hands
by limiting its authority to make an overall, pre-operational determination
about a plant's safety. In his letter to Selin, Watkins said S. 1220 does
not diminish the discretion that the commission ''currently has under
existing authority'' to make safety determinations on its own initiative.
   Though S. 1220 does not eliminate the long-standing authority for a
pre-operational hearing in Section 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA),
the bill establishes a whole new subsection, 189(b), which creates a higher
threshold for intervenors seeking hearings and restricts such hearings
solely to conformance with the requirements of the combined construction
permit/operating license and its associated inspections, tests, analyses,
and acceptance criteria (ITAAC).
   Selin acknowledged that S. 1220 is ''sort of ambiguous'' on this point,
but the ambiguity doesn't really bother him because courts have always
deferred to NRC's broad authority to protect the public health and safety.
''So, as a practical matter I don't think there's any difference between
the two, but it's helpful to have the executive agency (DOE) agree...that
nothing precludes our ability to find that a plant is or isn't healthful
and safe at the time of operation,'' Selin said.
   Ron Simard, a spokesman for the Nuclear Management & Resources Council,
said the new AEA section covering combined licenses would restrict NRC to
the ITAAC, but added that the agency has sufficient authority under Section
161(b) and 161(p) ''to immediately shut down a plant or impose other
conditions'' at any time. That NRC authority applies only to plants already
licensed and operating. The purpose of the new Section 189(b) created by
the legislation is ''to establish some reasonable constraints on the issues
that will be considered during the post-construction and pre-operational
stage,'' Simard said.
   The removal of language from the new Section 189(b) which would require
a commission ''finding'' that the plant is ready to go on line was to
accommodate a DOE concern, Selin said. ''Their understanding is that, by
putting in the word 'finding,' we require a hearing, or at least if someone
challenges, they have to be given a hearing. Our understanding--my General
Counsel--says that's not true. The hearing situation is not affected by the
phrase.
    ''Our General Counsel thinks the hearing situation is identical
whether you call it a finding, or approval of an ITAAC, or a judgment,''
Selin continued. ''It's still the commission's decision on whether a
hearing is called for or not, subject to judicial review. So, at least in
my opinion...what they were nervous about was that, in putting in the word
'finding,' we would make it more difficult for the commission to decide in
a specific case that a hearing was unnecessary.''
   Selin said the big difference between NRC and the Administration is
''none of these things. Our main discomfort is none of these things we've
discussed. If, in trying to get (S.) 1220 through, the Administration were
to inadvertently trash Part 52, we then might end up with neither (the
nuclear power provisions) of (S.) 1220 nor a practical (Part) 52 and then
we don't have a single-step license.''
   He said, ''The Department...just as they think we've changed our public
policy a little bit, they've changed their nuances a little bit. In their
last statement, I'm very comfortable with the letter Secretary Watkins sent
us.''

KOREA PLANS 13 MORE REACTORS TO MAKE NUCLEAR MAIN GENERATOR

By:
Elaine Hiruo, London

   An additional 13 commercial reactors will be constructed by the year
2006 in South Korea under the government's revised long-term development
program, according to Choi Dae Yong, vice president of procurement with
Korea Electric Power Corp.
   The units will be in addition to a 700-MW Candu plant Atomic Energy of
Canada Ltd. received a contract for in February (NW, 3 Jan., 1) and the two
1,000-MW PWRs that will be constructed under a contract awarded to ABB
Combustion Engineering in July (NW, 25 July, 1). The country plans
increasing domestic content of the new reactors and is aiming for complete
self-sufficiency in nuclear construction and operation (NW, 11 Oct. '90,
5).
   Speaking at the Uranium Institute symposium last week in London, Choi
said two more 700-MW Candu pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) and two
1,000-MW PWRs will be constructed by 2001, and six 1,000-MW PWRs and three
700-MW PHWRs are planned for construction by 2006.
   ''The electrical share of final (all) energy consumption increased from
3.7% in 1970 to 11% in 1991. It will be over 14% in 2001,'' Choi said.
''Korea's (per capita) electricity consumption is still much less than that
of advanced industrialized countries, being one-quarter that of Japan and
one-sixth that of the United States. There is therefore the potential for a
rapid increase in electricity demand in the future.''
   He said that peak electricity demand in the country recorded an annual
average growth of 15% during the last 30 years but that reserve capacity
during the 1991 summer peak was only 4.5%.
   Nuclear accounted for 49.1% of electricity generation in South Korea in
1990; the average capacity factor of its nine units exceeded 70%. Nuclear
is projected to produce 54.6% of electricity in 2006, with coal producing
29.8%.
   The projections are a sharp contrast to 1981 when oil was the dominant
generator, producing 79.8% of the country's electricity. Projections for
2006 show a drastic drop in oil, with that fuel's power production at only
2.6%. In 1981 nuclear was the No. 2 producer in South Korea with a 7.2%
share. Coal--which was at the bottom, trailing behind hydro's
6.7%--accounted for only 6.3% of the total power generation.
   But in order for new units to be constructed in a timely manner, Choi
said, such hurdles as investment financing, securing sites for construction
and transmission equipment, and public opinion must be overcome. He pointed
to a 1991 poll that showed that only 67.6% of the people surveyed supported
construction of nuclear power plants. A 1986 poll put support at 72.4%.
   ''If Korea is to develop nuclear power continuously, and to achieve
self-reliance in energy, the misconceptions among the public on the safety
of nuclear power must be cleared up and their understanding and support
secured,'' he said. The public outreach campaign underway in South Korea
involves the publication of booklets and pamphlets, conducting site tours,
and making nuclear-related information available to the public, he said.

ITALIAN REGULATOR GIVEN AUTONOMY AS ENERGY AGENCY CHANGES FOCUS

By:
Marion Bywater, Rome

   Italian nuclear regulatory agency DISP is to be rendered more
''legitimate'' and financially autonomous under new legislation passed by
Parliament, although it will continue to be a part of state energy research
agency ENEA.
   The new law also officially transforms ENEA from a predominantly
nuclear-oriented entity to one focusing on the environment and alternate
energy sources and carrying out only limited nuclear research in the areas
of plant safety and radiation protection. ENEA's full name--but not its
acronym--will change to ''Ente per le Nuove Tecnologie, l'Energia e
l'Ambiente'' (Agency for New Technologies, Energy & Environment).
   Officials at DISP (Direzione Centrale per la Sicorezza Nucleare e la
Protezione Sanitaria) say the new legislation contains no great practical
innovations but it ''institutionalizes our autonomy. We are very pleased
about the change because it makes things clearer. It truly gives us a
completely independent identity.''
   The changes have been under discussion by Italian legislators since
Italy voted its nuclear moratorium in 1987. Initially it looked as if ENEA
might be abolished and DISP spun off as a stand-alone agency, but
legislators ultimately decided to leave the regulatory agency as a
directorate within ENEA, apparently because they felt establishing a
separate regulatory board could have sent the wrong signals in
nuclear-sensitive Italy.
   The wording of the law, however, ''underscores our legitimacy,'' DISP
officials said. It provides a statutory guarantee that DISP should have
''independence in carrying out its specific functions and full management
and organizational autonomy.''
   Instead of having its budget allocated by ENEA, DISP has been given an
annual allocation of 45-billion lire (U.S.$40-million) within the
1.7-trillion lire ($1.3-billion) budget authorization for ENEA for the
period 1991-1993.
   DISP officials said that they expect to have enough funds within this
budget not only to run the 290-person agency on a day-to-day basis, but to
have ''not much, but a not negligible'' margin left over for regulatory
research.

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS LOOM ON IRAQI CENTRIFUGE EFFORT

By:
Mark Hibbs, Bonn

   A fifth IAEA inspection team will head for Iraq this month in search of
answers to key unresolved questions about that country's clandestine effort
to build and operate gas centrifuges. In October, a larger IAEA mission
will go to Iraq to follow up.
   At present, there is no consensus at the IAEA about the extent to which
Iraq relied on foreign assistance to build centrifuge components and
assemble them at a facility known as El Pharat, located south of Baghdad.
Official sources said that Iraq still refuses to disclose foreign sources
for centrifuge design information and components. ''They are not
cooperating and they still claim they can make and operate centrifuges all
by themselves,'' one official said (NW, 22 Aug., 7).
   According to the IAEA inspection report on the fourth mission to Iraq,
which was completed last week but has not been made public, before
inspectors arrived at El Pharat, the labels had been scraped off imported
equipment meant to be used for manufacturing centrifuge components, in an
attempt to disguise their origin.
   Iraqi experts previously told the IAEA that Iraq had designed its
clandestine nuclear program by building redundant facilities in order to
prevent interruption should any one secret location be discovered or
destroyed. Thus, Iraq constructed two identical calutron enrichment
facilities at Tarmiyah and Al Sharqat, although inspectors are not sure
whether Al Sharqat, which was less complete when the Gulf War began, was
meant as a backup for Tarmiyah or as a simultaneous operation.
   During the fourth inspection, however, the IAEA was not shown a twin for
the centrifuge production facility at El Pharat.
   The latest IAEA report states that, in the view of inspectors, Iraq,
which claimed it could manufacture 200 centrifuges per year at El Pharat as
of 1993, might have been able to manufacture as many as 600 centrifuges per
year later in the 1990s.
   But that is viewed with skepticism by some western centrifuge experts.
These sources say that the IAEA estimate extrapolates future centrifuge
output in large part from the spatial dimensions of the workshops at El
Pharat. These experts asserted that IAEA inspectors have seen no evidence
yet that Iraq can mass-produce key components such as spiral-grooved bottom
bearings and magnetic suspension top bearings, no evidence that Iraq has
access to sufficient quantities of centrifuge-grade maraging steel, and no
evidence that Iraq has cascade engineering expertise.
   For these reasons, these experts assert, Iraq would need substantial
help from a foreign source to meet its goal of building and operating a
500-centrifuge cascade by 1996. A cascade that large might have been
capable of producing about 5 kilograms of high-enriched uranium (HEU) per
year--about one-fifth the amount needed for an initial nuclear explosive
device (NuclearFuel, 19 Aug., 12).

Two Rotor Assemblies Operated

   The IAEA report on the fourth inspection confirmed that no indigenously
manufactured rotors shown to inspectors were of sufficient quality for
uranium enrichment.
   During the inspection, IAEA officials learned that Iraq had obtained 10
carbon fiber centrifuge rotors, and test-operated two complete carbon fiber
rotor assemblies using uranium hexafluoride feed material. However, these
rotor tubes were supplied to Iraq by an outside source.
   With the exception of some simple rotor tubes made of aluminum, all
rotor tubes manufactured in Iraq were made of maraging steel. To produce
these, IAEA inspectors found, Iraq had obtained 25 plates of 350-grade
maraging steel from a foreign source. Iraq claimed that 19 sheets were made
into preforms at the Al Nassr State Enterprise for Mechanical Industries at
Taji, near Baghdad. Iraq also told inspectors that six more maraging steel
preforms for centrifuge rotors had been obtained from a foreign source.
   According to IAEA documents, only nine sufficiently balanced maraging
steel rotors had been made using the 25 pieces of maraging steel. None were
of sufficient quality for enriching uranium.
   Some Iraqi officials told IAEA inspectors they were confident that Iraq
could have evaded export controls on 350-grade maraging steel and could
have imported sufficient quantities for building many centrifuges. However,
IAEA inspectors found no other quantities of maraging steel in Iraq.
   An interim IAEA report compiled during the fourth inspection stated that
Iraqi officials ''claim to have had severe difficulties in obtaining
maraging steel yet they proceed with a plan that would require a dependable
supply.''
   The interim report stated that Iraqi officials led IAEA officials to
believe that Iraq planned to indigenously produce maraging steel. However,
Iraqi suggestions that domestic production of this specialty steel was
possible were not supported by officials at the Al Badr General
Establishment, located south of Baghdad at Mahmoudiya, which Iraq declared
to be a centrifuge production facility. Engineers at Al Badr ''complained
bitterly about the poor quality'' of carbon steel which Iraq had already
produced.

Cascade Engineering Primitive?

   The three large-scale centrifuge enrichment facilities in Europe which
are owned and operated by the Urenco consortium were built only after
centrifuge designs had been proven in extensive test programs and machines
assembled and operated in small pilot cascades.
   One western centrifuge expert told Nucleonics Week he was ''astonished''
that Iraq had planned to build two large cascades based on a centrifuge
design very similar to Urenco's G-1 centrifuge--a 100-machine cascade by
1993 and a 500-machine cascade by 1996--without having first built and
successfully operated a pilot cascade with only a few machines.
   Advanced countries ''wouldn't have done it that way,'' he said. In
Brazil's clandestine centrifuge program, experts built and operated a
cascade with eight machines in the late 1980s before manufacturing several
hundred centrifuges for a larger cascade.
   Iraq had considered building a cascade with 36 centrifuges after it
tested single rotors, but then abandoned that plan and proceeded instead to
concentrate on a cascade design with 102 centrifuges, western sources said.
Cascade designs shown to inspectors by the Iraqis for both the 36-machine
and the 102-machine configurations were based on a separation factor of
1.15-1.18 and a ''cut'' of 0.5. The separation factor quantifies the degree
of separation which can be obtained in a single centrifuge. The ''cut''
describes the ratio of product flow to feed flow in a centrifuge stage.
   However, one western expert said, Iraq's cascade designs were based on
only ''back of the envelope calculations'' for production of enriched
uranium. Iraqi experts showed inspectors calculations for production of 3%
U-235 only, using simple, ideal cascades, which provided no evidence of
extensive cascade engineering know-how.
   Iraqi officials denied that they had tried to design a cascade for
production of highly-enriched uranium (HEU). But that assertion is viewed
with skepticism by western experts.
   Iraqi officials' confidence in their ability to proceed from single
centrifuges to large cascades might have been illusory, and prompted by
competition between task teams involved in Iraq's clandestine nuclear
effort, sources said.
   Alternately, Iraqi confidence might also indicate that the centrifuge
program was guided by an outside expert,yet unknown to the IAEA or western
intelligence agencies, who had great familiarity with centrifuge design and
manufacture. The chief inspector during the fourth IAEA mission, David Kay,
reported from the field last month that such a guiding hand ''must have
been there.'' In evidence of this, inspectors found that Iraq had modified
its centrifuge design, which closely resembled the Urenco G-1 centrifuge
built in Germany, to include the spiral-grooved bottom bearing from G-2, an
improved Urenco centrifuge.
   During the fourth inspection, the most senior Iraqi official providing
information to the IAEA was Jaffar Dhiah, a vice director of the Iraqi
Atomic Energy Commission. While Kay stated last month that he believed
Jaffar Dhiah was not the guiding light behind Iraq's secret program, the
official inspection report completed by the IAEA last week asserted that
Jaffar had been in charge of the program.
   At the outset of bench testing of a G-1 rotor assembly, the ''cut'' of
the centrifuge might be as low as 0.1, requiring optimization of scoops
which are fitted inside the rotor tube. At a warehouse complex called Ash
Shakyh, inspectors found a press for inserting baffles and scoops into the
rotor cylinder. But sources said that, even if Iraqi experts had managed to
optimize the ''cut'' of the G-1 centrifuge to 0.5 (which at Urenco might
have taken only several weeks of careful and intensive testing), Iraq would
still have had to build 50 or more stages containing several thousand
optimized G-1 centrifuges in a cascade to make significant quantities of
HEU.
   But Iraq had apparently not optimized the single rotors it had
flow-formed itself. Using the first of two test stands found in Iraq by
inspectors, Iraq was able to spin a simple, so-called Beams-type or ''model
I'' centrifuge rotor at a velocity of 50,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).
However, when the ''model I'' rotor assembly was used for test separation
of product using light gases (not heavy uranium hexaflouride), speeds of
only 20,000 to 25,000 rpm were achieved.
   The ''model II'' centrifuge rotors which Iraq tested on a second test
stand, and which officials described as very close to G-1, could spin at an
optimal speed of 60,000 rpm without feed material. However,
mass-spectrometric examinations indicated that these rotors had apparently
not been tested with uranium hexaflouride feed.
   After inspectors arrive in Iraq on the fifth mission, they will pursue
Iraq's claim that it had manufactured magnetic suspension top bearings. A
German firm, Inwako GmbH, exported some British-made components for
samarium-cobalt top bearings to Iraq last year, criminal justice officials
said. On the last day of the fourth inspection, Iraq claimed it had
manufactured 50 top bearings, but when the inspectors left for Vienna they
had seen only a single top bearing, and no manufacturing equipment for
making the bearings.

Al Qaqaa for Missile Testing?

   Western intelligence reports in 1990 stated that the Al Qaqaa State
Establishment, located about 30 miles south of Baghdad, was ''concerned
with the development of the nonnuclear components of a nuclear weapon''
(NuclearFuel, 21 Jan., 3). But, according to the IAEA, Iraq has given a
''plausible alternative explanation'' for secret work going on at Al
Qaqaa.
   At Al Qaqaa, Iraqi experts had been working on bridge wires--a crucial
electronic component which can be used for precise detonation of high
explosives in a nuclear implosion device. According to Iraqi officials,
however, the bridge wires were being developed at Al Qaqaa for so-called
fire-set components to separate missile stages within time tolerances of
0.5 microseconds. Iraqi officials also stated that experts had been working
on development of so-called RDX explosives and metal cast explosives, and
had imported hundreds of tons of the explosive known as HMX. These
explosives can be used in a nuclear weapon.
   For any nuclear weapon, Iraq would probably need a steady supply of
polonium-210, which is used with a small amount of beryllium as a neutron
initiator (NW, 25 July, 12). Sources said that evidence of production of
Po-210, which has a half-life of only 138 days, would serve as ''indirect
confirmation'' that Iraq was working on nuclear explosives. IAEA inspectors
found no indication of Po-210 production or handling at the Tuwaitha
Nuclear Research Center, Al Qaqaa, or two facilities for materials research
and high explosives testing, Al Atheer and Al Musayyaib. However, Jaffar
told IAEA officials during the fourth inspection that Iraq had made ''small
quantities'' of Po-210 for ''steady-state ion sources.''

USSR OFFERS UP RBMKS TO SCRUTINY OF WORLD SAFETY EXPERTS, VIA IAEA

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Vienna

   The Soviet Union has proposed that the international community conduct a
safety review of its RBMK graphite-moderated channel-type reactors in a new
program managed by the IAEA. The offer, made at an international safety
conference in Vienna last week, marks the first time the Soviets have been
willing to subject design and operation of the Chernobyl-type units to
international scrutiny.
   The USSR's existing 16 RBMK units provide about half of the country's
nuclear-generated electricity. But their safety systems and basic design,
even after post-Chernobyl backfitting, are considered by some in the West
as insufficient to justify long-term operation.
   The Soviet offer was endorsed by the experts who were meeting in Vienna
to set a nuclear safety strategy for the next decade (see related story,
this issue), and it seemed sure to be accepted by the IAEA Board of
Governors at the end of this week and the agency's general conference,
which convenes Monday, September 16. It would be modeled on the IAEA's
''Study of the Safety of Older Reactors,'' a safety review of
first-generation Soviet-design VVER (PWR) units in central and eastern
Europe, which is due to wind up this fall.
   Lars Hoegberg, director of the Swedish Nuclear Inspectorate (SKI),
estimated that an RBMK safety study of the same scope as the VVER study
would require tens of engineering man-hours and up to $200,000 per unit
examined.
   The Russians evidently believe their channel reactors will pass muster
after completion of a five-year program of safety improvements and upgrades
following the 1986 accident at Chernobyl. They hope that an international
stamp of approval will allow them to finish RBMK units whose construction
was frozen in the wake of the Chernobyl accident.
   Separately, a senior Soviet official said regulators expect to rule by
October on whether first-generation RBMK units can resume operation at full
power. The Committee for State Supervision of Safety in Industry & Nuclear
Power (CSSSINP) imposed a ceiling of 70% power operation in June 1990
because of concerns about the consequences of a fuel-damage accident at the
older plants if they operated at full power (NW, 12 July '90, 1). But
committee deputy chairman Anatoly Belyaev told Nucleonics Week last week
that the Ministry of Atomic Power & Industry (MAPI), which operates Soviet
nuclear reactors, is about to submit to the regulators a technical study
aimed at proving that the consequences of a severe core-damage accident
would not be higher at 100% than at 70% power.
   Belyaev said the ministry had stressed, in debating the RBMK matter with
the safety committee, that operating at reduced power means lower revenues
for the power plants and thus ''eventually reduces the capability to
improve safety at those plants.'' MAPI had officially committed to invest
all additional income from full-power operation in improving safety at the
units, Belyaev said. ''We understand their arguments and are trying to
listen to them,'' he said. He cited ''very important changes'' made
recently to the first large RBMK at Leningrad, including rebuilding of
pressure tubes, which had kept Leningrad-1 off line for nearly two years,
and said similar backfits were planned at other RBMKs.
   ''The energy supply situation is still very difficult'' in the USSR,
Belyaev said. ''We would like to make a final decision (on the RMBK
full-power operation) no later than October if there's enough evidence.''
   The Soviet proposal for an RBMK safety review program was aired by
Andrei Gagarinski, deputy director of the Kurchatov Atomic Energy
Institute, on behalf of MAPI. The program would encompass work that is just
about to begin between safety experts in the USSR and four western European
countries.
   MAPI first deputy director Viktor Sidorenko wrote August 22 to nuclear
regulatory bodies and safety experts in Germany, Sweden, the U.K., and
Finland to invite them to begin in-depth examination of RBMK safety in a
multilateral effort that would encompass incipient bilateral work. The
experts from those four countries, plus possibly Italy, are scheduled to
meet in Moscow next week to discuss how to proceed.
   Up to now, the western world's influence in the RBMK program has been
limited to certain technical points, such as Gesellschaft fuer
Reaktorsicherheit's (GRS) proposal to try to apply its thermohydraulics
codes to RBMK accidents. The Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate (SKI)
recently signed an agreement with CSSSINP to study the safety of BWRs,
while the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority has been discussing points of common
interest concerning graphite-moderated reactors.

International Financing Assumed

   It is assumed that any changes deemed necessary in the RBMKs after
international scrutiny--like those now being worked out under a European
Community program for the old Kozloduy VVERs in Bulgaria--would have to be
funded through borrowing from international institutions like the World
Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development.
   Last year, the International Advisory Committee (IAC) of senior nuclear
experts underlined the large contribution of the Soviet-design reactors to
total world nuclear power risk and recommended that, if national
governments cannot fund them completely, then safety-necessary backfits
should be supported by the west's nuclear industry and governments most
interested in preserving the nuclear option (NW, 20 Sept. '90, 2).
More recently, at the Andrei Sakharov Memorial Conference held in Moscow in
late May, an international expert panel recommended ''urgently'' that
further operation of the RBMK units ''be recognized as a temporary
emergency measure.''
   Both the IAC and the Sakharov panel estimated that the risk of a severe
accident with major off-site consequences from the Soviet-design reactors
was as high as 50% over five years.
   Meanwhile, Lithuanian independence poses special questions around the
Ignalina RBMK station in that Baltic nation. The Ignalina units--two
operating and one in suspended construction--are the only RBMKs outside the
Russian Federation, but they are also the biggest ones, at unit electric
power of 1,500 megawatts for a core the same size as the 1,000-MW Chernobyl
units. They produce a substantial share of Lithuania's electricity and
could help generate export revenues for the republic. Following the
recognition of Lithuania by the Nordic states, close cooperation on RBMK
safety and nuclear safety supervision is expected to be put in place by
Sweden and Finland.

CZECHS WERE FORCED TO TAKE UNITS THEY KNEW WERE BELOW-STANDARD

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Vienna

   Czechoslovakia's senior nuclear regulator said last week his country
knew from the beginning that the reactors it imported from the USSR in the
1970s did not meet prevailing nuclear safety requirements, but could do
nothing about it. He painted a stark picture of the situation of former
USSR satellites, forced by politics to accept nuclear power plants they
realized were below standards in force at the time in the West.
   Zdenek Kriz, chief inspector of the Czechoslovak Atomic Energy
Commission, told a meeting of international nuclear safety experts at the
IAEA in Vienna that the decision to buy two VVER-440 units at Bohunice from
the Soviet Union ''was a purely political decision made by our government.
Safety was not a criterion. There was no tender, no discussion about
safety'' before the sale, he said. The decision involved ''acceptance of
the philosophy of the Soviet vendor, which at that time differed
significantly from U.S. (safety) criteria,'' Kriz said. For example, the
Soviet's defense-in-depth concept stressed accident prevention, and
''suppressed other parts (of the philosophy) partially or totally.'' The
Soviet approach violated the spirit of IAEA nuclear safety standards as
well, he said.
   Later, he said other central and eastern countries had been in the same
situation, and his remarks were meant to speak for all of them.
   Karel Wagner, chairman of the Czech Atomic Energy Commission, later told
Nucleonics Week that the eastern Europeans ''did a lot of things that were
not up to western standards'' in the years they spent as satellites of the
USSR.
   ''The role of safety regulation was fully underestimated in our country
and others,'' Kriz said.
   Czechoslovakia passed a law on state supervision of nuclear power in
1984. ''But the two units (Bohunice-1 and -2, the early-design VVER-440s)
were commissioned in 1978 and 1980. The law came too late,'' Kriz said.
   ''From the beginning we were aware of the situation. Both operators and
the regulatory body made many efforts to enhance safety and improve the
situation'' at Bohunice, Kriz recounted. The ''most important obstacle,''
he said, was that, since all significant changes had to be approved by the
vendor, ''people said the vendor country was responsible for safety.''
   A series of backfits was proposed to the Czech government in 1986. ''But
we were aware the problem was not solved,'' Kriz said.
   During the past year, Kriz said, the Czech Nuclear Inspectorate
conducted ''a very extensive'' 10th-year safety assessment of the Bohunice
units, advised by a government commission, and ruled that they should be
upgraded over two years. The program, Kriz said, costs about one-quarter
the units' original price and is the prerequisite for their operation to
1995. At that time, the operator either will propose further measures to
bring the units up to acceptable safety levels or will have to shut them.
   Wagner said that 60 of the proposed improvements are already made, and,
of the 81 still to be realized, 17 should be finished by the end of this
year and the others in 1992. Thereafter, the units will undergo yearly
regulatory review to 1995, with yearly extensions of their operating
licenses if they pass muster.
   After 1995, Wagner said, the two units must shut down unless their owner
agrees to backfit a ''proven substitute for containment'' that includes a
special primary circuit pressure suppression system and a large inventory
of primary coolant. Wagner reckons that the ''only way'' to do this is to
add ''some type of barbotage'' system similar to the bubbler-tower
condenser systems that were added to the design for second-generation
VVER-440s such as Bohunice-3 and -4.
   The initial Bohunice units represent ''a young station,'' Wagner said,
''with only 10 and 12 years of operation, or less than half their expected
design life. They could operate another 10 years'' if they are
appropriately backfit, he observed.
   Kriz told the Vienna meeting that ''although we are aware that the
safety level (of Bohunice) is lower than that at other PWRs, we, the
regulatory body, took our responsibility and defined measures that must be
fulfilled by the operator'' at Bohunice.
   ''I assure you,'' he told the IAEA delegates, ''that we are fully aware
that responsibility (for the Bohunice units' safety) is in our hands. We
must achieve a level of safety acceptable for all in the world.''

EDF AND SIEMENS TO BID TOGETHER ON KOZLODUY DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Electricite de France (EDF) and Siemens have formed a joint venture to
bid on design studies of improving the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in
Bulgaria in the framework of the European Commission/World Association of
Nuclear Operators (EC/WANO) program of aid to the Bulgarian nuclear
operators.
   The joint venture agreement, which links Siemens and EDF's subsidiary
EDF International, was signed at the end of July. An EDF official said that
the consortium agreement runs only for the length of the EC short-term
program for Kozloduy; that is, to the end of this year. Nevertheless, the
EC/WANO program could be extended into 1992, and in that case the
EDF-Siemens venture could also be lengthened.
   Any initiative past the Kozloduy work, however, would imply creation of
a new consortium or conclusion of an annex to the present consortium
contract, the EDF official said.
   The two companies will reply to a bid solicitation from the Bulgarian
Energy Committee, which is managing the Kozloduy improvement program from
Sofia's side. The first of four first-generation Soviet-design PWRs at the
site in northwestern Bulgaria was shut September 4 for near-term upgrades
and a second unit is scheduled to be shut shortly.
   The EDF official said that the initiative for the consortium came from
Siemens because of EDF's ''excellent contacts'' with the Bulgarian Energy
Committee. The French utility had agreed with the Bulgarians in early June,
before international attention was focused on Kozloduy after an IAEA audit
found serious safety deficiencies at the plant, on ''active twinning''
between Kozloduy and EDF's Bugey nuclear power plant, and EDF staff were at
Kozloduy by the end of August.
   On the other hand, said the EDF official, the French ''lacked
knowledge'' of the VVER-440 reactor design, which could be supplied by
Siemens because of its work on VVER-440s at Greifswald in the former German
Democratic Republic.
   The EDF-Siemens accord has raised some eyebrows in France, where reactor
vendor Framatome and EDF, as two monopolies, are condemned to get along
with each other. But Framatome could not counter EDF's argument of Siemens'
greater experience with the VVER reactor type. Moreover, it is no secret
that the Germans have far closer industrial contacts in central and eastern
Europe. If Siemens sees EDF as key to closer contact with the Bulgarian
energy production establishment--and perhaps counterparts in other eastern
European countries--the German company may be one card for EDF to play in
its drive to take positions in foreign markets. If the ''trial balloon'' of
the Kozloduy partnership works well, the EDF official said, the experiment
could well be extended into other markets behind the former Iron Curtain.

DIABLO CANYON-2 BREAKS RECORD FOR LWR CONTINUOUS OPERATION

   On August 30, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diablo Canyon-2 broke by one
day the LWR continuous operation record set in July by GPU Nuclear's Three
Mile Island-1. However, Wolf Creek may break the new record this week.
   Diablo Canyon-2 shut down after 481 days of operation, 10 days short of
its planned September 9 refueling outage, because of a leak in the reactor
coolant system. TMI-1 had broken the 477-day record, set by Omaha Public
Power District's Fort Calhoun in 1988, by three days but then scrammed
automatically because of a test procedure failure (NW, 1 Aug., 16).
   Wolf Creek, owned by Kansas Gas & Electric Co., Kansas City Power &
Light Co., and Kansas Electric Power Cooperative, reached 478 days of
continuous operation on September 10 and was still running. It is not
scheduled to shut for refueling until September 19, giving it the
opportunity to run 487 days. All are PWRs: Diablo Canyon-2 and Wolf Creek
from Westinghouse; TMI-1 from Babcock & Wilcox; Fort Calhoun, from
Combustion Engineering.
   Another kind of record is being claimed by Commonwealth Edison for its
Byron station: the longest continuous U.S. run for both units of a two-unit
station. The two Westinghouse units were both on line for just over 258
days, from December 21, 1990 to September 6.
   A review of recent operations of two-unit stations as reported to
Nucleonics Week found the longest run internationally was chalked up in
1990, when both Asea-Atom BWRs at Sweden's Barsebaeck station ran together
for 335 days. However, since statistics have not always been kept on
two-unit station runs, there may be longer runs not reported.

NOTES PERTAINING TO THE GENERATING TABLE FOR JULY 1991

   Cattenom-4 is being added to the table this month. The 1,362-MW PWR,
operated by Electricite de France, achieved criticality May 4 and generated
its first electricity May 27. It is in precommercial testing and is
scheduled for commissioning before the end of the year.
   This month, statistics from all countries but Britain are reported on
the basis of 744 hours. In Britain, units owned by Nuclear Electric and
Scottish Nuclear are both reported for 672 hours. For the year-to-date,
statistics are based on 5,087 hours of operation through July 31 in Europe
and the U.S., except Britain's Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, whose
figures are based on 5,039 hours. Figures from all other countries are
based on 5,088 hours.
   Belgium's Doel-3 was down for 287.18 hours for refueling.
   In Brazil, Angra-1 was down for 26.5 hours for repair of the heating
line of the steam generator 1A feed pump on the secondary side.
   Britain's Hunterston B-1 continued in shutdown the entire month for its
statutory biennial outage. Torness-1 was down 136 hours for its statutory
biennial outage and 27 hours for a turbine/reactor trip. Torness-2 was down
for 336 hours for refueling.
   In Canada, Pickering-3 restarted after being shut since 1989 for fuel
channel replacement. Pickering-5 was down for 675 hours for repair of a
generator hydrogen leak. Bruce-1 was forced down for 520.7 hours due to a
boiler (steam generator) tube leak. Darlington-2 continued in its forced
outage all month to repair cracked end plates.
   In France, Electricite de France's nuclear plants generated 22.4-billion
kilowatt-hours (KWH), or about 71% of total French electricity produced in
July. EDF's 900-MW PWR series averaged 71.6% energy availability
(capability factor) during the month and 74.2% over the 12 months ended
July 31. During the month, the 900-MW-class units averaged unavailability
of 18.5% for scheduled refueling and maintenance and 9.9% for unscheduled
downtime, of which 4.4% was forced outages caused by equipment problems.
   The utility's 1,300-MW PWR series had average energy availability of
57.6% in July and 72.2% over the 12 preceding months. Their unavailability
during the month was due 14.6% to scheduled outages and 27.8% to
unscheduled outages, with 11% of the latter classified as forced outage.
   EDF classified 13 incidents on the French nuclear event scale during the
month, two of them at Level 2 and the others at Level 1:
   --Belleville-2, which had a Level 2 event in May, had another, unrelated
one July 10, when 10 cubic meters of non-borated water were injected by
mistake into the reactor coolant system (RCS) because of an error in
estimating the level of water in a feed tank that had been used for a test.
Although the average boron concentration of the RCS remained above
specified limits at all times, the incident was classified at Level 2
because of its potential safety consequences.
   --The problem of peeling paint on the inside walls of containment sumps,
discovered the previous month, was reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2
because a check showed it had affected a significant number of units in the
1,300-MW PWR series. However, by mid-August EDF had remedied the peeling
problem.
   --At St. Alban-2 on July 1, a fuel handling incident put a fuel assembly
off balance, causing its head to strike the head of another assembly. The
two assemblies were removed to the fuel building for inspection.
   --At Tricastin-2 on July 1, deterioration of a main coolant pump seal
caused the pump to trip and the reactor to scram. About 300 cubic meters of
primary coolant leaked onto the reactor building floor.
   --At Tricastin-3 on July 4, reactor protection signals from one of the
four ionization chambers were discovered to be unavailable because of
incorrect wiring in the associated data processing system. The anomaly was
not revealed during the usual periodic testing of the measuring device but
during maintenance on the electric cabinet where the signals are produced.
   --The volume of primary coolant at Gravelines-5 on July 5 was found to
be about 10 cubic meters lower than required. This happened because the
reactor vessel vent valve, which allows expulsion of air during RCS
filling, had remained closed, leading to formation of an air cushion under
the vessel head and an erroneous measurement of primary coolant level.
   --The boron concentration in a tank of the auxiliary boron circuit at
Chinon-B1 fell below the required level July 7, and operators took nine
hours longer to rectify it than is required by technical specifications.
The incident was traced to a failure of level alarms to switch on while
another tank was being filled.
   --At Tricastin-3 on July 12, a fuel handling incident caused slight
deformation of a fuel assembly. The fuel element was being lowered slowly
towards the upending device of the fuel storage pool when by mistake the
operation was switched to high speed. Although the operator stopped the
maneuver immediately, the leg of the fuel element ended up pressing against
the upending device and the element was slanted about 10 degrees off
vertical.
   --Paluel-1 was off line with fuel discharged on July 17 when, during
planned maintenance on a switch, a second switch was opened by mistake,
interrupting the off-site power source. The second diesel generator
switched in immediately.
   --An electric distribution panel on one power supply train was rendered
unavailable at Gravelines-5 July 19 because of a mixup in preparing
maintenance on the other train. This caused startup of an emergency diesel.
At the same time, spent fuel pool cooling was interrupted for about two
hours, leading to a rise in pool temperature of about 4 degrees C, although
it remained within prescribed limits. The maintenance file was revised to
avoid recurrence of such an incident.
   --An alarm indicating too-low boron concentration (below 2,000 ppm) in
the Dampierre-2 RCS on July 24 was not taken into account until six hours
after it appeared. However, the concentration remained above the level of
1,950 ppm covered by safety studies.
   --One of the two pumps of the residual heat removal system at
Flamanville-1 had to be stopped for 90 minutes on July 25 due to the
passage of an air pocket through the pump. The pocket had been entrained
from a pipe into the pump when a valve was opened.
   --Operators took 50 minutes too long to stop Nogent-2 on July 29
following a leak of primary coolant that exceeded the regulatory operating
limit of 230 liters per hour. The plant had been kept operating for three
hours after the leak was detected at the request of the power dispatcher.
Nogent operators expected to need only one hour to stop the reactor
(technical specifications require a reactor to be stopped four hours after
detection of a primary coolant leak), but it actually took one hour and 50
minutes.
   Pre-commercial testing resumed at Cattenom-4 on July 22; the unit had
been down since June 12 for work on a reactor scram control train and
repair of a defective nozzle on the low-pressure safety injection system.
Bugey-2 restarted July 26; it had been down since April 6 for refueling and
maintenance, but it was taken down again July 27 and 28 for work on a
6.6-kilovolt electric cable. Bugey-3 restarted July 1 following completion
of work on high-pressure turbine steam pipe supports. The unit was stopped
again July 19 at the end of its regular duty cycle in anticipation of the
programmed refueling outage.
   Cattenom-3 restarted July 10; it had been down since June 27 for repairs
to a low-pressure safety injection system nozzle. The unit was down again
July 28-30 for work on a main coolant pump.
   Chinon-B3 was down July 27-28 for work in the reactor building. Cruas-1
came back on line July 4 following completion of its fifth-year inspection
and refueling outage, which began March 30. It was down again July 4-15 for
work on generator exciter control cabinets. Cruas-2 was down July 25-26 for
work on the generator hydrogen system. Nogent-1 was taken down July 27 for
work on thecooling modules of the atmospheric cooling tower. Nogent-2 was
taken down July 29 for work on a valve part of an RCS auxiliary system.
Paluel-3 remained down (since June 29) for work on the sumps of the reactor
building and nozzles on the safety injection and containment spray systems.
Penly-1 was down July 20-21 for work on the nuclear island fire protection
system. St. Alban-1 was down July 5-15 for repairs to a defective nozzle on
the containment spray system. Tricastin-2 was down July 1-25 for work on
main coolant pump seals.
   The Creys-Malville breeder reactor remained down for various work
associated with purification of primary sodium and review of operating and
management measures by French safety authorities. The prototype breeder
Phenix, owned by the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, also remained off
line following the reactivity drop incident of fall 1990.
   Gravelines-2 remained down (since May 11) for its 10th-year inspection
and refueling outage. Gravelines-5 remained down (since June 29) for its
fifth-year inspection and refueling, as did Chinon-B2 (since May 18). St.
Laurent-B1, down since January 19 for refueling and maintenance, restarted
July 1. The St. Laurent-A2 gas-cooled reactor was taken down July 31 for
its annual inspection.
   Bugey-1, a gas-cooled reactor, remained off line since June 24 because
of low electricity demand. Dampierre-2 was taken down July 15 after
completion of its duty cycle in anticipation of scheduled refueling.
Flamanville-1 was taken down July 4 at the end of its duty cycle and began
scheduled refueling/maintenance on July 29.
   Units off line all or part of the month for regular refueling and
maintenance included Belleville-2, Blayais-3, Cattenom-1, Dampierre-1,
Dampierre-3, Fessenheim-2, Paluel-1, Paluel-2, Tricastin-3, and St.
Alban-2.
   Hungary's Paks-1 returned July 16 from routine refueling and
maintenance, and Paks-3 was shut for its annual refueling/maintenance the
same day.
   In Japan, down for refueling and maintenance all or part of the month
were: Fukushima I-1 and II-4, Hamaoka-3, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa-5, Mihama-2,
Ohi-2, Shimane-2, Takahama-2 and -4, Tokai-2, Tomari-1, and Tsuruga-1.
Sendai-1 was down for 48 hours due to a neutron flux disorder.
   South Africa's Koeberg-2 was down the entire month for refueling.
   South Korea's Wolsung-1 was off-line for 220 hours for routine
maintenance.
   Spain's Asco-1 was down for 407 hours for refueling. Trillo was down for
305 scheduled hours for accommodating chemical parameters and to repair a
leakage in a boron addition line.
   In Sweden, Forsmark-2 was down for 464 hours for refueling. Ringhals-3
was down 310 hours for refueling and maintenance.
   Switzerland's Beznau-2 was in a scheduled refueling outage for 472
hours. Goesgen-Daeniken, Leibstadt, and Muehleberg were down for 144.86,
163, and 245 hours, respectively, for scheduled refueling outages as well.
   In Taiwan, Kuosheng-1 was down for 73.75 forced hours due to an average
power range monitor A/B upscale trip. Maanshan-1 was down for 46.05 forced
hours due to a typhoon and bad water chemistry. Maanshan-2 was down 113.92
scheduled hours for the same typhoon.
   Yugoslavia's Krsko went into hot shutdown and reduced power-level
operation as a result of armed hostilities in its vicinity and threatening
fighter-jet overflights (NW, 25 July, 6).
   Baltimore Gas & Electric's Calvert Cliffs-1 was out for 417.9 scheduled
hours for maintenance and testing. The outage was extended for 241.9 forced
hours to correct vibration on a reactor coolant pump.
   Carolina Power & Light's Brunswick-1 was down for 182 forced hours due
to reactor scram because of a faulty instrument manifold valve.
   Commonwealth Edison's Quad Cities-2 was forced down 75.44 hours to
repair leaking condenser tube.

INDEX, NEDS ARE OPERATING.

A box on page 9 of the Special Report, ''Outlook on Security,'' included
with the June 27 issue of Nucleonics Week, incorrectly said neither the
Integrated Nuclear Data Exchange (INDEX) or the Nuclear Employee Data
System (NEDS) had ''received enough industry support to survive alone.''
Both are now active. INDEX is a consortium of 14 nuclear utilities that
share a computer data base listing some 20,000 reactor outage workers who
meet NRC standards for plant access as temporary workers. INDEX is headed
by Hollis Hutchison, nuclear personnel manager of Texas Utilities Co., and
has offices at 150 South Spring Lake Drive, Itasca IL 60143, (708)
825-3000. NEDS has been taken over and is being revived by GPU Nuclear
Corp. as a for-sale service, not a membership consortium. According to Chip
Fenton, GPU director of human resources and head of NEDS, NEDS has
''letters of intent'' to join from seven other utilities, chiefly in the
northeast. Fenton is reachable at GPU Nuclear Corp., One Upper Pond Road,
Parsippany NJ 07054, (201) 316-7044.

SEVERAL FUELS ISSUES REMAIN TIED-UP IN BUDGET DEBATE

      A number of issues important to the refining and marketing
industry remain unresolved as Congress and the White House negotiated
over the budget and the federal government remained closed last week. 
The U.S. EPA remains unfunded, operating with a minimal staff, and
officials at the Agency warned that they're unable to enforce
environmental statutes.
      The Clinton Administration and Congressional Republicans appear
to be far apart on a number of issues, including the taxable status of
kerosene for home heating and the depreciation schedule for
convenience stores operating in conjunction with gasoline stations.
      Due to lack of appropriations for EPA, funds have also run out
for the Federal Leaking Underground Storage Trust Fund (LUST) and the
Superfund Trust Fund.  Below is a review of programs and tax issues
affected by the Washington, D.C., stalemate, including federal motor
fuels taxes as of Jan. 1 that may still be changed under final federal
budget programs.

Clinton Seeks Tax On Kerosene For Home Use

      One provision of a White House budget proposal would impose a
tax on kerosene mixed with heating oil.  Under the current law,
kerosene is subject to the 24.4 c/gal diesel fuel tax when it is mixed
with dyed, on-road diesel fuel.  It is not subject to the tax when it
is distributed to be used in home heating oil, as it is often in the
Northeast to ensure that the fuel does not gel.
      The White House is pursuing the change because "some wholesale
distributors of diesel fuel have not been paying the tax on kerosene
that they blend with diesel fuel for highway use," according to a
White House memo.  "As a result, the government is losing tax revenues
and complying taxpayers are at a competitive disadvantage."
      The Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America (SIGMA)
concurs with the Administration on the kerosene tax.  "People are
using the kerosene for fuel, and that is a form of tax evasion -- and
we are always against tax evasion," said SIGMA counsel Tim Columbus.
      Another gasoline marketer association, Petroleum Marketers
Association of America (PMAA),  is "totally opposed to this," said
PMAA spokesman David Morehead.  "This is not something we want to
allow to slip through."  PMAA is encouraging its members to contact
their Congressmen on the issue. 
      House and Senate members from Northeast states have sent letters
to Senate Majority leader Bob Dole (R-KS), asking him to oppose
Clinton's proposal.  "This would be an extremely regressive tax that
would have its greatest impact on low-income consumers of home heating
oil, many of whom live in trailer parks and cannot afford any increase
in fuel costs," the House letter read.
      "[The Clinton Administration] is charging that this is a tax-
break for businesses. We think this is a good business deduction,"
Morehead said.  "[Clinton is] taking the issue almost personally." 
      Taxation of aviation jet fuel also hangs in the balance.  On
Oct. 1, 1995, the Treasury began to collect the 4.3 c/gal tax on jet
fuel that had been exempted from the 1993 increase in the federal
fuels excise tax.  Extension of that exemption was included in the
Congressional budget bill that was vetoed last month, but it remains
on the table as part of the budget negotiations.

Congress Wants New Depreciation For C-Stores; Clinton Opposes

      A provision in the budget bill passed by Congress and vetoed by
the president last month would give convenience store (c-store) owners
that do more than 50% of their business in motor fuels and related
services the same 15-year depreciation schedule that gasoline stations
have.  Currently, those c-stores must use a 39.5-year depreciation
schedule.
      SIGMA, PMAA and the National Association of Convenience Stores
(NACS) support quicker depreciation.  Acknowledging that the Clinton
Administration has opposed the new schedule, Lindsay Hutter, NACS
spokeswoman, argues, "It has not been an issue of great contention in
the budget debate.
      "We have had the commitment of the Republican leadership on this
issue," Hutter said.  "We continue to be very hopeful -- this is our
number one issue."  

Tax For LUST Fund Expires, Extension of Tax Unlikely

      The 0.1 c/gal gasoline tax used to finance the LUST fund expired
on Dec. 31, and it appears no major effort is underway to restore it. 
Approximately $800 million is now in the trust fund, but it is not
being properly disbursed for cleanups, according to PMAA's Morehead. 
"Money in the LUST fund is just sitting there --  it hasn't been spent
very vigorously," he said.
      As for the tax, "we say 'let it expire' because the money is not
being used for what it should be used for," said Morehead.  PMAA might
favor restoration of the tax if the money was distributed to the
states, he said.  
      "SIGMA and NACS may try to reposition the LUST, but we would
want the federal government to give the money to the states, provided
they would use it for cleanup costs," concurred Columbus.

Superfund Tax Expires;  Lack Of Appropriations Slows Cleanups

      The tax collected for the Superfund Trust fund also expired as
of Dec. 31.  The $9.7 c/bbl, or $0.0023 c/gal, tax is not currently
being collected, but it will almost certainly be re-imposed
retroactively, according to Capitol Hill sources.
      In the meantime, the Superfund program is undergoing a partial
shutdown due to the lack of an EPA appropriations bill.  The trust
fund currently has a surplus of $4 billion, but it is receiving no new
revenue, according to Paul Hirsch of the Chemical Manufacturers
Association (CMA).
      "Work is continuing at sites where construction has started,"
Hirsch said, noting that there are two types of sites: those where the
government is performing the cleanup and those where the liable
parties are cleaning the site.  Liable parties will continue their
clean-up efforts.
      While some EPA Superfund employees are furloughed, the majority
of clean-up is performed by outside contractors, many of which are
still being paid through the trust fund, Hirsch said.  "The government
isn't going to ask those contractors to pick up their shovels and
leave," he said.  At sites that present an immediate threat to human
health, removal work will definitely continue.
      EPA officials offer a less optimistic view, saying that the lack
of funding will likey shut down most of the Superfund program.  The
agency is in the process of furloughing approximately 2,400 agency
workers and 10,000 contractors in the program.  EPA officials did
confirm that cleanup will continue at approximately 100 emergency
sites.

      BP is shutting down shop at Marcus Hook, PA, after an
overwhelming 83% rejection last Thursday of new owner Tosco's proposed
labor contract by union workers; and now Tosco says the prospect of
restarting the cold 185,000 b/d plant may prove too chilly to
contemplate. 
      Since buying the Marcus Hook plant and a retail system from BP
last November for $75 million, plus the $160 million value of the
inventories, Tosco expects to assume a cold refinery Feb. 1, when it
takes possession of the plant.
      "Since the union voted to reject the Tosco proposal, we are
continuing plans to suspend operations at Marcus Hook beginning in
mid-January and transferring the suspended operations over to Tosco on
February 1," said BP spokesperson Marian Lowes, declining to comment
on the unit's current utilization. 
      "We failed to reach an agreement with the union," said Jefferson
Allen, Tosco spokesman.  "Although that does mean we can now hire new
employees, it doesn't mean that we will open the plant ever.  We
expected to acquire an operating refinery, but we must now reevaluate
the costs and benefits of running the plant."
      For now, Tosco expects to use its 215,000- b/d Bayway, NJ,
refinery to supply the retail system in the Northeast it will also
acquire from BP.  "We've reached no conclusions about what we're going
to do," Allen added. 
      The plant's union, which represents 320 of its 520 employees,
sharply criticized the Tosco proposal presented on Dec. 31, and denied
that the company made any attempt to bargain.  "It has taken labor
relations back 30-40 years," charged Bob Burdick, International OCAW
representative.  "The document was not negotiated, it was issued by
the company.  Tosco refused to negotiate." 
      Nevertheless, the plant's union agreed to hold a secret ballot
vote on the plan last Thursday, at Tosco's request.  Chief among the
union's complaints with the proposal is the inclusion of mandated
selective hiring, which would "totally negate seniority -- a very
important subject for unions," explained Burdick. Also, the plan would
remove 30 positions from the union's collective bargaining group, lay
off 65 hourly-wage union members,  and eliminate 654 salaried
management-type positions.  It would allow some supervisors and other
salaried employees to bid on union jobs.    
      After the union membership rejected the plan, with only 16.8%
voting in favor of it, the shop steward said the negotiations are now
in Tosco's hands.  "The membership is not willing to go to work under
these conditions," said Cathy Brady, Marcus Hook OCAW shop steward.
      Employees at two of Tosco's other three refineries are also
represented by OCAW, and Burdick contends Tosco's Marcus Hook proposal
compares unfavorably with the union-Tosco contracts at Avon, WA, and
Ferndale, CA.  "This contract is much different and much more
stringent," he said.  "The management-rights clause in the Marcus Hook
proposal gives Tosco almost unlimited power, which is not normal for
such a clause.  Normally, the company is subject to the conditions of
the union contract."

PIPELINES WARY ABOUT MMT BLENDS

      Though Ethyl Corp. has received regulatory approval to market
MMT in the U.S., pipeline operators have yet to embrace the
introduction of yet another fuel additive into an already-stressed
transportation system.  No pipeline has yet changed its gasoline
specification to accomodate MMT blends, though none have indicated
opposition to the additive, either.
      Colonial Pipeline, the key mover of gasoline from the Gulf Coast
to the East, has requested input from its shippers as to whether it
should develop a set of specifications for MMT-blended gasoline. 
"Some shippers have indicated to us that they are not interested in
MMT," said William Copenhaver of Colonial.  "We're just trying to be
cautious." 
      Colonial is not suggesting that it has found technical problems
in shipping MMT-blended gasoline, said Copenhaver, only that it's
trying to understand the needs of its market.  The pipeline system
would allow a segregated shipment of MMT-blended gasoline now, but
Copenhaver said he is unaware of any customer requests.
      MMT, which can be blended only into conventional gasoline, will
be added at the refinery gate, according to Ethyl.  This creates a
"Catch 22" situation: Getting the support of common-carrier pipelines
is essential to broad market acceptance of MMT, but those pipelines
may withhold their support until the market demands the product.  In
response, Ethyl has contacted pipelines and supports the polling of
customers about their MMT plans and concerns, said Ethyl's Technical
Manger, Fuels, Don Hollrah.
      Allowing MMT blends into the fungible system would require
Colonial to add another entire set of gasoline grades, which it is
loath to do on top of the series of gasoline and diesel grades created
in response to new environmental regulations since 1993.
      Responses are due from shippers by Jan. 12, and Colonial will
announce its intentions "soon after," said Copenhaver.  This decision
will set the tone for other pipelines, add industry sources.

ENERGY BIOSYSTEMS PATENTS DESULFURIZATION BREAKTHROUGHS 

      A breakthrough in Energy BioSystems Corp.'s development of
biocatalytic desulfurization is bringing a six-to-eight-fold increase
in specific critical intermediate reactions, the company reported,
predicting it will be ready for commercial demonstration in early
1996.  The Houston-based company also received two new process design
patents for its proprietary biocatalytic desulfurization systems (BDS)
that use bacteria to remove sulfur from petroleum. 
      While Energy BioSystems scientists were experienced with the
interplay of three factors in the intermediate reactions,  the recent
enhancements in the process reflect the company's greater mastery over
a fourth factor discovered in September.   Company scientists are now
working to determine what effect the more prolific reactions will have
on the overall sulfur yield. 
      More development is required on a final reaction to produce the
prototype biocatalyst necessary for pilot plant demonstrations planned
for middle distillate streams at one of Total Petroleum's refineries,
the company said.  BDS will be later be applied to crude, naphtha and
other gasoline components. 
      As for Energy BioSystems' newest patents, the first (U.S. No.
5,472,875) claims a new reactor design by which air or oxygen-enriched
gas is introduced into the oil prior to treatment with the
biocatalyst.  The second patent (U.S. No. 5,468,626) claims a method
by which a biosorption agent preferentially absorbs sulfur-containing
compounds from petroleum.  Such a process design could reduce the size
of the bioreactor by concentrating on those compounds requiring
desulfurization, thus reducing capital equipment costs, the company
reported.

CHEVRON, VENEZUELA'S MARAVEN PARTNERSHIP TO PUSH ASPHALT 

      Maraven S.A. and Chevron Corp. have formed a 20-year alliance
that will bring Chevron substantial crude supplies to run its three
asphalt-oriented refineries in the U.S. and expand its marketing of
asphalt products in the western U.S.  The U.S. partnership is named
Chevron Ven Asphalt Alliance.
      Under the agreement, Chevron will operate Maraven's property in
Venezuela's Boscan oil field and Maraven will in turn supply crude oil
to Chevron's asphalt refineries in Perth Amboy, NJ, Portland, OR, and
Richmond Beach, WA.  "Boscan crude, with an API gravity of 10 degrees,
is an excellent asphalt feedstock," said David O'Reilly, president of
Chevron USA Products Co. 
      Chevron's investment in the heavy oil fields will improve
production from 80,000 b/d today to 115,000 b/d, will reach about $2
billion, the company estimates.

PARAMOUNT PETROLEUM CONTINUES DOWNSTREAM RESTRUCTURING

      Paramount Petroleum launched the next phase of its operations
restructuring to shift its emphasis away from light-end products to
asphalt, jet fuel, diesel fuel and intermediate product refining.  The
company's latest efforts have idled certain downstream units, but
Paramount says it will retain the option of resuming hydro processing. 
"For now it is important that Paramount focus on its core business,
and continue to provide high-quality products and customer service,"
said Jerrel Barto, Paramount chairman.
      Paramount's restructuring began last September when it acquired
EOTT Energy Corp.'s West Coast asphalt marketing operation, senior
management team and technical staff.  At the same time, Paramount
terminated its processing agreement with EOTT, paid off its long-term
debt, entered into a long-term crude oil supply arrangement with EOTT,
obtained long-term financing from Bank of Boston and received a
substantial capital investment from EOTT, Paramount reported.

ASSESSING THE FUTURE OF CNG IN AN RFG WORLD

      Compressed natural gas (CNG) has been studied and tested
extensively as an alternative transportation fuel.  It has beeen used
in passenger car fleets, public transit vehicles and in some heavy-
duty equipment with spark-ignition systems replacing diesel fuel.  But
even so, the public understands the fuel characteristics of RFG and
diesel fuel far better than those of CNG.
      Nevertheless, CNG must be considered as one of the backup
transportation fuels of the next century.  It has the support of the
U.S. Department of Energy and is probably more compatible with the oil
and automobile industries than battery power.  However, as long as
crude oil moves freely in commerce throughout the world, CNG vehicle
development will be slow.  Future RFG, along with advances in
emissions control, can compete environmentally with CNG.

Natural Gas As A Stable Energy Source: Economic Factors

      As a fossil fuel, natural gas follows coal as the most plentiful
energy resource of the U.S.  Crude oil is in a distant third place,
and the U.S. is becoming increasingly dependent on imports.  At the
same time, methane, the major constituent of CNG, can be generated
from coal, tar sands, crude oil and, to some extent, renewable
sources.  It offers long-term stability as an energy source.
      Today, the price of natural gas is set by competition with
residual fuel oil or coal as a burner fuel, and it varies considerably
with geography and season.  As a general rule, CNG is more economic
than RFG despite capital and operating costs for compression. 
Conversions to accomodate CNG are said to average about $4,000 per
passenger or van-type vehicle.
      Fuel economy comparisons between CNG and RFG are confusing at
best.  On a theoretical BTU/gallon basis, CNG has much less to offer
than RFG.  On a BTU/lb of vapor basis, the heat content is more
comparable, but varies with individual CNG and RFG composition.  One
study with Caprice and Crown Victoria taxicabs conducted by Clean Air
Cab Co. indicated CNG "average fuel economy is equal to or better than
gasoline."  The study also also indicated a 20-month payback on
conversions.  

Composition and Emissions Performance

      In general, treated natural gas ranges from 80% to 98% methane,
with varying amounts of ethane, propane, inert gases (carbon dioxide
and nitrogen) and traces of heavier hydrocarbons.  EPA certification
fuel is specified at the bottom of Table I and is more restrictive
than some pipeline gas delivered for heating.  The heavier
hydrocarbons are necessarily limited for CNG due to the danger of
liquid formation.
      CNG's high methane content insures clean burning and a low level
of non-methane emissions.  Heavier hydrocarbons emitted, primarily
ethane and propane, are low in photochemical activity.
      Toxic emissions, such as benzene and 1,3 butadiene, are almost
non-existent, especially when catalytic converter controlled. 
However, the reactivity of emissions from compressed fuel can increase
if the C2 and C3 fractions contain olefins from refinery cracking
operations.  Olefin limits could be set on future CNG certification
fuel as an added environmental control.  (The California Air Resources
Board current limits the amount of propylene in LPG at 10 vol%, to be
reduced to 5 vol% on Jan. 1, 1997.)

Octane Quality

      The octane quality of most CNG compositions exceeds 120 (R+M)/2. 
However, the inherent value of the excess octane is currently lost
because vehicles converted to CNG are not designed with higher
compression engines that could offer additional fuel economy or
greater performance.
      An advanced natural gas vehicle developed by an industry
consortium, headed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory, does incorporate a modified small displacement, high-
compression engine.  The compact-sized, four-door sedan is said to
have a 315-mile driving range between refueling and fuel economy of 32
miles per (equivalent) gallon.

Fuel Tanks and Fueling

      Two major disadvantages for CNG passenger cars are the larger
space needed for fuel tanks and the availability of compressed gas for
fueling.  The Johns Hopkins prototype is said to retain 75% of the
original trunk storage space, which means that the rear has been
redesigned for fuel storage and lacks space for a spare tire and jack. 
Instead, the car is equipped with "run flat tires" which can be driven
up to 250 miles with no damage after puncture.
      Fueling time and availability is a major problem that needs
resolution before the average motorist can become serious about CNG,
and limited fleet operations can be expanded.
      Yet, in a world that would place a significant number of CNG
vehicles on the road, solutions can be visualized.  For example,
natural gas available through conventional systems for industrial and
home heating could be the fuel source.  Compression equipment and
tankage could be installed at large service stations or vehicle repair
shops.  Also, it is conceivable that compressors and small tanks could
be installed in the home garage, assuming safety problems could be
resolved.
      However, in the home-supply case, the gas delivered through the
heating system would need to meet CNG fuel specifications.  Natural
gas for home heating contains a minute amount of odorant, such as
mercaptan sulfur.  The material is added to facilitate leak detection
and could probably be removed with a filtering device connected to the
compression equipment.

Long-Range Outlook

      Prospects are slim for a CNG share of vehicle transportation
from the average motorist.  He or she is not likely to trade fueling
convenience and trunk space for lower-cost mileage.  Further, the
economic advantage for CNG over RFG would probably be lost (through
rising demand and added road taxes) if gas-powered vehicles were
mandated in critical air pollution areas such as the Los Angeles
Basin.  Also, as long as zero-emission vehicles are scheduled and
mandated in California, the major emphasis of automakers will be on
development of battery-powered cars.
      Future RFG, along with more extensive catalytic conversion, is
also competition for CNG from the standpoint of cost-effective
emissions reductions.
      On the other hand, as long as fuel economics favor CNG and
facilitate a short-term payout of conversion equipment, as well as
offer long-term, low-cost mileage, compressed gas will be attractive
for fleet operation -- especially in critical air pollution zones. 
Therefore, CNG and CNG vehicles can be viewed as a niche market that
will experience gradual growth.

SANCTIONS AGAINST NIGERIA COULD SEND OIL PRICES SOARING

      Elimination of Nigeria's oil production from world markets
through a boycott would push oil prices sharply higher and have a
particularly severe impact on heating oil and diesel fuel because of
the uniquely high distillate nature of Nigerian crudes, said Cheryl
Trench, executive vice president, Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation (New York, NY).  OECD countries, led by the U.S., would be
most affected, as they account for 90% of Nigeria's export market, or
more than 1.5 million b/d.
      "As everybody is well aware, this is not an issue under hot
debate in the U.S. right now," said Trench.  "But it is under
consideration in the U.S. Congress and internationally."
      With the world having perhaps 3.5 million b/d of spare oil
production capacity today, two-thirds of that in Saudi Arabia, Trench
believes that prices would rise during the substantial time lag before
supplies were redistributed around the world in accordance with
demand.  "Even if  it were, however, the incremental crude would not
match the quality of Nigerian crudes, with their high yields of light
products in general, and particularly high yield of gasoil," she
wrote.
      The last time when light crudes were at a premium, during the
U.S. Operation Desert Storm, refiners that had to use heavy crudes
wound up increasing refinery runs to make up deficits -- and the same
thing would occur in this case.  "Uncertainty over the availability of
incremental supplies will encourage inventory holding, the phenomenon
that unbalanced markets in 1979," she added.
      Even a unilateral embargo by only the U.S. would affect the
market noticeably, Trench predicted.  For one thing, U.S. East Coast
gasoline and heating oil inventories are lower this year than in years
past, so any production shortfall would be felt "quickly and strongly
in product prices."  The redirection of near-substitutes for Nigerian
crude (such as North Sea production) to the U.S. would change trade
patterns and contribute to a widening of crude-grade splits.
      The impact of a boycott in the U.S. would fall
disproportionately on several refiners, PIRF found: Sun, which is 100%
dependent on Nigerian crude to run its Philadelphia refinery complex;
BP, which relies on the crude for 70% of its feed at Marcus Hook, PA,
a facility it is soon turning over to Tosco; and Hess, which uses
large volumes of Nigerian crude at its Virgin Islands complex.

ABB GROUP SCORES SUCCESSES IN FORMER SOVIET UNION

      During the last few months, Switzerland's ABB Group moved ahead
of other Western engineering companies backing the growth of the
refining industry in the former Soviet Union.
      In November, ABB Lummus Global, a division of ABB Group, helped
arrange a $96 million loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for
further modernization of a refinery in Perm, Russia.  ABB Lummus will
manage the project, which will expand production of low-aromatics (10
vol%) diesel fuel, increase yield of high-value products and reduce SO2
emissions by 30%.  The refinery is already Russia's top producer of
lubricant oils and has been making an all-unleaded gasoline slate
since March 1993.
      Separately, ABB Simcon signed an agreement with Petrocom of
Moscow, to cooperate in supplying the refining industry with
automation systems, dynamic simulators and related services.

GASOLINE, HEATING OIL PRICES IMPROVE DESPITE INVENTORY BUILDS

      Fuel traders appeared to shake off American Petroleum Institute
(API) data that indicated gasoline and distillate inventories
increased substantially in the last week of 1995, instead driving Gulf
Coast gasoline up nearly 4 c/gal since late December.  For the week
ended Dec. 30, 1995, gasoline inventories incresaed 5.1 million bbl.
      Distillate stocks increased 1.2 million bbl, but that was
entirely due to a rise in on-road diesel, as the cold weather took a
large bit out of heating oil inventories.  As a result, spot prices
for high-sulfur diesel fuel ended last week even with on-road diesel
at 61 c/gal in New York and 55.6 c/gal in Houston.
      Concentrating on a huge drawdown in crude oil inventories of
11.4 million bbl, traders said that the trends of higher product
demand are more important than a one-week fluctuation in product
stocks at a time of year when inventories are sometimes manipulated
for tax purposes.  
      News Friday morning that refinery workers at BP's Marcus Hook,
PA, facility rejected the contract offer by Tosco helped gasoline
prices in the East as the week ended.  If BP proceeds with its
decision to close the refinery in the absence of a new contract when
it turns it over to Tosco on Jan. 31, product from the172,000-b/d
facility would come to a halt.  However, sources indicate that the
plant has been running "at maybe half capacity" for a considerable
period of time and that the new owner, Tosco, could increase
production at its Bayway, NJ, refinery to make up for any shortfalls
from the Marcus Hook plant.
      Also aiding the market late last week were stoppages in some
crude shipments  because of severe winter storms.  Coastal  announced
that its Corpus Christi, TX, refinery was scaling back operations
about 20% due to reduced crude shipments from the Gulf of Mexico
because of the weather.  Shell reduced operations at Deer Park, TX, by
an undisclosed amount for the same reason.
      MTBE prices have stalled in the past several weeks, due to light
trading interest and sufficient supplies, after performing strongly in
the first three weeks of December.  Spot Gulf Coast MTBE held at 92
c/gal last week, said sources, who added that they do not see any
events on the mid-term horizon that will affect prices.  Methanol
contracts rolled over unchanged from December to January at 42 c/gal,
with spot prices at discounts of as much as 10 c/gal from those
levels.
      Ethanol prices were also unchanged at spot levels, though some
Midwest marketers reported that rack rates increased by 1-2 c/gal in a
reflection of stronger rack gasoline prices.
      Crude price gains were attributed to expectations of continued
strong product demand.

CDTECH PIONEERS SAFER, SMARTER BENZENE UNIT FOR TEXACO

      CDTECH is licensing its first application of CDHydrosm for the
selective hydrogenation of benzene in reformate feedstocks for Texaco
Refining and Marketing Inc.'s Bakersfield, CA, plant to provide a less
expensive way for the refiner to meet its CARB Phase 2 RFG gasoline
requirements.
      The technology provides an economic way for Bakersfield to
produce a high-octane component, since it lacks a catalytic cracker. 
The plant has 16,000 b/d of low-pressure catalytic reforming capacity.
      CDHydro technology, said to be the first of its kind, is
designed to replace the standard fixed-bed hydrogenation and
conventional distillation units in one single proprietary catalytic
distillation unit.  The Texaco contract will mark the first commercial
use of a combined, single-step reaction and fractionation of benzene,
allowing cheaper, lower-pressure and safer operating conditions, said
Tom Hickey, director of marketing and operations, CDTECH.  
      While gasoline benzene specifications continue to be more
stringent worldwide, CDHydro hydrogenates benzene into cyclohexane,
considered to be more environmentally innocuous.  The new technology
operates isothermally, thus eliminating the concern of temperature-
rise common in fixed-bed reactor systems.  Another advantage is that
the technology utilizes commercially available catalyst.
      Also,  standard fixed-bed units require a larger volume of
hydrocarbons in processing because they use more equipment for
processing them.  CDHydro utilizes just one column already present in
the refinery eliminating the need for additional hydrocarbon
inventory.  "This reduces the ultimate residence time of the liquid
and limits hydrocarbon holdup," Hickey said.
      The technology has been commercially available since mid-1994,
and may be installed either as a retrofit or a new column.  Although
it may not be universally useful to all refiners, Hickey said, "we
expect to see a fair number of applications, but that really depends
on a case-by-case basis.  However, 100%" of everyone that has to build
a new reformate splitter can benefit. 
      "We will probably see wide utilization in Europe because of the
strict new environmental regulations on benzene," Hickey said.  "Many
refiners will require new reformate splitters to remove benzene, and
in those applications, CDHydro is a natural." 
      Texaco recently installed a new, 7,200-b/d reformate splitter
column at Bakersfield to produce California Phase 2 RFG, which will
utilize the CDHydro technology.  Currently, the 56,000-b/d refinery
does not produce any RFG, either Federal or California.  Texaco
declined to comment on the projected savings it expects to glean from
the CDHydro technology or the amount of RFG it plans to produce.  The
upgrade won't alter the plant's overall crude capacity, however. 
      Other options for eliminating benzene include pre-fractionation
for precursors, post-fractionation, removing the benzene for sale, and
alkylation.  CDTECH developed the technology based on its similar
applications for butadiene hydrogenation for C4 streams.

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL OVERLOOK

     Independents still splitting and combining, some surprises, some
significant deals in property acquisitions, majors still
repositioning, usual yearend rush to buy and sell reserves.
Canadian takeover market just keeps heating up, three or four major

JANUARY 1996

TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS

Takeover mania continues unabated outside our borders. Internally, so
many companies and/or oil and gas divisions are being placed on the
market, hostile efforts are usually not necessary.
Of course there are exceptions. A group of dissident shareholders try
for the umpteenth time to unseat the Tesoro Petroleum board. The
group, which includes Kevin Flannery, James Stone, George
Baker, Alan Kaufman and Robert Washburn, own about 5.7% of the Tesoro
shares. Group files a 13-D with the SEC notifying it that the group
will mail a proposal to shareholders to elect its slate of five board
nominees, which include Gale Galloway and Douglas Thompson. Group
proposes to sell the Alaskan refinery and other assets, possibly
including all of Tesoro.  The takeover battle for First Interstate
Bancorp continues to rage on.  After Wells Fargo increased its offer
to .667 share for each First share, and First had rushed into the
arms of First Bank Systems (Minneapolis), Wells reported a plan to
purchase up to 5% of First's shares.
First Bank reported Wells couldn't do that under takeover laws. That
point is still up in the air.
Meanwhile, the market price of Wells shares keeps rising, making their
offer even higher, up to $1 billion more. Wells to ask First
shareholders to reject the First Bank offer and accept its offer. The
whole deal may still come down to whether the SEC allows First Bank to
use the pooling accounting treatment of its merger with First rather
than the purchase accounting treatment, which Wells has to use. As of
last word, the SEC accountants hadn't decided, but heavy-duty
analysts argue both sides of the proposal. Near press time, First
Interstate sues Wells in Delaware court, charging securities laws
violations.
Other bank mergers include Fleet Financial Group's $3 billion offer
for the U.S. commercial banking unit of Westminster Bank PLC. Deal
makes Fleet the eighth largest in the U.S. The Royal Bank of Scotland
will merge its U.S. unit, Citizens Finance Group, with First NH Bank,
the third largest in New England and a sub of Bank of Ireland, giving
Royal Bank of Scotland a 76.5% share in the combined bank.
## UPDATES FROM NORTH OF THE BORDER
The Murwell Resources Ltd. board recommends acceptance of the takeover
offer from Icon Energy Ltd. of two Icon shares for each Murwell common
as reported last month. Offer mailed early in December.
Other takeovers reported herein include the C$380 million 
Rigel offer for Inverness the merged company to have reserves of 572
BCFG and 58.9 MMBL; the C$1.1 billion offer by Alberta Energy for 
Conwest Exploration; and the C$186 million offer by Forest Oil for 
ATCOR Resources.
Another new takeover attempt that turns hostile is made by a
consortium of a Canadian energy company, a pension fund, a Canadian
bank and a U.S. investment firm. On Dec. 17, Pembina Acquisition
Corp., which is owned 51.5% by Pembina Resources Ltd., 30% by the 
Ontario Teacher's Pension Fund, 10.8% by Allen & Company Inc., and
7.7% by T D Capital Group Ltd., an affiliate of the Toronto-Dominion
Bank, reports its intention to offer C$7 per for the shares of 
Mark Resources Inc. Hints at a possible higher offer. The group
currently holds 2.88 million Mark shares, or about 5.2%. Deal subject
to review of financial data and 66.67% acceptance.  Asks Mark for a
list of its shareholders. Group retains T D Securities Inc. and RBC
Dominion Securities to act as financial advisors. Deal currently
valued at C$354 million.  By next day, Mark shares trade above the
offer price at C$7.125 per. On the 19th, Mark board calls the offer
too low and approves a shareholders rights antitakeover plan with a
20% trigger. Mark hires CIBC-Wood Gundy Securities as financial
advisor. Pembina reports disappointment with the board maneuvers,
plans to proceed with the offer. Analysts expect a higher offer, up to
the C$8 range. Mark acquired Hillcrest Resources in a hostile takeover
earlier in 1995 and was expected to be a target.
Pembina is privately owned by the Mannix family of Calgary.
Pacalta Resources Ltd. offers C$.55 per for shares of Trax Petroleum
Ltd. Trax board sets up committee to review offer and hires CIBC Wood
Gundy Inc. as financial advisor.  In the UK, Melrose Energy PLC
continues its takeover offer for Pentex Oil PLC. Melrose offers 81 new
shares for every 20 Pentex shares, or about $31.2 million, based on
current market prices. Deal would give Pentex shareholders a 29.5%
stake in Melrose. Melrose to also issue a rights offering to raise
capital for the group, offering one new share at 34 pence for each
five shares held. Pentex board approves the deal.  Basically Pentex
Oil management (Pentex has 67 employees) will take over management of
Melrose Energy. Pentex chairman, Henry Cameron, will become chief
executive and Pentex managing director will take the same job at
Melrose. Robert Adair, a geologist who owns 60% of Melrose, will see
his stake reduced to 40% and will take the deputy directorship and CFO
job.  Melrose has few employees, but manages oil and gas interests in
Texas, New Mexico and Wyoming.  Pentex produces 6,000 BOPD from its
interests in two North Sea fields and produces about 500 BOEPD from 12
onshore UK fields.
In other European news, Statoil extended its offer for 
Aran EnergyAran Energy after receiving only 83.78% of Aran shares by
Dec. 6 in response to its 76 Irish pence per offer. By the 13th,
Statoil had received 85.43% and declared its offer unconditional.
Talisman Energy Inc. (Calgary) makes a takeover offer for Goal
Petroleum PLC (London). Offers 97.5 pence in cash per share, or about
C$275 million, and agrees to assume about C$40 million of Goal debt.
Institutional investors holding 45.5% of Goal agree to tender their
shares to the offer. Goal has 20 employees with production of about
20,000 BOEPD from a 5% interest in the Wytch Farm, 32% in Blenheim,
2.5% in Mangus and interests in 47 other British and Dutch licenses
and fields. Proved and probable reserves estimated at 31.1 MMBO and
83.9 BCFG. Deal gives Talisman 49,000 BOEPD from the North Sea and
quadruples its exploration acreage there. Talisman to borrow the C$315
million from the Royal Bank of Canada.
Central and South West Corp. extends its offer for shares of 
Seaboard PLC to January 11 after receiving only about 44.42% of
Seeboard shares, or 109 million shares to its offer. Including shares
it held, that gives CSW about 74.31% of Seeboard.
Abbot PLC, parent of KCA Drilling (Aberdeen) makes a $8.25 million
takeover offer for OIS International Inspection (Aberdeen). OIS
services the oil, gas and petrochemical industries.
Kvaerner A/SKvaerner A/S makes a hostile takeover offer of 100 pence
per for Amec PLC, which is involved in the development of the Natuna
Field, offshore Indonesia.

Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., cut a deal with the Canadian and Newfoundland
governments to combine the four exploration licenses they hold in
offshore and onshore Western Newfoundland and to extend their rights
through January, 2000 four years beyond the original term of two of
the licenses. The JV has drilled on one of its two licenses from an
onshore location in extreme southwestern Newfoundland and by all
reports has discovered major reserves. The JV then farmed-in the Mobil
blocks and currently is drilling a deviated hole from a land location
at the extreme northern tip of the Port au Port Peninsula. The JV has
already committed to drilling another well in 1996, probably offshore

group commits to at least four wells to get the consolidation.
The above has set off a frenzy of activity in the area, including
seismic and drilling plans.

Vinland Petroleum Inc. and plans a directional well from an onshore
location in the near future. 
Oilexco Inc. reports cutting a deal with Vinland to hold a 25% WI in

sub-salt discovery in Block 128, along with its discoveries in Blocks
83, 84 and 127, and Amerada's discovery in Block 172 will be developed
together, with platforms in Block 128
and later in Block 172. Shell will operate the project, which is
expected to produce about 300 MMCFGPD and 40,000 BLPD when fully
developed.
Mike Baugh, president of BHP's Australia/Asia region, reports in an
article in the December Journal of Petroleum Technology that
government takes of discoveries vary widely in the region. Malaysia
and Vietnam have about 15% to 20% higher takes than the ZOCA area

GAS PRICES

Well gas prices did some mighty strange things in December. The cold
weather in the Northeast caught everyone by surprise and pipeline
supply just wasn't enough to keep up with demand. The bottleneck at
the Henry hub appears to be the main culprit as producers in Texas and
the Rockies were unable to get enough gas through that interchange,
while Louisiana and SE state producers opened the taps wide.
Therefore, as pressure mounted for more gas to fight the cold, the
short players had to scramble to cover their positions. The capacity
restraint, the short positions and the perceived low storage levels
drove eastern U.S. and local city gate prices through the roof. Some
city gates hit $6 in the crunch. Meanwhile, the Midwest states,
although just as cold, were able to draw down their more-than-adequate
storage volumes instead of bidding in the market. Thus Chicago gates
didn't get much above $2, although that began to change at month-end,
rising to about $3.50.
The overall effect was to raise prices, but expect the effect to be
temporary. Everything depends on the weather, of course, after the
short-players get covered.
Delivered-to-pipeline spots started December in the $1.85 to $1.90
range in Oklahoma, about 25 cents to 30 cents higher than last month
and last December. By January 1, prices had moved up only slightly as
Oklahoma gas was squeezed out of the rush to the east. Prices rose to
the $2 level on an average.
Texas Gulf prices didn't fare much better. Prices started the month in
the $2.05 range, up 40 cents from last month and 45 cents to 50 cents
from last year. By January 1, prices at some points had actually
slipped to the $2 range as Texas gas also got squeezed out. Even as
the pinch got worse in early January, Texas Gulf prices only increased
about 10 cents.
However, Louisiana spots were a different game. At the start of
December, Louisiana spots were in the $2.20-$2.25 range, up 45 cents
to 50 cents from last month and 55 cents to 65 cents from last year.
By January 1, prices varied widely from the Koch Gateway in the $2.60
range to most other points paying $3.30 to $3.55. The Henry hub saw
$3.50 in early January.
West Texas prices mirrored the rest of the middle states. The Waha hub
saw early prices in the $1.75 to $1.80 range, up 25 cents from last
month and 15 cents from last year. By month-end, prices had edged up
to the $1.90 to $2.05 range.
Rockies prices couldn't even see the rally. The Opal hub started the
month in the $1.30 range, up 5 cents from November and down 30 cents
from last December. By month-end, prices had actually slipped about 5
cents. In the southern Rockies, prices weren't much better, hitting
$1.30 to $1.35.
California border prices went nowhere, ending the month in the $1.50
range.
Canadian border spots stayed in the $1.10 to $1.25 range in the West
and soared to the $2.85 to $3.50 range in the East.
Appalachian fared better naturally, rising to the $3.70 to $3.85 range
by month-end.
Futures prices were a different story. Early December quotes for
February delivery were in the $2 to $2.15 range. By late month, that
had soared to the $2.05 to $2.35 range and by early January, futures
on the NYMEX hit the $3 to $3.10 range for February deliveries.
Gas storage volumes, of course, began to plummet. On December 1, the
AGA estimated storage at 83% full with 2.66 TCFG, down 9% from last
Dec. 1, some 73 BCFG pulled out in the last week of November. By the
end of the third week of December, storage had dropped to 70% of
capacity, after 154 BCF was pulled the week before, down 15% from last
year. No later figures were in, but you can bet Northeast storage
volumes were hitting rock bottom.
The above classically illustrates the dangers of speculative trading
in gas futures. It also dramatically puts the finger on problem areas
the Henry hub and the still low volume of peaking gas storage
facilities in the Northeast. This is one time when the LDC buyers got
caught short trying to drive down gas prices.

EDITOR'S COMMENTARY

Interesting article in the December JPT called "Heterogeneity,
Geostatistics, Horizontal Wells and Blackjack Poker," by Dennis
Beliveau dealing specifically with horizontal wells, but more
particularly about predicting outcomes when dealing with wells and
reservoirs.
I see a study of average annual pay for various industry groups in
Houston listed oil and gas extraction workers at $35,848/year.
Security brokers led the list at $87,747 followed by electric, gas
and sanitary services at $42,052 (!). Transportation equipment workers
came in at $37,765 per.
Louisiana reports monthly state employment in oil and gas extraction
averaged about 48,100 workers over the first nine months of 1995, up
from 44,700 in 1994. Experts expect that to increase to about 50,000
in 1996.
The Oklahoma Geological Survey reports that half of the state's gas is
produced by 3,200 small operators from leases that produce less than 1
MMCFGPD.
Exxon to help pay for an equipment upgrade on Sonat Offshore's
Discoverer Seven Seas and has contracted the drillship for deep water
wells worldwide over the next two years.
The deepwater royalty relief in the recently signed bill ending
Alaskan crude export restrictions is a nice boon to Gulf producers.
All new leases in waters of 200 meters or better qualify. No royalty
due on first 17.5 MMBOE in depths of 200 to 400 meters, on the first
52.5 MMBOE between 400 and 800 meters and on the first 87.5 MMB deeper
than 800 meters.
And, where do these utilities get these new names? Yikes!

ENERGY:  IRAN-PARTICIPATED GAS PIPELINE PROJECT MAKES PROGRESS

   NEW YORK, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- The pipeline project to export gas
from Turkmenistan to Europe via Iran and Turkey has made progress,
according to China's news agency Xinhua.
   It said a meeting held to discuss the project would be chaired
by Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov and attended by the oil and
energy ministers of Turkmenistan, Turkey, Iran, the Russian
Federation and Kazakhstan.
   It is reported that representatives at the meeting will discuss
whether to join a company to build the 845 km pipeline, estimated
to cost $2 billion.
   As there are some problems in the gas transportation through the
Russian pipeline to Europe, Turkmenistan initiated a project to lay
a pipeline as an alternative export route for it to sell its gas
to Europe.
   It is estimated that Turkmenistan has gas reserves of 21
trillion cu. meters, the third largest in the world. But its gas
exports to Western Europe have fallen from 11 billion cu. meters
in 1992 to almost zero now.
   Turkey and Turkmenistan signed a natural gas transportation
accord in May 1992 and Ankara is interested in the project as it
is greatly in need of gas to meet domestic consumption.
   It is believed the financing of the ambitious project will be
finalized at talks in the Turkish capital, starting today.
   The Itar news agency confirmed that the meeting was also
expected to fix the date to begin construction of the pipeline.
   Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov will meet Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel to discuss mutual seller-buyer guarantees.
   "A managerial body capable of mastering substantial financial
and technical resources to implement the pipeline project will be
set up," according to Khekim Ishanov, the Turkmen minister for oil
and gas.
   "The Turkmen transcontinental pipeline will be able to transport
from 15 billion to 28 billion cu. meters of gas a year. Its
construction is expected to begin next may after the package of
financing documents is signed," he added.

ENERGY:  CONOCO EXECUTIVES VISIT VENEZUELA

   CARACAS, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- High-ranking executives from Conoco
of the United States have made a two-day visit to Venezuela to
analyze progress in a joint-venture association with Maraven, a
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) affiliate.
   The delegation met with Maraven president Emilio Abouhamad and
other board members to monitor progress in the association for the
development, production, transportation and upgrading of
extra-heavy crudes from the Orinoco oil belt.
   The Maraven-Conoco strategic association is aimed at producing
some 120,000 b/d of nine degrees api extra-heavy crude, which will
be transported along a 210 km pipeline to installations at Jose,
Anzoategui state for upgrading.
   These installations include a delayed choking plant, designed
to produce some 113,000 b/d of upgraded 20 degrees api crude that
will be shipped to Conoco refineries in the U.S.
   The delegation included Conoco's executive vice president of
corporate strategy, Robert E. Mckee, vice president for business
development and exploration and production resources Michael
Stinson, vice president of business development and optimization
Donald Unruh and the association project manager, David Griffith.
   The group also met with Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA)
president Luis Giusti and PDVSA vice president Claus Graf.

ENERGY:  OCCIDENTAL INKS BANGLADESH PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS

   NEW YORK, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- Occidental petroleum has announced
that it has signed production-sharing contracts with Petrobangla,
the state oil company of Bangladesh, to explore a 3.4 million acre
area in the gas-producing region of northeastern Bangladesh and to
appraise a large gas discovery made in 1989 by another operator.
   During the initial exploration period, Occidental will conduct
a 1,250 km seismic program, beginning this year, and will drill
two exploratory wells.
   The contracts are the first to be signed under the country's new
petroleum laws, which recently were changed significantly.
   The exploration area is composed of blocks 12, 13 and 14, which
are served by a pipeline system with sufficient capacity for new
discoveries.
   More than 25 trillion cu. ft of natural gas has been discovered
in 17 fields in Bangladesh, which has a growing need for the fuel.
   Currently, gas production is around 600 million cu. ft per day.
Occidental is operator with 100 percent of the contractor's
interest.

ENERGY:  WORLD BANK APPROVES $150 MILLION LOAN TO ALGERIA

   ALGIERS, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- The World Bank has approved a $150
million loan to Algeria, the Algerian News Agency (APS) has
reported quoting a World Bank statement.
   The loan would offer support to financial reforms and social aid
programs in Algeria, the statement said.
   Algeria was currently facing economic stagnation, a population
growth rate of 2.5 percent per year, a fall in its per capita
income of 25 percent, and an unemployment rate close to 25 percent,
the statement added.
   To counteract these problems, the government had undertaken a
stabilization program aimed at stimulating and transforming the
economy with support from the International Monetary Fund, it
noted.
   Inflation was currently under control and the budget deficit was
scheduled to be reduced from nine percent to three percent of gross
domestic product in 1995.
   The World Bank loan is repayable in 17 years, including a
five-year grace period, under usual World Bank conditions.
   Additionally, the African Development Bank has granted an 83.57
million loan to the Algerian firm Sonelgaz (electricity and gas).
   The loan will finance electricity projects, notably connecting
some 350,000 new users.
   Since 1971, the African Development Bank has financed 22
Algerian projects worth $1.4 billion.

ENERGY:  OIL PRICES SUFFER LOSSES IN ASIA, MIXED IN LONDON

   SINGAPORE, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- Fuel oil prices on the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange (Simex) closed on a slightly softer
note today, unflattered by the firmer tones adopted by domestic
bunkering trade.
   Traders here said the market was mostly cautious with the
front-month February fuel oil contract being discussed between a
low of 95.60 dollars a ton and a high of 96.40 dollars.
   Fuel oil futures trade was mostly under the influence of weak
crude and mixed prices on the International Petroleum Exchange
(IPE) in London today.
   The Simex February fuel oil contract settled the day at 96.20
dollars for a loss of 10 cents, while the March position fell by
50 cents to 94.50 dollars.
   Trading volume was a mere 165 lots, based on initially computed
figures.
   In bunkering trade, cst 180 was still maintaining a higher mood
at 103 dollars a ton, while cst 380 was in the 93 dollar range.
   Meanwhile, in early trading on the IPE, Britain's north sea
brent crude for March delivery was fetching 16.14 dollars a barrel,
up by one cent from Friday's close.
   However, gasoil on the exchange for February was being quoted
1.25 dollars lower at 140.75 dollars a ton.

DROPPING ETHANOL INVENTORIES SIGNAL TIGHT SUPPLY, SAYS MARKETER

      Fuel ethanol stocks across the U.S. have been dropping since
September, and marketers believe that the decrease in inventories is
an indication of supply tightness throughout the system.  Ethanol
stocks at the end of November were about 2.1 million barrels,
according to the latest Energy Information Administration (EIA)
report.  This is only a  slight decrease from last year's level of 2.3
million barrels, but a substantial drop from the 4.2 million barrels
EIA reported in September 1995.
      MTBE stocks have also dropped in the last few months, but the
decrease is not as dramatic as that seen in ethanol.
      While EIA does not show a dramatic decline in ethanol production
since September, marketers say ethanol is beginning to show the signs
of a tight supply market.
      "A lot of the tightness has to do with the amount of supply that
has been removed from the market," said one ethanol marketer.  Four
ethanol plants have been closed due to poor production margins earlier
in the year and others have cut back fuel ethanol production, he said. 
"Right now we are in the middle of a heavy demand period, with the
oxygenated fuel seasons, and we are faced with a contraction of supply
but demand is still at about normal levels -- leaving a definite
tightness in the market."
      Ethanol prices continued to respond to the tightness last week,
with prices increasing 1-2 c/gal.  Gulf Coast spot ethanol traded at
$1.18/gal and export was in a range of $1.18-$1.22/gal.
      However, the current price support is expected to be short-
lived.  "We have about 30-40 days of strength left in this market,"
noted the marketer.  "The demand will begin to fall off in mid-
February, and prices should fall as well."
      After a strong showing in December, MTBE prices seemed to have
stabilized, according to traders.  Gulf Coast spot MTBE remained in a
range of 92-93 c/gal.
      Methanol prices also remained steady last week, though there was
some speculation in the market that contract list prices may increase
later in the month.

INDUSTRY GEARS UP FOR INTRODUCTION OF CARB PHASE 2 RFG
-State Tests Show No Problems in Vehicles or Off-Road Equipment-

      With less than two months until the production of CARB Phase 2
RFG is required in California, refiners, oxygenate producers and state
government officials are reporting no problems with the implementation
of the program.   Supplies of CARB RFG and the oxygenates required to
produce it are expected to be sufficient to meet demand.
      The start of the California Phase 2 RFG program will be the last
big regulatory boost for oxygenates, according to Jim Thomas, vice
president of market analysis for Bonner and Moore Associates, Inc. 
"After CARB Phase 2 begins, oxygenate demand will only grow with the
normal growth rate of gasoline -- which is usually not very large," he
said.
      MTBE will be the oxygenate of choice for most refiners producing
CARB Phase 2 RFG, predicted Thomas, though some ethanol, TAME and even
ETBE will be used to meet the increased demand for oxygenates.
      Demand for MTBE will gain an additional 40,000 b/d for the last
six months of 1996, when CARB Phase 2 RFG is required at the retail
level, said Thomas.  "If you look at the average annualized demand
increase in 1996, it is about 20,000-25,000 b/d," he said.
      Oxygenate supply should be sufficient to meet the new demand,
and non-U.S. suppliers will be aggressively seeking their share of the
new business, Thomas said.  "There is a lot of volume available that
can be moved around," he said.  "There are new plants coming online in
Korea that will help, and product is available from Brazil, Saudi
Arabia and Europe."
      Oxygenate pricing should strengthen due to the greater demand
structure and remain strong until the market adjusts to the new
demand, Thomas said.  However, large price spikes, like those
preceding the start of the federal RFG program, are unlikely since
MTBE contract pricing is now more closely tied to market factors, he
said, adding that such spikes are very difficult to predict.
      Many refiners are already beginning to stockpile MTBE for use in
CARB RFG, said Thomas.  "Some of the current strengthening in MTBE
prices is a reflection of that inventory building," he said.

State Tests Show No Vehicle or Equipment Problems

      CARB's test program, done in conjunction with some of the
state's key refiners, gave Phase 2 RFG a clean bill of health, said
CARB officials recently.  The tests involved 829 vehicles in eight
private and government fleets that drove about five million miles on
Phase 2 RFG from February through August 1995.
      "There was no meaningful difference between the frequency of
fuel-system problems in vehicles using cleaner-burning gasoline and
the pre-1996 (conventional) gasoline," CARB Chairman John Dunlap
announced.  "Cleaner-burning gasoline has been thoroughly tested and
has broad-based support within industry."
      The few problems noted were on vehicles with mileage above the
average of the fleet (95,000 miles) or vehicles that used an
especially low-aromatics fuel Texaco developed but does not intend to
sell commercially.  Separate, smaller tests on various off-road
construction vehicles, lawnmowers and farm equipment found no
performance problems, Dunlap added
      Mileage for the Phase 2 vehicles was about 1% less than Federal
RFG now sold in Southern California and 3% below conventional gasoline
sold in the state, CARB found.

SOUTH AMERICA RANKS IMPORTANT IN GLOBAL METHANOL MARKET
-Region Will Be 30% of World Trade in 1998-

      While demand growth for methanol in South America is not
expected to be great through the end of the century, growth in the
region's production capacity is projected to be one of the largest in
the world, according to experts.  "The South American region is one of
those strategic offshore locations on which increasing emphasis must
be placed if any realistic prognosis of the future direction of the
[methanol] industry is to be made," said Rampersad Motilal, divisional
manager of manufacture and marketing for the Trinidad and Tobago
Methanol Co. (TTMC).
      South America's share of world methanol export trade continues
to grow, making it even more critical to the global methanol industry. 
"At present, the South American net share of world trade is close to
2.5 million metric tons, which represents approximately 20% of the
world total," Motilal told attendees of CMAI's World Methanol
Conference in Phoenix.  "By 1998, South America will account for close
to 4.4 million metric tons of world trade -- over 30% of the world
total."
      With a capacity growth rate of more that 18% from 1989 through
1995, South America led other regions of the world in production
increases, Motilal said.  From 1995 through 1998, the region's
production capacity is expected to grow another 16.5%, he said.
      The five largest methanol-producing countries in South America
are almost all expected to see continued growth in production capacity
through the end of the century.  At the same time, demand for methanol
is not expected to keep pace, leaving more product available for
export.
      Chile and Trinidad & Tobago will be doubling or nearly doubling
their production capacity between 1995 and 1998, according to Motilal. 
Methanex is constructing a second methanol plant in Chile.  The
926,000-metric-tons-per-year plant is expected to be online late in
1996.  Trinidad & Tobago is expecting the addition of three new
production facilities -- making it the largest methanol producing
country in the region with 2.1 million metric tons per year of
capacity.  Methanex, TTMC and Saturn Methanol are all planing to build
facilities in the island nation.
      Brazil and Venezuela lead the region in methanol demand.  Most
of Brazil's demand comes from its national fuel alcohol program, while
MTBE production dominates Venezuelan demand.

Region Offers Producers Several Advantages

      Low feedstock costs are one of the advantages of methanol
production in many South American countries, said project developers. 
However, it is not the only advantage the region holds.  For example,
Trinidad & Tobago "not only offers competitive natural gas prices, but
also skilled labor, logistical advantages and duty-free access to both
Europe and U.S. markets and has the needed infrastructure available,"
said Deo van Wijk, president of Saturn Methanol Co.  Saturn announced
plans for the construction of a 2,500-metric-tons-per-day (287-
million-gallons-per-year) facility to be located in Point Lisas,
Trinidad & Tobago.  The plant is expected to be on-line by late 1997

SOUTH DAKOTA ETHANOL SUPPORTERS CONSIDER YEAR-ROUND OXYGEN

      Ethanol proponents in South Dakota are considering their options
to add a year-round oxygen requirement to the state's gasoline.  While
an exact course of action has not yet been devised, a bill may be
introduced as early as this session.
      "A year-round oxygen content has a lot of merit," said Trevor
Guthmiller, executive director of the American Coalition for Ethanol
(ACE).  "The question is, can we educate legislators on the issue in
time to pass it this year?  The lawmakers we have discussed the idea
with so far do seem positive."
      The South Dakota Corn Growers Association (SDCGA) have also
shown support for such a move, said Jane Heenen, program coordinator
for SDCGA.  The group passed a resolution to support legislation "that
would require the sale of gasoline that contains at least 2.7%
oxygenates such as ethanol" and "encourage South Dakota's governor and
legislators to take the lead in getting all PADD II states to have
similar oxygenated fuel standards."
      However, both ACE and SDCGA were quick to note that a year-round
oxygen requirement should not come at a cost of the state's other
incentives for ethanol.  "We don't want to lose the incentives we
already have in place," said Heenen, noting that almost 50% of the
state's gasoline already contains ethanol.  "This may not be the year
to proceed."
      Minnesota begins its state-wide oxygen requirement in 1997, and
Nebraska is also considering such a move.

API PETITIONS EPA TO REPEAL NOx REDUCTIONS IN PHASE II RFG

      In the first attempt to amend Federal Phase II RFG
specifications, the American Petroleum Institute (API) has filed a
petition with U.S. EPA seeking  a repeal of the agency's requirement
to reduce summertime NOx emissions.  "This move is an attempt to
formalize the complaint we have had with the NOx reduction regulations
since the rule was promulgated," said API spokesman Chris Kelley. 
      Oxygenate producers worry this move may be the first in a series
of attempts to change Phase 2 specifications, including one to remove
the oxygenate requirement.
      In the petition, API argues that NOx reduction is not a cost-
effective way to control summertime ozone and in some cases may
actually exacerbate the problem.  EPA estimates NOx reduction costs at
about $5,000/ton while API maintains that the cost is closer to
$10,000/ton. 
       "API remains convinced that EPA's estimates of gasoline
desulfurization costs and the cost-effectiveness of NOx reductions are
far too low because of flawed refinery modeling assumptions," the
petition states.  "Because consumers would be faced with the higher
costs of Phase II RFG, API's petition urges EPA to repeal the NOx
reduction requirements, which would require refiners to make
significant capital investments.
      Phase I of the federal RFG program calls for no increase in NOx
emissions from gasoline, while Phase II RFG, which takes effect in
2000, calls for a 5% to 7% reduction in NOx emissions.
      Since the 1994 promulgation of the RFG rule, EPA has granted
several state waivers from certain stationary source NOx reduction
requirements, API noted.  The foundation of these waivers stems from
the "undisputed fact that NOx reductions in many areas do not help and
may even hinder some areas in their progress toward complying with
federal ozone pollution standards," the petition said.  
      Like VOCs, NOx emissions are widely believed to be a precursor
to ozone.  However, some studies have shown that in a few cases, NOx
may actually serve to break down ozone and that NOx reductions could
work to increase urban ozone concentrations, depending on the VOC- to-
NOx ratio.  Across-the-board RFG NOx reductions are not warranted,
"especially when other, more cost-effective and more targetable
controls are available," API wrote.
      API called for a prompt rulemaking on its request to repeal the
NOx reduction requirement, asking EPA to suspend the requirement until
"a more comprehensive assessment of the NOx control strategies and an
evaluation of EPA's overall nitrogen oxides control strategy can be
performed."
      With EPA closed temporarily, there has been no recent movement
on the issue, noted a source at the National Petroleum Refiners
Association (NPRA).  "There was a meeting but it was nothing more than
a formality," said the source.  "We had discussions with EPA that the
cost and the effectiveness of a NOx control strategy has not been
properly analyzed."
      While no studies on this issue have been performed recently,
"work was done earlier in conjunction with the RFG regulations and
other work on sulfur issues," said the NPRA source.

Oxygenate Sources Call the Change A "Mistake"

      "We are concerned about any of these changes to RFG
specifications," said Douglas Durante, executive director, Clean Fuels
Development Coalition.  "To suspend NOx reduction or any other
requirement without indisputable data and a consensus of stakeholders
would be a mistake," he said.
      While agreeing that fuel science is constantly evolving, Durante
showed concern over proposed changes to RFG specifications every time
new data appears.  "There needs to be a better process for dealing
with changing data," he said.
      "At this time API is not looking for any other changes in the
Phase II RFG regulations," said Kelley.

GOVERNORS' ETHANOL COALITION SUPPORTS RFG IN ATTAINMENT AREAS

      Even as the U.S. EPA is on the verge of finalizing its rule on
RFG opt-outs, the Governors' Ethanol Coalition (GEC) is adding its
support to the growing list of those urging the agency to allow ozone
attainment areas to join the federal program.
      "Allowing ozone attainment areas to participate in the RFG
program at the request of a state governor will provide states with
another strategy with which to combat air pollution and achieve Clean
Air Act goals," wrote Govs. Ben Nelson (D-NE), Tommy Thompson (R-WI)
and Mel Carnahan (D-MO) in a Dec. 15 letter to EPA Administrator Carol
Browner.
      Allowing attainment areas to opt-in to the program is
appropriate for several reasons, according the governors:

* RFG has made a measurable contribution to air pollution control, is   
highly cost-effective and safe;
* Participation in the program may help areas in attainment avoid   
slipping into nonattainment;
* RFG would assist downwind areas to reach attainment through reduced
pollution transport; and
* Once in nonattainment, control measures required in an area would
limit industrial expansions and consumer freedom.
      "While the Clean Air Act establishes a number of mandatory
control strategies, the Act still demonstrates a clear commitment to
allowing states the flexibility to determine the appropriate mix of
measures needed to meet air quality goals," wrote the governors. 
"Voluntary participation by attainment areas in the reformulated
gasoline program is just such a measure."

THIRD QUARTER MTBE, METHANOL PRODUCTION OUTPACED 1994 RATES

      Production of both methanol and MTBE in the third quarter
outpaced the same period in 1995, says the International Trade
Commission's (ITC) Preliminary Report on U.S. Production of Selected
Synthetic Organic Chemicals.
      MTBE far outpaced increases of other key octane boosters,
growing 273,884 metric tons, or 9.46%, from third quarter 1994 rates
to 3.169 million metric tons.
      During the same period, methanol production also inched up,
rising 60,955 metric tons, or 1.69%, to 3.667 million metric tons.
      Benzene, which is limited to 1.0 vol% in RFG, fell 95.066
million liters, or 17.84% from the same time last year to 5.738
billion liters in the third quarter.  However, production of the two
other major aromatics used in gasoline blending -- toluene and
xylene -- made year-to-year gains on the strength of petrochemical
demand.  Toluene production advanced 1.21%, or 21.014 million liters,
while xylene production rose 9.23%, or 313.383 million liters.

      While E-95 surpasses premium gasoline in reducing carbon
monoxide, hydrocarbon and oxygen emissions, carbon dioxide emissions
are slightly increased, reveals a newly released study from Mankato
State University (MSU) in Minnesota.  
      The study compared the fuel efficiency, tailpipe emissions, fuel
economy, horsepower and drivability of E-95 (a blend of 95% ethanol
and 5% unleaded gasoline) to that of conventional premium unleaded
gasoline in a 2.5-liter, four-cylinder General Motors engine.
      Test results show significant reductions in tailpipe emissions,
as well as increases in fuel efficiency and horsepower with E-95 fuel,
researchers said.  However, the test vehicle's fuel economy decreased
with E-95 due to the lower energy density of ethanol.
      The study, which primarily involved laboratory testing for
horsepower and emissions, also included some road testing,
particularly for fuel economy.  It ran from January 1994 through June
1995, according to Fred Kuzel, director of the Great Lakes Regional
Biomass Energy Program, which supplied funding for the study.
Additional funding was received from MSU and the Minnesota Corn
Processors Association. 
      The vehicle used in the study was one of several test vehicles
designed and built by senior automotive engineering students at MSU. 
The fuel and ignition systems of a Recycled Automotive Design vehicle,
developed by MSU students in 1991, were modified to run on the
alternative fuels.
      For information about the study, call Associate Professor Bruce
Jones, MSU College of Science, Engineering and Technology, at (507)

PITTSBURGH COMES CLEAN BY JOINING DOE PROGRAM

      Pittsburgh has become the latest addition to the U.S. Department
of Energy's Clean Cities program, marking the second designation for
Pennsylvania.  Philadelphia earned designation in 1993.  Pittsburgh's
addition brings the program's year-end total to 43 Clean Cities
nationwide.
      Pittsburgh has more than 650 compressed natural gas (CNG)
vehicles fueling at 23 public stations in the area.  The stakeholders
involved in planning Pittsburgh's Clean Cities program expect to add
another 1,650 alternative fuel vehicles -- mostly CNG, with some
electric -- by the year 2000.  They also plan to add 40 fueling
stations.
      The program will get local support from the University of
Pittsburgh, with its Natural Gas Vehicle Technology Assistance
Program, to research the operation of NGVs.  The $1.13 million program
is being funded through Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
Improvement grants, Pennsylvania's Alternative Fuels Incentive Grant
Program, and Equitable Gas.

AGENCY EXPLORING WAYS TO CONTINUE FEDERAL FLEET PROGRAM

      While Congress struggles to pass a 1996 fiscal year budget,
others are looking for ways to ensure the federal government continues
adding alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) to its fleet despite budget
cutbacks.  
      Since the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) established federal fleet
AFV requirements in 1992, much of the incremental costs have been paid
for by the U.S. Department of Energy.  This year Congress nixed DOE's
$20 million request for 1996 after rescinding funds in 1995.
      Without DOE funding, many doubt that federal agencies will
purchase AFVs in substantial numbers.  So DOE proposed an executive
order requiring that agencies meet EPACT's AFV mandate by paying for
it themselves.  The requirement stipulates that AFVs comprise 25% of
1996 federal fleet purchases, an estimated 12,500 vehicles.  The
proposed executive order has been supported by the natural gas and
electric vehicle industries, which have expressed concerned that EPACT
rule delays and Congressional funding rescissions are sending the
message that AFV program support is waning.
      The proposed executive order, which is expected to be reviewed
by the White House as early as next week, would also require that each
alternative fuel comprise at least 10% of the federal fleet's annual
AFV purchases, depending on commercial availability of fuels and
vehicles.
      So agencies with aggressive AFV programs would not be penalized,
the proposed executive order would direct the General Services
Administration to average the incremental costs across the entire
federal fleet.

ASSOCIATION CHARTS EV RECHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

      There are 888 non-residential electric vehicle charging outlets
across the United States, according to a survey released by the
Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA).  Of those, only
43 of the 219 charging locations are at public stations.  Most (72%)
are located in California, with Georgia having the second highest
concentration.
      Conductive charging sites account for about 90% of those
available.  Conductive charging utilizes a standard plug outlet with
metal-to-metal contact and will be used by Ford and Chrysler electric
vehicles.  General Motors announced it will produce its vehicles to be
charged inductively, which transfers power through a magnetic
connection with no direct contact.
      "This is an emerging transportation technology, and we are now
seeing only the very first commercial stages of vehicles and
chargers," said EVAA's executive director Robert Hayden.  The
association plans to release a site directory and will continue to
annually track infrastructure development.
      The EV industry is working to make greater inroads in charging
infrastructure.  The Electric Transportation Coalition's "EV Market
Launch" begins this year with workshops in 10 cities selected to
become "EV-Ready":  Los Angeles; Sacramento; Atlanta; Washington,
D.C.; Phoenix; New York City; Richmond; Boston; Detroit; and Ft.
Lauderdale.  The program will focus efforts in those areas to address
issues such as local, state and federal building codes, safety
training, fleet acquisition and charging availability.  The
coalition's goal is to place 5,000 new EVs on the road by 1997.

ENVIRONMENT CANADA TO EXPAND ECOLOGOtm PROGRAM FOR OXYGENATES

      Environment Canada is reviewing the possible expansion of its
automotive fuels category beyond just ethanol to consider granting a
variety of oxygenates and alternative fuels EcoLogotm status, which
would likely boost their sales.
      The government is considering opening the status to more than
just ethanol, for possible inclusion of MTBE, ETBE, TAME, propane,
methane, natural gas and low-sulfur diesel.  The group will consider
all types of automotive fuels, including those intended for use in
modified spark-ignition engines, such as compressed natural gas and
propane, as well as modified compression ignition engines.  Additional
categories may be added later.
      The EcoLogo status, part of Canada's Environmental Choice
Programtm, signifies the government's endorsement of the fuel as
environmentally responsible.  The EcoLogo appears on wholesale and
retail packages, and the government provides incentives to fleet
owners who use the recognized fuel.  Ethanol is the first and only
fuel granted EcoLogo status, but a routinely scheduled review is now
also underway to determine if it will retain its status.  The program
is revised every three years.
      "It's pretty safe to assume that ethanol will remain in the
program," said Kevin Gallagher, Marketing and Customer Relations for
TerraChoice Environmental Services, Inc., administrators of the
Environmental Choice Program.  "In fact, it's just beginning to take
off in Canada."  One company he cited has enjoyed 20% sales increases
in the last year and a half, since it was granted the status. 
      Preliminary testing conducted on ethanol reveals it comes close
to meeting the tentative draft standards.  A final determination is
expected by June 1996.  Ethanol blends of 5% or higher qualify for the
EcoLogo label at this time.  Canadians use 35 billion liters of
gasoline annually.
      To earn the status, Environment Canada will review currently
available life cycle information to determine if the fuel reduces
toxic emissions, global-warming substances and tropospheric ozone or
smog.  The fuels will be compared with an established matrix, and
scored for each of its stages against pollutant standards.  However,
the fuels won't be compared with each other, Gallagher explained.

MAJORS TURN TO JOINT VENTURES, ALLIANCES TO FINANCE OVERSEAS
DEVELOPMENT

      Major oil companies are emphasizing joint ventures and alliances
as they move to develop overseas projects. Leading U.S. producers have
worked with foreign entities since oil first was discovered outside
the United States. But the new agreements include financing by non-
U.S. participants that effectively makes them fuller partners as the
world oil industry continues to evolve.
   The most recent agreements include a $210 million investment by
Korea Petroleum Development Corp. (PEDCO) in exchange for a 15% stake
in Texaco Inc.'s Captain field in the British North Sea, and a multi-
faceted alliance between Chevron Corp. and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.
subsidiary Maraven S.A. to develop the Boscan field in Venezuela and
supply heavy crude to Chevron in the United States.
   Chevron's arrangement makes it the first publicly traded multi-
national oil firm since 1975 to be responsible for such a high level
of Venezuelan production. It expects to spend $2 billion over a 20-to-
30-year period in the heavy oil field. The San Francisco-based company
will be responsible for Boscan operations and production (which it
plans to increase from 80,000 barrels per day to 150,000 b/d over the
next three years), while Maraven will handle marketing.
   The alliance, which covers an initial 20-year term with a 10-year
extension option, will make Maraven Chevron's joint venture partner in
a West Coast asphalt business, the Chevron Ven Asphalt Alliance.
"Boscan crude, with an API gravity of 10 degrees, is an excellent
asphalt feedstock," notes Dave O'Reilly, president of subsidiary
Chevron USA Products Co. Maraven also will supply crude to Chevron's
refinery at Pascagoula, Miss., and its asphalt plants at Perth Amboy,
N.J.; Portland, Ore., and Richmond Beach, Wash.
   Texaco, which previously owned 100% of the Captain field, will
continue to be its operator. It expects 60,000 b/d of initial
production, beginning in 1996's fourth quarter. Since a portion of the
project's expenditures will be lease-financed, PEDCO will assume a 15%
obligation for the financing. The companies expect to complete their
transaction during 1996's first quarter.
   "In addition to acquiring an investment partner with this alliance,
Texaco gains an important business relationship with PEDCO -- one that
will provide access to market opportunities in the Far East and in
other potential project developments," maintains York LeCorgne,
managing director of exploration and production at affiliate Texaco
U.K. Ltd. "The formation of strategic alliances is an important
element in Texaco's plan for growth and allows the company to expand
its core oil and gas activities worldwide."

BROCK'S MERGER INTO KEY MAY BE FIRST OF MANY AMONG SMALL INDEPENDENTS

   By Wall Street's standards, Key Production Co. Inc.'s approximately
$13 million all-stock acquisition of Brock Exploration Corp. is
relatively minor. But it could signal a consolidation among smaller
publicly traded independent producers every bit as intense as the
sales of domestic production properties and formation of joint
ventures by major oil companies, a leading oil analyst contends.
   "It could take place across the board. People who had good years in
1992 and 1993 following 10 years of the natural gas `bubble' are
beginning to say, `Never again!' after several warm winters," says
Joseph Culp of A.G. Edwards and Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Just as the
majors are amalgamating their domestic assets, the smaller producers
are doing the same thing, only with stock because they don't have as
much financial leverage." Key Production and Brock will structure
their merger as a tax-free exchange, with Brock shareholders receiving
one Key common share for every 1.45 Brock share. Key also intends to
open a regional office in New Orleans that will be staffed by several
employees who previously worked for Brock.
   Brock Exploration's sale has been expected since the New Orleans
independent producer issued its 1994 annual report with a front cover
featuring Lawrence E. Brock, the chairman and founder, posing with his
wife, Lorena, who was corporate secretary, standing on a Gulf of
Mexico beach alongside the words, "We toiled for 28 years! We left our
tracks! It's time to go! Adios, Amigos!" Brock is in his early 80s.
His wife is about 10 years younger.
   What took some observers by surprise was Denver-based Key
Production's role of purchaser. "It obviously brings it onto the Gulf
Coast. But it's a big move for Key beyond its Rocky Mountain and
California bases that I frankly didn't expect because I haven't
followed the company that closely," says one analyst who asked not to
be named.
   Culp, who does track Key, says that the deal makes perfect sense.
"It apparently is a combination of someone who probably said, `My
better days in the oil business are behind me,' with someone else who
said, `I'll let you ride a little bit on my coattails, but I also want
to diversify my assets,'" he tells Petroleum Finance Week. "Key has
been a financially sound company all along that's been able to acquire
properties and then aggressively exploit them. Apparently, it was able
to strike an all-stock deal based on its record of being able to do
something positive with its assets. It's going to be able to pay for
this because its recent acquisitions in California are beginning to
bear fruit."
   Key Chairman Francis H. "Mick" Merelli and Brock say that they
believe the combined companies will be more efficient and stronger
than either one was by itself. The merger has to be approved by both
companies' shareholders, who will vote on the proposal at special
meetings in February. Key intends to file the necessary registration
covering the new shares it intends to issue with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as soon as possible. The companies expect the
combination to be complete this spring.
   Culp considers Key a relative sleeper among small independents and
Merelli "a well-respected guy who walks in the circles of the large
independents. He can get an audience and do deals that surprise some
people. But he has always been very good at being conservative and not
taking big drilling risks. He also has made some good strategic
acquisitions. The company tends to hide its light under a bushel,
preferring to let its actions speak louder than its words. If people
understood the kind of value it offered, it would have a much higher
share price."

NORAM ENERGY COMPLETES TWO BANK CREDIT FACILITIES TOTALING $550
MILLION

   NorAm Energy Corp. completed two bank credit facilities totaling
$550 million with a group of 22 banks. The facilities are a $150
million term loan and an amended $400 million revolving credit, which
will allow NorAm to release two pipeline subsidiaries that it
previously provided the banks as security and provide the integrated
natural gas company financing at a lower price and with reduced
borrowing fees. CitiBank was agent for both facilities. Bank of
Montreal and NationsBank of Texas were lead managers of the revolving
credit, the terms of which were extended to December 1998.
   The $150 million term loan is a five-year facility, which will
generate proceeds for NorAm to redeem $150 million of 8% notes due
January 1997, which it called at par on Nov. 22, 1995, and redeemed on
Dec. 22. This facility, as well as the revolving credit, includes a
pricing grid where the facility and borrowing codes are reduced once
debt rating services Standard and Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors
Service upgrade specific assessments.
   "These two facilities were well received by the banking community,
with both being well over-subscribed," notes NorAm Chief Financial
Officer Michael B. Bracy. "The improved terms in the revolving credit
reflect NorAm Energy's continuing improvement in credit quality,
reflected by debt reduction and improved results from operations. The
release of the security previously provided by [pipeline subsidiaries
NorAm Gas Transmission Co. and Mississippi River Transportation Corp.]
to the banks is another step toward management's goal of returning
NorAm Energy to an investment grade."

AMOCO, UNOCAL EMPHASIZE OVERSEAS PROJECTS IN 1996 E&P SPENDING PLANS

      -- Pennzoil's '96 Outlays Will Slightly Exceed 1995 Level --
   Continuing a well-established trend among major U.S. oil companies,
Amoco Corp. and Unocal Corp. each emphasized overseas exploration and
production prospects as they announced capital spending plans for
1996.
   Chicago-based Amoco announced a capital spending and exploration
budget of $4.7 billion, a 12% increase from the $4.2 billion approved
for 1995. The rise follows an increase last year of 31% from 1994's
$3.2 billion, "a pattern of strong re-investment" that compares with
average annual spending of $3.4 billion during the 1990-94 period.
   "The continued growth in our spending is a clear indication of the
success of our 1994 restructuring," Amoco Chairman H. Laurance Fuller
says. "That restructuring has allowed us to reduce costs, accelerate
decision-making and empower our business groups to more quickly bring
forward projects that we believe will provide profitable growth. In
fact, additional funds above the $4.7 billion level could be made
available to take advantage of other opportunities. For example, we
currently are negotiating the purchase of Albemarle Corp.'s olefins
derivatives business, the cost of which is not included in this
budget."
   Of the $2.8 billion that Amoco has budgeted for 1996 exploration
and production outlays (about 60% of the total), overseas projects
account for $1.4 billion, up from $1.15 billion of the nearly $2.68
billion E&P total in 1995. Significant projects include construction
of a liquefied natural gas plant in Trinidad and a program of highly
focused exploratory drilling. Startup of crude oil and natural gas
production in China and gas production in China and continuation of
Egyptian and North Sea programs also are included. U.S. E&P spending
will fall to an even $1 billion from nearly $1.08 billion in 1995,
while outlays in Canada will decline by $50 million, year-to-year, to
$400 million in 1996.
   The company expects to spend $525 million for refining and
marketing improvements ($450 million in the United States and $75
million overseas), principally to upgrade gasoline marketing
operations. In 1995, it spent $600 million downstream ($575 million in
the United States and $25 million overseas).
   Amoco has budgeted $1.25 billion in chemical outlays for 1996, $875
million of which is planned for the United States and $375 million
slated for overseas, where new facilities or expansions are under way
in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Belgium. In 1995, its chemical
spending totaled $900 million, with $575 million spent in the United
States and $325 million spent overseas.

With Downstream Outlays Essentially Complete, Unocal Turns its
Attention Upstream...

   Unocal budgeted $920 million, or 68% of its forecast $1.25 billion
capital spending total, for exploration and production, a 10.8%
increase from the $830 million it spent on E&P in 1995. The 1996 total
is slightly below the estimated $1.4 billion that Unocal spent overall
last year. "We have significantly reduce the capital allocated to our
downstream segment now that we've completed the refinery modifications
to manufacture California-mandated reformulated gasoline," Unocal
Chairman Roger C. Beach says. "This frees capital for new projects in
Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia, as well
as the oil project in Azerbaijan that will create significant value
for the company."
   Approximately $530 million of the $920 million budgeted for E&P is
earmarked for overseas oil and gas activities, up 43% from an
estimated $370 million in foreign upstream outlays during 1995.
Domestic E&P spending is budgeted at $390 million this year, down from
$460 million in 1995. Some 64% of the U.S. upstream budget is slated
for development of key natural gas projects in Louisiana and the Gulf
of Mexico.
   Unocal earmarked another $240 million for worldwide exploration,
$170 million, or 71%, of which will be spent for projects near
existing operations that the company believes have a high potential
for success.
   Planned expenditures for Unocal's 76 Products Co. division, which
encompasses its West Coast refining and marketing holdings, are $230
million for 1996, a 41% drop from 1995's $390 million. About $100
million is designated for marketing, principally the addition of quick
service restaurants, convenience stores, car washes and other new
profit centers to existing retail sites. Another $90 million is
planned for Unocal's California refineries on projects to enhance
profitability and meet environmental regulations.
   Spending for geothermal and power projects are expected to nearly
double to $110 million in 1996 and focus on projects in Indonesia.
Diversified businesses (agricultural products, carbon and minerals
operations, pipelines and real estate development) will receive $50
million, a 29% drop from 1995's $70 million when Unocal started up an
ammonia and urea manufacturing plant in Finley, Wash.
   Another integrated U.S. oil firm, Pennzoil Co., announced a 1996
capital budget totaling $474 million, up from the approximately $472
million that it expects to spend in 1995. The Houston company will
spend $233 million on oil and gas exploration, $214 million on motor
oil and refined products operations and $27 million on franchises and
other operations. The company also announced that it has hedged a
substantial portion of its 1996 oil and gas production as part of a
risk management program that it established in 1994.

TENNECO, QUESTAR CANCEL KERN RIVER DEAL AFTER UNFAVORABLE FTC RULING

   Citing the potential concentration of market power for Questar
Pipeline Co. in the Salt Lake City area, the Federal Trade Commission
voted against allowing Tenneco Energy Co., a subsidiary of Tenneco
Inc., to sell its 50% interest in the Kern River natural gas
transmission system to the pipeline division of Salt Lake-based
Questar Corp.. The companies agreed last week not to legally challenge
the ruling and terminated the $225 million cash deal that was
announced Sept. 8.
   The transaction would have been the largest in Questar's history,
dwarfing its $94.5 million purchase in April 1994 of exploration and
production assets formerly held by Amax Oil and Gas Co. from Union
Pacific Resources Co.. "We really wanted this deal. But the FTC
apparently doesn't understand how the restructured natural gas
industry works and how difficult it has become for a pipeline to
dominate a market," a Questar spokesman tells Petroleum Finance Week.
"It has sent a signal that we intend to aggressively grow and will
pursue other opportunities. But the growth won't be with Kern River."
   The 904-mile pipeline runs from Opal, in southwestern Wyoming, to
Bakersfield, Calif. It delivers 700 million cubic feet of gas per day
to customers that include local distribution companies, direct end-
users, electricity cogenerators and enhanced oil recovery systems.
Tulsa-based Williams Companies Inc. owns the remaining half interest
in Kern River.
   "We are disappointed with the Federal Trade Commission's ruling and
don't agree with it," says Tenneco Energy Chairman Steve Chesebro'.
"However, during the bidding process, we received a high level of
interest from several qualified bidders. We plan to reopen contact
with these parties in the next few days, with the goal of competing
the sale in a timely manner."

LYONDELL PETROCHEMICAL ADOPTS POISON PILL THAT PARTIALLY EXCLUDES ARCO

   Lyondell Petrochemical Co. adopted a 10-year shareholder rights
plan, effective Dec. 20, 1995, that its directors say is designed to
protect shareholders in the event of a proposed change of control at
the Houston petrochemical producer and petroleum refiner. Like other
so-called "poison pills," the plan would be implemented with
distribution of common stock purchase rights as a dividend if a person
or group acquires 15% or more of Lyondell's outstanding common shares,
or if a tender or exchange offer is commenced that would have that
effect. The plan provides an exception for Atlantic Richfield Co.,
which currently holds 49.9% of Lyondell's stock. But it could be
activated if Arco decided to accumulate additional shares.

WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT DEREGULATED ELECTRIC UTILITY COMPETITION? NOT
ATMOS

   The prevailing sentiment is that natural gas demand will suffer
initially because the electric industry, once it is decontrolled, will
be so much more competitive. "For a low-cost, efficient provider like
Atmos Energy Corp., competition brings more opportunity than concern,"
declared Robert F. Stephens, president and chief operating officer of
the Dallas-based, multi-state natural gas utility holding company.
   "We're old hands at competition in the industrial market,
particularly in our Kentucky service area, where 59% of our throughput
is to large-volume customers," he said during a recent Atmos
presentation to the New York Society of Security Analysts. "We're also
accustomed to competition at the retail level from other energy
sources, and compete for customers against some very low-cost electric
utilities."
   The company has stayed ahead of other natural gas distributors in
making sure its operations are streamlined and efficient. Stephens
said that it has 400 customers per employee, compared to an industry
average of 380. Its operating expenses are among the industry's
lowest. And its plant investment per meter is below the industry's
average.
   Atmos also reduced its already low average cost of gas per thousand
cubic feet during fiscal 1995 (ending Sept. 30) to $2.46 because its
market-sensitive contracts let customers benefit from lower wellhead
prices while keeping the company competitive. "By operating
efficiently to keep its gas price low, looking for ways to trim gas
costs and providing a valuable resource to its customers to reduce
their total energy bills, Atmos has achieved a record of success in
competitive markets," said Stephens.
   James F. Purser, Atmos' executive vice president and chief
financial officer, pointed out that the company achieved a 12.3%
return on average shareholder equity during fiscal 1995 from earnings
that rose 28.6% (despite weather in its utilities' Texas, Colorado,
Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana and Kentucky service areas that was 10.3%
warmer than normal) to $18.9 million, or $1.22 per share from fiscal
1994's $14.7 million, or 97 cents per share.
   Cash flow per share increased 40% in fiscal 1995 to $3.02 from
fiscal 1994's $2.46, with the help of rate increases totaling $2.8
million during fiscal 1995. Atmos has established an ambitious
building program for fiscal 1996, including a second Colorado gas
processing plant and gathering system upgrades in Colorado and Kansas.
But the company is holding to a debt-to-equity ratio target between
40% and 60%, Purser indicated. "Regulators, obviously, have an impact
on that, although it has not been a bone of contention in any of our
rate cases where we have explained our capital structure," he said.
   Atmos' wide-spread gas utility operations make it distinctive among
local distribution companies -- and frequently mentioned as a
purchaser when it comes to acquisitions. "Looking at acquisitions is a
regular ongoing activity for our company," Stephens confirmed. "We
have enough experience that, generally, if someone is considering
selling a piece of property, we're generally invited to look at it."
   Most government regulators are hesitant to allow recovery from a
utility's acquisitions that are above book rate. Atmos supports this
idea, but adds that there are occasional instances where an
acquisition above book value should be allowed because it would be in
the public interest. "The kind of regulation that's present and the
kind of economy that a prospective addition operates in determines how
much we're willing to pay," said Stephens. "But our interest is piqued
if something different is offered."
   Atmos does not set a limit on the size of a deal because that would
limit its opportunities. "There are lenders who will finance $200
million if a deal offers very favorable returns," said Stephens. He
conceded that earnings dilution is almost inevitable following
acquisitions. But he also emphasized that Atmos' purchases have not
diluted payouts to shareholders permanently, "and we plan to make
certain that it won't happen."
   He said that Atmos is aware that several primarily electric
utilities are thinking of divesting their gas holdings. "We're finding
that an equal number, if not more, tend to view their service role as
energy products and are quite happy to have gas as a part of their
companies. I do expect several to shift more of their operations into
separate components, and that could provide more opportunity for a
company like ours," said Stephens.
   Asked if Atmos might consider acquiring electric assets, he
promptly replied, "We certainly would. We realize the reality of the
situation with electric companies' balance sheets and their higher
investment per customer. That would make an acquisition very difficult
financially for any gas company. But we would be interested if we
found a deal that makes financial sense."

DUFF AND PHELPS, FITCH TAKE POSITIVE VIEWS TOWARD ENRON FOR DIFFERENT
REASONS

   Duff and Phelps Credit Rating Co. and Fitch Investors Service took
a positive view toward Enron Corp. in separate ratings actions. Fitch
sees an improving credit trend for the Houston integrated natural gas
company because it is structuring its businesses to compete on a
vertically-integrated basis worldwide in all of its operating
segments. DCR applauds Enron's sale of more than 25% of Enron Oil and
Gas Co. because Enron will use the approximately $690 million of
proceeds to reduce its short-term debt. But the ratings service also
cites uncertainty regarding the final outcome of the Dabhol power
project in India and resolution of a dispute over the J-block natural
gas contract. The Enron Oil and Gas stock sale involved two separate
transactions: the direct sale of more than 31 million shares and the
sale of 10 million 6.5% interchangeable notes, which DCR and Fitch
rate Triple B-Plus, with mandatory common share conversion provisions.
DCR also affirmed its Triple B-Plus ratings of Enron's senior notes, a
Triple B assessment its senior subordinated debt and a Triple B-Minus
rating of its convertible preferred.
   Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Corp. affirmed
their assessments of Talisman Energy Inc.'s senior debt following
Talisman's announcement that it will acquire Goal Petroleum Plc. (LSE)
for C$315 million in a debt-financed transaction. S&P, which assesses
Talisman's debt Triple B-Plus, sees a stable outlook for the company
because the purchase is consistent with Talisman's operating strategy
and will reduce its dependence on North American natural gas markets.
But Moody's, which rates the issue "Baa1", changed its outlook for the
Calgary independent oil and gas producer's credit to negative from
stable. Goal is a British independent producer active in the British
North Sea, and its acquisition is consistent with Talisman's goal to
increase its reserves outside Canada. Proved reserves, which total
approximately 45 million barrels of oil equivalent, are primarily
crude oil and include a 32% interest in the Blenheim field. Moody's is
concerned over the deal's size, the fact that it is being financed
with debt and the continuing impact of low gas prices.
   Moody's affirmed its "b1" rating of Tejas Gas Corp.'s preferred
stock while Standard and Poor's Corp. raised its assessment of the
Houston gas gathering, transmission and marketing company's issue to
Double B-Minus. Moody's also assigned a "Ba1" rating to the $455
million revolving credit facility of the Tejas Acadian Holding unit,
citing the parent company's relatively stable results, sensitivity of
earnings to gas prices and resulting pressures on margins from intense
competition in Gulf Coast markets. Both ratings services favorably
view opportunities from Coral Energy Resources, a gas marketing joint
venture in which Tejas has a one-third interest and Shell Oil Co.
holds a two-thirds stake. Coral, which began to operate in November,
is expected to assure higher volumes for Tejas' transmission system
and to expand its marketing capabilities.
   S&P placed a Single B-Minus rating on KCS Energy's $150 million of
senior unsecured notes, with a Single B corporate rating and a
positive credit outlook. S&P considers KCS "a small independent
exploration and production company with an aggressive financial
profile and above-average finding costs." Its positive outlook assumes
a favorable outcome for a gas contract dispute and moderate Rocky
Mountain drilling successes leading to improvements in finding and
development costs that are higher than average.
   In its first assessment of Public Service Co. of North Carolina,
Moody's assigned a preliminary "A2" rating to the Gastonia, N.C.,
natural gas utility's $125 million shelf registration for senior
unsecured debt. The assessment reflects PSNC's strong and relatively
stable earnings and cash flow, management's commitment to maintain a
conservative balance sheet and the absence of non-gas-related
subsidiaries. The rating also considers the company's small size
relative to other publicly traded gas utilities, its relatively high
average dividend payout ratio and the short-term nature of its
committed bank facilities.

IRAN STILL CONSIDERING ITS OPTIONS ON SHAKH DENIZ ROLE

(London)
Iran is still considering participating in Azerbaijan's Shakh Deniz oil and
gas project in the Caspian Sea, a senior Iranian oil official said last
week.
Mehdi Hosseini, the National Iranian Oil Co's exploration director, said in
a telephone interview from Tehran that Iran was still considering
Azerbaijan's invitation to join the project through an equity transfer from
state oil company Socar.
   Hosseini said the National Iranian Oil Co was "still looking at the
viability" of the project and that further exchanges of information with
Socar would be necessary. He said Socar had not imposed a deadline for
Iran's response to the long-standing invitation.
   Azerbaijan is anxious to compensate Iran for having been rejected as a
member of the consortium developing the offshore Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli
fields. Cash-strapped Socar plans to sell off part of its 40% stake in
Shakh Deniz, assigned in a preliminary agreement last summer with BP,
Statoil and Turkish TPAO which have a collective 60% equity. Negotiations
on a production- sharing agreement got underway late this year and will
resume in January 1996.
   Current thinking among the companies involved in Shakh Deniz is that
Iran could join the project, which currently has no US partners. But while
NIOC appears to be interested in Shakh Deniz, Iran's foreign ministry is
unwilling to endorse Iranian participation in an Azerbaijani offshore
project while the legal status of the Caspian remains unresolved, according
to analysts.
   Shakh Deniz's oil reserves are pegged at 1.2-1.4-bil bbl.
   Meanwhile, Hosseini said, French oil major Total will shortly begin
shooting seismic in the Sirri area offshore Iran. Hosseini said Total
already has begun a seabed survey using a vessel leased from NIOC. "Total
has started a seabed survey with this ship and will soon start seismic," he
said. "Drilling will be the next step," he added.
   Total in July signed a $600-mil contract to develop Iran's Sirri A and E
fields after Conoco of the US, which originally was awarded the contract,
was ordered by the US government to pull out of the deal.
   Total will be paid for its work with production from the project.
Hosseini said Total was working "in accordance with the time schedule."

UNOCAL SEEKS TO ADJUST THAI HOLDINGS
Wants to shift some stake to its partners

By:
Maya Webber

(Bangkok)
Unocal Thailand has asked its partners in several Gulf of Thailand contract
areas to increase their equity holdings, in a move to streamline gas price
negotiations by standardizing equity distribution in Unocal gas sales
contract areas I, II and III.
   Mitsui Oil Exploration Co currently controls 20% in Unocal I, 30% in
Unocal II, and 23.75% in Unocal III. If agreed to, the arrangement would
give Petroleum Authority of Thailand Exploration & Production Co a
first-time interest in Unocal I and II. PTTEP currently has a 5% interest
in Unocal II, but no interest in the other two contract areas.
   A Unocal spokesman in Thailand. said the negotiations do not reflect a
pullback by Unocal, which would remain the majority owner and operator of
the contract areas.
   "We were probing for a way to facilitate decision-making and cost
allocation among the three partners," said Konthi Kulachol, Unocal
Thailand's public relations manager, arguing that cost allocations can be
time-consuming and tedious.
   An increased interest by PTTEP could be attractive to Unocal in the
future. PTT, the monopoly operator of Thailand's natural gas pipelines,
retains a 70% interest in PTTEP.
   It makes sense to have "a close working relationship" with PTTEP, the
Unocal spokesman said.
   PTTEP officials said they have made no decisions about whether to invest
in Unocal I and II.
   Tevin Vongvanich, PTTEP vice-president for corporate planning and new
ventures, said that seeking to harmonize the equity holdings to reduce cost
allocation headaches is a good concept.
   Because the production potential of the areas is well proven, the
investment would involve little risk, he said. But that also means there
is limited added potential, he said. PTT's Natural Gas Business president
Prajya Phinyawat added that price would be a big factor in the decision to
take increased equity shares.
   Some of the fields are "quite old" and might start to decline, he said.
   Unocal Thailand's production from its offshore fields averaged 705,000
Mcf/d for the first nine months of 1995. Production is expected rise to
900,000-950,000 Mcf/d when a second pipeline to Rayong comes into service
next year. The company's investment in natural gas development in the gulf
represents the company's largest commitment for a single project. In
addition to Unocal I,II, and III, the company is also developing block
B12/27, the Pailin field.

AMOCO CANADA WILL SELL REMAINING CRESTAR STAKE

(Calgary)
Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Ltd said it intends to sell its remaining 15%
stake in Crestar Energy Inc to fulfill a pledge to the federal government
following its C$5.2-bil takeover of Dome Petroleum Ltd in 1988.
   Calgary-based Amoco Canada said it has appointed RBC Dominion Securities
Inc as its agent to oversee block trades in Crestar.
   The planned transaction is valued at about C$134-mil ($98.4-mil) based
on Crestar's closing price Dec 28 of C$19.12 ($14.04) a share on the
Toronto Stock Exchange.
   Amoco Canada had promised to make certain assets available to Canadian
investors in the wake of its Dome acquisition. In 1993, the federal
government's screening agency for foreign investment allowed Amoco Canada
to spin off those assets to create Crestar.
   No date has been set to begin selling the 7-mil Crestar shares owned by
Amoco Canada, but the sale could start as early as Jan 4 under TSE
policies.
   Industry analysts have speculated that any proceeds from the Crestar
sale could be used by Amoco Canada to launch a significant takeover in
1996. Three months ago, Calgary-based Anderson Exploration Ltd's share
swap valued at C$800-mil beat out Amoco Canada's C$757-mil cash bid for
Home Oil Co Ltd
   Crestar is considered a promising player in Canada's oil patch. It
acquired Ranchmen's Resources Ltd. in a C$177.5-mil (C$130.4- mil) hostile
takeover effective Oct. 1.

NEB BACKING TCPL DEAL

(Calgary)
The National Energy Board has endorsed a historic four-year deal on
domestic and export natural gas transportation tolls negotiated by
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Canada's natural gas industry.
   The new tolls are designed to save millions of dollars a year in
transportation costs (ON 12/22).
   The incentive regulation agreement between the gas line operator and
shippers has been lauded as a watershed for new ways to cut the massive
costs of delivering most of Canada's gas to domestic and US markets.
   Normally, tolls are decided by the NEB, rather than between suppliers
and pipeline operators, said NEB secretary Scott Richardson. Final
endorsement of interim tolls that reflect the pipeline's terms of service
will be considered at a January hearing, Richardson said.
   Under the agreement--the first in North America signed with a pipeline
operator--when TransCanada saves C$1 in costs, the benefit will be split
50-50 between the Calgary-based pipeline and shippers.

VIETNAM TO CUT ITS TARIFFS

(Hanoi)
The country will cut the import tariff for petrol from 70% to 55% beginning
Jan 1, following a request from the the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations that all tariffs be brought under 60%, an official at the tax
department at the Ministry of Trade said. Vietnam imports all its products.
Tariffs on diesel will remain at 25% and for jet fuel at 10%, the official
said. The country is cutting tariffs on 857 goods or commodities from the
six members of ASEAN, the first step toward membership in the ASEAN Free
Trade Area, which Vietnam will join fully in 1996.

MARCUS HOOK SHUTDOWN DELAYED, AS THREE-WAY LABOR TALKS CONTINUING

(New York)
BP has pushed back into January the possible shutdown of the Marcus Hook,
Pennsylvania refinery, allowing more time for the union there to reach a
new contract with Tosco, which is buying BP's US Northeast refining and
marketing assets.
   BP had said it would begin to suspend operations at the 190,000 b/d
Marcus Hook plant at the start of January if it was unable to close the
deal with Tosco by the end of 1995. And BP had wanted Tosco to have a new
contract in place with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union at the
refinery before closing its deal with Tosco.
   BP now has delayed the potential shutdown until the middle of January, a
company spokesman said Dec 29. However, a union official said BP has
indicated in talks with OCAW that it would push back the suspension until
the end of the month. The BP spokeswoman had not comment on the union
official's statement. BP's current contract with the OCAW expires Jan 31.
   BP has extended the shutdown deadline to allow more time for the
company, as well as Tosco, to negotiate with the OCAW, the BP spokeswoman
said. BP still must settle severance issues with the union, while Tosco
must negotiate a new contract. The spokeswoman said severe winter weather
in the Philadelphia area has delayed negotiations. She also said BP is
encouraged by the meetings that began last week between Tosco and the OCAW.
A bargaining session was held Dec 29 between OCAW and Tosco, which wants to
cut refinery staff by 25% and runs by 20%. The BP spokeswoman said BP
still wants to close the Tosco sale as soon as possible. Should the company
suspend operations in January, it's likely that the sale to Tosco would
close in February, she said.

ELECTRICITY, TAXES TO BE STATES' '96 FOCUS
Power restructuring will be felt in the field

By:
William Mullins

(Houston)
The continuing shift in electricity markets in the US looms as a major
issue that oil industry officials will be watching at the state level in
1996, according to a survey of oil and gas officials in several key
states.
   An overview of some of the leading state issues facing the industry this
year indicates that on the state level, the oil industry as electricity
consumer, rather than as provider of a generating fuel, has risen to the
top of the list of concerns in several states.
   Ironically, the second-biggest state in terms of oil production--
Texas--will not have a legislative session this year, so no issues will be
decided there.
   What follows is a state-by-state survey of some of the leading issues
that will be taken up by legislatures this year.
CALIFORNIA: The ongoing restructuring of electricity markets in the state
is an important issue to oil producers because they have a constant base
load demand and use a lot of electricity, said California Independent
Petroleum Assn president Dan Kramer.
   "So, as a group we'll be fighting potentially having to pay excessive
stranded costs, basically paying for utilities' bad investments in nuclear
power and some other more expensive forms of power that would be embedded
in our electricity rates," Kramer said. "We'll be fighting that issue along
with trying to lower electricity rates for our producers in general."
   Electricity bills in California, depending on where a company is
located, are 25% to 50% higher than in any other state, he said.
   Oil companies have formed a group called Oil Producers Electric Project,
and are working on a legislative solution to the problem.
   As for other issues in the nation's largest state, California doesn't
have a severance tax on oil production, and some of the more liberal
legislators probably will introduce a severance tax bill on the grounds
that other large producing states have such a tax, Kramer said. But oil
producers will be opposing it, Kramer said, basing its opposition in part
on the argument that California already has the highest property taxes on
oil production of any state that imposes such levies.
   The industry also will try again to reform the California endangered
species act, which is more stringent than the federal law, he said. A bill
almost was passed at the end of the last session but it failed because of
disagreements on a few issues, Kramer said.
   Still another industry goal is to repeal a portion of state fish and
game laws that allow the California Dept of Fish & Game, in conjunction
with local district attorneys, city attorneys and environmental groups, to
levy bounty hunter fines on producers with accidental spills, he said.
These are small accidental spills that can be less than one barrel, but
carry fines of up to $25,000 per day. Kramer said they have been levied on
a producer, even if it cleans up the spill.
   "We'll also attempt to coordinate oil spill response," he said. "In
California, when you have an oil spill, depending on where you're at, you
can have up to 15 or 16 different agencies involved in the spill and
they're all trying to assert their jurisdictional authority."
LOUISIANA: The legislature will be holding a session on fiscal matters
only, but the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Assn thinks one issue that
could come up is the idea of an oil and gas processing tax designed to
raise revenue on the foreign oil imported into Louisiana, as well as the
offshore oil and gas coming into the state. Such a proposal has been
defeated previously and probably would be again, an association spokesman
noted.
OKLAHOMA: Oklahoma oil producers, like those in California, are hoping to
see the legislature enact some kind of electricity rate reform, said Mickey
Thompson, executive vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum
Assn.
   Oklahoma producers also will be fighting against two proposals that
would modify forced pooling arrangements, and allow higher damages to be
assessed in pollution cases, Thompson said.
   The forced pooling issue arises from a law allowing the state to step in
where there are multiple land owners on a tract, and an operator can't
reach negotiated settlements with all of them. The state can "force pool"
the properties in such circumstances.
   Royalty owners and producers are on opposite sides, with royalty owners
maintaining some operators are abusing the process by using it as a quick
way of putting together a tract without bothering to negotiate, according
to Jim Stafford, executive director of the National Assn of Royalty Owners.
"The poolings in Oklahoma in the last few years have gotten ridiculous in
terms of being vastly unfair in regards to fair market value, on lease
bonuses particularly," he said.
   Another factor is that royalty owners are concerned about a producer
acquiring multiple zones on a lease tract, but not drilling, testing and
producing all of them, Thompson said. This can occur when the producer
can't or doesn't want to produce from more than one zone and may later
produce the others, but some royalty owners would like to see a time frame
within which a producer had to produce the zones or lose his rights.
   Producers and royalty owners are having difficulty coming to an
agreement over the issue, Thompson said. So the situation may develop as it
did last year, when the royalty owners found a sponsor for their bill, but
couldn't prevail in voting on the measure.
   Another proposal supported by royalty owners and farm and ranch
organizations would change the Oklahoma law on how much damages courts can
award in pollution cases, Thompson said. The proposal follows a state
Supreme Court decision in 1994 that held a land owner could recover no more
than the total value of the land in a pollution case, although the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission still would be able to compel an operator to clean
up the pollution.
   The initial bill to negate the effect of the Supreme Court ruling
failed, but the oil industry expects a similar bill will be introduced in
next year's session, he said.
   Another issue which probably can't be handled in one session but which
the industry wants to pursue is the creation of a state oil and gas
department that would take over regulation from the Oklahoma Corporation
Commission, Thompson said.
KANSAS: A major tax shift bill that passed the House last year is in the
Senate tax committee now, said Donald Schnacke, executive vice president of
the Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Assn. The bill would shift about $600-mil
in annual school levies from overall property taxes to the sales and
individual income tax base.
   "We pay a significant property tax on oil leases, about $100-mil a
year," Schnacke said. "This bill, if it passed, would reduce our ad valorem
tax by about 50%. That would be a very significant improvement on our tax
situation. The governor is resisting this bill, but it's a very popular
bill and he may wind up having to veto it."
   There also is likely to be action on the issue of abandoned wells,
Schnacke said. The Kansas Corporation Commission has estimated there may be
as many as 91,000 such wells throughout the state, but they date from 1880
and regulation only started in 1935. "We're probably talking about using
dedicated severance tax money or something like that to help on the expense
of this well plugging," Schnake said.
COLORADO: The state's severance tax is likely to come up in the 1996
session of the Colorado legislature, according to the Rocky Mountain Oil &
Gas Assn. At present, 50% of the tax is allocated for local governments to
use in addressing impacts from mineral development, and the other 50% goes
into a state trust account.
   But an amendment is expected to be offered that would allow half the
state trust funds to be used for state agency projects directly related to
mineral development.
   Another proposal that the Colorado legislature is expected to consider
is a bill on retail wheeling, which would allow retail customers to freely
choose among different suppliers of electricity. The oil industry's
interest is both as a user of electricity and as a supplier of natural gas
to fire power plants.
NEW MEXICO: In a budget-only session, there might be a revival of a
proposal to impose a pipeline tax that would raise $10- or $15-mil for the
state, said D. Van De Graaff, executive vice president of the New Mexico
Oil & Gas Assn. The proposal previously passed the Senate, but was defeated
in the lower chamber.
OTHER STATES: The Idaho legislature will consider raising the state's motor
fuels tax 2-5 cts/gal to pay for road maintenance and construction, while
South Dakota will be looking at an increase of 3cts/gal dedicated to county
roads and bridges.
   Utah's legislature also is being urged by government agencies to
increase the state motor fuel tax to fund road work.

PETRODOLLARS

By:
Peter Zipf

Who would have thought that old war horses like Exxon, Mobil, Texaco and
the like could still put on such a strong finishing kick? The group of the
largest publicly traded oil majors ended 1995 with an impressive
performance in equity markets. In the last two months of 1995, a group of
14 large oil companies posted a stock- price gain of 11%, bettering the 5%
increase in the Standard & Poor's 500. Most of the majors clearly needed
this late run to the wire, since for much of the year they badly lagged the
stellar 34% gain posted by the S&P 500 for the full year. Even with the
late jump, the 14-member oil group's full-year gain was 24%.
   The oil group did have its stars for the full year, with Exxon (up 37%),
Mobil (+35%) and the smaller Kerr-McGee (+35%) managing to beat by a nose
the gain of the S&P 500. Also in this top-tier group, though trailing the
broader market by a length, were Royal Dutch/Shell (+30%), Texaco (+30%)
and BP (+29%). Further back in the pack in 1995 were Shell Transport &
Trading (+24%), Amoco (+22%), Chevron (+18%), Amerada Hess (+18%) and
Marathon (+17%). Trailing badly were Arco (+9%), Unocal (+7%) and Phillips
(+4%).
   To some industry analysts, the story of 1995 was this divergence in the
stock-price performance of the largest oil companies. Their conclusion: it
paid to be big and well-balanced internationally. As an example, Dean
Witter's Eugene Nowak cites Mobil, whose diversity allowed it to use
stronger margins in Singapore to offset weak refining margins for parts of
the year in the US and Europe. The more US-concentrated majors, such as
Arco, Unocal and Phillips, also suffered because of their higher leverage
to domestic natural gas prices, which had a disappointing year.
   The largest companies also attracted more market attention, Schroder
Wertheim's Michael Mayer says, because they tend to raise their dividends
year after year, providing a haven for yield-starved investors.
   The diversity of the biggest oil companies also provided some insulation
as oil prices languished for much of the year, a development that set back
the domestic majors.
   If geographic and sector balance was a key to equity performance in
1995, why was Kerr-McGee among the leaders? Nowak says the company's exit
from the US downstream in 1995 exceeded expectations, with Kerr-McGee
planning to use the $400-mil in proceeds to reduce debt and repurchase
stock. Nowak calls Kerr- McGee his favorite gas play, and sees the stock
gaining more than 10% in the next 12 months.
   The oil group's late kick allowed it to make up some ground on the
overall market. Mayer says many major portfolios were underweighted on oil
stocks during much of 1995, in large part due to OPEC-induced uncertainty
on the direction of oil prices. Once OPEC's mid-November meeting removed
much of the haze--the organization decided to roll over its output ceiling
for another six months--the fund managers began to pour money into the big
oils. The money that rotated into oil was drawn from previously hot stock
groups such as technology and the financials.
   Adding to the impact of firmer oil prices was the surge in US natural
gas prices, which Mayer calls "the icing on the cake."

Bear Stearns Fred Leuffer said the end-year trading rally proves that
investors' "thirst for yield is insatiable," with fund money being drawn by
the relatively strong dividends paid by many large oil companies.
   How will the race in 1996 infold? Many observers do not expect it to be
as enticing as this year's run. "The easy money has been made," says Nowak.
The international majors traditionally have been good values, he says, but
that margin has been narrowed by this year's late run.
   Leuffer is advising investors to trim positions in the major oils now
that a rally has taken place. He says his neutral outlook for the group for
1996 would likely slide to "sell" if not for the yield protection the oil
companies provide.
   Leuffer believes the majors' earnings momentum has peaked. After rising
35% in 1995, the analyst expects operating earnings for the group to
increase only 6% in 1996. Some of this is tied to the fact that
restructurings, and their associated cost cuts, having largely run their
course at most companies.
   Many analysts continue to like Mobil despite its 35% gain in 1995. Mayer
ranks the company as a premier E&P player, saying Mobil invests about
two-thirds of its cash flow on the upstream-- as opposed to the industry
norm of some 85%--yet more than replaces output each year. Mobil is also
seen deriving further savings from its broad restructuring, and is among a
group of 5-7 majors likely to boost dividends in 1996. This yield
protection is shaping up as a key factor in the group's projected
performance for 1996. For an investor in a defensive posture, "the oils are
a decent place to have holdings," Leuffer says.

WEATHER CUTS FORTIES CRUDE OUTPUT TO 550-600,000B/D

(London)
Production of UK Forties Blend crude plummeted to 550-600,000 b/d December
29 as freezing weather conditions caused problems at onshore processing
facilities in Scotland, a source with an equity producer said.
   The source said output was likely to remain at that level for the next
couple of days. Operator BP admitted that production from the fields which
make up the Forties system had now fallen below 800,000 b/d because of the
problems at onshore processing facilities at Kinneil.
   "It's down, it's quite low. We're working on it right now," a BP
spokesman said. "It was 800,000 b/d a while ago (today) and has gone below
800,000 b/d," he said.
   The spokesman was unable to predict when Forties output would return to
normal levels of 1-1.2-mil b/d. "We don't know with the weather being as it
is," he said.
   The equity producer source said Forties production was around 1-mil b/d
in early December and fell to 800,000 b/d "a few days ago" before falling
further December 29.
   Trading sources close to operator BP said a total of 2-mil bbl or the
equivalent of four Forties cargoes had so far been cancelled from the
January loading schedule. "A string of old problems" is expected to push
the current loading schedule back for at least one to two days, one source
said.
   Recent Forties spot trades achieved directionally stronger price
differentials to dated Brent. Mid-January transactions of the grade were
reported late December 28 at around dated Brent plus 20-23 cts or around
$19.01-19.04/bbl.

LIBYA RAISES JANUARY CRUDE PRICES BY 5-20 CTS/BBL

By:
Gerald Bueshel, London.

(London)
   Libya has raised its official selling price for crude liftings in
January by 5-20 cts/bbl, equity sources said Friday.
   The price for Es Sider, the main Libyan export grade, was set at dated
Brent plus 15 cts/bbl, compared to dated Brent minus 5 cts/bbl in
December.
   January OSPs for other grades were announced as follows: Sirtica at
dated Brent plus 18 cts/bbl (up 18 cts from December); Brega and Zueitina
at dated Brent plus 30 cts (up 5 cts); Sarir at dated Brent minus 55 cts
(up 5 cts); Amna at dated Brent minus 60 cts (up 5 cts); Bu Attifel at
dated Brent minus 40 cts (up 5 cts); and Bouri at Iranian Heavy FOB Sidi
Kerir minus 25 cts/bbl (up 5 cts).

MORE TIME ALLOWED FOR BP REFINERY SALE TO TOSCO

(New York)
   BP has pushed back into January the possible shutdown of the Marcus
Hook, Pennsylvania refinery, allowing more time for the union there to
reach a new contract with Tosco, which is buying BP's US Northeast refining
and marketing assets.
   BP had said it would begin to suspend operations at the 190,000 b/d
Marcus Hook plant at the start of January if it was unable to close the
deal with Tosco by the end of 1995. And BP had wanted Tosco to have a new
contract in place with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union at the
refinery before closing its deal with Tosco.
   BP now has delayed the potential shutdown until the middle of January, a
company spokesman said December 29. However, a union official said BP has
indicated in talks with OCAW that it would push back the suspension until
the end of the month. The BP spokeswoman had no comment on the union
official's statement.
   BP's current contract with the OCAW expires January 31.
   BP has extended the shutdown deadline to allow more time for the
company, as well as Tosco, to negotiate with the OCAW, the BP spokeswoman
said. BP still must settle severance issues with the union, while Tosco
must negotiate a new contract.
   The spokeswoman said severe winter weather in the Philadelphia area has
delayed its negotiations with the union. She also said BP is encouraged by
the meetings that began last week between Tosco and the OCAW. A bargaining
session between the two was held December 29. Tosco had indicated a desire
to cut refinery staff by 25% and reduce refinery runs by 20%.
   The BP spokeswoman said the company still wants to close the Tosco sale
as soon as possible. Should the company suspend operations at Marcus Hook
in January, it's likely that the sale to Tosco would close in February, she
said.

ACTIVE VLCC TANKER MARKETS

(London)
   South Korean charterers were busy in the VLCC market, with a rash of
fixtures reported Arab Gulf-South Korea, mainly around Worldscale 57-59 for
250-260,000mt lots.
   Despite the Christmas holiday, European charterers were relatively
active, with Mediterranean refiners in particular keen to fix stems out of
the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir through the first half of the month.
Brokers suggested that owners were for now willing to settle for around
Worldscale 90 on Suezmax ships, but that charterers feared an increase in
rates once the rest of the market returned to work after the New Year
holiday.
   West African business was similarly fairly brisk, with rates creeping
slightly higher, even after factoring in the increase in flat rates for
1996. Late in the week, several fixtures were seen for West
Africa-UKContinent and the Med, while a steady stream of vessels continued
to head West Africa-US Gulf Coast and US Atlantic Coast at rates around
Worldscale 89-90 for 130,000mt.

JAPAN TO HIKE CRUDE OIL RESERVE TO 305-MIL BBL IN FISCAL YEAR 1996

(Tokyo)
   Japan will raise its national strategic crude stockpile by 1.2- bil
liter (7.5-mil bbl) to 48.71-bil liter (304.6-mil bbl) in the next fiscal
year starting April, a source at Agency of Natural Resources and Energy
said Wednesday.
   Ministry of Finance halved the agency's original request for 2.5-bil
liter (15.6-mil bbl) in order to allocate financial resources for
construction of a national strategic LPG stockpile, industry sources said.
   The country's first government-operated LPG reserve complex, with a
capacity of 250,000mt, will be built in Nanao in central Japan's Ishikawa
prefecture next year.
   The national strategic crude stockpile is expected to reach the
government's self-imposed goal of 50-bil liters (312.7-mil bbl) in the
fiscal year 1997-1998, the agency source added.

ASIA: 1995 GOES OUT QUIETLY

   Gasoline cargo prices in Singapore were steady in very quiet trade ahead
of the New Year holiday. The 97 RON unleaded market was supported at $21.50
while 95 RON was flat at $20.95. In the 92 RON market, prices were flat at
$19.75-19.85. Swaps were also unchanged for January and February at
$20.70-21.20.
   The open-spec naphtha market was softer due to the downturn on crude
prices and news that the CDU at the SRC refinery would re-starting on
Sunday. Trade was thin as the market slowed for the holiday break. Second
half February was bid at $175.00 while first half March quoted at
$174.00-175.00. The front half to back half February spread was in
backwardation at $1.75. Singapore paper was weaker with January talked at
$17.50-17.60, February at $17.40-17.50.
   The kerosene market dropped slightly with some selling interest now
apparent in Singapore. A major offered 100,000 bbl, FOB Singapore, for
loading January 23-28 at $32.25. A trader bought the parcel at even with
the market mean, pricing on current day quotes. Another major and a trader
bid for 200,000-250,000 bbl parcels for loading January 14-24 at $32.50.
Reports surfaced that a major was shipping kerosene to Asia from Western
Europe and some talked of shipments from the Caribbean. A major bid for DPK
on a C+F basis into Japan at $34.40-35.20 for delivery January 25-29.
However, there was only interest if the product was shipped directly from a
refinery and not from storage.
   The gasoil paper market tumbled in early Singapore trade with January
done at $26.30, markedly lower that the previous day's close at $25.90. The
drop was attributed to weaker IPE and NYMEX settlements on Thursday and the
closing of positions ahead of the New Year. January paper dropped to as
low as $24.95 before it recovered to around $25.15, a reflection of IPE
strength at the opening. Physical bids were also lower in Singapore as
buyers stepped down almost in line with the weaker paper. A trader bid for
180,000 bbl for loading January 13-17 at $25.75, then at $25.85. A seller
offered 150,000 bbl at $26.00 for loading January 20-24 but no deal was
done. Earlier in the day, a 100,000 bbl parcel traded at 50 cts over the
market mean.
   Despite bearish sentiment in the swaps market, cargo residual fuel oil
prices were stable due to the rebound in crude values. A trader offered
20,000mt of 180 CST at $116.50, then at $117.50, for January 13-17.
   A major bid for that date range at $116.25, then at $117.25. The same
company was also willing to pay $117.00 for January 18-22. A bid for
January 24-28 was seen at $115.75. Later, a 20,000mt trade went on the
books for January 18-22 at $117.00. The 180/380 CST spread was pegged at
$6.50/mt due to tight cutter stock avails. January swaps were done at
$115.00, $114.75, $114.00, $113.00 and $113.50 and February at $108.50 and
$107.40.
   Indonesia is expected to allocate an additional 400,000 bbl of LSWR for
January to its affiliates. Indonesia had allocated 4.15-mil bbl. A
Indonesian affiliate fixed 200,000 bbl of mixed/cracked for second half
January lifting at the Pertamina formula, plus around $1.20, FOB
Indonesia.

EUROPE: QUIET CLOSE

   A couple of first half January premium unleaded barges changed hands at
slightly lower prices, $167.00 and $167.50 for storage material, FOB
Amsterdam/Rotterdam, and $166 for very prompt loading. A regular unleaded
barge sale was reported at $157 for 1,000mt, FOB Rotterdam. Cargo activity,
however, was dead, and the only other business reported was some January
swap action at $169.50-170.00, FOB Rotterdam.
   A flurry of naphtha cargoes was placed ahead of the New Year break as
most dealers headed off early for the weekend. An Egyptian cargo for early
January loading was reported sold into Brazil and another sale was heard
into Canada. A January 10-20 arrival for the Mediterranean was confirmed at
$165.50, CIF Spain, for 70 min paraffins. Swaps values were more difficult
to establish. January and February swap levels were notional at $166-168,
CIF NWE.
   A firm tone was maintained though activity was quiet on the jet fuel
market. Sources expected the firm numbers currently obtainable to attract
avails into the market next week. Buying interest into the UK was still
apparent, but much of traders' attention still focused on moving product
into eastern arbitrage opportunities.
   A Russian gasoil cargo was reported sold into Cyprus at $9 over the high
CIF market quotes. Trade was said very quiet over the day with barges
asking a slightly firmer $1 over the gasoil futures screen. GOM was
reported sold FOB at even with the high CIF market quotes. There was also
talk in the market of an Algerian offered in the Mediterranean at $1.25
over formula with bids at 50 cts over. The North may be moving more into
line with the firm numbers in the Mediterranean, traders said. Delays
reported in the Black Sea may be resolved before the New Year, said
sources, and vessels awaiting loading berths were due to dock at the
weekend.
   High sulfur cracked fuel oil in the Mediterranean was again stronger
with a deal heard into Romania at $114, CIF Constanza. FOB bbl were also
well bid, according to brokers. Low sulfur material was harder to gauge. In
NWE, netback values to the US suggested a much firmer market, but trade was
reported into Italy at $123.25, CIF. Refiner, as well as utility, demand
was reported into Italy. High sulfur barge activity was very thin with
prompt trade heard at $105.50, FOB ARA. Low sulfur barges continued to
benefit from the very cold weather in Europe. An E-4 cargo was said to have
been done at $118, basis Rotterdam.

MTBE: QUIET AND STABLE

   Prices were stable in very quiet trade. Material for very early January
were perceived as tight. A refiner reportedly offered 50,000 bbl for
January 10-15 at 92.75 cts, FOB US Gulf. A producer indicated selling
interest for second half January at 93 cts, FOB US Gulf.
   In the Northeast, buying interest was again reported at close to 100 cts
in New York Harbor.

GAS LIQUIDS: PROPANE STILL CLIMBING

   December non-TET propane was done at 38.50 cts at Mt Belvieu in the
morning. But trade thinned with many players leaving early for the New Year
holiday.
   A trader bought normal butane at 38.50 cts for December. January normal
butane sold at 39.50 cts.
   Activity at Conway was extremely quiet. December Warren bbl of natural
gasoline sold at 41.75 cts and 42.00 cts.

ATLANTIC COAST: READY FOR HOLIDAYS

   Unleaded gasoline markets were thinly traded. Sources said that many
traders were "out of the saddle" getting ready to "pop the corks" and
celebrate the New Year.
   Prompt RFG regular unleaded 87 barge offers held at 150 points under the
January screen while bids languished at 200 points under. Softer front half
January RFG Boston unleaded cargo talk was heard at 125-160 points under
the January print.
   Oxygenated RFG regular unleaded 87 barge talk weakened to even to 50
points over the January screen. Softer RFG premium unleaded 93 values were
seen at 3.50-3.75 cts over the January print. Oxygenated RFG premium
unleaded 93 talked at 6.25-6.50 cts over January futures.
   Talk for conventional regular unleaded 87 barges slipped to 5.75-6.25
cts under the January print. Conventional premium unleaded 93 barge values
were seen at 1.75-2.00 cts under the January screen.
   Differentials to the futures screen for No.2 heating oil slipped on the
back of sharply lower NYMEX prices. Prompt No.2 oil barge offers were seen
at 25 points under the January screen, bids were 50 points under. Front
half January Boston No.2 cargo values were pegged at 20-40 points over the
January screen.
   Low sulfur No.2 oil talked at parity with regular No.2 oil. Slightly
softer 54 grade jet fuel talk was heard at 1.20-1.40 cts over the No.2
print. Low sulfur jet/kero, 55 grade, values held at 4.50-4.75 cts over the
No.2 screen.
   Residual fuel oil traders ended 1995 on a quiet note. Most weren't
especially eager to buy or sell and potential selling interest was mostly
limited to a few looking to move foreign low sulfur cargoes.
   Little discussion was heard for 0.3%S H/P and L/P as traders waited for
a New York utility to award its H/P tender for January 10-20 on January 4.
Sellers of 0.3%S L/P barges could still be found at $23.00-23.25.
   Nothing new was seen on the physical 1.0%S market. The "best bid" seen
was at $21.50. Values for January 1.0%S paper were little changed with
sales reported at $20.20, $20.25 and possibly at $20.35.
   Late Thursday, a trader sold its South American 1.7%S cargo at a
market-related high plus 50 cts, delivered to a New England utility. Values
for high sulfur material held near $18.00. New York 380 CST bunker sales
were last heard at $130.

US GULF COAST: A MODEST YEAR-END UPTURN

   Unleaded gasoline prices firmed on the pipeline as a major stepped in to
pick up a few bbl. At one point the market was pushed to 710 points below
the February gasoline futures print. By the end of the day, most called the
first cycle 730 points off.
   Premium unleaded looked a bit stronger at 3.0 cts over regular unleaded
and 93 octane material was another 1.0 cts over that.
   No.2 heating oil was still tight on the water. A 90,000mt ship was taken
to export for the Far East and most put the waterborne market about a 50-75
points over the pipeline. On the pipeline, high sulfur No.2 oil traded as
low as 420 points under the February futures print, slightly less than
Thursday's levels.
   Low sulfur diesel was 15-25 points lower than high sulfur. Jet fuel on
the prompt cycle was 225 points below the February print, while low sulfur
jet fuel sat at 150 points over. Both of those differentials were unchanged
from Thursday.
   Residual fuel oil values were up on the bunker market with $105 reported
for 380 CST at Houston. Most attributed the strength to "distress buying"
for the holiday.
   There was little bulk market activity, but the consensus was that while
more product was available, good export demand remained. Talk on 1.0%S was
higher as well due to the possibility of Florida buying above its contract
requirements.
   Naphtha was quiet around 1.0 cts under unleaded prices.

CHICAGO: PRICE DIFFERENTIALS UNCHANGED

   Differentials to the futures screen were about unchanged with No.2 oil
at 5.25 cts under the print and low sulfur diesel was 3.5 cts below.
   Unleaded gasoline was stable at 4.5 cts under the February futures
print. Premium unleaded was quoted at a 3.5 cts regrade. RBOB was reported
done at a 1.5 cts premium to conventional unleaded.

3.25-3.50 spread over regular unleaded.
   No.2 heating oil was quiet at 6.0 cts below the February futures print
and low sulfur No.2 oil was 3.0 cts under.
   Al prices were quoted in relation to the February futures for January
delivery.

FUTURES: THIN AND VOLATILE

   The session on NYMEX was dominated by expiration-related activity on the
products, traders said, and resulted in a sharp sell-off in January heating
oil and a milder decline in January unleaded.
   February crude rallied to a new contract high near the close. Some
traders left early, or failed to appear to trade, before the long holiday
weekend and that left trading thin and volatile. Additionally, the IPE
closed at 1300 GMT and that tended to erase some direction from the
market.
   January heating oil, which from early December until Thursday had led
the NYMEX energy complex higher, dropped for the second consecutive
session. Traders tied the decline to expiration-related long liquidation,
profit taking and hedge unwinding. "It's the last day of the last month for
that contract and hedgers and speculators who were long during the recent
price run-up got out," a trader said. The contract also came under pressure
over the past two days due to expectations of moderating temperatures.
   January heating oil began its recent rise at the beginning of December
around 52.00 cts and peaked at the contract high of 62.45 cts on Thursday.
However, profit-taking prior to expiration caused it to drop more than 4
cts in two days. January heating oil closed down 169 points at 58.63 cts.
   January unleaded, which also expired, was under pressure much of the
session on expiration-related activity. Thought the contract recovered from
its lows, the market was too illiquid to really discern much about
direction. January unleaded closed off 42 points at 58.86 cts.
   February crude was range-bound after gaining early on an unexpectedly
low US crude stock figure as reported by API. While crude received some
support from its stock draw, the draws in heating oil and unleaded failed
to support those contracts. "The market tends to ignore the figures
following the initial reaction," a trader said.
   However, in the final minutes of trading the February crude contract
found renewed strength as the market stabilized and it broke above
resistance at the previous contract high of $19.55 to set a new high at
$19.57.

US WEST COAST: PRICES SLIP INTO '96

   The end of 1995 approached quietly in Los Angeles with little talk heard
for most products. Los Angeles unleaded languished at the previous day's
level of 57.00-58.00 cts with few buyers seen. Talk was mostly notional
with some narrower ranges heard.
   Traders said it appeared the Portland unleaded market was starting to
slide a little faster. The range dipped to 54.25-55.25 cts as the market
continued to "figure things out" following the reopening of the pipeline
from Seattle.
   Bay unleaded was said to be losing ground to Los Angeles and talked at
least 1.50 cts lower than Los Angeles. Oxy was reported done at 2.50 cts
over Bay unleaded. Reformulated talk was no higher than 2.00 cts over Los
Angeles conventional unleaded.
   Jet fuel prices in Los Angeles appeared closer to the 66.25 cts level at
which the last reported deal was done. Apparently little was getting done,
but there continued to be enough outside pressure in the form of refinery
problems and Asian prices to keep jet supported.
   A CARB seller in Los Angeles was reportedly looking for 67.00 cts early
while the Bay was pegged around 62.50 cts. Low sulfur No. 2 oil held steady
through the day at 60.00-61.25 cts with 60.00 cts reported done in Los
Angeles for the back half of the month. Portland L/S No.2 oil talked lower
at 57.75-58.75 cts.
   Demand into the fuel oil market screeched to a halt on the last trading
day of the year. Traders scrambled to supply what was left of the demand in
the bunker market.
   In Los Angeles, sources reported that bunker-C sold at $111.50,
resulting in a slight increase in the price of 380 CST and 180 CST.

US CRUDE: TALK OF SUPPLY PROBLEMS

   The steady march to stronger prices in Gulf Coast grades continued on
Friday. The tight avails of crude in the US Gulf has been pushing prices
higher as refiners seek out alternate, cheaper crudes.
   According to one trader, the Brent replacement cost on Thursday was
February WTI plus 42 cts and that contributed to the gains seen in LLS.
That sweet grade climbed several cents above Thursday's levels which were
stronger than Wednesday's levels. February LLS was heard traded at 68, 69
and 70 cts over Cushing WTI, with 70 cts over Cushing WTI said to have been
done 10 to 12 times. That topped Thursday's high of 65 cts.
   February Midland WTI was done at 8-10 cts under Cushing WTI, actually
priced into the Gulf and not into Cushing. The February WTS talk level
firmed. One trader suggested, that with the climb in LLS prices, refiners
might turn to WTS because of the wide differential, as much as $1.00-1.65.
"They would run as much as possible until they 'max out' and their
desulfurization units halt," he said.
   Production problems which cut four January Forties cargoes, cold weather
effects on refineries overseas and production problems in certain fields
created a supply problem in crude worldwide, traders noted. The bottom
line, another said, is "crude is tight, crude is strong."
   There were numerous and persistent reports of activity in South American
crude, but, due to an absence of traders prior to the long weekend, the
reports remained unconfirmed. In addition, a trader said that information
appeared to be flowing less freely than it had in the past.
   A second half February Cano Limon said on offer at WTI minus $1.20 and,
while buyer and seller were confirmed, the selling price could not be
verified. There was talk that an end-January or February Vasconia had
traded, but details weren't available. Several traders doubted reports that
up to four cargoes of Oriente had traded around the ANS minus 40 cts level.
The doubt was due to uncertainty about whether Petroecuador will change its
pricing formula in February.
   No West Coast ANS sales were reported by the main spot seller.

INTERNATIONAL CRUDE: UNEVENTFUL

   The 15-day Brent market was uneventful with two February Brent cargoes
done at $18.53 and a partial done at $18.51. February Brent/Dubai talked at
$1.20-1.25 while February/March Dubai talked at plus 24-30 cts and
March/April Dubai talked at plus 21-25 cts. January 2-5 Brent CFDs were
pegged at February plus 35-40 cts. January 8-12 Brent CFDs were valued
around February plus 15 cts.
   Prompt physical Brent values moved lower versus February when a January
4-6 cargo changed hands early at February plus 30 cts. But two late-day
trades tightened the market. A January 15-17 was done at 5 cts under
January, equivalent to February plus 67 cts. It was later re-sold at
February plus 60 cts. Talk was tighter during the day so the late deal
coincided somewhat with the market. However, next week's CFDs were rumored
done at plus 37 cts. Based on the three trades, the market was valued at
February plus 52 cts.
   In other dated Brent talk, most were waiting for fresh second decade
January offers while seven sets of Brent dates were kept from the chains.
Six of the dates were kept by a UK major said to hold up to 13 physical
Brent cargoes. Little action took place in other North Sea markets with
Oseberg price differentials to dated widening. An end-January cargo of the
grade was heard done at dated plus 37 cts.
   West African markets were fairly quiet with many still absent due to the
holiday season. The general tone for BQ and Forcados price differentials to
dated was said "reasonably strong." Recent trades were seen breaking the
dated plus 50 ct mark. Offers for light Nigerian grades, loading towards
end-January, were said at the mid 50s over dated Friday.
   Mediterranean Urals trade was thin though prices firmed on back of tight
avails with one deal done at dated plus 15 cts, C+F Augusta, for 80,000mt.
Although the port of Novorossiisk re-opened late Thursday, 19 vessels were 
reportedly waiting to load. Sources said Mediterranean refiners were
seeking alternative crude supplies and were replacing their sour crude
requirements with sweet North Sea barrels.
