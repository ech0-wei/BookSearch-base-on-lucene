JAPANESE DEFENSE MINISTER SEEKS LIMITATIONS IN NEW BUDGET

     In spite of prime ministerial support for moderate defense
growth, Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) Director General Yozo
Ishikawa said this week that the agency will likely limit defense
spending in the next five-year defense plan (FYDP) following the
Soviet agreement to allow a unified Germany under NATO.
     Ishikawa said that easing tensions in Europe, coupled with
this new Soviet agreement, will eventually reach the "Asian
region."  He added that in order to win public understanding on
defense expenditures, "it is natural that we try as much as
possible to restrain the scale of the defense budget."
     The statement comes after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
JDA Director General for Policy Akira Hiyoshi last week voiced
more active support for a strong military posture, despite
decreased tensions between the United States and the Soviet
Union.
     Citing differences between the European and Asian political
situation, Hiyoshi emphasized that the region is still militarily
"unstable and fluid."  He pointed to the Soviet Union's strategic
modernization and upgrading of their naval forces with more
advanced weapons, the People's Republic of China's large ground
forces, and the continued war in Cambodia, as justifications for
maintaining a 6 percent annual growth in the next five-year plan
(1991-95).

Budget Details of the New Five-Year Plan

     Last month, JDA estimated the nation's next five-year plan
would total approximately $160 billion and will call for flat
growth in procurement--with more money going to maintenance of
advanced systems--as a direct response to the reduced threat
from, and warming relations with, the Soviet Union and
neighboring countries.
     Japan's current five-year program (1986-90) totals about
$126 billion, under which the defense budget has seen a rough 5.6
percent annual increase.  Some in the government, however, are
looking to reduce that annual growth to below 5 percent, without
exceeding the 1 percent of Gross National Product (GNP) ceiling.
     Japan's Parliamentary Security Council, after a meeting with
JDA officials last month on the new five-year defense program,
says that after a several more meetings, it will propose its new
budget to Japanese legislators early this fall.
     A final FYDP program will be defined and voted on by
December, in time for the government to resolve its entire fiscal
1991 budget plan.

Major Procurement Programs

     Major systems the JDA is looking to procure after 1991
include the Boeing E-3A AWACS aircraft, LTV's Multiple Launch
Rocket System (MLRS), and four air tankers.  Opinions are divided
between the JDA Air Staff Office (ASO) and other departments of
the Defense Agency as to what type of air tankers to buy and how
they should be procured.
     Japanese sources say that it will be very tough to overcome
objections from opposition party leaders who charge that air
tankers would pose a threat to other Pacific Rim nations that
would perceive an extended Japanese attack capability.
     The ASO, however, maintains it is possible to win approval
since the air tanker would be used for extending endurance of
fighters on patrol only in Japanese air space, which would not
pose a threat to neighboring countries.
     Additional continued procurement programs include:
     AH-64A Apache--Outlook for introduction of McDonnell
Douglas' attack helicopter during the next defense program is
bleak as procurement cuts in the purchase of new equipment will
affect future buys, a Japanese source says.  The government adds
that Fuji Heavy Industries will be hit hardest because production
of the AH-IS anti-tank helicopter will end in four years, leaving
the firm without any guarantees of future contracts.
     New aircraft trainer--Development of a follow-on to
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' (MHI) current T-2 supersonic jet
trainer is designed mainly to foster indigenous aircraft
development capability, rather than meet a requirement to train
pilots, the government says.  But JDA officials say they are
reluctant to develop a new trainer after the experience of the
FSX, in which the U.S. Congress delayed the program for over a
year because it did not approve of the technology transfers
involved.
     Under a contract to Japan's Technical Research and
Development Institute, MHI has also converted one T-2 into a
testbed that utilizes horizontal and vertical canards to increase
the flight envelope, a program similar in principle to the
U.S./German X-31 Enhanced Fighter Maneuverability (EFM) aircraft.
     New light helicopter-A new light helicopter to replace the
Kawasaki/McDonnell Douglas OH-6 may be developed in the latter
half of 1990s, JDA officials say.  The original helicopter was
developed by Hughes (now McDonnell Douglas) Helicopters in the
late 1970s and is produced under license by Kawasaki Heavy
Industries.
     Hawk and Patriot missiles--A new medium-range surface-to-air
missile to replace Raytheon's radar-guided Hawk may be developed
in the 1990s.  The U.S. Army began fielding the improved version,
the PIP III Hawk, last year.  The PIP III provides a low-
altitude, simultaneous engagement capability and enhanced
electronic counter-measures.  Procurement of Raytheon's Patriot
surface-to-air missile will end during the middle of the new
five-year program.

MITSUBISHI SEEKS $333 MILLION MORE FOR FSX

     Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the Japanese prime contractor
in the development of the FSX fighter, has asked the Japanese
Defense Agency (JDA) for an additional $333 million and another
year's time to complete development of the fighter.
     Mitsubishi says that more funding is necessary as the
development estimate submitted by the U.S. prime contractor,
General Dynamics, is higher than the original estimate of about
$1 billion.  Company officials add that having to develop the
aviation control software on its own has pushed up program costs.
FSX development was originally slated to be completed within five
years, and achieve operational deployment by the late 1990s.
General Dynamics would not comment on the cost changes.
     MHI currently has a small staff of engineers at General
Dynamics' Fort Worth, Texas, plant working on design and
development of the FSX, while General Dynamics, in turn, has a
small contingent of engineers working in MHI's domestic aircraft
facilities.  Although the FSX is based on GD's F-16C, a General
Dynamics official tells us that an actual F-16 is not being used
as a baseboard for FSX development, only certain F-16
technologies are.  The FSX is a complete and independent
development program.

ENGINE FOR JAPANESE TILT-ROTOR TO BE SELECTED SOON

     The selection of an engine for the TW-68, a Japanese tilt-
wing aircraft, will be made within the next 90 days, J. David
Kocurek, president of Ishida Aerospace Group (IAG), tells PAC-RIM
DEFENSE MARKETING correspondent Ernest Blazar.
     Currently, IAG is looking at both Rolls-Royce Turbomeca and
Pratt & Whitney powerplants for the airplane.  He said, "The
aircraft is sizing out nicely" and he is pleased with the
aircraft's technological progress.
     Flight testing of the TW-68 is scheduled for 1994 with
certification expected to be complete by 1997.
     The range and speed of the planned aircraft are estimated at
300-350 knots and 700 static miles, respectively.
     Dual Mode Air Vehicles and the Ishida Corporation of Japan
are jointly developing the aircraft which is capable of lifting
off like a helicopter and flying like an airplane.
     Though some see the TW-68 as a Japanese version of the V-22
Osprey, jointly developed by Bell Helicopters and Boeing
Helicopters, the new aircraft is designed for commercial purposes
rather than the military requirements that drove the Osprey's
design and development.
     Ground-breaking ceremonies were last month for the Ishida
Aerospace Research Technical Center at Fort Worth's Alliance
Airport.  Construction will unfold in two phases.  The first
phase is a 20,000-square-foot building housing design and office
facilities.  After its completion at the end of next year, phase
two construction will begin, bringing the total area to 60,000
square feet.  Phase two will witness the construction of the
assembly buildings.

V-22/TW-68 Seen as Complimentary Aircraft in Novel Market

     Kocurek said he does not particularly view the V-22 Osprey
tilt-rotor aircraft as a competitor.  He explained the V-22
"complements" the Ishida tilt-wing.  The most important item to
remember at this time, he said, is the necessity of building up a
commercial vertical lift constituency in the fixed wing,
rotorcraft operator community.  That constituent backing, he went
on, is how the proper infrastructure for vertical lift will
eventually be developed.
     However, the aircraft are different, he told our sister
publication DEFENSE DAILY.  As most helicopters haul passengers
rather than spend the majority of their time hovering, a tilt-
wing aircraft is better suited to carrying passengers, he said.
"The V-22 is entirely a military aircraft.  The only thing taken
from it is experience," he added.  Additionally, the V-22 is in
the 40,000-pound range, whereas the TW-68 is around 14,000
pounds.
     The FAA has been picking up some momentum in both the
operations and certification sides of the shop, Kocurek said.
     IAG is predicting a monthly production rate of three
aircraft.  Furthermore, it estimates that during the production
run between 1997 and 2005 approximately 300 aircraft will be
produced, 100 of which will be taken by the North American
market.
     The Pacific Rim will take the remainder of the production,
and the Middle East is seen as contributing to the customer base.
As soon as the production line is stabilized, Kocurek said a co-
production venture will begin on one of the Japanese islands.
     In regards to some of the rumors circulating in the industry
about T-Ishida siphoning off Bell Helicopter engineers, Kocurek
said it was not true.  He has not had to solicit any of his
engineers.  As for Bell, "I hope it is a friendly rivalry."
     Kocurek held out the idea that a model tilt-wing port will
be established to demonstrate the value of the technology.
Perhaps a Dallas-to-Houston route will be set up.  Some of the
difficulty in establishing novel vertical lift transport in the
United States is the stumbling block of establishing an
infrastructure.  A package deal of aircraft and vertiport may be
in the works, he said.

AUSTRALIAN DEFENSE OFFICIALS CHARGED WITH PROCUREMENT FRAUD

     Australian government police last week said they have
uncovered a scam in which tens of millions of dollars of the
nation's military procurement budget was annually misappropriated
by military officials as the result of an effort by industry
executives to secure contract awards.
     Commander Jim Allen of the Australian Federal Police (AFP),
who declined to specify the areas in which defense spending fraud
took place, said a year-long investigation by AFP officers
uncovered six instances of Fraud in which military procurement
officials and industry executives colluded to intervene in the
contract tendering process.
     Allen added that there was also evidence of a "revolving
door," where former defense department officers were offered
employment by companies bidding for contracts, noting that the
six cases identified appeared to be only the tip of the iceberg.
     Australian Defense Minister Robert Ray confirmed the
existence of fraud in the defense department, but rejected the
police assertion that it involved millions of dollars.  "Although
the total value of the contracts being investigated amount to
[several] million dollars, there is no valid financial data to
support the claims that the dollar loss to defense through fraud
[amounts to] millions of dollars a year," he said.
     Ray said two cases of fraud are currently active court
cases, while five other cases are still under investigation.  Two
cases, meanwhile, have been closed, one because of a lack of
evidence and another following the conviction of a defense
contractor.
     Allen, who worked for several years as the AFP's senior
liaison officer in Washington, D.C., said corruption and waste in
defense procurement costs the United States $45 billion annually,
the equivalent of 11 new aircraft carriers.  He said evidence
suggests similar corruption has developing in Australia's defense
circles.  Australia's annual defense budget totals about $6
billion.

SOVIETS WILL NOT UNDERCUT U.S. LAUNCH PRICES AT CAPE YORK

     The Soviet Union does not intend to capture the world market
with low-price launches at Australia's Cape York facility,
according to representatives of the Soviet civil space agency
Glavcosmos and a U.S. firm that markets Russian space products.
     "The Soviets have no intention of dominating the market
(through predatory pricing), they only want a share of it,"
Chester Taylor, an official with Space
Commerce Corp. (SCC) of Houston told our sister publication
SOVIET AEROSPACE & TECHNOLOGY.  "The Soviets have said many
times, and I repeat it now, that they will sell launches at world
market prices," he added.  SCC markets Soviet boosters and other
space technology to U.S. customers.
     A senior Soviet space official confirmed Taylor's remarks,
although critics and some members of the fledgling U.S.
commercial launch industry expressed doubt as to the veracity of
the Soviet price claims.  Unlike U.S. firms, the Soviet could
offer low launch prices due to the subsidies and artificial
pricing system that has dominated its economy.
     The Bush Administration announced at the Houston Economic
Summit that the White House would allow launch of American
commercial payloads into orbit by Soviet-built boosters.
     Frank Gaffney, former assistant secretary of defense, said,
"While the Bush Administration avers that the Soviets will be
obliged to charge fair and reasonable prices for their launch
services, this is, at best, wishful thinking; at worst, it is a
canard."
     Gaffney added that Moscow will, like Beijing, disregard
commitments made to the United States to market its boosters at
fair prices.  Under a January 1989 pact with the United States,
China agreed to limit itself to a total of nine commercial
launches over a five-year period.  In return, the United States
would allow American payloads to be exported to China and
launched on its Long March rocket.  Last February, Western firms
complained that China's contract to launch Arabsat for $25
million, roughly half the going price, constituted a breach of
the agreement with the United States.
     In addition, the Soviet has a large stable of boosters and a
strong desire for hard currency.  The Soviet has conducted just
one commercial satellite launch--the low price charged to the
Indian government for the March 1988 mission was a special
introductory offer, according to Soviet officials.
     The price Glavcosmos would charge to orbit a commercial
satellite has taken on increasing relevance since remarks made
recently by Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and
Secretary of State James Baker that indicate the White House will
approve a proposal by USBI Co., a subsidiary of United
Technologies Corp., to manage an Australian space facility.
     The space port, known as Cape York, would feature launches
of commercial payloads, including American-made satellites, using
the Soviet SL-16 Zenit rocket.
     The three-stage Zenit, which can boost 5,860 kg to
geostationary transfer orbit, is well known as the strap-on
rocket for the Soviet heavy-lift Energia launcher, which carries
the Soviet Buran space shuttle.
     In addition to price, some critics of Cape York fear U.S.
satellite technology will be acquired by the Soviet despite
USBI's claims to the contrary.  Gaffney is concerned that a
"short cut" to Cape York will be to allow U.S. payloads to be
launched in the Soviet Union.  "Let there be no mistake about it:
This is a formula for the wholesale compromise of sensitive,
military relevant technologies," Gaffney said.

First Launch Seen in 1995

     "This [the U.S. decision] is a major step...[since] 60
percent of commercial launches are of U.S.-made satellites,"
Stephen Williams, Cape York managing director, said last week.
He predicted the first Zenit rockets could be launched by 1995.
     The spaceport would be the world's first and will cost an
estimated $384 million to build.  The Cape York authority is
planning five launches annually and hopes to take 20 percent of
the global commercial satellite market.  The site in northeast
Australia is seen as a prime candidate due to its proximity to
the equator--only the Ariane complex at Kourou is closer.
     Other industry officials said a commercial launch policy
report prepared by the National Space Council had been approved
by officials at State, Defense, Commerce and NASA.
     It now awaits the president's approval, which is supposed to
be imminent, officials said.  The report will include provisions
concerning launching of U.S. satellites on Soviet boosters.  As
we went to press, the policy had not been formally released.

SALES OF JAPANESE SPACE ITEMS UP 11.6 PERCENT IN 1989

     Japan's industrial aerospace sector sold $1.6 billion worth
of products and services for fiscal 1989, an increase of 11.6%
over 1988, according to preliminary figures released by the
Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) last week.  These
sales bring Japan's total 1989 worldwide aerospace industry sales
to over $6.5 billion for the first time in its history.  SJAC
attributed the sales growth to development of the H-2 rocket, as
well as ground facilities construction related to the H-2.

JAPAN TO TEST SUPERCONDUCTOR POWERED SHIP

     Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has developed a water-propelled
ship powered by a superconductor.  According to company
officials, the ship uses the same sort of force that powers
trains run by superconducting power and is said to be the first
of its kind.  Because the ship is operated by water-jets instead
of the normal rotating screw propeller, officials say maintenance
costs will be minimal.

U.S. FIRM ILLEGALLY SELLS SDI SOFTWARE TO JAPAN

     Four of Japan's largest aerospace and defense contractors
have admitted to purchasing Strategic Defense Initiative related
software from a non-licensed U.S. firm between 1986 and 1989 to
develop the Japan Experimental Module (JEM) for Space Station
Freedom, according to Japanese sources.
     Officials from Mitsubishi Research Institute, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries (MHI), Nissan Motor Co., and Ishikawajima-Harima
Heavy Industries (IHI), which purchased the Contam software
system without proper U.S. licenses, contend they were unaware
that they lacked the relevant import permits from the U.S.
government.  They further noted that there are no procedures for
verifying whether or not a U.S. company has received all
necessary licenses.
     The software was sold by Plume Technology, a small defense
software contractor located in Los Angeles.  Four weeks ago,
Plume executive Ronald Hoffman was arrested for illegally
exporting the Contam software to Japan.  According to a U.S.
government affidavit filed in Los Angeles federal court, the
software continues to be developed to analyze missile plumes and
exhaust trails to provide missile defense data for develop SDI.
     A spokesman for Mitsubishi said the Japanese companies
bought the software "because it was interesting, but that's all
we can say."
     The U.S. government is still investigating the software
sale.  The Pentagon's SDI Organization (SDIO) declined to comment
on the case, noting that it is still pending.  The U.S.
Department of Justice also declined to comment.

AIR FORCE RENEWS $170 MILLION CONTRACT WITH ITT

ANNAPOLIS CAPITAL (APR 1) -- IIT Research Institute, with 700, has been
awarded an Air Force contract renewal worth up to $170 million over the next
three years.
   The contract, for work done entirely in Annapolis, extends a mission
performance since 1961 by the Chicago-based company.
   IIT supplies engineering support to a defense department project at the
Severn River Naval Complex.
   Edward Jackson, IIT vice president, said the company found out at 4 pm
(2100 GMT) Friday about the sole-bid award, to be enacted in July.
Essentially, it means business as usual in Annapolis.
   The contract does not guarantee $170 million, but authorizes up to that
amount.  Jackson said about 200 projects a year must be approved
individually.

ARMED CONTRAS SLIPPING BACK INTO NICARAGUA

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (MAR 31) AP -- The Sandinista party newspaper said
Saturday that at least 1,000 armed Contra rebels have slipped back into
Nicaragua from Honduras, and it claimed they were preparing to wage
full-scale war.
   The military said nine Contras had been killed and 13 government soldiers
wounded in a series of new clashes.
   Contra representatives signed an agreement with Nicaragua's incoming
government to disband by April 20, five days before the new administration of
the United National Opposition takes over from the leftist Sandinistas.
   Despite that March 23 pact, rebel leaders have said their forces were
taking their weapons as they moved from jungle camps in neighboring Honduras
back into Nicaragua.
   Contra leaders said last week that nearly all 12,000 of the rebels in the
camps had returned home.
   Contra rebels interviewed by The Associated Press earlier in the week said
they would not turn over their arms until they are convinced the government
of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is in control of the nation's
security forces.

ATTEMPTS FAIL TO FREE US SERGEANT IN NETHERLANDS

UTRECHT, Netherlands (APR 1) AP -- Dutch prison guards foiled an attempt by
12 Americans, including several servicemen, to seize a US Air Force sergeant
imprisoned on charges of killing his wife, television reports said Sunday.
   Television reports said the incident occurred Friday after the Dutch High
Court ruled that Sergeant Charles Donald Short could not be extradited to the
United States to stand trial on the murder charges.
   The 12 US citizens, including several members of the US Air Force, were
waiting in several cars with US license plates outside a jail in the central
Dutch city of Utrecht, the television said.  Short was due to return there
from the High Court ruling in The Hague, 37 miles away, according to the
report.
   The television report quoted Short's unidentified defense attorney as
saying the Americans were trying to mount "a little Panama."  It was a
reference to the US invasion of that nation in December to topple dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Short was arrested on April 1, 1988, and accused of killing his
Turkish-born wife, cutting her body into pieces and dumping the remains in
plastic bags in Monnikendam, 56 miles from the US Air Force base at
Soesterberg.  He was serving there with the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron.

BRIEF STALEMATE IN LEBANON ENDS WITH RENEWED FIGHTING ON MONDAY

BEIRUT, Lebanon (APR 2) AP -- Rival Christian forces clashed with artillery
and tanks in east Beirut and mountains to the northeast Monday, setting fuel
tanks ablaze in an inferno that threatened a liquor factory's alcohol stocks.
   The fighting in the city's Christian sector and fog-shrouded Kesrouan
highlands broke out around midnight, shredding a cease-fire brokered by
Vatican-backed mediators only a few hours earlier.
   One person was wounded by sniper fire in the fighting between rebel
General Michel Aoun's 19,000 troops and the Lebanese Forces militia led by
Samir Geagea, a police report said.
   At least 839 people have been killed and 2,290 wounded since Jan 30, when
Aoun attacked the militia in a bid to crush the main challenge to his
authority in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Police said both sides pounded each other's positions with 155-mm
howitzers, tanks and multi-barreled rocket launchers in the latest flare-up.

BRITAIN ANNOUNCES LIFTING OF MILITARY SECURITY ZONE

LONDON (MARCH 30) - Britain will lift on Saturday the (150 nm) military
exclusion zone it enforced around the Falkland Islands after the 1982 war
against Argentina, the foreign office announced Friday.
   The zone will cease to exist at 1600 GMT Saturday, the foreign office
said.
   A decision to lift the restriction around the islands in the south
Atlantic was taken when officials from Britain and Argentina met in Madrid
two months ago, but no date had been set.
   The security of the island group will be maintained by measures drawn up
by the two governments.

CHINESE POLICE TIGHTEN CONTROL OVER TIANANMEN SQUARE

BEIJING (APRIL 1) UPI -  Police cordoned off most of Tiananmen Square until
dusk Sunday and fire trucks with water cannons stood by as authorities braced
for signs of a revival of last year's crushed pro-democracy movement.
   "This just proves how terrified the leadership is," a Chinese official
said.
   The extraordinary security precautions came days after the government
issued a document warning Beijing citizens to avoid Tiananmen Square from
April 1 to June 4, a two-month span encompassing a series of sensitive
anniversaries marking the rise and then the bloody dismantling of last
spring's protest movement.
   The 100-acre square was the site of student-led protests by hundreds of
thousands of people.
   Government fears of renewed unrest during the first anniversary of the
protests and their bloody suppression have been heightened by recent fax
messages and letters sent to Beijing offices by overseas dissidents who fled
China after last June.
   The faxes urged Beijing residents to "take walks" through Tiananmen Square
beginning April 1 to protest the killing of hundreds, perhaps thousands, when
the army opened fire on demonstrators last June 3-4.

CUBA SENDS ADVISERS IN NICARAGUA HOME

WASHINGTON TIMES (APR 2) -- Cuban advisers are leaving Nicaragua, abruptly
ending Fidel Castro's heavy investment in the outgoing Sandinista government.
   Fifty military advisers and about 300 medical and construction personnel
remain, according to a US official who asked not to be named.
   Mr. Castro announced an end to military cooperation with Nicaragua after
the landslide defeat of his Marxist proteges by an opposition coalition led
by Violeta Chamorro.
   By the time President-elect Chamorro takes office April 25, "you're going
to see all of the military and clandestine types gone," the official said.

DISCOVERY OF SOVIET MISSILES SIDETRACKS ARMS-CONTROL EFFORTS

WASHINGTON TIMES (APR 2) -- The discovery is Eastern Europe of Soviet-made
intermediate-range missiles banned by treaty is complicating US efforts to
conclude new arms-control accords, according to Bush Administration
officials.
   The SS-23 Spider missiles in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria,
combined with a recent dispute over on-site inspection in the Soviet Union,
will make it harder to develop a verification regime for strategic and
conventional arms-control treaties, said US officials who asked not to be
named.
   The Czechoslovaks have said their 72 missiles will be dismantled by the
end of the summer, officials said.  But the Bulgarian government recently
told the United States in a diplomatic note that it will keep its 24 INF
missiles, unless the Americans would like to negotiate the dismantling of the
arms.  Bulgaria is not a party to the INF treaty.

DOCTOR HURT AS AIR NATIONAL GUARD HELICOPTER IS SHOT

ALTONA, NY (MARCH 30) UPI - Gunfire from a Mohawk Indian encampment struck a
Vermont Air National Guard helicopter on an emergency medical evacuation
mission Friday, wounding a doctor and forcing the chopper to land in a field.
   The UH-1 "Huey" helicopter from the Delta 150th Aviation Batallion was
forced down about 11:20 am and made a "controlled landing," a State Police
spokesman said.
   Five people - three military personnel, the doctor and a nurse - were
aboard the helicopter.  The helicopter was heading to Massena Memorial
Hospital to pick up a seriously ill patient, officials said.
   The wounded doctor was shot in the arm and was reported in stable
condition at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont in Burlington,
authorities said.
   Mohawks in upstate New York have been feuding with the state and federal
government since July, when State Police and the FBI raided a number of
casinos on the St. Regis Indian Reservation about 100 miles west of the
encampment.

'DON'T PULL OUT OF EUROPE' GROUP OF EXPERTS WARNS

WASHINGTON TIMES (APR 2) -- A group of prominent American defense experts and
politicians yesterday cautioned Congress against pressing for unilateral
troop cuts in Europe before the implementation of a conventional arms treaty
in 1992.
   While US armored troops could go home after the treaty is signed, the
group suggested, over the long term the United States should maintain a
military presence in Europe focused on intelligence, planning, command, and
logistics with the ability to return troops in a hurry if necessary.
   "The bottom line is that we say `Don't pull out of Europe,'" said former
Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, a co-author of the interim report on
"Changing Roles and Shifting Burdens in the Atlantic Alliance," sponsored by
the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute and the Paul H. Nitze School of
Advanced International Studies.

EAST GERMAN SOLDIERS START SEARCH FOR STALIN VICTIMS

ORANIENBURG, East Germany (MARCH 30) UPI -  East German soldiers Friday
started exhuming bodies from a mass grave thought to contain the remains  of
several hundred victims of Stalinist executions.
   The soldiers had volunteered for the grisly task at the Oranienburg site
of a former Soviet prisoner of war camp, one of several that recently have
come to public attention in East Germany.  The Soviets are thought to have
used the camps to hold any German considered a security risk.
   Bones and skeletons as well as rusty identity tags and bullet cartridges
were discovered shortly after the digging began at the site just north of
East Berlin.
   Between 1939 and 1950, 130,000 prisoners passed through security camps,
first ran by the Nazis and later taken over by the occupying Red Army, in
what is now East Germany.  An estimated 65,000 people are believed to have
been killed in the camps, many of them average citizens who were denounced by
their neighbors.
   Other mass graves believed to contain the remains of at least 2,000
victims were discovered earlier this week at a camp near the East German
town of Neubrandenburg.

FRENCH COMBAT BUILDUP IN CHAD "IMPLICIT WARNING" TO LIBYA

PARIS (MARCH 31) UPI - France is sending 15 more combat aircraft and
additional troops to eastern Chad as an "implicit warning" to Libyan leader
Colonel Moammar Gadhafi to halt attacks by his forces on Chadian President
Hissene Habre's troops, Defense Ministry sources said Saturday.
   The warplanes together with transport aircraft and support troops are
being deployed from French bases at the Chadian capital of Ndjamena and Bouar
in the Central African Republic, the sources said.
   France currently has about 1,000 troops stationed in Chad.  But only 100
of these are based in the east of the country in the city of Abeche, some 150
miles southeast of the Sudanese border.
   Fighting broke out in the area a week ago between Chadian troops and about
2,500 members of the "Islamic Legion," a Libyan-backed force consisting
partly of mercenaries and led by the rebel Chadian commander Idriss Deby from
a base in Sudan.
   Libya has denied any involvement in the fighting.  Forces loyal to Habre
carried out a series of raids into Sudanese territory against the rebels in
October and November.

NAVY HORNET CRASHES INTO MEDITERRANEAN, BUT PILOT LIVES

GAETA, Italy (APR 1) AP -- A US Navy jet crashed in the western Mediterranean
during routine operations, but the pilot was quickly rescued, a 6th Fleet
spokesman said Sunday.
   The F-18 Hornet, operating from the USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69), was
flying about 28 miles from the NIMITZ-class aircraft carrier when it went
down Saturday afternoon.
   An SH-3 Sea King helicopter operating in the area recovered the pilot
within 10 minutes and returned to the carrier.
   The pilot, whose name was not released, was in stable condition.  The
extent of his injuries was not immediately known.  The cause of the accident
was under investigation.

ONGOING VIOLENCE IN INDIA LEAVES ONE DEAD, 14 INJURED

SRINAGAR, INDIA (APRIL 1) UPI -  Separatist violence Sunday in the troubled
Kashmir city of Srinagar left a security force officer dead and at least 14
people injured, police and witnesses said.
   Police said one of two militants appeared from a side street in the city's
Khanauar district and threw a grenade at a Central Reserve Police Force
patrol, killing one officer instantly.
   Others in the patrol fired at the militants but missed and injured 10
bystanders, police said.
   Six bystanders in the area were arrested but police gave no reason for the
action.
   In a separate incident, witnesses said members of the reserve police
opened fire in the Nawpora area of town, injuring at least four people.
Police confirmed the report but could not say what prompted the incident.
   The unrest in Srinagar, the Jammu and Kashmir state summer capital 400
miles north of New Delhi, occurred during a six-hour relaxation in the curfew
that began at 5 am.
   The separatist campaign, aimed at forcing India to allow Kashmir to become
independent, is supported by virtually all of the area's 3 million Moslems.

POLISH DIPLOMAT AND WIFE WOUNDED BY UNKNOWN MOSLEMS IN BEIRUT

BEIRUT, Lebanon (MAR 31) AP -- Assailants Friday wounded a Polish diplomat
and his wife, and a previously unknown Moslem group Saturday claimed
responsibility and warned Poland not to help Soviet Jews travel to Israel.
   The shootings followed Poland's offer to help Soviet Jews emigrating to
Israel as a "humanitarian gesture" that it hoped Arab nations would
understand.
   Budgan Zbigniew, a Polish commercial attache, and his wife, Eva Sarkis,
were wounded by assailants firing automatic rifles as the couple was parking
a car near the Bristol Hotel in Moslem west Beirut.
   The two were rushed to the American University Hospital, where a hospital
spokesman Saturday said both were "doing fine.  They are off the critical
list."  A hospital medical bulletin said Zbigniew had a bullet wound in the
chest and his wife suffered minor wounds in the left arm.
   The Polish government condemned the attack and said the Foreign Ministry
was taking increased measures to protect diplomats and other overseas
employees.
   The claim of responsibility came in a handwritten Arabic statement from
the Revolutionary Action Organization, the Arab Resistance front--The Martyr
Suleiman al-Halabi unit, published by the Beirut leftist newspaper As-Safir.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE LEAVES ONE DEAD, 4 INJURED IN GREECE

ATHENS (APRIL 1) - Fighting between members of two rival Greek political
parties left one person dead and four wounded on the southern island of Crete
on Sunday a week before a general election, police said.
   Manolis Yakoumakis, 37, died after being shot in the head near the
island's capital Iraklion, while four other people, including a journalist,
were  hospitalized with bullet wounds.
   The dead man and three of the wounded belonged to the conservative New
Democracy party (ND).  A fourth victim was a member of former Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou's PASOK socialist party.
   The clash erupted shortly after ND chairman Constantin Mitsotakis arrived
to make a campaign speech.
   The violence began when conservative militants attacked PASOK headquarters
in Alikarnassos, a suburb of the capital, and shot a party member in the leg.

REBELS SHOOT DOWN TWO AFGHAN HELICOPTERS

ISLAMABAD (APRIL 1) - Afghan guerrillas have shot down two transport
helicopters near southern Kandahar city, killing five crew members,
resistance sources said Sunday.
   The helicopters crashed in the Daman area, 15 kilometers (9 miles) east of

Afghanistan's second largest city, after they were fired on by US-made
Stinger missiles, the pro-resistance Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported.
   Quoting a local rebel leader, AIP said the helicopters had been returning
to Kalat after transporting food and other consumer goods to Kandahar.
   It said rebel mujahedeen had recovered the bodies of five crew members
from the wreckage.

SOVIETS ADD TO FORCES IN LITHUANIA

WASHINGTON POST (APR 2) -- MOSCOW, APR 1 - The Kremlin reinforced its
military presence in Lithuania today, hours after President Mikhail Gorbachev
issued a tough statement calling on the rebel republic to rescind its
declaration of independence.
   Lithuanian government leaders, meanwhile, said they were ready for talks
with Moscow on any issue, including Soviet security interests in the Baltic,
but that they would not revoke their March 11 proclamation of independence.
The Lithuanian parliament is to meet Monday to discuss Gorbachev's appeal.
   The Kremlin has already dispatched a paratroop regiment to Lithuania,
together with several units of internal security troops.  Over the past week,
Soviet soldiers have been posted at the office of the chief Lithuanian
prosecutor, the main printing works and several Communist Party buildings.

SRI LANKAN LEADER RETURNS IN TRIUMPH OVER INDIA

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (APRIL 1) UPI -  One week after the last of 50,000 Indian
troops withdrew from Sri Lanka, the leader of the victorious Tamil Tiger
guerrillas said Sunday that his fighters will not lay down their arms and
will continue the struggle of the Tamil-speaking people.
   Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran returned in triumph to Nallur in
northern Jaffna peninsula two years after the skin of his pet leopard was
displayed as a war trophy by Indian troops, who drove his 4,000 guerrillas
into Sri Lanka's jungles but failed to disarm or pacify them.
   "We have fought and defeated the (world's) fourth-largest army.  We have
shown the world by defeating the Indian army. No one can crush us,"
Prabhakaran said at a news conference in the northern peninsula, now
virtually under complete control of the Tigers.  We are not against the
Indian government or the people, but we are against the atrocities carried
out by the Indian army," he said.

STALEMATE HALTS FIGHTING BETWEEN CHRISTIAN FORCES

BEIRUT, Lebanon (APRIL 1) UPI - A cease-fire agreement and a stalemate
Sunday ended two days of fierce clashes between rival Christian forces
northeast of Beirut that killed at least 50 people and wounded 110.
   Police said sporadic machine gun and mortar fire echoed across the village
of Qlaiat, where troops under General Michel Aoun and the rival militiamen of
Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces engaged in bloody battles Friday and Saturday.
   Qlaiat is a strategic village controlled by Aoun's troops in the Christian
Maronite heartland of Kesrouwane, 12 miles north of Beirut, an area that is
largely a Lebanese Forces militia stronghold.
   Police said big guns fell silent along the 4-mile front in Kesrouwane late
Saturday after a Christian mediation team managed to persuade the two rival
leaders to hold their fire.
   Military sources said Geagea had launched attacks against Aoun's positions
in Qlaiat with the aim of driving him out of Kesrouwane.  They said Geagea
wanted to distract Aoun from attacking his militia headquarters in east
Beirut.
   More than 50 people were killed and 110 were wounded in two days, raising
the casualty toll in two months to 850 dead and 2,820 wounded.
   Military sources said around 1,000 troops, backed by tanks, armored
personnel carriers and relentless shelling from 200 artillery pieces,
confronted a similar militia force with the same fire power.

SUDAN SOLDIERS KILL 112 REBELS

KHARTOUM, Sudan (MAR 31) AP -- Soldiers and their allied militiamen killed
112 rebels in fierce fighting in southern Sudan, the military command
reported.
   A statement issued late Friday also said nine soldiers and militiamen were
killed and 32 wounded in the fighting in southern Sudan's sprawling Bahr
el-Ghazal region. It did not say when the battles took place.
   In addition to the 112 rebels killed, a "large number" were wounded, the
statement said.  The military also said the rebel unit's commander was
captured.  The militiamen are part of a newly formed popular defense force
made up of civilian volunteers armed by the government to fight the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   It was impossible to verify the government statement because the south has
been closed to outsiders for years due to the rebellion.

TWO SENATORS WANT TOUGHER STANCE ON NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION

WASHINGTON (APRIL 1) UPI - Two senators said Sunday it is time to get tough
on the proliferation of nuclear weapons overseas, particularly in light of
the recent attempt to ship potential bomb triggers to Iraq.
   Senator William Cohen (R-Maine) ranking Republican on the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, said the United States should be as hard on Iraq
as it is on Libya when it comes to weapons proliferation.
   "I think we should.  I think that's precisely the case," Cohen said on
ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley" program.
   Cohen suggested using economic sanctions to block the expansion of nuclear
weapons.
   Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, echoed Cohen's opinion.
   "I think we need to get tough, not just with those Middle Eastern
countries, but with those who are supplying them. ... I think we need to  use
strong diplomatic measures with those folks who are in the business of
supplying these weapons," said Bingaman.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations disputed the senators' position.

US COAST GUARD SEIZES COCAINE BOAT FOR SPAIN

MIAMI (APRIL 1) UPI -  A US Coast Guard boarding team acting on behalf of the
Spanish government seized a Spanish fishing vessel carrying at least 185
pounds of cocaine and held the crew, the Coast Guard said Sunday.
   The seizure was made Friday in international waters about 250 miles
southeast of Puerto Rico, but was not made public until after the vessel
reached Puerto Rico Sunday.
   A Coast Guard law enforcement team aboard the USS SOUTH CAROLINA (CGN 37),
a US Navy CALIFORNIA (CGN 36)-class cruiser, spotted the crew of the Spanish
ship TERRAL throwing bundles into the ocean.
   The Navy crew and the Coast Guard team recovered the bundles and found
them to contain 185 pounds of cocaine.
   The United States notified the government of Spain, which authorized the
seizure of the ship and asked the Coast Guard to detain the crew.
   The TERRAL and its crew of 10 Spanish citizens were escorted to San Juan,
Puerto Rico Sunday by the Coast Guard Cutter CHILULA (WMEC 153).  They were
turned over to the jurisdiction of the Spanish consulate in Puerto Rico, and
were being held by US immigration authorities pending transfer to Spain for
prosecution.
   It was unclear who was to pick up the floating bundles of cocaine.

US WEIGHS CHANGES IN PLANS TO PRODUCE SHORT-RANGE NUCLEAR WEAPONS

WASHINGTON POST (APR 2) -- The Bush administration is considering changes in
its plans for production of more short-range nuclear weapons for deployment
in Western Europe in order to respond to opposition from West Germany and key
US legislators, US and diplomatic sources said yesterday.
   The officials said several alternatives to the highly controversial weapon
plan are being discussed with US allies in preparation for a meeting of
defense ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
Alberta, Canada, early next month.
   The administration's aim is to win allied approval for a new approach that
would halt widespread criticism of its request for $112 million in fiscal
1991 to develop a short-range nuclear missile, plus additional funds for
nuclear-tipped battlefield artillery shells.

VMI'S NEW CHIEF DEFENDS MALE-ONLY ENROLLMENT POLICY

WASHINGTON TIMES (MAR 30) -- LEXINGTON, VA - Maj General John W. Knapp made a
camouflaged defense of Virginia Military Institute's male-only admissions
policy during his inauguration as superintendent yesterday, but called the
outcome of a sex-discrimination lawsuit unpredictable.
   General Knapp was flanked by 1,300 cadets in their gray-and-white dress
uniforms and backed by the board of visitors as he said VMI's single-sex
education designed to mold citizen-soldiers holds "a special place" in
Virginia's diverse system of higher education.
  In a separate interview, General Knapp said allowing women would ruin the
uniqueness of the VMI experience, a single-sex education where a rigorous
physical and mental indoctrination is used to reinforce male bonding.

HONDURAN MILITARY PLEDGES TO FIND ATTACKERS OF US SOLDIERS

TEGUCIGALPA (APRIL 1) REUTER - Honduran Armed Forces pledged on Sunday to
launch a manhunt for gunmen who strafed a bus full of US airmen with
machine-gun fire, leaving seven wounded, two seriously.
   A US Embassy spokesman said the US military has been receiving constant
threats against servicemen temporarily stationed in Honduras, but he denied
there had been a warning about Saturday's attack.
   At least three suspected leftist guerrillas opened fire with machine guns
as the bus was returning 28 temporary duty Air Force personnel from a
pleasure trip to the Atlantic coast beach.  The attack on the Air Force bus
occurred about 12 miles (20 km) north of Tegucigalpa.
   Two of the injured were in critical, but stable, condition on Sunday
morning after surgery in a Tegucigalpa hospital.
   US Embassy spokesman Terence Kneebone said the two would be flown back to
the United States when possible.  Another spokesman said four of the injured
had been flown to an army hospital in Panama City and one was recovering at
the Soto Kano airbase in Palmerola, some 50 miles (80 km) north of
Tegucigalpa, where most US military personnel in Honduras are based.
   The Pentagon maintains some 1,200 troops on regular duty in Honduras, but
the number is often boosted by troops on short-term civic action duties and
military exercises.

SEVEN US SOLDIERS WOUNDED IN REBEL ATTACK ON HONDURAN BUS

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (MARCH 31) UPI - Rebels of the leftist Morazanist
National Liberation Front opened fire Saturday on a bus carrying 28 US
soldiers, wounding seven, including three seriously, Radio America reported.
   The bus left the US Palmerola military base bound for Tegucigalpa, 53
miles to the south, but leftist rebels intercepted the bus about 12 miles
from the city, Radio America said.
   The rebels fired at least 10 shots into the vehicle about 1 pm (1900 GMT),
damaging the engine and wounding seven soldiers, the radio said.
   Radio America said the seven wounded soldiers, including three in serious
condition, were immediately taken to Tegucigalpa's Escuela Hospital, where
they were treated.
   The broadcast said five of the wounded were later transferred to the
Palmerola base, while two were still under observation at Escuela Hospital.
   Radio America quoted a doctor there saying the victims arrived at the
hospital at 1:30 pm and that one of them was undergoing surgery to  remove
bullets from his head and chest.

WASHINGTON TIMES (APR 2) -- MANILA - Talks on the future of US military bases
in the Philippines, already twice postponed, face new delays amid claims that
an American was involved in last December's army coup attempt against
President Corazon Aquino.
   US Ambassador Nicholas Platt said the talks would not take place as
scheduled in mid-April but declined to elaborate, saying only that "we need a
little more time," Mr. Platt denied he had any connection with an American
implicated by a Philippine general in the December army revolt.

FILIPINO COMMUNIST REBEL LEADER THREATENS AMERICANS AND JAPAN

MANILA, Philippines (APRIL 1) UPI -  A communist rebel leader said Sunday
guerrillas would step up attacks on Americans and warned Japan for the first
time against its alleged involvement in Manila's counter-insurgency drive.
   "We will certainly intensify attacks against US imperialism as long as it
increases intervention and control of our country," Romulo Kintanar, chief of
the 19,000-member communist New Peoples Army, said in a statement to news
agencies.
   "Our main targets are invasion troops and all US personnel involved in
counter-insurgency," he said, adding that other American civilians would not
be targeted.
   Guerrillas have been blamed in the past two years for the deaths of eight
Americans, including three active military personnel, one retiree, two
defense employees and two civilians.
   Kintanar also said he had information that Japanese Official Development
Assistance is being used for Manila's counter-insurgency campaign and for
projects that have deprived farmers of land and polluted the environment.
   "We warn the Japanese government to stop this and urge the Japanese people
to oppose this act of their government," Kintanar said.

US BANS MOST TRAVEL BY AMERICAN AIRMEN IN PHILIPPINES

MANILA, Philippines (MARCH 30) UPI - Officials at Clark Air Base banned
Friday most travel by American airmen to the Philippine capital, where a
policeman was killed in a communist-style ambush.
   An announcement over the US military television, Far East Network, said
travel to Manila by some 9,000 airmen at the headquarters of the 13th Air
Force is prohibited except for official missions.
   The announcement said exceptions could be granted on a "case-by-case
basis" by commanders at Clark, 50 miles north of Manila.
   Clark's travel ban followed a similar directive Tuesday from the commander
of US naval forces in the Philippines at Subic Bay Naval Station "due to
increased threats to US military members."
   Some 6,000 servicemen are stationed at Subic, the sprawling repair and
logistics center for the US Seventh Fleet, 60 miles northwest of the
Philippine capital.
   Eight Americans have been killed in the country in the past two years in
slayings the government blames on communist guerrillas.
   About a dozen Philippine lawmen have been killed in the past week in
metropolitan Manila in advance of the 21st anniversary of the founding of the
communist New People's Army.

PENTAGON APPROVES TACTICAL UAV DEMONSTRATOR

     The Pentagon has decided to rapidly introduce a close-range
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to the military services by pursuing
development and production through an advanced concept technology
demonstration (ACTD), DoD said Dec. 22.
     Pentagon acquisition chief Paul Kaminski formally approved the
concept in a Dec. 21 memo that calls for the demonstration of a
tactical UAV system within 18 months, as well as a pre-planned product
improvement (P3I) to build upon air vehicle capabilities. 
     Kaminski's approval came on the heels of an agreement brokered by
the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in mid-December between the
Army and Navy over divergent system requirements.The original
suggestion to scrap the traditional acquisition process in lieu of an
accelerated plan came last July after a year-long delay in releasing a
request for proposals (RFP).
     Formerly known as the Maneuver variant, the Tactical UAV (TUAV)
ACTD will include the procurement of six complete systems, two Mobile
Maintenance Facilities (MMFs), and eight attrition air vehicles and
Modular Mission Payloads (MMPs), according to Kaminski's memo.
     Moreover, the TUAV "should have a maximum projected cost of
$350,000 for the 33rd air vehicle and sensor," Kaminski stipulates.
"The TUAV selected for award should also have a maximum projected cost
of $300,000 for the 100th air vehicle and sensor." 
     The system is envisioned to have a range of 200 kilometers, be
able to fly for three to four hours, and be launched from land or sea.
     Officials in the Navy-led UAV Joint Program Office are anxious to
release a draft RFP for the TUAV ACTD as early as next week. A final
RFP is expected by the end of the month. Proposals are due around
March 11 and a final contract award should be made on "reasonably
quick order," JPO spokesman Ray Colemon said earlier this month.
     But the final RFP, and subsequent contract award, may not come so
soon, despite the level of importance the Army and Navy have ascribed
to the tactical UAV mission, military and industry officials contend. 
     For example, Kaminski has directed several things be completed
first to ensure a successful ACTD is pursued. The TUAV program manager
has been directed to develop an ACTD management plan which will
include TUAV life cycle costs, logistics support, manpower, training,
and transition to production. The program manager has yet to be
selected, Colemon said.
     The question of how best to transition from an ACTD to full
production--if such a decision is made--has plagued ACTDs in the past
and in this case has been a concern of Kaminski's. 
     Pentagon officials are grappling with the production issue with
another UAV program that was developed and built as an ACTD, the Tier
II Predator. The Predator ACTD, which ends in June, has been hailed as
a success for its quick development and its deployment last year in
support of NATO forces in Bosnia.
     An Integrated Product Team, which will evaluate the TUAV's
military utility, supportability, and producibility, is also being
established under Kaminski's orders.
     And lastly, the director of the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance
Office has been tasked to "develop a ground reception, processing, and
control system architecture and a schedule for achieving
interoperability with other UAVs, collection systems, and command,
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance systems," Kaminski's memo states.  One industry
official also foresees industry competitors having difficulty meeting
the requirements of the forthcoming RFP quickly. He points out that
the ACTD requirements are significantly different than the original
Maneuver UAV program. In particular, the range now called for is
almost four times greater 
than in the original program, which called for between 30 and 50
kilometers.
"[Industry] can't add weight or fuel [to go that distance] without re-
engineering the whole thing," the industry official said. 
     According to military and industry UAV officials, the potential
competitors for the TUAV ACTD contract include Westinghouse, Textron,
Alliant Techsystems, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon , a Boeing-General
Atomics team, and interested Canadian and German firms. 
     Kaminski is expected to decide soon on the fate of another UAV
program, the Hunter short-range UAV. The Joint Staff recommended
terminating the TRW -developed system late last year after numerous
air vehicle crashes and programmatic blunders. 
     According to officials familiar with the discussions, some of the
seven Hunter systems resulting from the existing production contract,
including 56 air vehicles, will divvied up among operational Army
units--and perhaps even the Marine Corps--over the next few months.
But no additional vehicles will be built.
     Some of the vehicles are likely to be put in storage, as the
Joint Staff recommended, an Army official said.

STUDY SEES 50 PERCENT GROWTH IN U.S. EW MARKET BY 2001

     The U.S. electronic warfare (EW) market projects U.S. sales will
grow from $1 billion last year to $1.45 billion by 2001, according to
a new study by the market research firm Frost & Sullivan.
     The study says the market will decline slightly to $946 million
in 1997  but rebound later in the decade when programs completing
development move into production.
     F&S says in U.S. Electronic Warfare Market that rotary-wing
aircraft equipment will rise from 13 percent of total EW market
revenues in 1995 to 20 percent in 2001 while the market for
fighter/attack aircraft equipment will dip from 72 to 61 percent in
the same period.
     The study says the EW market has shifted from single-service
sales toward greater coordination between the services and adds that
DoD is encouraging U.S. suppliers to reach overseas for technology
partners to lower development costs and enhanced interoperability in
systems.

V-22 EMD EFFORT ON COURSE FOR DECEMBER FIRST FLIGHT

     Current projections--backed up by actual parts flowing from
pre-production processes--show that the V-22 Osprey is now weighing
nearly 1,300 pounds under the empty weight figures specified in the
contract between the U.S. Navy and Bell Boeing, a 1995 year-end check
on progress shows. 
     "We have about 50 percent of the aircraft which is now 'actual'
parts with known weights," says Stuart Dodge, Director of the Joint
Program Office (JPO) in Washington, D.C. "They all conformed to our
predictions. It shows we have the weight projections nailed down."
     Dodge recently told JPO employees in a Christmas letter that the
weight savings have exceeded--by more than a factor of two--the target
weights set by the Bell Boeing manufacturing team themselves.
     "It's directly related to the advanced production processes in
use. Put simply, they minimize errors and guarantee first time
results," Dodge said in a follow-up interview with sister publication
Helicopter News.
     Dodge--who credits pioneering work done with the Boeing 777
airliner with the production process success--says the first EMD
(Engineering, Manufacturing and Development) Osprey fuselage was
recently mated to its wing structure "with the tap of a rubber
mallet."
     This operation--which brought the Boeing Helicopters Div.,
fuselage together with wings manufactured by Bell Helicopter Textron
in Arlington, Texas,--represented an important milestone for the
project.
     "It qualified us to begin giving out advanced long-lead contracts
to vendors for the first Osprey production equipment items," he said.
     Go-ahead for the first, or low rate initial production (LRIP),
parts will follow the first flight of this aircraft set for December
of this year. It will be the seventh V-22, but the first built to
production-level specifications.
     "Everything hangs on meeting that [first flight] commitment,"
Dodge said.
     The stakes are high. With this flight complete, the government
will formally begin the process of buying 523 V-22s it has contracted
for (425 for the Marine Corps, 48 for the Navy and 50 for the Special
Operations Command.) 
     Costs of the program show a similar story to the one on weight,
he said, with the first EMD aircraft now exhibiting a "recurring
flyaway" cost estimate of $32.5-million per aircraft. Dodge said this
is on track to meeting its the target price goal of $29.4-million (in
FY '94 dollars.) A cost reduction program under assessment has the
potential of reducing this to $28.1 million.

ARPA EMBARKS ON ELECTRIC COMBAT VEHICLE DEMONSTRATION

     The Advanced Research Projects Agency is soliciting proposals for
electric power systems for future use in land combat vehicles,
according to an announcement in Commerce Business Daily.
     As part of ARPA's Integrated Product and Process Development
effort, the agency plans to demonstrate the ability of electrically
engineered land vehicles to provide ground forces with increased
mobility, lethality, deployability, command and control, and
survivability, according to the Jan. 4 announcement. Proposals are due
by Feb. 21, 1996. [SOL BAA96-09, POC John Gully, 703/696-8401]

PENTAGON RESTORES MOST OF ARMY's MONEY FOR RADIO PROGRAM 

     The Pentagon's civilian leadership last week heeded the Army's
cries over the past few months and agreed to restore nearly all of the
service's funding request for the Single Channel Ground and Airborne
Radio System (SINCGARS) in the next two fiscal years, according to DoD
officials and budget documents.
     The service is now set to accelerate fielding of an improved
version of the primary tactical radio system and believes it can
retain two prime contractors and continue to keep costs down. General
Dynamics and ITT  compete annually for SINCGARS production and are
both working on the SINCGARS System Improvement Program (SIP).
     In early December, Deputy Defense Secretary John White restored
the $92.8 million in FY '97 money DoD Comptroller John Hamre
recommended be cut last November. However, until last week, the Army
was set to lose all of its $298 million request for FY '98.
     In program budget decision (PBD) 731 on Dec. 28, White restored
$267.9 million in FY '98, $30 million less than the Army was looking
for. The decision came after continued Army assertions that the FY '98
cut would put the program and force readiness in jeopardy.
     Although the Army won't be able to buy as many radios in FY '98
as originally intended, service officials are confident the program is
out of the woods.
     "We see that as a pretty fair cut," an Army budget official said
of the $30 million FY '98 decrement. "We made our case and got most of
what we asked for." 
     Budget requests are made for two fiscal years at once, but
Congress appropriates funding for only one year at a time. This year
the Pentagon is at a disadvantage going into its final budget
deliberations because without a federal budget for FY '96 it lacks a
funding baseline for FY '97 to work against. Without a federal budget
soon, the FY '97 request will likely be delayed beyond the statutory
deadline for being submitted to Congress. 
     The comptroller's original recommendation to cut FY '97 and FY
'98 SINCGARS money was based on the belief that the Army planned to
use the resources to outfit the National Guard with the primary
command and control system used by infantry, armor, artillery and
aviation units. But, the argument went, the National Guard has no
warfighting mission, does not require SINCGARS, and should make do
with its older VRC-12 series radios.
      But the Army, in an appeal to Hamre's recommendations in
November, said it plans to field the SINCGARS SIP radio to first-to-
fight units and that the National Guard will benefit only by receiving
those SINCGARS already fielded and set to be replaced by the SIP
radios. The appeal by Neil Ginnetti, principal deputy assistant
secretary of the Army, prompted White to approve the FY '97 request in
December. But the Army's continued fight led to White's decision last
week to approve FY '98 funding as well.
     Last fall the Army decided to accelerate the SINCGARS program in
an effort to field the required 225,000 radios as quickly as possible
and save nearly $500 million over the future years defense plan by
buying out the program in three years instead of eight. The Army plans
to apply those cost savings to other areas. The accelerated plan
called for $283 million in FY '97, $298 million in FY '98, and $15
million in FY '99 and FY '00, according to internal Army documents.

ARMY TO BRIEF INDUSTRY ON SCOUT SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

     The Army plans to host an industry briefing this month on the
service's plans for the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System
(LRAS3), the Communications Electronics Command, C4I Electronic
Warfare Acquisition Center, says in the Jan. 3 Commerce Business
Daily.
     The Army expects engineering and manufacturing development (EMD)
of LRAS3 to begin in FY '96/97 with production of 650 systems
beginning in FY '99.
     The Army may award up to two study contracts for the program or
decide to go directly into an EMD contract.
     LRAS3 is a long-range, line-of-sight system that will be used by
Army maneuver battalion scouts in both mounted and manportable mode
for reconnaissance of terrain and tactical surveillance. The system
will have near all-weather capability for target acquisition with
integrated 2nd Generation Forward Looking Infrared, low-light level
TV, eye-safe laser range finder, digital compass, and global
positioning system. The system will have the capability to digitize
and provide imagery/information transmitted over Army standard
tactical communications networks. [Contact: Stephanie Allen, 908/532-

BDM WINS ARMY SUPPORT CONTRACT FOR BOSNIA

     BDM Federal said last week it won an $11.7 million contract from
the Army to provide about 500 interpreters and translators to assist
American military personnel in Bosnia and Hungary as part of Operation
Joint Endeavor.
     "U.S. forces must be able to communicate quickly and directly
with the people of Bosnia and Hungary if Operation Joint Endeavor is
to succeed," Phil Odeen, BDM chairman and CEO, said.
     The company is currently recruiting prospective interpreters and
translators who will be consultant-linguists of BDM while they are in
Bosnia and Hungary and will be paid a stipend for their services.
     BDM Federal is a subsidiary of BDM International, Inc..

JOINT STARS TO CONTINUE OPERATIONAL TESTING IN BOSNIA

     Operational testing of the Joint Surveillance Target and Attack
Radar System (Joint STARS) will continue while the aircraft system is
deployed operationally over Bosnia as part of Operation Joint
Endeavor, an Air Force official said in late December.
     Joint STARS, a system that consists of a modified Boeing E-8
aircraft and ground-based terminals, was sent to Iraq during the
Persian Gulf War. That deployment delayed the system's operational
testing. Air Force officials were concerned that a second deployment
would further delay the independent operational testing.    
     "[The Office of the Secretary of Defense] and the Air Force spent
time with the [Director of Operational Test and Evaluation], along
with Air Combat Command, to put together a deployment and multi-
development test and evaluation [schedule] that would be transparent
and non-interfering" with the ongoing Bosnian mission, Air Force Col.
Robert DeBusk, commander of the 4500th Joint STARS squadron
[provisional], said in a telephone interview. On Dec. 4, DOT&E signed
off on a plan to concurrently test Joint STARS during Operation Joint
Endeavor. DeBusk spoke to Defense Daily from Rheim Air Base, Germany,
regarding the fledgling U.S. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
     "We need to do that to ensure full rate production in 1996,"
DeBusk said. He added that first and foremost, Joint STARS is to
provide surveillance for U.S. troops in the peacekeeping mission. But
when possible, the platform and its associated ground stations will be
tested. 
     The Joint STARS system will begin operations over and in Bosnia
in January, DeBusk said.
     Northrop Grumman, the Joint STARS aircraft system prime
contractor, is to deliver two Joint STARS systems to the Air Force in
FY '96. The Air Force has a requirement for 20 of the systems. The
service plans to buy the aircraft at a rate of two or three a year for
the next 10 years at a cost of about $5 billion to $7 billion.
     Joint STARS is a long-range, air-to-ground surveillance and
battle management system that can locate and track vehicle and armor
movements. The program, run jointly by the Army and the Air Force, is
comprised of an airborne platform, a radar sensor with subsystems and
a ground station that receives, in real time, the radar data processed
in the aircraft. Motorola builds the Ground Station Modules (GSM).
     Two E-8 Joint STARS aircraft left on Dec. 14 for Bosnia from
Northrop Grumman testing grounds in Melbourne, Fla. Along with the two
E-8s, at least 10 GSMs from Fort Bragg, N.C., and Fort Hood, Texas,
are being deployed to help monitor vehicle movements during the
transition between the United Nations' protection force in Bosnia and
the implementation of NATO forces there.
     In preparing for the January missions, DeBusk is running training
sorties of Joint STARS to check out the crews and to "determine the
ground truth." The Joint STARS, based out of Rheim, will be monitoring
"vehicle-type" movements, he added. 
     Joint STARS has not flown in an operation since Desert Storm. One
obvious difference between that mission and the upcoming one is that
Bosnia is a different terrain, full of mountains and trees, somewhat
limiting Joint STARS' ability to survey and track movements. 
     Overall, Joint STARS was considered a great success in Desert
Storm and DeBusk plans on using the lessons learned in that operation
in Bosnia. 
     "I have reviewed lessons learned and have set down with Lt. Gen.
George Muellner [principal deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force
for acquisition] to get his perspective on the lessons learned," he
said. "We are going to try to avoid any mistakes [made during Desert
Storm.]" Muellner commanded the Joint STARS squadron in Desert Storm.
     DeBusk added that the Joint STARS mission for Bosnia is different
than that in Desert Storm in that this time, it is completely a joint
operation. 
     "The 4500th is a unique organization because it is a totally
joint Air Force, Army group. The vice commander is Army Col. Randy
Young. Our organization is Army and Air Force top to bottom. It is a
success story from the joint perspective."

EMERGING COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS BEING CONSIDERED FOR BOSNIA  

     The results of a recent exercise that tested the ability of
emerging communications systems to work together in support of joint
military operations are affecting Pentagon discussions on how to best
equip U.S. and NATO forces in Bosnia, with several systems on the
table for probable deployment to the European theater in the coming
months, according to Pentagon officials.
     A "lessons learned" report on the Joint Warrior Interoperability
Demonstration (JWID), recently approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
recommends these systems be fielded at the earliest possible date,
following the determination by exercise evaluators that they greatly
enhance the capabilities of U.S. forces across a broad spectrum of
military operations.
      The high-level Military Communications and Electronics Board
will be briefed on these recommendations and Pentagon officials
believe many, if not all, will then be put into motion. 
     "A lot of the [communications] technologies to be used in Bosnia
resulted from the JWID proof of concept," Ronald Elliot, Marine Corps
assistant chief of staff for command, control, communications,
computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems integration, told Defense
Daily. 
     Elliot was tapped last year by the Joint Staff to supervise the
exercise, which is held every year and rotates the service sponsor.
     "Those kinds of things being used in the commercial sector and
civil agencies that can be applied to military operations emerged
[from JWID]," Elliot said. "All of those are being planned to be
applied" to current operations, most notably Bosnia.
     According to officials at the Defense Information Systems Agency,
the lead agency in formulating the insights gained from the exercise,
the lessons learned report will be widely distributed beginning the
second week of January. 
     Although the JWID report doesn't specifically mention Bosnia and
recommend the systems in question should be utilized there, "if you
read between the lines you can certainly pull that out of this," a
DISA official said. "It does certainly say these capabilities should
be made available immediately."
     The communications systems being considered for use in NATO's
Operation Joint Endeavor as a result of JWID '95 serve a broad range
of purposes, according to officials familiar with the findings.
     Communications on Operational Modeling, Planning, and Simulation
Strategy (COMPSS), a training tool largely aimed at improving the
execution of air mission plans and fostering a smoother, more
effective air tasking order process, is being "bannered around for
going [to Bosnia]," the DISA official said. "It did very well in
JWID." COMPSS is an effort originally led by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency and is now under the auspices of the Defense 

Modeling and Simulation Organization.

     Another capability successfully demonstrated and being considered
for a Bosnian deployment is the Collaborative Contingency Targeting
(CCT) system, officials said. An evolution of an older program known
as Rapid Application of Air Power, CCT was developed to "solve the
targeting problems" encountered by pilots during the Persian Gulf War
such as dated information on the location and purpose of Iraqi bombing
targets. That "did very well" during JWID as well.
     The exercise also convinced officials that large screen displays
and electronic "white boarding" capabilities would enhance operational
planning and execution in any hot spot. White boarding is nothing more
than electronic "chalkboards" that can be used in briefings throughout
an operation such as Joint Endeavor.    
     Many of the capabilities such as COMPSS and CCT have been pursued
by the Pentagon as advanced technology demonstrations, aimed at
introducing next-generation systems to the warfighters in a timely
fashion. C4I officials are now urging these capabilities be leveraged
in Bosnia. 
     Some of the communications capabilities proven during JWID, and
now being considered for Bosnia are nearing the completion of their
development anyway, officials contend. These include the Global
Command and Control System (GCCS), a contractor-supported DISA
integration effort to tie together the services' disparate command and
control systems into a global network. GCCS is currently being tested
and is set to replace the outdated World-Wide Command and Control
System early next year.
     The Global Broadcast System (GBS), or at least much of what it
will offer, is also a candidate for use by U.S. troops in Bosnia,
according to officials. A Navy program, GBS is scheduled to leverage
commercial satellites to offer the military direct voice, data, and
video broadcast capability virtually everywhere on the planet
beginning in FY '96.
     "The key is even though [GBS] has specific requirements as a new
[program], that capability can now be fielded in Bosnia," a Pentagon
official said. "The constellations and equipment are there."
     Likewise, asynchronous transfer mode communications--already
fielded to U.S. forces in the continental U.S. and Hawaii--are ready
for deployment, according to officials. This technology provides
secure telecommunications service via satellite.
     The Pentagon official noted that although contractors are
developing these emerging systems, C4I officials are recommending only
the capabilities be introduced to the force quickly. In other words,
"even though a specific system has been demonstrated, [the capability]
could be introduced another way."  
     As Pentagon leaders decide which communications capabilities
should go to Bosnia and how best to introduce them, the warfighting
community in Europe is playing a crucial role as it determines what it
needs. Requests from the warfighters are being funneled through Air
Force Brig. Gen. Buford "Randy" Witt, the European Command's director
of command, control, communications, and computer systems, in
Stuttgart, Germany. Witt's billet is a DISA one. 
     According to Maj. Charlie Roberts, Witt's executive officer,
"EUCOM's role is to validate and expedite requests for communications
to support the U.S. side and NATO in Operation Joint Endeavor. A 24-
hour a day operations center, manned by a Crisis Action Team, has been
set up to field those requests and then task the relevant component to
meet them.

NYC SPECIAL ED PANEL RELEASES FINAL REPORT

The number of disabled students who attend regular classes
in New York City could rise dramatically under a reform
proposal by an independent panel.

More than 60 percent of the city's disabled students ages
six through 11 -- three times the national average -- now go
to public school in restrictive settings.

Too many students, especially those with mild disabilities,
are dumped into special education classes because regular
education teachers lack the capacity to meet their needs,
says the New York University (NYU) team that wrote the
report.

Funding Change Critical

Like a preliminary version released last summer, the report
recommends scrapping New York state's special education
funding formula (ED, May 30, 1995).

The panel says the current formula rewards schools for
segregating disabled students and should be replaced by an
"enrichment allocation" that each school could use to
improve services for all students, including those who are
disabled and at risk of failure.

The new report modifies the draft version's suggestion that
all special education and compensatory education funding
streams be merged.  The final report calls for preserving
the formula for students with severe disabilities.

It also expands on earlier recommendations that teacher
preparation programs address special education in basic
courses.

Former New York City schools Chancellor Ramon Cortines
requested the study as part of an effort to trim special ed
costs.

Nearly a quarter of the city's public school budget goes
toward educating 140,000 special education students.

The report suggests that its proposals could yield savings
by cutting transportation costs and reducing the need for
evaluations.

"The cost of evaluating, transporting, tracking, re-
evaluating, mainstreaming and de-certifying students who may
not be disabled is siphoning resources from a resource-
starved public education system," said Norm Fruchter, head
of the university team and co-director of the NYU Institute
for Education and Social Policy.

Rudolph Crew, who has replaced Cortines as the city's school
chief, said the report, "Focus on Learning," will be sent to
a variety of groups for review.

STUDENTS POOR AT EXPLAINING MATH, SCIENCE REASONING

While students worldwide can solve hands-on problems, they
have trouble explaining their answers, according to the
largest study ever of mathematics and science achievement.

Many students could show that light exercise boosts the
heart rate, for instance, but few were able to explain why
or how they reached that conclusion, say researchers
processing results from the Third International Mathematics
and Science Study (TIMSS).

"Writing something out clarifies your thinking," said
Maryellen Harmon, the study's international coordinator of
performance assessment, who previewed some preliminary
findings for Education Daily.

Over the past two years, TIMSS has posed traditional
multiple-choice questions and presented a series of
performance assessment tasks to elementary and secondary
students in 45 nations.

While the eagerly awaited TIMSS results won't be released
until September, field trials of 22 performance tasks
conducted in 19 countries in the summer of 1994 shed light
on weaknesses in students' math and science writing around
the world, Harmon added.

"Students need to learn to communicate, in English or
Norwegian or whatever language they speak, about anything
and everything that is important to them," she said, urging
educators to demand that students write every day in every
subject.

National Assessment of Educational Progress findings on U.S.
students released last year -- showing mild gains in science
and math, but hardly a ripple in reading and writing --
point up the relevance of Harmon's observations for American
children (ED, Aug. 18, 1994).

The Write Stuff?

"Students like to problem-solve, and they have a notion of
how to go about it, and they go about it well," Harmon said,
lauding nine- and 13-year-olds' showing on problems, such as
conducting laboratory experiments or arranging blocks to
solve math puzzles.

"Children of this age don't like to write," however, she
lamented.

Based on her 40 years of experience teaching U.S. students
in a range of subjects, Harmon said she wasn't surprised to
find students largely unable to put their thoughts on paper.

When a nation leans heavily on high-stakes, multiple-choice
tests, it offers students little incentive to refine their
communications skills, she said in an interview.

Means To An End

While only 27 of the 45 nations participating in TIMSS --
including the United States -- are using the performance
assessment part of the test, that number represents a step
forward for that type of evaluation, Harmon said.

Only six countries used such techniques in the previous math
and science survey about a decade ago by the Netherlands-
based International Association for the Evaluation of
Educational Research (ED, March 29, 1994).

The multiple-choice and short-answer items that make up most
of TIMSS reveal little more than whether students can
thoughtfully choose or guess correct answers, but
performance tasks enable assessors and educators to
"diagnose" problems in student performance, said Eugene
Gonzalez, TIMSS director of operations and data analysis.

"We can see the process that the student follows to get the
answer to a question, rather than just the product," he
said.

The performance aspect of TIMSS makes the test not only a
tool for comparing countries, but an engine for school
improvement, providing curriculum designers and teachers
insights about trouble spots, Gonzalez added.

It also helped the study cater to the varied curricular
emphases different nations brought to math and science, said
Ina Mullis, deputy director of TIMSS's international
headquarters at Boston College.

The hands-on format proved agreeable to educators from
Denmark, who claim their students never have taken a
multiple-choice test, and to those from Austria, where many
students spend more time on job training sites than in
schools, Mullis said.

Inequities Unclear

TIMSS turned up mixed findings on gender differences,
contrary to the conventional wisdom among U.S. researchers
that boys regularly outperform girls in science and math.

But socioeconomic and racial or ethnic disparities are
difficult to gauge in an international study, since
countries have varied ideas about what constitutes a poor
standard of living or a minority.   -- Geoff Camphire

REPORT FAULTS NEW YORK CITY FOR MINORITY, LD PLACEMENT

New York City public schools place too many black students
in special education, and improperly label other students as
learning disabled, an independent review panel says.

Those charges -- frequently leveled against special
education programs around the country -- are part of a new
report calling for major changes to the city's general and
special education systems.

The researchers found that black studentsin New York City
are placed in self-contained classes almost twice as often
as whites.

For every white student, there are 1.93 black students in
the total population.  But for every white, 3.74 blacks are
placed in self-contained classes.

And in schools where fewer than 20 percent of students are
black, the black referral rate to self-contained classes is
four times the rate for whites, they say.

Citing a 1985 study of New York City school children, they
said just 16 percent of 133 children labeled as learning
disabled met the criterion for that disability as stipulated
in state regulations.

In a follow-up study in 1992, researchers found that 15
percent of 175 students met the clinical definition of
learning disabled.

The report was compiled last year by five New York
University education specialists for former New York City
Chancellor Ramon Cortines.

LEGISLATIVE UPDATE

Congress and President Clinton will continue work this week
on a compromise to balance the budget in seven years.  In
the meantime, many federal agencies, including the Education
Department, will remain closed.

Awaiting the President's Signature ...

School Meals

H.R. 4: The House-Senate welfare reform bill would allow up
to seven states to receive school meals money in a block
grant over the next five years.

Last action: The House passed the bill, 245-178, on Dec. 21.
The Senate passed it the following day, 52-47.

Next action:  President Clinton has yet to receive H.R. 4,
but says he will veto it.

Recent or Upcoming Action ...

Budget Limits/Student Loan Cuts

H.R. 2491:  Congress's budget-balancing bill would have cut,
then capped, domestic discretionary spending -- which
includes most education programs -- at $219.7 billion this
year and kept it there for six more years.  It also called
for saving $4.5 billion in student loan spending, mostly by
limiting Direct Student Loan volume (ED, Nov. 15).  The bill
also would have trimmed school meal reimbursement rates.

Last action:  The president and the House and Senate
majority leaders met Friday, hoping by Saturday to have a
framework for budget negotiations.

Next action:  Talks are expected to resume this week.

Fiscal 1996 Appropriations

H.R. 2127:  The House version would cut money Congress
appropriates for Education Department programs by $3.6
billion from last year's funding, to $23.2 billion in fiscal
1996.  The bill would reduce Title I school district grants
by $1.1 billion and Safe and Drug-Free Schools grants by
$282 million.  Spending on student loans and other programs
would raise ED's budget to $27 billion (ED, July 13).  The
Senate's bill would reduce ED appropriations by $2.1
billion, to $24.7 billion, including cuts of $679 million
from Title I and $66 million from Safe and Drug-Free schools
(ED, Sept. 14).  President Clinton's initial fiscal 1996
budget proposal would have raised ED appropriations 4
percent (ED, Feb. 7).

Last action:  Temporary funding for ED and several other
agencies expired Dec. 15.  House Republicans want to keep ED
-- and other agencies without fiscal 1996 spending bills --
closed until Clinton and Congress agree to a plan to balance
the budget in seven years.  The House passed H.R. 2127 in
August, but the Senate version is stalled over health and
labor policy.

Next action:  Senators probably won't take up their bill
until Congress begins a new session late this month.

Just Introduced ...

Higher Education Reform

H.R. 2834:  Would amend the Higher Education Act to improve
programs' accountability.

Last action:  Introduced by Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., on Dec.
22;  referred to the House Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee.

Next action:  No action is scheduled.

COMPUTER COMPANY AWARDS GRANTS
FOR USING TECHNOLOGY FOR DISABLED


   The NEC Foundation of America is giving grants totaling
$225,000 to 11 organizations focusing on science and
technology education and/or assistive technologies for
persons with disabilities.

   NEC said the grants are consistent with the company's own
corporate philosophy of "sharing the benefits of technology
with society and helping to advance human potential."

   Kenjiro Nitta, president, NEC Foundation of America,
said, "Through these grants, we help to assure that
individuals - regardless of physical ability - have the
skills to continue to advance the boundaries of technology
on both a personal and societal level."

   Following are the education-related organizations
receiving grants from the foundation:

   y The Jason Foundation for Education, Waltham, Mass.,
$25,000, for Teacher Enhancement: An Innovative Approach to
Preparing the Nation's Students for the 21st Century, to
develop skills of elementary- and secondary-level classroom
teachers to use rapidly emerging education technologies,
including global telecommunications systems such as the
Internet and World Wide Web.

   y Junior Engineering Technical Society, Alexandria, Va.,
$50,000, for expansion of the National Engineering Design
Challenge academic program and competition, which engages
teams of high school students in developing prototype
devices to demonstrate the principles of universal design.
The design specifications require the device be usable by
people with and without disabilities.

   y Long Island Museum of Science and Technology, Melville,
N.Y., $10,000, for planning of a new hands-on science and
technology museum that will include exhibits related to the
technologies of information, the environment, biology and
elec-tronics. The facility is to augment classroom learning
and is expected to be a major New York State cultural
attraction.

   y The George Lucas Educational Foundation, Nicasio,
Calif., $25,000, for a major public awareness campaign
related to Edutopia: Innovative Efforts Project, to include
a video and resource document promoting ways education is
improving so all students will be prepared to live and work
in an increasingly complex, highly technical world.

   y Vanderbilt University, Peabody College, Nashville,
Tenn., $26,000, for national expansion of the Teacher in
Residence Program, which will bring outstanding classroom
educators to participate in university research, teacher
education and program development related to the infusion of
information technology in education.

   The NEC Foundation of America was established in 1991 and
endowed at $10 million by NEC of Japan, a major company in
the computer and communications technology fields, and its
U.S. subsidiaries. The foundation supports programs with
national reach and impact in science and technology
education, principally at the secondary level, and assistive
technology for persons with disabilities. Since its
inception, the foundation has awarded 56 grants totaling
nearly $1.5 million.

   For information, contact Sylvia Clark of the NEC

AMERITECH AWARDS GRANT FOR TEACHING
DETROIT TEACHERS TO USE INTERNET


   The Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program (DAPCEP)
received a $32,500 grant from Ameritech, a regional
telephone company, to help students and teachers use the
Internet.

   The money will support DAPCEP's Internet teacher-training
program in which more than 60 Detroit teachers will receive
eight hours of instruction on how to use the Internet in the
classroom. Teachers then will become consultants for DAPCEP
and work with students after school hours to assist with
Internet research projects.

   "The Internet has so many valuable resources for
education," said Lyn Allen, Ameritech's director of
contributions. "Our goal with this contribution is to try
and move the Internet from a once-a-week toy to a natural
part of every lesson plan."

   Kenneth Hill, DAPCEP executive director, said teacher
training will begin in February and run through April.
"Teachers need to learn how to use the Internet to prepare
our students for the information age," he said. "We are
excited about this opportunity to provide more resources for
teachers and students."

   DAPCEP, a pre-college education program, has 5,000 middle
and high school students enrolled. Representatives from
local industry, 11 colleges and universities, the Detroit
Public Schools, parents and community groups work together
to offer school and Saturday classes, summer enrichment
programs, mentoring, tutoring, summer jobs, scholarships and
teacher training. DAPCEP celebrates its 20th anniversary
this year.

   For more information, contact Sara Snyder of Ameritech at
(313) 223-7192.

OMAHA SUPERINTENDENT ADVISES PEERS
TO INVOLVE STAKEHOLDERS IN TECHNOLOGY


   Involvement of all stakeholders in a community is vital
to developing support for major investments in school
technology, according to the experience of one Midwest
school superintendent.

   A "multifaceted approach" to educating and involving
school staff, board members, parents and members of the
community at large was critical to the success of the
Westside Community Schools in Omaha, Neb., said
Superintendent Ken Bird.

   Writing in Edutopia, the newsletter of the George Lucas
Educational Foundation, Bird said a recent survey of
residents in his district showed 96 percent "support our
investment in technology." He attributes that support to the
efforts made to involve the entire community in the
transition to modern technology in the schools.

   Bird said he talks regularly to people about how
technology can play a positive role in educational
transformation. "The goal of this daily discourse is to help
all the stakeholders become aware of our vision - that
technology provides tools to increase our capacity to
gather, organize, analyze, and impart information and that
it helps increase learners' abilities in all academic areas
as well as areas such as critical thinking, problem solving,
communication and social skills," he said.

   A successful transition requires extensive involvement
and full support of a district's teaching staff, Bird said.
"So teachers were invited to become actively involved in
designing and planning the learning environments in which
they conducted their work." It also was realized that the
infusion of technology "would create a critical need for
ongoing staff development, with an emphasis on 'ongoing' -
not one-time training opportunities."

   Another vital component of the strategy "has been
building a sense of need and urgency with the board of
education," he said. "We accomplished this by making
technology an integral part of the board's operation and by
giving members the support they need to facilitate their
learning."

   The board's meeting room is equipped with state-of-the-
art presentation equipment and meetings frequently include
presentations by students and teachers who use "the
opportunity to demonstrate to the board - and to the public
- how fundamental technology has become to learning."

   Each board member's home was connected with the
districtwide computer network, Bird said. "Their work
stations provide instant access to the district's
information bulletin board, calendars and e-mail, as well as
access to all of the resources available on the Internet.
This active involvement with technology has been a
significant factor in gaining and maintaining board
support."

   Providing opportunities for community members to use new
technologies and experience their value "was a key element
in our transformation," the Omaha superintendent said.

   "Our district has a long tradition of active community
participation and we are committed to weaving the fabric of
the community and the schools. I was especially concerned
about trying to prevent the emergence of a 'haves' and
'have-nots' situation, in which students from families with
technological resources in their homes could gain a
considerable advantage over those whose families could not
afford such resources." While the district could not put a
computer in every home, "we have been able to do some things
which have provided greater access to computers for
everyone," he said.

Low-Income Access

   Bird cited an initiative at Amber Ridge Family Education
Center in an apartment complex of many low-income families.
"The center provides a wide variety of services to the
families of students who live there, including access to
computers. The students use computers for homework
assignments and other learning experiences. Adults, too, can
use the computers and training is provided for those who
don't have computer skills."

   Also, the newly renovated Westside Middle School has been
opened to the public in the evenings and on Saturdays.
"Parents, students and 'empty nesters' take advantage of the
school's computers, with students often guiding their
parents and grandparents on their first trip down the
'information highway.'"

   Bird noted new technologies "have helped us move toward
better teaching and learning, more challenging roles for
teachers, and greater levels of community involvement. Yet
none of this would be possible without using the oldest tool
available to a superintendent: careful cultivation of
relationships with the school board, the staff and the
community. In Westside, all of these stakeholders now
recognize that technology is an integral part of society and
that it must be part of our schools and the learning
process."

Westside Community Schools, 909 South 76th St., Omah, NE

PENNSYLVANIA DISTRICTS JOIN PROJECT
TO EXTEND VIDEOCONFERENCING ABILITY


   Six rural school districts in Northeast Pennsylvania
joined in a project using the technology of
videoconferencing to improve education opportunities for
their students.

   The school districts, working with three colleges,
experimented with videoconferencing during the 1994-95
school year, allowing rural, remote schools to expand high
school curriculums, offer college classes to high school
students, assist with staff development for local teachers
and offer career training and college classes to local
residents.

   While capable of offering a strong educational program,
the district was not able previously to offer the number and
diversity of courses available in suburban areas.

   The consortium recently applied for a five- year grant to
expand the videoconferencing network to 40 sites throughout
Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.

   Besides linking the involved schools with other schools,
the network has the potential to connect them to other
resources, such as museums, historic sites, art galleries
and performance centers.

   Typical of the districts involved in the program is the
Towanda Areas School District.

Learning Language

   In 1994, a teacher went to Towanda High School to teach
Japanese 101 to students from three different school
districts. In exchange for teaching the Japanese class, the
teacher made it possible for students at Towanda to receive
distance learning from other schools.

   Without videoconferencing, there would have been no
Japanese instruction because the number of students in one
school would not justify paying a teacher's salary for that
course.

   However, videoconferencing enabled the foreign-language
curriculum in six school districts to expand from French and
Spanish to include German I-III, Japanese, Russian and
Latin.

   Besides being a cost-effective way to enhance curriculum,
videoconferencing is helping students in the schools make
friends many miles away, according to a consortium
spokeswoman.

   The consortium also allowed high school students to take
college introductory classes in literature, anthropology,
psychology and fine arts available from College
Misericordia. The classes also were available to local
residents during day and evening hours.

   Teachers have taken advantage of some college credit
courses previously not available in their area and, in
addition to those classes, there are many opportunities for
teacher seminars.

   For more information on the Pennsylvania consortium,
contact Kimberly Scholtz at (603) 436-6690.

CANADIAN FIRM EXPLORES ADVANCES
IN DISTANCE-LEARNING TECHNOLOGY


   An advance in distance-learning technology is being
explored by the General DataComm (GDC) multimedia research
center in Montreal.

   Unlike most telecommunications networks, which are
designed for point-to-point connections, multimedia
applications such as distance learning and video
conferencing usually are multipoint.

   Recently, the research center announced, it previewed a
new product that supports the deployment of multipoint
multimedia services using existing network infrastructures.

   The not-yet-announced product, a powerful multimedia
multipoint server with multistandard and multibandwidth
capability, represents two years of design and development
work at the Montreal-based center.

   When completed, the new "video interactive product" is
expected to allow a broad range of multimedia services to be
deployed on a network, the center said.

   At the preview, musicians situated in remote locations in
Toronto, Montreal and Laval, Que., played instruments in
unison, successfully recreating the sound of a live
orchestra.

   As the musicians played, their images were joined on a
large projection screen set up at the preview for the
product.

   According to Shaker Sabri, vice president of the
Multimedia Research Center, the server's multimedia
functionality and multipoint connectivity will allow for
creation of "a broad range of services such as video
conferencing, distance learning and telemedicine."

   For more information on the server and other GDC work,
contact: General DataComm, 1579 Straits Turnpike,
Middlebury, CT 06762-1299; (203) 574-1118.

TELEPHONE COMPANY REDUCES RATES
IN INDIANA, MAKES GRANT IN WISCONSIN


   Ameritech donated $1.4 million to the Wisconsin Advanced
Telecommunications Foundation to underwrite grants for
technology projects in education and health care.

   The $40.5 million foundation, created last year after
passage of the Wisconsin Information Superhighway law, was
established to support advanced telecommunications projects
and educate users across the state. Funding will come from
the state's telecommunications companies.

   Ameritech, which provides telephone and other
communications services in five Midwest states, has
committed $13.5 million to the founda-tion over a seven-year
period.

   The company was the first telecommunications firm to
contribute to the foundation's endowment fund with a $1
million donation in 1995.

   In another development, the telephone company announced a
cut in its basic telephone rates in Indiana as part of the
company's "Opportunity Indiana" program.

   That program involves investment of money to extend two-
way interactive video links to all interested schools,
hospitals and major government centers in Ameritech's
Indiana service area.

   Nearly 60 schools throughout the state already have taken
advantage of Opportunity Indiana to extend advanced
communications links to their classrooms, Ameritech said.

   The links bring to nearly 200 the total number of Indiana
schools using Ameritech distance-learning technology to
extend the reach of their classrooms beyond their campuses.

   The technology allows students to take "electronic field
trips" to the Indianapolis Zoo and museums and allows
teachers to take continuing-education courses from their
school.

   In addition, as part of a six-year, $30 million Ameritech
contribution to the Corporation for Educational
Communications, an independent non-profit organization, 142
schools and supporting organizations have been awarded
grants that include funding for video equipment and
distance-learning curriculum development.

   For more information, contact Ameritech at (800) 242-
1553.

DISTRICT ACKNOWLEDGES ERROR, SETTLES
WITH STUDENT PUNISHED FOR INTERNET USE


   A Washington State school district reached a settlement
with a former student disciplined for writing a spoof of his
school and posting it on his World Wide Web home page.

   When the principal of Newport High School in the Seattle
suburb of Bellevue learned of the posting, she revoked the
school's recommendation of Paul Kim for a National Merit
scholarship and for college admissions.

   After Kim challenged the action, the Bellevue School
District acknowledged his free-speech rights on the Internet
were violated.

   Kathleen Taylor, director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Washington, which backed Kim in his challenge of
the district's punitive actions, said, "The district has
recognized that the principal had no authority to discipline
a student for expressing his opinions on his own time on a
home computer."

   The district agreed to pay Kim $2,000, to seek to have
him reinstated as a National Merit finalist and to apologize
for punishing him. Kim's spoof, on his "Unofficial Newport
High School Home Page," lampooned his classmates as being
obsessed with sex. It also included links to other Internet
material with sexually explicit content.

JOSTENS OFFERS SCHOOLS NEW LINE
OF LEARNING MODULES FOR SCHOOLS


   In a move to help schools "ease into" the acquisition of
an integrated software-based curriculum, Jostens Learning is
offering a new Learning Modules product line.

   Learning Modules is a series of focused, integrated
curricula packages that allow schools to pick and choose the
curricula they need by subject matter and grade level to
build a schoolwide implementation system over time.

   The packages "offer all the advantages of comprehensive
networked curriculum without the high implementation costs
associated with a broad-based system," Jostens said.

   The modular offering is a departure for Jostens, which
previously sold its courseware in one large comprehensive
package, with the option of separate add-on tools, such as
Microsoft Works or multimedia encyclopedias.

   There are 12 learning modules in all, including Jostens
A+dvantage Management System, an operating system offering
schools the opportun-ity to run any software and curriculum
they desire, in addition to the Jostens Learning curriculum.

   Each learning module begins with the A+dvantage
Management System and then is combined with various pieces,
such as Research-Writing tools (2-6), Mathematics (4-6), or
Middle School Science.

   Another new module is A+dvantage Worldware, a teacher-
managed Internet connection that allows educators to
identify and link resources from around the globe with their
own software-based curriculum.

   For more information about the learning modules or to
receive a catalog, call (800) 244-0575.

IBM AND APPLE HEAT UP THE K-12 HARDWARE MARKET/Apple to Support
Mac-based ILS

IBM has announced a powerful addition to its PS/2 Model 25 line
of educational personal computers, targeting teachers and
administrators. Apple also had important news for the K-12
market: in a videocassette mailed to thousands of educators,
Apple Chairman John Sculley made official what has been widely
rumored--it will introduce an inexpensive, color Macintosh,
during the 1990-91 school year, which will also be able to run
Apple II software (via an Apple IIe emulation board).

Education market discounts for existing Mac products have been
increased "significantly" over the current discount structure,
effective immediately. (While Apple does not publish its discount
schedule, a spokesperson suggested that, for example, some K-12
buyers will be able to get the Mac Plus for under $700). Apple
also announced the System 7.0 operating system for the Mac, which
it has released in a Beta test version to selected software
developers.

The new IBM machine, called the PS/2 Model 25 286 is the first of
the educational series to be able to run Windows and Presentation
Manager, the object-oriented multitasking operating environments
which are the hallmark of the PS/2 line's models 30 and higher.
With it, IBM hopes to extend its reach beyond student instruction
to powerful but user-friendly and affordable work stations for
school staff. Like all MS DOS PCs, the Model 25 286 will be
easily connected to high speed local area networks, able to link
teacher's units to school office or district resources.

The new Mac will correct some glaring weaknesses in Apple's K-12
line which have given IBM the opportunity to mount a far more
serious challenge to Apple's K-12 dominance than most industry
observers had believed possible only a few years ago. During the
period from the 1985-86 school year to the 1988-89 school year,
IBM's share of new machines going into the K-12 market has risen
from 5% to 30% while Apple's has fallen from 70% to 54%. IBM
Chairman John Akers recently suggested that IBM may move ahead of
Apple in K-12 market share as soon as the end of the current
school year.

Apple built its position in the K-12 market on the Apple II
platform, a technology increasingly seen by educators and others
as a dead end. Apple's own focus on Macintosh technology for the
business market over the past several years, has left its Apple
II line exposed in networking capabilities, on-board mass storage
and processing speed -- all areas of strength for IBM. Although
the Mac is competitive in these regards, they've been too
expensive for the K-12 market and, at the low end, have lacked
the color monitor considered essential for effective educational
software.

Because of these weaknesses, integrated learning system (ILS) and
administrative software developers have largely shunned the Apple
II platform in favor of MS DOS, giving IBM a significant edge in
increased K-12 penetration. Now, assuming Apple delivers on its
promise, it has a chance to again become a serious competitor in
these critical market segments. Software publishers seeking more
information about Apple's support program for education market
products should contact Don Fields, Apple manager for education
solutions, at 408/974-8595 (Cupertino, CA).

HELLER REPORT News Analysis

If the three most important factors in the success of a retail
establishment are "location, location and location," are the
equivalent factors for winning the school market "installed base,
installed base and installed base?" If so, Apple may feel it can
take some comfort in its new strategy despite IBM's PR to the
contrary. While IBM is creeping up on Apple in terms of new
machines going into the market, it still faces at least a 2-to-1
disadvantage relative to Apple in terms of total installed base
(all Apple products vs. all brands of MS DOS PCs).

Until recently, Apple's predominant market share and the
consequent attention of most educational software developers,
gave Apple a solid lock on the K-12 market. The new Mac, by
preserving schools' investment in Apple II software and by
supporting networking technology and computing power competitive
with MS DOS, will help Apple to position itself as the best of
both worlds.

It won't be that simple. While Apple is playing catch-up in
networking and ILS, IBM has been significantly altering the rules
of the game -- radically expanding the expectations of K-12
decision makers -- in ways that still leave Apple at a
disadvantage. From IBM's perspective, the educational PC is no
longer just a free-standing educational appliance; now it is one
piece of a seamless web of interconnected data processing power
extending from the classroom to the school office and on to
district, regional and state headquarters, as well as into the
homes of students, teachers and administrators.

IBM doesn't see "educational software" as what it used to be
either. The traditional instructional drill and practice,
tutorials, simulations and productivity tools are only a piece of
it -- now there must also be a comprehensive suite of
administrative and management systems ranging from instructional
management, student attendance and grade reporting to food
service management, bus scheduling and salary administration.

In other words, IBM is changing the unit of competition from the
desktop PC, and its attendant floppy- or hard disk-based
software, to networks of computers spanning the range from PC
through mainframe, and to software systems ranging from
instructional floppies to mainframe packages able to manage
information from all the schools in a state. In this type of a
face off, IBM is coming at Apple from a position of considerable
and unequally matched strength.

If this were just IBM's world view, Apple could treat it as
speculation. But IBM has come to these conclusions "the old-
fashioned way," by listening to teachers, administrators,
superintendents and state agency executives who are throwing up
their hands over piecemeal solutions to school computing needs.
After years of grass-roots support for computers in schools by
students and parents, it is as if the superintendents and
principals are saying "I give up; you win! Okay, we'll have
computers in our schools. But (1) the educational software's
going to be comprehensive and curricularly relevant, (2) the
systems are going to support teachers in accomplishing their
daily classroom objectives, and (3) the technology will encompass
everything from the classroom to the office and on to state
headquarters."

Is the game worth the candle? No matter how one looks at the
data, the upside potential for PC hardware and software in the
K-12 market is still enormous. Current penetration is less than
five percent in terms of PCs for students and far less in terms
of PCs for teachers and administrators. Add in the market for
minicomputer- and mainframe-based management systems, and its
clear that the stakes in K-12 are extremely high.

IBM has committed at least $30 million in grants for K-12 market
development, and, according to industry sources, has almost 1,200
people in K-12 marketing support (i.e., not counting sales reps).
Apple's new strategy should put it back in the game, but what it
takes to play will never be the same.

VANDERBILT'S PEABODY COLLEGE DEVELOPS "JASPER" VIDEODISCS/Seeks
School Market Distributor

A group of educators from Vanderbilt University's Peabody College
of Education (Nashville, TN) is developing interactive video
products to teach multi-step problem solving to 5th and 6th grade
students. The first two videodiscs of the Jasper Project (named
after the protagonist of the storyline, Jasper Woodbury) are
being testing in schools in Nashville and a few other areas
around the country. About 50 discs have been sent out for testing
to date, said Dr. Bob Sherwood, associate director of Peabody's
Learning Technology Center. The program is being simultaneously
produced on videotape as well as disc, so that it can be used by
a wider number of schools, according to project director Dr. John
Brandsford.

The goal is to produce at least six Jasper discs. The third and
fourth discs are in production; Dr. Brandsford said the
University is hoping to get Federal funds to help it complete
discs five and six. The vice-chancellor's office is currently
talking to several distributors of educational software in hopes
of striking an agreement to market Jasper to schools. Dr.
Sherwood said that the University is hoping the Jasper discs will
go at "a reasonable price", which he put at under $300. Dr.
Bransford noted that Vanderbilt would put any profit it makes
from the project directly back into research.

The Jasper discs are appropriate for teaching "math-impaired" and
at-risk students, as well as adult remedial education, Dr.
Brandsford said. Students watching the program for the first time
see a linear, 17-minute version, and then go back for clues to
solve Jasper's problems using mathematics. With videodisc
technology, there is the advantage of random access; in the
videotaped versions, students watch the entire tape again and
raise their hands when they feel the tape should be stopped to
discuss a clue, Dr. Bransford said.

Each Jasper episode is costing close to $100,000 to produce, Dr.
Sherwood said, noting that programs demand high quality video
because children are accustomed to TV's high production values.
In addition to the videotape versions, the Learning Technology
Center is developing training tapes and workbooks for teachers.

SURVEY: $1.3 MILLION COMPUTING BUDGET YEARLY AVERAGE FOR HIGHER
ED SCHOOLS

With many areas of the economy sagging, technology providers may
take comfort to know that the market for computers--and
particularly microcomputers--in the nation's colleges and
universities is robust. According to a recent study by Globe
Research Corp. on behalf of The Chronicle of Higher Education,
institutes of higher education budget a yearly average of $1.3
million each for computing purposes, a figure that includes fees
for hardware, software, support staff and courseware. The budgets
ranged from an average low of $482,000 per year for two-year
colleges, up to $3.37 million annually for large institutions.

The study, Computers in Higher Education: The 1990s, Current
Usage, Responsibilities and Purchasing Trends, is based on data
from 2,426 responses out of a mailing of 4,000 questionnaires,
representing a return rate of 60.9%.

Nearly every college and university already owns microcomputers
(the survey placed the number at 96.5%), with an average of 101
microcomputers per institution. Small institutions averaged the
lowest number of units, at 58 each, while large institutions
averaged 308 microcomputers. The survey found that colleges and
universities averaged 3.6 computer centers each, and that the
majority of microcomputers were located in the computer centers,
administrative offices, individual departments and libraries.

About 16.7% of campus computers were located in dormitories. The
survey found that between 18% and 24% of the responding
institutions recommended brands or types of hardware to students;
however, only 1.1% of respondents required students to purchase
computers. Nearly half (48.6%) made some sort of microcomputer
hardware recommendation to students, faculty and/or
administrative staff.

According to the study's findings, IBM retains a wide margin over
its nearest competitor, Apple, in the competition for market
share. The brands or models most recommended by respondents were
of the IBM PC family, including the IBM PC, PC/XT, PC/AT, PC/RT
and OS/2 (a combined total of 70.2%), followed by the Apple
Macintosh (31.3%). IBM-compatible clones were assessed at 27.6%
of the market, ahead of Zenith (24.7%), Apple II (20.3), AT&T
(9.7%), Hewlett-Packard (6.4%) and DEC (5.7%). Other familiar
names, including Leading Edge, Epson, Compaq and Tandy, were all
placed at under 5% of the market.

Globe's results confirmed the heavy use of computer networks in
higher ed. Seven out of ten schools reported that their micros
were networked to other computers. Of schools using networks, 78%
had their micros connected to a mainframe; 54.1% were using
micro-to-micro networks.

Software Centrally Pooled on Campus

One significant finding of the report revealed that a very large
number of institutions--averaged to 43% in the survey--had a
central pool of microcomputer software. Nearly all had word
processing and spreadsheet software available from the pool
(98.1% and 93.4%, respectively), and most had database management
software as well as programs in graphics and statistics. Of those
institutions, WordPerfect was the dominant word processing
product (66.9%), while Lotus 1-2-3 remained the top spreadsheet
package (81.9% of schools). dBase topped the list of database
management software (81.2% of schools) and SPSS was the top
statistical product (45.2%).

Almost half of all institutions --48.1%--said they "would be more
interested in software if site licensing were offered," the
report states. The potential number of microcomputers that would
come under site licensing averaged out to 195.5 units per
institution. That figure rose to 233.4 micros at four-year
colleges and universities and leaped to 437.1 units for large
institutions. The potential number of individual users in site
licensing came to an average of 850 individuals, while the number
of potential concurrent users averaged to 295. The majority of
schools also said they preferred a one-time payment for site
licensing rights, as opposed to an annual fee.

Purchasing trends for peripherals were also looked at in the
study. Among higher ed officials using microcomputers as part of
their jobs, 39.9% said they planned to add a laser printer to
their system within the next two years. Modems were on the
shopping list for 25.1% of the officials, while 31.7% said they
planned to add a scanner.

The Role of Purchasing Committees

A 1989 survey published by Globe Research Corp. focusing on
higher ed purchasing patterns found that, in the majority of
schools, purchasing committees were involved in the purchases of
computer products, software and telecommunications systems. The
responses were taken from people who had served on institutional
purchasing committees in the 12 months prior to the survey. The
study, The Purchasing Process in Higher Education, determined
that purchasing committees were involved in the decision to buy
computer equipment, products and systems in over 80% of
institutions surveyed (83.2%).

Purchasing committees were involved in the acquisition of
audio/video equipment and products in 55.9% of all institutions,
while such committees were active in the buying of
telecommunications equipment in 33.2% of all schools. Of
institutions surveyed, 32.2% of senior administrative officials
were involved in purchasing telephone equipment, and 30% of those
senior officials were involved in the purchase of long-distance
services.

Copies of both higher ed surveys can be obtained from The
Chronicle of Higher Education, Inc., 1255 23rd St. NW,
Washington, D.C. 20037.

US DOE'S TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICE IN FORMATIVE STAGE

The US Dept. of Ed's Office of Training Technology Transfer
(OTTT), established two years ago under a Federal Trade Act, has
yet to hire personnel and create an agenda to carry out its
mission -- but recent activity suggests both may happen soon. If
so, publishers may find some product opportunities involving
government-funded training materials. The goal of the OTTT,
according to DOE's Dr. Lucille Reifman, is to "facilitate
transfer of education and training technology, with educational
and Federal support, to technology and training institutes."
Although startup of the OTTT was approved in 1988, funding has
yet to be sent to the unit.

Dr. Reifman feels that Federal money will be arriving soon;
Congressional legislation had proposed $3 million for the first
year of operation, with subsequent years funded "as needed," Dr.
Reifman said. The $3 million was supposed to come out of a larger
technology training initiative that has yet to gain official
approval, she added. During the Spring of 1990, Dr. Reifman and
other officials will be meeting to explore issues central to the
unit, and to formulate how policy will be conducted.

Once the Office takes shape, the plan is to establish a network
of OTTT training technology centers in every government office
that uses such technology. Then the OTTT would seek to take an
inventory of training technology programs used by the U.S.
government, analyze them, and disseminate information. Of course,
a portion of this work will have to be contracted out; after a
budget in place, the OTTT will have the ability to award grants
and contracts, Dr. Reifman said.

The OTTT has the potential to become an important source of new
information and training programs, handling everything from
language courses originally used by the State Dept. to the Job
Skills Education Program (JSEP), a computerized job training
program developed by the U.S. Army, Florida State University and
Ford Aerospace (see related article in HR April '90 issue).

One of the main issues facing OTTT officials will be that of
proprietary rights, said Dr. Reifman, touching on ownership of
courseware developed on behalf of the government, or by a branch
of government itself.

The OTTT would probably rely on terms found in the original
agreements between individual contractors and the government
regarding intellectual property rights, she said. Dr. Reifman
added that the OTTT, as it is currently being proposed, would
have the power to turn over certain proprietary rights to the
original manufacturer if it were found to be in the public
interest. She added that some of the powers proposed for the OTTT
"may not be practical for this office to exercise," requiring a
cohesive, legislated policy instead.

One concern she raised was the future of material found in the
public domain--would a private company really push a product, or
seek to modernize it, if it were public material? Or if a product
were developed to work on a mainframe or very powerful PC
platforms, like JSEP, how could the OTTT facilitate JSEP's
reincarnation into a less expensive PC product, so that colleges
could use it?

The Heller Report will be following the formation of the Office
of Training Technology Transfer and will bring our readers
periodic updates as to its progress.

RURAL ELECTRICAL AND TELEPHONE COOPERATIVES ASSISTING SCHOOLS
WITH DISTANCE LEARNING AND TELECOM MATERIAL

If the latest developments in Arkansas are indicative of a trend,
local energy cooperatives are playing an increasingly important
role helping to bring rural school districts into the
technological 20th century.

The Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation (AECC), the
umbrella unit to which 17 of the state's 18 energy co-ops belong,
is using some of its profits to purchase satellite transmission
and reception equipment for each district in the state. Jim
Davis, a spokesperson for the AECC, said buying and installing
the satellite equipment--transmission and reception for each of
AR's 389 districts--will cost at least $500,000, probably much
more.

To date, 300 Bentley 8 dishes (supplied by Western Manufacturing
Co. of Cabot, AR) have been purchased; receivers will be bought
from Satellite Technology Services (St. Louis, MO). The purchases
are being made centrally by AECC, but each district is overseeing
the transport of the equipment to its locality. The dishes are
expected to be placed in district high schools, Davis said.
Although there is one rural electrical cooperative that is not a
member of AECC, Davis said the AECC will donate equipment to the
district falling within the non-member's area. One district has
already installed its equipment; the rest of the districts are
expected to begin in mid-May, he said.

The Role of Rural Co-ops

Rural electrical cooperatives, established to provide electricity
in remote and rural areas, began to flourish in the 1930s-40s.
Owned by its customers, the co-ops are run by boards elected by
the community. According to Richard Larochelle of the National
Rural Electrical Co-op Association (Washington, D.C.), the
nation's 1,000 rural electrical co-ops serve 25-30 million
people, representing 70% of the land mass in the U.S. Each co-op,
on average, serves three or four counties.

Rural telephone cooperatives are patterned much the same way. The
telephone cooperatives have also been active in helping schools
get up-to-date technology; in several states, the rural telephone
cooperatives will fund and oversee installation of a fiber optic
infrastructure so that a district can have phone, data and
distance learning communications in its schools. In Oklahoma,
rural phone co-ops have been coordinating the introduction of
fiber optics in some districts, while in others it has been
helping schools get grants for satellite dishes, according to
Shirley Bloomfield of the National Telephone Co-op Association
(Washington, D.C.).

In many cases the U.S. government's Rural Electrification Agency
will lend money to the rural co-op to pay for the infrastructure,
Bloomfield said. If the money to retool takes the form of a loan,
districts will "lend out" the school's distance learning or
computer network after hours and gradually recoup the costs in
this manner.

Interestingly, rural telephone cooperatives are not hampered by
the same restrictions as the RBOCs. Many of the rural co-ops have
established separate subsidiaries through which they participate
in cable TV ventures--a precaution taken so that the basic phone
bill does not wind up subsidizing cable or other units,
Bloomfield said. While RBOCs are presently prevented by Judge
Greene's MFJ from becoming for-profit information providers,
Bloomfield does not see that situation lasting for more than a
year or two. "Our only concern is that when restrictions are
lifted on the RBOCs, that there are safeguards for the rural
co-ops," she said, adding that the rural organizations would want
assurance "that we would have access to the technology" to
continue its own ventures.  Some industry observers contend that
RBOC support for pending rural distance learning legislation,
such as the Rural Partnership Act of 1989 ("Rural Star Schools;"
see the related story in the Sept. 1989 HR), which would provide
$110 million for telecommunications and computer equipment and
programming for rural schools, is part of the RBOC lobbying
effort to chip away at MFJ.

VITA TO USE LOW-ALTITUDE SATELLITE AND RADIO MODEMS FOR AFRICA
PROJECT

To help foster communications between schools of higher education
in Africa, Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA)--a
non-profit volunteer organization in Boston, MA--plans to supply
universities in Nigeria with computers, radio modems and packet
radios to help deliver voice and data communications. This effort
will be aided by a low-altitude satellite launched earlier this
year, called PACSAT, that will provide store-and-forward
communications on an experimental radio band. Moreover, the
computer and radio components will be powered by solar panels,
VITA president Henry Norman told The Heller Report.

Funding for the project came from a variety of sources, including
The Hoover Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, the
latter granting funds for the solar equipment. Funds for the
PACSAT satellite came from VITA ($350,000) as well as
organizations such as TERC (Technical Education Resource
Centers), which purchased transponder space in advance of the
launch.

The low-altitude satellite was built at the University of
Surrey's Spacecraft Research Institute in the United Kingdom,
while the American-made radio modems (actually, terminal node
controllers) are from Applied Electronic Associates, located in
Washington state. The packet radios are of Japanese origin,
Norman said. The terminal node controllers (TNCs) break
information into small "packets" that can be transmitted via
radio to the receiving computer; another TNC at the reception
site decodes the information "packets" for display on the PC
screen. The system can be powered either by solar cells or by
conventional lead-acid battery.

PACSAT is designed to act as an "orbiting mailbox," because in
its low orbit (700km), it will pass over most points on earth at
least twice daily. Depending on a query's point of origin, a
message can be uploaded and then unloaded at its destination in a
maximum of 12 hours' time. When PACSAT is over a ground station,
it will signal the station to turn itself on to transmit or
receive messages. Based on this timed orbit, the longest
query-response cycle will be no longer than 24 hours,
considerably speeding up communications in areas where there are
no telephone or electrical lines.

The PACSAT initiative is expected to act as a testing ground for
a more expanded project, called VITASAT. It is anticipated that
the VITASAT satellite will cost roughly $1.2 million. VITASAT is
expected to serve a minimum of 35 ground stations, although a
VITA-distributed brochure on the project states that the goal is
to have "an internal network of 50 stations," which will serve up
to 500 remote locations. About half of those will be in Africa,
with the rest in other third world spots.

TERC's "Global Laboratory" Program

TERC bought transponder space on PACSAT for the TERC-coordinated
Global Laboratory Project. The project, begun this Spring, would
have used PACSAT and radio so that high schools in Brazil could
communicate with schools in the U.S., Australia, the U.S.S.R. and
Canada to compile information on global warming. However, a
source at TERC said it has been unable to secure funding to
continue with the PACSAT part of Global Laboratory. The project
is going ahead with countries that already have conventional
phone lines (the U.S., Australia, Canada and the U.S.S.R.).
TERC's future involvement with PACSAT will be decided in about
one month, the source said.

IBM, NY STATE TEAM UP FOR $5 MIL PILOT TECHNOLOGY PROJECT

IBM and the New York State Dept. of Education announced they will
jointly enter the pilot phase of a plan to bring technology to
all schools in the state.

The pilot will serve to help validate the DOE's Long Range Plan
for Technology in Elementary and Secondary Schools in New York
State, an initiative long promoted by the DOE and expected to be
approved by the NY state Board of Regents this month. To help
initiate the two-year pilot phase, IBM will be donating about $5
million to 12 elementary schools and 12 teacher colleges. The
project illustrates IBM's substantial commitment to increasing
its penetration of the K-12 market (see related story, and
analysis, of the IBM/Apple K-12 face off on page 1).

Donations of equipment will be made to schools on a competitive
grant basis; proposals from schools are due June 1.  Most
proposals will be prejudged by the 41 Boards of Cooperative
Educational Services (BOCES) around the state; the five largest
cities, including New York City, can submit proposals directly to
the capitol. The top five plans selected by the BOCES will be
forwarded to the state DOE for final selection. Winners should be
announced by June 19, said Dr. Peter Stoll, an associate for
educational television in the Bureau of Technical Applications at
the DOE.

The selected schools will receive approximately $250,000 to
$300,000 worth of IBM equipment, including four or five PS/2
model 25 workstations per classroom, with color monitors and
voice adaptor cards. Every school will get an IBM PS/2 model 80
file server, while teachers and school principals will receive
PS/2 model 30 workstations. Additionally, each school will
receive an IBM laser printer. According to Dr. Stoll, each
winning school will also receive a "teacher presentation system,"
consisting of large screen projection hardware, a computer-driven
videodisc drive and a CD-ROM drive.

The state's plan calls for networking each workstation to the
file server, linking them to the other microcomputers in the
classroom and in the building, and to other classrooms in the
state connected to NY's Technical Network Ties (TNT), a
state-wide computer network.

An "Overview for Superintendents" issued by the DOE describing
the IBM/NY venture states that schools having prior involvement
with IBM, such as those that have used Writing to Read or other
IBM courseware, will be given preference in the selection
process, as will schools currently networked to TNT.

Winning schools will be required to assume the costs for any
additional wiring necessary to network workstations in the
classrooms; networking between classrooms within the building
must be paid for by the district.

As the Long Range Plan currently stands, the goal is to have
computers in every NY state school and school library, with
students having daily access to "technology-rich learning
environments within their classrooms and in separate learning
labs outside the classroom, in the school library media center,
or from home when needed."

The objective is to have the plan at least partly implemented by
1995.

While no firm price tag has been put on such a plan (should it be
approved by the Board of Regents), Dr. Stoll noted that NY state
makes between $18 million and $20 million available each year for
hardware and software purchases by schools.

RR DONNELLEY/GTE TELEMESSENGER LAUNCH AUDIOTEX "IN-TOUCH"
LITERACY AID

One of the country's largest printing firms, Chicago-based R.R.
Donnelley and Sons, has teamed with GTE Telemessenger (Irving,
TX) to offer a telephone-accessed literacy service called "The
In-Touch Reading Aid." In association with Literacy Volunteers of
America (LVA), Donnelley and GTE are planning to launch a pilot
with 100 students in early June. If the results are positive, the
service may expand its offerings and/or become a "900" number.
The fledgling "In-Touch Reading Aid" currently has a vocabulary
of about 800 words; callers to the temporary "800" number are
asked to spell out a troublesome word using the keypads of a
touch-tone phone. A prerecorded voice spells the entered word,
and gives the correct pronunciation.

Robert Chainski, technical director for advanced communications
applications at R.R. Donnelley, told The Heller Report that the
company originated the "In-Touch" idea out of concern over the
high rate of illiteracy in the U.S. Through this service, adult
illiterates, the disabled, children or non-English speaking
people would be able to learn pronunciation and spelling if they
become "stuck" on a word, Chainski said. He noted that the LVA
identified this as a major problem among adult illiterates who
practice reading skills at home--getting "stuck" with no one to
turn to for help.

Chainski said that through Donnelley's contacts with textbook and
children's publishers, the company is seeking to create a joint
project that would include using the "In-Touch" line. If, for
example, an agreement was reached with a children's publisher,
Donnelley could add words into the online dictionary specifically
related to a publisher's text. An English-Spanish vocabulary
service is one of the forms the "In Touch" line may eventually
take, he said.

Prior to Donnelley's partnership with GTE Telemessenger, most of
the telecommunications firms contacted by R.R. Donnelley were
reluctant to join the project, mainly because it was unclear how
or when the system would bring in profits, Chainski said. The
100-student pilot slated to begin in June is scheduled to last
three months, after which Donnelley and GTE Telemessenger will
determine the future direction of the service.

HOWTEK PRINTER TRANSLATES TO BRAILLE; EDUCATION RESELLER SOUGHT

Howtek, Inc., headquartered in Hudson, VT, has introduced
Braillemaster, a line of computer printers that will interpret
ASCII into Braille, and are capable of printing alphanumeric
symbols as well as Braille on the same page. Using proprietary
software and a plastic-based ink, the printers shoot out four
layers of ink dots that dry instantly on the paper, creating the
raised Braille symbols, according to Howtek business manager Jack
Dolan. The initial sales thrust for Braillemaster printers will
be the corporate market, Dolan said, although the company is
looking for "resellers" who will bring the product to the
education/special ed market.

This technology, designed to facilitate communication between
blind and sighted employees in the workplace, may enable blind
and sighted students to learn together as well. The Braillemaster
(really a Pixelmaster printer will specialized software, ink and
Braille drive) uses a solid ink capsule resembling a crayon, said
Dolan, which melts when inserted in the printer. Inside the
printer, the liquefied ink is kept at 240 degrees Fahrenheit, so
the sudden temperature change that occurs when the ink hits the
paper causes it to solidify immediately, Dolan said.

Howtek designed the printer to be used by the sighted as well; it
is designed to remember 256,000 shades of color, and can print
graphs, charts, maps or images.

Developed in cooperation with the National Federation of the
Blind, the Braillemaster is built to accommodate Grade 2 Braille
software produced by Duxbury (Littleton, MA), which contracts
often-used prefixes and suffixes for faster reading by the blind.
Braillemaster I, with 512K of memory, lists at $5,995, while
Braillemaster II, with 2-1/2 megabytes, lists at $7,900. Those
interested in further information can contact Dolan in Howtek's
west coast office (Dublin, CA) at 415-828-4604.

NORTH DAKOTA HOPES TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION  OF $15 MIL ED NETWORK
NEXT YEAR

The state of North Dakota is planning construction of a
state-wide educational telecommunications network, a system that
will cost an estimated $15 million to build and approximately $5
million per year to maintain and operate.

The network is being designed under the auspices of the North
Dakota Computer Education Committee, part of the Dept. of Public
Instruction in Bismark, ND. Two years ago, the state legislature
revamped what had been ND's Educational Broadcasting Council into
the Educational Telecommunications Council; the new council
commissioned Federal Engineering, a Fairfax, VA-based consulting
firm, to develop a plan for the installation of a state-wide
network. However, since ND's state legislature meets every other
year, the study will not be taken up by the lawmakers until its
next session in Jan. 1991 (the previous session ended May 1989).

The state's fiscal year begins on July 1st, so that if the
recommendations (or any subsequent bids) were approved, funds
would not be forthcoming until July 1991 (the start of ND's
fiscal 1992), at the earliest. The plan, as it currently stands,
its to build the network over a five-year period, according to
Joel Linnertz, director of administrative services for ND's Dept.
of Public Instruction. The scheduling of any RFP will most likely
be tied to the fiscal cycle, although no timetable for RFPs have
been set.

The network is expected to be funded entirely by state money.
However, the state has been under great financial pressure due to
three consecutive years of drought, as well as a depressed oil
market, affecting two important areas of commerce for North
Dakota. The decision to spread construction over a five-year
period may, in part, soften the financial pinch of the project.

Ultimately, the network's backbone will be a "fiber optics
corridor circling the state," Linnertz said. He also indicated
that the first aim of the project will be to establish a computer
network for educators and students in K-12 schools. The network
would also be used for administrative tasks. In progressive
stages, the network would also be used to link colleges and
libraries around the state, and perhaps add to the state's
distance learning efforts. So far, most distance learning
projects in ND have been carried out by local consortium,
independent of one another.

LEIDS CORP. INTRODUCING SINet TO K-12 SCHOOLS

In the past four months, Leids Corp. of Fargo, ND, has wired over
150 schools in five states to its SINet proprietary database and
information retrieval system. It plans to introduce systems in
Portland, OR and Washington, D.C. in the near future.
SINet--Secondary Informational Network--is designed to retrieve a
host of topic-specific information by accessing large numbers of
databases and bulletin boards, searching for data pertaining to a
particular category.

For example, if the topic is ecology, SINet might scan National
Geographic's database, as well as ECONET and other databases and
newswires to gather and present a body of information for the
user. Leids is also talking to FrEdMail and other bulletin board
providers in order to add more of those services under SINet's
umbrella, according to Leids CEO Dr. Theodore Rosenbaum.

Dr. Rosenbaum described SINet as "a distributed system" that will
act as a gateway to other bulletin boards, as well as support
conferencing and e-mail (public domain databases, but no active
online services, are accessed via SINet). Schools can access
SINet either remotely or by leasing or buying the complete
system. The system can be cost-effective for schools with limited
resources; Dr. Rosenbaum noted that Catholic schools in Minnesota
log into SINet via a remote site designated for them, at a total
cost of $80 per year. The SINet system consists of Leids'
proprietary UNIX-based software running on an NCR Tower computer,
which can be used as a file server for a local area network
linking user stations. There are currently two multiuser NCR
Tower setups in Minnesota, serving 50 schools, while two NCR
Towers in AZ serve SINet to about 100 schools, Dr. Rosenbaum
said.

Schools can also lease or buy the system (line charges for online
accesses are paid separately). NCR acts as sales and marketing
agent for the SINet package, and will send teams to schools to
instruct users and keep track of the system's performance. In
either a lease or buy situation, Leids provides ongoing support
and troubleshooting for SINet. There is a certain amount of
customizing involved for each school or district. Using KERMIT
telecommunications software, a public-domain product, Leids
tailors SINet for IBM or Apple systems.

To date, schools in Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska and Arizona
(Phoenix) as well as one Texas school have become SINet users. A
system tied into Novell Netware capable of serving up to 150
users can cost from $10,000 to $16,000 to purchase, Dr. Rosenbaum
said. He noted that the system bought by the Phoenix, AZ schools
can serve up to 78 users. K-12 schools are not Leids' only market
for the product; the Kansas judiciary system is considering
installing the software for its own use, said Dr. Rosenbaum.

Leids' current efforts in the higher ed market include a project
to link universities in Nigeria to SINet. The team effort
involves Leids, NCR, Nigeria's Education Ministry, and possibly
some volunteer organizations. Business representatives went to
Nigeria to meet with education officials about one year ago, and
followed up with a proposal to connect with SINet via satellite.
The first test of the system is expected in two months.

Prior to changing its name six months ago, Leids Corp. was known
as Barrister International.

NIEU's EDUCATION UTILITY SLATED FOR SITES IN AZ, NY AND FL BY
JUNE

After some false starts dating back to the early 1980s, National
Information and Education Utilities Corp. (NIEU) is beginning to
find customers for its Education Utility program. Technologically
enhanced since its first introduction, EU is now a satellite
delivered service offering schools downloaded educational
software, data and video on demand for a per-use fee.

NIEU vice-chairman Henry Schwartz said the Education Utility (EU)
system has been installed in two high schools in Arizona, with
installation for four others to begin next month. NIEU has also
signed on the C.W. Post College of Long Island University and
three more schools in Suffolk County, NY. Further, two sites in
Florida have signed on to receive the EU system: Nova
University's South Florida Education Center, and a second
Education Center run by a consortium made up of Broward County
Community College, Nova University and the Broward, Dade and
Monroe Counties public schools. NIEU executives are currently
talking with education officials in Illinois and California to
explore business opportunities in those states.

The basic EU structure is as follows: using a schools's own
computer hardware and an NIEU-supplied receiver dish, schools
receive encrypted database and video information that is stored
on hard disc, CD-ROM and/or VHS video recorder. The system can
also be amended to accommodate interactive optical discs, said
Schwartz. The data is decoded by a Scientific Atlanta B-Mac
device placed on-site. The Education Utility currently has
between 350 and 400 software programs available from about 50
suppliers, including Scholastic and MicroSoft, although Schwartz
said the number of programs "will shortly top 1,000."

Schools are charged a fee for use of the third-party software
delivered to the desktop, as well as 50 cents per hour for each
workstation using the system; software publishers are paid a
royalty for each use. The leasing charge for the EU system is
$1,750 per month ($21,000 annually); Schwartz estimates the
additional, per-use fees, based on a 190-day school year, will
run about $6,000.

When used to deliver computer data, the system can handle up to
250 concurrent users without any loss of speed, Schwartz said.
When delivering full-motion video, the system acts "like cable
TV" and can be seen by any number of users, he added.

Financial Incentive in Leasing

To help recoup the costs of the system, NIEU allows client
schools to lease out the EU for non-school business, such as
adult literacy classes or other community use. Recently, NIEU has
added dial-up capabilities to the EU system, allowing users to
access data from home using individual passwords. Aside from the
phone line and program fees, NIEU charges $1.50 per hour for
dial-up service, and will credit one-third (50 cents) of that
revenue to the client school, Schwartz said.

Further, NIEU has concluded an agreement with ERIC (Education
Resource Information Center) for use of its databases for K-12
teachers and administrators. Those databases are public-domain,
Schwartz said.

SLANTS & TRENDS

     Back-to-back news reports on Jan. 2 and 3 speculated that Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos might yet become the first member of President
Bush's cabinet forced to leave office.  White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater denied the rumors Jan. 3, saying Cavazos "has done an outstanding
job."  When asked directly if Cavazos were leaving, the president's
spokesman replied, "He has the job as long as he wants it."  Similar rumors
seven months ago had also been denied, when the president himself said
Cavazos "has my full confidence."

     The rumors resurfaced Jan. 2, when columnist Jack Anderson reported
that Cavazos might be on the way out because some "Washington insiders"
felt that his low-key style had failed to help build Bush's reputation as
"the education president."  Cavazos' style was compared to that of his
outspoken and combative predecessor, William Bennett.  Anderson said
Cavazos had also alienated Congressional Democrats and education interest
groups for not pushing harder for higher spending on education.  The
columnist said unnamed "White House operatives" were scouting for a
replacement for Cavazos, with outgoing New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean (R) and
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander (R) among their candidates.

     On Jan. 3, The Washington Post carried a similar story on its front
page, including more criticisms of Cavazos.  The criticisms from liberals
were largely predictable, but even Jeanne Allen, education policy analyst
at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said, "We don't need a mellow
secretary.  We need somebody to really rock and roll.  He just doesn't know
policy."  The Post also quoted Cavazos' reaction to his critics, offered
during an interview with the paper:  "I'm just going to keep on doing my
job.  They can just line it up and have at it, because I'm going to have
right back at them."

     Later that same day, while denying rumors of Cavazos' imminent
departure, Fitzwater said criticisms of the secretary were "unfair," and
alleged that "action interest groups were trying to stimulate" Cavazos'
ouster.  As of RLP press time, Cavazos still had his job.

GOVERNORS' ASSN. TO HOLD THIRD ANNUAL CONFERENCE
ON STATE LITERACY INITIATIVES IN HARRISBURG, PA.

     The National Governors' Association (NGA), in cooperation with the
U.S. Department of Education and Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS), will
sponsor the third annual conference on state literacy initiatives April 2-4
in Harrisburg, Pa.  The theme of the conference will be "Alliances for
Literacy," and it will focus on the development of state literacy policies
and the implementation of state-wide literacy systems.

     The three-day meeting is expected to draw more than 400 participants,
ranging from governors and their spouses to new adult readers.  Others
will include representatives from governors' offices, state literacy
agencies, nonprofit organizations, the business community, organized
labor, education, the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Departments of Education,
Health and Human Services, and Labor.  Organizers say they also hope
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Sen.
Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Rep. Tom Sawyer (D-Ohio) will attend.

     While a detailed agenda is still in the works, organizers say
conference workshops will be divided into three tracks:  Targeting
Services, Creating an Infrastructure and Evaluating Effectiveness.  Because
some state programs are further along than others, workshops are being
planned that will address various stages of program implementation.
Conference plenary sessions will be devoted to national literacy issues
that are relevant to state efforts.

     For further information, contact Bob Silvanik at the NGA, Hall of the
States, 444 North Capitol St., N.W., Suite 250, Washington, D.C. 20001;
(202) 624-5353.

GOVERNORS SET TO ADOPT NATIONAL EDUCATION
GOALS AND RECOMMEND AGENDA FOR ACTION

     Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad (R), chairman of the National Governors'
Association (NGA), says the nation's governors will not only adopt
education goals at their annual winter meeting in February, they will also
issue an action agenda outlining the steps needed to acheive those goals.
(See RLP, Dec. 14)

     Branstad issued a statement Dec. 27 in which he said that the
governors' "education summit" with President Bush in September had
"produced an action agenda in four areas:  building national goals,
providing more flexibility in federal education programs, restructuring
education and improving accountability.  First, we will adopt national
goals for excellence in education.  Then, we will outline the process for
achieving the rest of our agenda."

     Branstad said the NGA task force on education will develop an action
agenda for the governors and the nation and issue it at the Feb. 25-27 NGA
meeting in Washington.  According to the NGA, the agenda will describe the
problems of education and the issues facing state policymakers, outline a
consensus on reasonable and achievable goals, and recommend practical ways
to acheive those goals.

     One of the broad goals set forth at the September summit was the
acheivement of "functional literacy" by all adult Americans.  Other broad
goals addressed the gammut of educational issues, from preschool through
college.  In the intervening months, the NGA education task force has been
involved in a joint effort with Bush administration officials to develop
more specific goals.

NATIONAL 'REPORT CARD' SHOWS STUDENTS'
READING AND WRITING ABILITIES REMAIN LOW

     "The reading and writing skills of American students remain dreadfully
inadequate," said Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos Jan. 9.  Cavazos was
speaking at a Washington news conference to announce the results of
nationwide studies on reading and writing conducted in 1988 by the
federally-funded National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).  The
NAEP is conducted by the Educational Testing Service under a grant from the
Education Department's Office of Educational Research and Improvement.
(See related story, RLP, Oct. 19)

     Cavazos said that, overall, the reading and writing performance of
nine-, 13- and 17-year-olds remained "virtually unchanged" since the last
assessment in 1984.  Among 17-year-olds, 58 percent still could not read at
the "adept" level, which is defined as having the ability to find,
understand, summarize and explain information in materials like 12th-grade
textbooks.  Writing abilities were similarly deficient, showing little
change since the first writing assessment in 1974.  Seventy-two percent of
17-year-olds could not write adequate responses on the least-difficult
persuasive-writing task in the 1988 study.

     One hopeful sign amid the otherwise bad news was that Black and
Hispanic students continued to make gains in reading achievement, although
they still lagged behind white students.  In writing, the performance gap
between minority and white students did not change for nine- and
17-year-olds, and while the gap was reduced slightly for 13-year-olds, the
reduction was caused by lower performance among the whites.  Officials
blamed poverty for the racial disparities.

     Reading from a prepared statement, Cavazos used the disappointing NAEP
results as a springboard to call for enactment of the Bush
administration's education agenda.  "We must give parents the right to
select the schools their children will attend, and let schools compete for
students...." he said.  "We must let parents, teachers and administrators
manage their classrooms and schools without interference from district,
state and federal governments."

     Cavazos read his statement at the beginning of the news conference,
then turned the meeting over to representatives of the NAEP for a detailed
explanation of the study results.  He left the room immediately, without
inviting questions from the scores of reporters in attendance.

     But during a later question-and-answer session, a reporter compared
the lack of educational progress during the 1980s with earlier gains, and
asked if the new study had not deliberately avoided criticism of Reagan-era
cutbacks in education programs.  Wilhelmina Delco, vice-chairman of the
National Assessment Governing Board and a Democratic member of the Texas
House of Representatives, used that opportunity to complain about cuts in
the Head Start program for pre-schoolers.  "The Head Start program has been
substantially diminished in some areas and even abolished in others," she
said.  "This was a working vehicle, and we would encourage efforts in this
direction to be advanced, not discarded."

     The NAEP will mail free copies of The Reading Report Card, 1971-88 and
The Writing Report Card, 1984-88 to some 20,000 education professionals and
policymakers.  To find out if you are on their list, and to order the
reports if you are not, contact Kent Ashworth, NAEP, P.O. Box 6710,
Princeton, N.J. 08541-6710; (800) 223-0267 or (609) 734-5890.  Those not on
the free distribution list will be charged $9 for the reading report and
$12 for the writing report, with shipping and handling charges included in
those prices.

NATIONAL COALITION FOR LITERACY
ELECTS NEW CHAIR, CONSIDERS POLICY ROLE

     Indiana University Education Professor Anabel Newman has succeeded
Literacy Volunteers of America (LVA) President Jinx Crouch as chair of the
National Coalition for Literacy.  Coalition members include nonprofit
literacy groups, government agencies and education trade groups.  It
promotes greater awareness of adult illiteracy, attempts to foster
communication between literacy providers, and assesses national literacy
needs and services.

     Newman says that in a departure from previous practice, the coalition
is about to become involved in the national literacy policy debate.  She
told RLP Jan. 10 that coalition leaders are working toward a consensus on
various issues, but they have yet to agree on any specific positions.  This
new tack presents a problem for the coalition's governmental members (see
below), who have said they cannot take part in advocacy or lobbying
efforts.

     Newman is director of the Reading Practicum Center at Indiana
University.  She is a member of the International Reading Association
(IRA), one of the coalition's member groups, and serves as chair of the
IRA's committee on International Literacy Year (ILY).  The United Nations
has designated 1990 as ILY in an effort to promote literacy throughout the
world.  (See RLP, Dec. 28)

     During her one-year term as chair of the coalition, Newman will act as
its central coordinator, prepare agendas for and chair coalition meetings,
and represent the coalition at various functions.  Newman can be contacted
at:  School of Education 211, Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind. 47405;
(812) 855-9160 (Reading Practicum Center), or 855-7167 (sec'y), or 855-0378
(School of Ed.).

     At its most recent meeting, the coalition accepted a request from ILY
organizers and agreed to publicize ILY in the United States.  The
coalition will put special emphasis on getting the word out to the literacy
community, in an effort to encourage local ILY observances.  A series of
articles written by coalition members will be published in the newsletters
of the coalition's member groups and in other periodicals.

     ABC network Vice President John Harr wrote one such article for
inclusion in the December issue of The Reader, the LVA newsletter.  Harr is
ABC's project director for Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS), another coalition
member group.  In his article, Harr conceded that U.N. literacy conferences
in Bangkok and Geneva "might seem a little high-flown for local literacy
programs" in the U.S., but he went on to say that awareness of ILY
activities should be "a morale-builder" for local programs.

     Newman says the National Contact Center, another coalition member,
will function as a clearinghouse for ILY information.  The center will add
information about national and local ILY activities to its database and
respond to ILY-related inquiries.  The center may be reached via its
national literacy hotline number, (800) 228-8813, or by writing to P.O. Box
81826, Lincoln, Neb. 68501-1826.

     In addition to the LVA, the IRA, PLUS and the contact center, other
coalition members include the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor, the
ACTION agency, the National Commission on Libraries and Information
Science, Laubach Literacy Action, the American Library Association, the
American Association for Adult and Continuing Education, the Correctional
Education Association and the National Council of State Directors of Adult
Education.

SEN. MOYNIHAN BERATES ADMINISTRATION FOR FAILURE
TO NOMINATE HHS OFFICIAL TO RUN J.O.B.S. PROGRAM

     Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) wrote to Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan Jan. 4 to express his "bitter
disappointment that the administration has still not nominated an Assistant
Secretary for Family Support."  Among other responsibilities, the
assistant secretary would be in charge of the Job Opportunities and Basic
Skills Training (JOBS) program for recipients of Aid to Families With
Dependent Children (AFDC).  (See RLP, Dec. 28)

     The assistant secretary's post was created by the Family Support Act
of 1988, a major overhaul of welfare programs that stresses job training
and education for welfare mothers.  Moynihan is chairman of the Senate
Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy, and he was the chief
Senate sponsor of the act, which was signed by President Reagan in October
of 1988.  At least 25 states have already implemented JOBS programs despite
the vacancy at HHS.

     In his recent letter to Sullivan, Moynihan wrote:  "The program must
be up and running nationwide by October 1, 1990.  And yet, there is still
no one to run it....  Is there some way we can help?  If you like, I will
be happy to hold a hearing of the subcommittee early in the new year in
order to give you a chance to explain your problem...."

     Sources told The Washington Post that the leading candidate for the
job is Gordon Johnson, director of the Illinois Department of Children and
Family Services.  A Sullivan spokesman told RLP that the secretary is
eager to complete the selection process, but would only confirm that
Johnson is "a candidate."

CENSUS BUREAU WILL MAKE SPECIAL EFFORT TO INCLUDE
ILLITERATE, HOMELESS AND DISABLED PEOPLE IN 1990 COUNT

     The Census Bureau says it will make special efforts to include such
groups as illiterate adults, the homeless, and the disabled in the 1990
census.  The bureau says it will not attempt an actual headcount of
illiterate or homeless people as such, but some census forms will ask about
languages spoken at home.  The bureau reasons that many illiterate and/or
homeless people would be reluctant to answer questions about their status,
rendering any attempted headcount highly unreliable.  Census officials also
say that, in the absence of universally accepted definitions of
"illiteracy" and "homelessness," they will not attempt to come up with
their own.

     The 1990 census is being called a "do-it-yourself" count because it
will be conducted almost entirely by mail.  Five out of six households will
receive a short form containing 14 questions.  The rest, about 17 million
households, will receive a long form with 59 questions.  (It is these long
forms that will include questions about languages and disabilities.)

     The bureau will feature the "Census '90" logo prominently in a planned
advertising campaign, in the hope that people will recognize it when their
forms arrive in the mail.  The forms will include a toll-free telephone
number for anyone who needs help filling them out, and the bureau has also
arranged to set up hundreds of walk-in assistance centers across the
country.

     Households that do not return census forms will be visited by
"enumerators" from the bureau.  Also, special teams of enumerators will
interview some homeless "street people" at pre-identified sites, but these
interviews are designed to collect sample data only, not to produce a
definitive count.

     MARYLAND -- School officials in Prince George's County have not had

     MARYLAND -- School officials in Prince George's County have not had
any employers take them up on their "student-back guarantee" so far,
according to a report in the Greenbelt News Review.  Last June, the
district, which borders Washington, D.C., issued certificates of
employability to more than 2,500 graduating seniors who had been enrolled
in a variety of career education programs -- more than a third of all
graduates.  The wallet-size certificates guarantee potential employers
that the students have learned essential basic skills, including specific
competencies in reading, writing, math and verbal communication.  The
students are also guaranteed to have mastered work habits and attitudes,
interpersonal relationships, reasoning and problem-solving.  If a
"guaranteed" graduate fails to measure up, the district has promised to
provide job counselling and retraining at no cost to the employer.
Initial success has prompted efforts to attract even more students and
businesses into the program this year.

     NEW YORK -- For the first time, high school students trying to gain
admission to state colleges and universities will be allowed to use
calculators on the math portion of New York State's Regents exams next
year.  Fred Paul, head of the state Education Department's mathematics
bureau, said of the decision:  "It's an everyday situation where people
have them, they're going to use them, and we're just going to acknowledge
that."  Paul said the calculators will not give a significant advantage to
students who use them, because most of the Regents math questions require
problem-solving skills, not just arithmetic skills.  Students will still be
required to show the work involved in reaching their answers.

     PENNSYLVANIA -- Field screening of clients referred to the public

     PENNSYLVANIA -- Field screening of clients referred to the public
defender's office in Pittsburgh from June through November revealed that
only 51 percent of the clients could read at the ninth-grade level or
better.  Eight percent of the clients had a fourth-grade or lower reading
ability, while 41 percent were able to read at the fifth- to eighth-grade
levels.  The results were reported in On-Line Literacy, the newsletter of
the Pittsburgh Literacy Initiative.  The group said the statistics
indicated a need to integrate remedial education programs into court
sentencing procedures.  (See RLP, Dec. 14)

     The Philip Morris Companies will donate $1.5 million and the Pew
Charitable Trusts will donate $600,000 to form a private/public
partnership with the Mayor's Commission on Literacy in Philadelphia.  The
commission is an umbrella organization for adult literacy services.  The
money will fund a three-year initiative aimed at a significant reduction in
adult illiteracy.  According to reports, nearly 40 percent of the city's
adults have inadequate literacy skills.  Philip Morris will also fund a
local literacy-awareness advertising campaign.

     VIRGINIA -- The state's public/private Literacy Initiative, championed
by outgoing first lady Jeannie Baliles since 1986, is credited with helping
Virginia move from 48th place in the nation to 34th in terms of funding
for adult basic education and literacy.  While new programs are reaching
only five percent of the 668,000 Virginians over 25 who have less than a
ninth-grade education, only two percent received instruction before the
initiative.  State funding for literacy programs has jumped from $20,000
in the 1986-87 academic year to $270,000 in '87-88, and to a budgeted $4.25
million for the '88-90 two-year period.  Enrollment in adult education
programs nearly doubled between '87-88 and '88-89, and the adult dropout
rate has gone from 50 to 28 percent.  Only eight businesses had workplace
literacy programs four years ago, but 44 have them now.  Since 1985, the
number of private volunteer programs has also more than doubled, from 34 to
80; the number of trained volunteer tutors has jumped from 1,700 to 3,500;
and the number of students in volunteer programs has gone from 1,500 to
3,452.

will go up by nine percent by 2000, reversing a recent four-percent
decline; in 1999, for the first time, women will earn more doctoral degrees
than men; and over the course of the '90s, the real purchasing power of
teacher salaries will increase by 14 percent.  The publication is available

CD-ROM PROVES TO BE MORE THAN A PLATTER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, COMDEX/ASIA'96

By Les Yetton

D-ROm technology is exploding. According to Dataquest, nearly 25
million drives were shipped in 1995.

This number is expected to expand to 50 million units by the end of
1998, and upwards of 70 million by the year 2000.

CD-ROM is now the most popular media used to distribute software.
Due to its capacity, (a standard CD-ROM disk can hold up to 650MB
of information, or the equivalent of 130 K pages of text),
durability, low production cost and ease of packaging and
distribution, virtually all new software titles are produced using
CD-ROM.

As more software applications are distributed and deployed on CD-
ROM, companies are beginning to look at ways to share this
information resource within corporate networks.

The adoption of the ISO-9660 CD-ROM format standard, supported by
nearly all of popular computing platforms allows CD-ROM data to be
read by users of DOS, Mac, Windows, Unix and OS/2 systems.

Why Network CD-ROMs

It is a relatively simple question of economics and sound business
practice. Organisations that make available a myriad of CD-ROM-
based information  empower their employees with instant access to
critical information, hence enabling them to make decisions
quicker.

With a shared CD-ROM resource on the network, organisations can
also provide better support and responsiveness to customers while
promoting better communication within the organisation.

Many large organisations use several types of computing platforms,
including PCs grouped together using NetWare, various Unix dialects
supporting TCP/IP, as well as several application servers running
Windows NT.

Today's CD-ROM Server solutions allow these environments to share
the same CD-ROM subsystem and information simultaneously.

There are several types of solutions available, from file server-
based software  to file server independent products that sit out on
an Ethernet or Token Ring as an intelligent node.

A networked CD-ROM subsystem incorporates three distinct
technologies: CD-ROM drive devices, network connectivity technology
and data storage management products.

CD-ROM Applications

The rate at which CD-ROM technology is assimilated into an
organisation is dependent upon those CD-ROM applications utilised
or about to be utilised.

Because of the appeal of the medium, the number of CD-ROMs being
made available to each professional, business and technical
discipline is growing exponentially. CD-ROM is becoming the
preferred publishing medium.

Although the first requirements in an organisation for CD-ROM
connectivity generally occur on the workgroup level, departmental
and enterprise level implementations can also quickly become
priorities.

Consequently, as the technology extends to the corporate void more
protocols and network operating systems need to be supported as
environments come on-line.

Networking CD-ROM drives offers significant benefits. There are
several different methods available to achieve basically the same
result. Some are hardware oriented, while others employ a software
approach. Some use existing file server resources while others are
file server independent.

What to Consider

Some factors to consider when choosing a CD-ROM networking
architecture:

  Cost

Hardware and software costs, license fees or per-user fees are
important.

  Ease of Installation

Solutions requiring access to file servers or a network shutdown
are often not desirable. Installation will ideally be plug-and-
play.

  Ease of operation

Ideally, users will have nothing new to learn.

  Multiprotocol Support

The product should be able to simultaneously support the major
protocols.

  Impact on File Server

Solutions that use file server resources can cause performance or
throughput problems, as file servers become burdened with the load
of handling additional overhead.

  Drive Location

In cases like major libraries, centralised drive location and
management is preferred. In other cases, it is desirable to have
the drives located departmentally.

  Performance and throughput

Performance should be sufficient to meet the current and
anticipated needs of the application.

To ensure that performance is consistent, it should be independent
of other activity on the network or file server.

  Doubling up on Network Traffic

Incremental network traffic should be minimised, particularly over
WANs or through LAN segments connected to bridges and routers.

Conclusion

There are various architectures to choose from to network CD-ROMs,
but one thing's for sure, CD-ROM networking is here to stay.

Why VLANs Are Now popular

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, COMDEX/ASIA'96

by Douglas Hill

Very few modern networking concepts are as confusing as virtual
LANs (VLANs). Virtual LANs are new, and their widespread use has
only just begun.

Vendors, in an attempt to take advantage of interest in the latest
trends, have blurred the concept of what a VLAN really is.

There are many ways to implement VLANs in switching products -
each with very different capabilities and limitations.

Why Use LAN Switches?

VLANs are an inherent outgrowth of LAN switching.

The amount of data being carried on LANs has grown steadily and
rapidly.

LAN switches make it possible to transfer much larger amounts of
data than was possible with hubs and routers. Token rings and
Ethernet segments can be dedicated to individual devices, or to
small groups of devices.

Limitations

LAN switches achieve high performance levels by using simplified
processes.

They are basically bridges, rather than routers. They switch via
layer-two ("MAC") destination/source addresses; this is much
simpler than routing.

All bridged networks have a basic limitation - bridges, since they
don't participate in the layer-three protocols which use MAC
broadcasts.

Although point-to-point traffic is isolated to the specific ports
sending and receiving those frames, broadcasts must be sent
everywhere.

The same is true of frames that have a destination MAC address that
hasn't been learned by the bridge. They have to be sent everywhere.

In most networks of moderate size, this "flooding" has almost no
impact on other traffic.

However, in a very large network or one with an unusually high
level of broadcasts, it is possible for flooding to impact point-
to-point traffic.

When this happens, it's important to keep broadcasts isolated in
"broadcast domains".

Many LANs built over the last 10 years use hubs and routers.

The workstations, servers, and other devices are connected to the
hubs, and the hubs are interconnected with routers.

In this type of LAN, broadcast domains are built automatically,
since every hub is a broadcast domain.

Routers are essentially devices for interconnecting broadcast
domains.

But with networks based on LAN switches we need to provide this
function in other ways.

Virtual LANs

A virtual LAN is a broadcast domain. Just as with a hub, all
devices in a virtual LAN see all broadcasts as well as all frames
with unknown destination addresses, so long as the broadcast and
"unknown" frames originated inside that virtual LAN.

With hubs and routers, frames are repeated within a hub and routed
between hubs. With virtual LANs, frames are switched (bridged)
within a virtual LAN, and routed between virtual LANs.

A virtual LAN can be considered as nothing more than a more
flexible version of familiar networking practices.

What is new is that a broadcast domain is no longer restricted to
the devices in one physical part of the network.

Switching is simpler than routing, and therefore faster.

To the extent that data can be switched between devices, rather
than routed, it can be moved faster.

Unfortunately for hub/router-based networks, devices that need to
connect to each other all day long are often in different parts of
a building, or even in different buildings.

Virtual LANs address this issue - if they're powerful enough.

A broadcast domain in a good virtual LAN implementation can span a
building, campus, or city.

So the need for routing is minimised, and data moves much faster.

Multiple MAC Types

Remember that the basic purpose of moving to a switched LAN is to
increase throughput.

One fundamental way to do that is to divide the network into
smaller segments or rings; this is done by switching each device on
its own segment or ring.

This means that workstations no longer contend for bandwidth.

Modern switched networks are moving to structures which allow
central resources to run at speeds greater than those of the
workstations.

Examples include: 10 Mbps Ethernet workstations and 100 Mbps
Ethernet servers; 16 Mbps token ring workstations and 100 Mbps FDDI
servers.

The point is to switch traffic between the workstation and the
servers, rather than routing it.

This means that a virtual LAN must be able to accommodate a variety
of MAC types.

Network Changes

In many networks it's common for devices to move frequently within
a building or a campus.

You should be able to assign a workstation to one or more virtual
LANs once, and after that it should remain connected to them, no
matter where on the campus it has moved.

Speed Operation

Increased throughput is the reason why LAN networks are moving to
switching solutions.

Virtual LANs assist this movement by keeping broadcast traffic at
reasonable levels.

It is obvious that the implementation of the virtual LAN capability
should not slow down the network.

This implies that the actual forwarding of the individual frames
should be done in hardware, including checking source and
destination virtual LAN matches.

SOFTWARE PIRACY RECEIVES FULL ATTENTION AT SHOW

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, COMDEX/ASIA'96

THE Business Software Alliance (BSA) will be using Comdex/Asia '96
to promote regional awareness about the importance of software
copyright laws.

"The reason for unauthorised software copying range from pure
profit motives to carelessness, lack of awareness of law and
general disregard for treating software as valuable intellectual
property," said Bryan Ghows, vice-president for the Business
Software Alliance.

IT Crossroads

"Comdex/Asia will provide a conducive environment for bringing
together major players from the information technology markets and
communities of Asia and the Pacific Rim," he added.

"We intend to be present, working mainly through our members to
promote the alliance's strategy for increasing public awareness and
fostering more widespread understanding of software copyright
laws."

According to Ghows, Asia is one of the most dynamic regions in the
world and Comdex/Asia is seen worldwide as one of the most
important IT events of the year.

"We plan to use the show as a platform to promote BSA's Hotline and
Reward campaign and simultaneously raise awareness about piracy
issues," he said.

The BSA will be participating in Comdex '96 through its members
which include Microsoft; Symantec; Lotus via its distributor SiS
Singapore; Novell via its distributor UIC Technologies; and SCO.

BT FORESEES ASIAN TELCO DEREGULATION

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

UK-BASED telecommunications vendor, BT, will plug away in the Asia-
Pacific, despite the slow pace of deregulation in the region,
gaining entry through local partners and distributors.

"We are committed to deregulation, having made the transition from
a state-owned body to a private telco in 1984 and thence to one
with a global presence," said Mike Burgess, director, Marketing &
Sales, BT Asia-Pacific.

According to BT, the deregulation process had already begun in the
Asia-Pacific and it was only a matter of time before it opens up to
competition.

"Hong Kong and Singapore have started the process, so have
Indonesia and Malaysia," said Martin Benson, manager, Regional
Sales & Marketing, BT.

"The Communications Authority of Thailand has also been chartered
to start deregulation with the same developments being seen in the
Philippines.

Other challenges BT faces in the region are the varying technology
and infrastructure levels, geographical conditions and economic
growth rates.

"A rising trend here is the growing mobility and interdependence of
the business community," said Burgess. "This leads to a demand for
connectivity to the rest of the world anytime, anywhere."

BT's partners in the region are Marubeni (Japan), Wipro (India),
Dacom (Korea) and through its 20 per cent stake in MCI, Clear, a
New Zealand telecoms carrier .

EDS PICKS CHINA, INDIA AS NEXT TWO EXPANSION SITES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Raymond Tan

Electronic Data Systems (EDS), with regional operations
headquartered in Singapore, will expand further with the setting up
of two subsidiaries in China and India by Q1'97.

The China and India offices will add to the company's current sites
in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and
Thailand, said Nitin Gangla, managing director of EDS.

EDS grew 20 to 25 per cent over the last five years in the region,
with software and services revenues hitting US$12 million at the
end of 1995.

EDS markets and supports the JBA system/21 client server
applications that now run on different vendor platforms including
the IBM AS/400, RS/6000 and HP 9000 mid-range computers.

Gangla, citing SAP, SSA and JD Edwards as his main competitors,
expects growth to remain at 25 per cent for this year.

He is optimistic about the company's growth, counting EDS' long
experience and familiarity with the Asia-Pacific market as its main
strength.

"We have over 350 installed mid-range customers in the region -
with more than 100 for the AS/400 - of which 90 are based in
Singapore. SSA and JD Edwards have only been here for five years."

Gangla said EDS was set up in Singapore in 1979 as a software
house. It has since moved into providing software applications for
IBM computers and into IT services such as outsourcing, help desks,
disaster recovery and network management.

Chief among Gangla's concerns is to steer the industry away from
the perception that EDS is only an IBM solutions company.

He said although more than half of EDS' revenue came from
supporting the AS/400 and RS/6000 platforms, revenue from services
and multivendor platforms will overtake the IBM-based revenue by
the end of the year.

"The market has shifted, wanting more value-added services. We've
evolved the company to do more consulting and services," he said.

Gangla said outsourcing has offered EDS good potential, with the
company already signing up 15 customers in the region.

"In the US small to mid-range systems market, 40 to 50 per cent of
companies have already outsourced their IT operations. In Asia,
this figure is below one per cent. There is a big market out here."

DIGITAL UNWRAPS NEW SWITCH LINE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Digital Networks has introduced switching solutions that assist
network managers in integrating multiple high-speed technologies
into a multi-gigabit switching system.

When installed in the DEChub 900 MultiSwitch chassis, the new
VNswitch 900 and ATMswitch 900 products provide seamless, low-
latency interconnection among any combination of switched
technologies.

This approach allows network managers to give users high-speed
access to servers and campus backbones regardless of the underlying
network technology.

To support this advanced capability, the company is introducing a
new software-definable switching interconnect for the DEChub 900
MultiSwitch that doubles backplane bandwidth with a simple firmware
upgrade.

For maximum flexibility, the modules can also be deployed as
standalone solutions.

Continuing the rollout of the en VISN architecture, the products
offer a range of switching features such as IP Switching and
comprehensive VLAN support. Distributed routing will also be
available via a firmware upgrade.

RIGHT STUFF FOR WEB AUTHORS: COREL WEB. DESIGNER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Using Web.Designer's browser to view my own home page, I quickly
realised the effectiveness of the software: an error log appeared
showing all my invalid HTML markups.

Very handy, but it would not print out, nor could I relocate the
file so it meant reloading the page again and taking notes.

Though many templates are available in Web.Designer, I decided to
try my hand at the WYSIWYG Web designer.

I fairly quickly assembled a new Web page.

Wanting to hyperlink a word it was quickly determined that a word
has to be highlighted before the button on the button-bar activates
so it can be clicked. The Help function came in handy to find that
bit of information.

However, the manual supplied has little information, its pages
mostly containing the pictures of Web Gallery.

I tried Web.Transit without giving it too much of my time to see
how fast I could at least get a handle on the program.

Transit converts documents into HTML format. It proved that getting
familiar with Web.Transit would not be a short process, simply
because when you import a file to be formatted for HTML viewing
there are a lot of decisions to be made prior to that step.

The file itself has to be in shape, whether in Rich Text Format,
Word, WordPerfect or ASCII.

Then a template equivalent has to be ready, with tags, then the
paths have to be right.

When everything is ready, pushing the right buttons shows coloured
fillers rapidly giving an effective indication of the job going
through and the layout is done in a jiffy - a jiffy excluding all
the work that has gone into setting everything up.

Thumbs up to Corel with their submission to the arena of Web page
and HTML document design.

Corel Gallery is also supplied with Designer and Transit. It runs
on Windows 3.1, Windows 95 and NT, and supports Java applets.

FASTER ACCESS TO WEB INFORMATION

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Tony Henderson

More Like This, the Web search software from KDL technology, has
some attractive features.

The idea is to provide a search method using far less steps than is
usual when using Alta Vista, Lycos or whatever.

While CyberSearch and Web Compass do offline searches, search
engines such as Alta Vista, which have been more than just handy
helpers for many users, are feeling the strain.

What is needed today is a smarter search that achieves higher
efficiency. That is the promise that comes with More Like This.

This is accomplished using its own information base as a kind of
treasury that facilitates searches through words associated with
key words.

However, the programme itself is not yet perfect: it did not filter
out repeated displays of Web pages following a search.

The problem may lie in how creators of Web pages write their search
help details.

On the other hand, these Web search engines which perform site
indexing just plod their way through the Internet and if they
blindly log on to everything found, repetitions will occur.

So the fault may well lie on the other side - KDL Technology in
this case.

To make a fair comparison, I tested the on-line Excite search using
Netscape, and it was clear that using Excite resulted in less
repetitions.

In fact, having Excite to tap into without the need to have the
search software located on one's own hard disk means a fair saving
in disk space and the associated woes of installing it.

Check out Excite at http://www.excite.com before digging into your
pockets for any installable software.

Search Levels

There are four levels of search with More Like This: standard,
keyword, concept and wide angle.

Standard is a straightforward search, of course using its inbred
intelligence.

Keyword is a more focused search where use is made of selected
words.

Concept casts a broader net and promises to be quite entertaining,
while  wide angle brings in materials normally left outside typical
searches.

If strict control is required over the search, there is a custom
search feature which lets the user determine how searches are
conducted.

This helper application, which sits nicely atop the browser, can
work with Usenet articles as well as Web pages.

KDL says this is not a plug-in, which they define as a program
which may alter the program a plug-in works with.

More Like This can be minimised and placed on the taskbar like any
other Windows 95 adapted program.

It runs on Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, requiring 7 MB of free disk
space to install and works best with 8 MB or more of RAM.

CREATIVE CONTROL FOR CARD HAPPY USERS: Corel Print House

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Dwayne Serjeant

Flying out of the Corel stable and into the category of "1,001
useless applications to fill up your hard disk" comes Print House,
your personal calendar and card maker.

I know that, being a designer, perhaps I shouldn't tilt my nose so
high at products like this because there is a market for them.

It reminds me of 10 years ago, when you had a product like
PrintShop for the Apple II that enabled you to print the same sort
of things on a dinky little dot-matrix printer.

Although slightly more sophisticated in what it can produce, Print
House is the basically the same application with a Beverly Hills
facelift.

The manual is a good couple of hundred pages long, but only the
first 16 are taken up with how to use the application. The
remainder are pictures of the clip-art libraries included on the
CD-ROM.

Installation

Installation is simple enough with the Corel/Microsoft Wizard
technology taking you through the steps.

Also included, and definitely worth using, is the Uninstall Wizard
which, like most Uninstall options, gets rid of the myriad
collection of files that are installed nowadays.

Print House can be used by multiple users by way of a customised
startup.

By setting up the manner in which users want their application to
be presented, Print House makes it easier on the novice to get up
and running, although it would be hard to place a 'professional'
option into this application.

You can begin Print House with a variety of options including
starting from an existing sample, starting totally from scratch,
using a saved version/template that you have created, or by using a
PaperDirect template.

PaperDirect make high quality paper reams and objects which Print
House users can print directly to.

The trouble here is that it's an IDD call to get your set of papers
ordered, and a DHL option for delivery. Isn't Hallmark still
cheaper?

Ease Of Use

The toolbar palette includes just enough options to let you tweak
and adjust the included graphics, or to draw your own.

It all borrows fairly heavily from Corel's CorelDraw product and
even feels fairly similar, but is far easier to get to grips with.

The standard options for type adjustment and colour changing are in
place and the interface is similar to all the Corel line of
products.

An additional notebook option lets absolute beginners get to grips
with Print House by popping up buttons with labels like 'Edit
Project', 'Save Project' and 'Exit Print House'.

It really would be difficult to get lost with this product and I'm
sure that was its main purpose.

Messages

Aside from the conventional collection of clip-art, Print House
includes a large selection of desktop printer-quality photographs
and an even larger collection of canned messages like "Wishing You
A Wonderful Day" and "For A Nice Grandma. Did You Know That
Wherever You Go, Happiness Follows."

If the youngster of the house wants a card making application, then
the glove fits.

AZTECH ZETA MASTERS ART OF SPEED READING: Aztech Zeta 10X CD-ROM Drive (CDA
1068)

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Alan Andrews

In increasing number of software developers today opt in favour of
the CD-ROM drive as the preferred storage media.

CD-ROM drive manufactures are also churning out ever faster CD-ROM
drives.

We evaluated one such offering from Aztech Systems: the Aztech Zeta
10X CD-ROM drive (Model CDA-1068).

The X-factor

In its nomenclature, the X signifies its basic data transfer speed
of 150 kbps, hence 10X signifies 1500 kbps.

Fast CD-ROM drives like the Zeta do fill a need: a sluggish CD-ROM
drive can take ages to retrieve information from a CD-ROM.

Faster CD-ROM drives speed up the transfer of information from the
CD- ROM to the computer system.

This results in good quality reproduction of animated files from a
CD-ROM disk.

Test Drive

We decided to evaluate the Aztech Zeta drive considering the
reality of today's requirements instead of merely testing whether
it conformed to specifications.

To ensure compatibility on different machines, we tested the Zeta
drive on an assembled 486 as well as on a branded Pentium machine.

Both machines were loaded with 8 MB RAM and an IDE drive interface.

What immediately strikes the lay user about the Zeta drive are its
ease of installation and use.

It took us barely 15 minutes to connect the drive and kick start
the Windows 95 machine.

Windows 95 has built in drivers that recognise the drive.

Speeding Ticket

Next we tested it for speed.

Having loaded the Microsoft Encarta 95 CD-ROM encyclopedia disk, a
search for the specific words brought up the results in the
twinkling of an eye.

The Zeta drive is also capable of playing normal Audio CDs.

Its front panel has an easily accessible volume control, a
stop/eject button and a play/skip button.

The drive also has the capability to run multimedia games, minus
the jerky motion.

We tested the drive with WarCraft, Rebel Assault, Power Monger and
Flight Simulator.

While running most games, a CD-ROM drive has to look into the CD-
ROM for code or pictures.

When the CD-ROM drive is slow in its search, it takes time to
locate the information, causing a temporary break in the game or
introducing a jerky motion of the animated object.

With the Zeta CDA 1068 we did not experience any of these hitches.
The drive is excellent retrieving data:  it took just 12 seconds to
read 52 MB of data from the data CD.

Support

While the performance of the drive was good, the documentation on
the drive is just a skimpy leaflet.

It does not reveal much. For instance, it did not mention what the
purpose of a red jumper on the CD-ROM drive is.

The Customer Support Number in the warranty certificate led us to
chase up three other numbers.

Though the leaflet mentions that the Customer Support Number is 65-
741-7211, the actual number we had to call was 65-742-9633.

This number is not listed in the Certificate of Warranty literature
provided by Aztech.

However the people providing help on 65-742-9633 are extremely
patient, competent and helpful.

Aztech's Web site,  www.aztech.com.sg, was a good source of
information for Aztech products, FAQs as well as utilities and
drivers.

Evaluation

Overall the Aztech CDA 1,068 10X drive does answer the requirements
of today's impatient, speed-hungry users.

It does its job quickly, efficiently and with a minimum of fuss,
which is what the lay user wants.

DBMS REVAMP HELPS INFORMIX PIP SYBASE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

IN A recent report on the DBMS market, US-based market research
firm, the Gartner Group, reported that it observed a shift in the
database ranks in 1995 with Sybase and Informix swapping positions.

Sybase, said the report, reacted to significant technical and
quality challenges with the delivery of System 11 but the damage
had already been done with System 10 and it fell to No. 3 in DBMS
revenues.

Informix, on the other hand, addressed the challenges of
scalability when it undertook a complete DBMS redesign in 1990.

The company also turned a corner in 1995 with a shift in focus to
supporting high-end OLTP and DSS solutions.

The Illustra acquisition also positions Informix strongly to
support the new application demands beyond the year 2000.

In the Asia-Pacific, IDC figures tallied with the Gartner Group's
findings, placing Informix third behind Oracle and IBM but ahead of
Sybase.

WILL INFORMIX BE LATE?

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

INFORMIX first announced Universal Server back in February 1996
after it had finalised its acquisition of Illustra. According to
the company, Universal Server will integrate Illustra's dynamic
content management system into its Dynamic Scalable Architecture.

When finally delivered in the fourth quarter of 1996, Universal
Server will be able to manage all information assets including
numbers, images, maps, sound, video, Web pages and text.

Some industry analysts doubted, however, that Informix would be
able to meet the deadline.

"It takes a year just to debug an application, let alone merge a
one million-line RDBMS with a 500,000-line server," said Rick
Finkelstein, president, Performance Computing. "It will never
really happen."

The Aberdeen Group, on the other hand, felt that despite the
technical details, Informix's target was achievable. "Informix's
parallel-scalable architecture combined with extensible DataBlade
modules will put Informix well-ahead of its competitors," said a
recent Aberdeen report on Universal Server technology.

INFORMIX WILL KEEP FOCUS ON DATABASE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by William Oei

WO: INFORMIX's financial results for Q2'96 defied earlier downcast
projections with 38 per cent revenue growth over the corresponding
period last year. Why was this so?

WT: One of the reasons was the strong 51 per cent growth that we
experienced in the Asia-Pacific. Some countries in Southeast Asia
eclipsed even this with 80 per cent growth rates.

The economies here are growing fast with a lot of data to
manipulate. Companies here need the kind of database power that we
can offer.

Worldwide, we saw our database licenses grow by 61 per cent over
1995 and our new product releases and announcements such as
Informix Workgroup Server for Unix and Windows NT and Informix
OnLine Extended Parallel Server 8.1 and Universal Server were well
received.

What differentiates Informix from the other database vendors such
as Oracle and Sybase?

First and foremost, unlike our competitors, we focus on nothing
else but on database and database tools and are thus able to
channel all our resources toward this end.

Some 70 per cent of our revenues come from our database business.

We recognise that we cannot be the best in everything and thus work
with a wide range of partners from system vendors like Digital
Equipment, application vendors such as Baan, SAP, SSA and
Peoplesoft, consultants like the Big Six, and systems integrators
like NCS, ST Computers and CSA.

In this way, we can leverage off the core strengths of each party
other.

We are also very focused on a few industries to prevent ourselves
from being spread too thin.

These areas include the telco, manufacturing, banking and finance
and particularly in Asia, the government industries.

Some analysts say that difficulties in integrating the Informix and
Illustra databases will delay Universal Server. Is this true?

Absolutely not. Although it won't be easy task to integrate the
object-oriented database from Illustra with our relational-based
one, we are confident of meeting our year-end ship date.

In September, we will launch the Datablade Developers Program and
already have at least 24 companies including the likes of Adobe
Systems, Macromedia, MapInfo and Verity, writing datablades for a
whole host of applications such as text search/management, video
search and retrieval and electronic commerce.

Industry analysts reported in February, after we officially
acquired Illustra, that we had an 18 month headstart on our
competition in multi-dimensional, object-oriented relational
database technology.

What are Informix's expansion plans in the Asia-Pacific?

You will see us putting in more offices, more people, more hardware
resources such as the Advanced Training Centre (see page 2 News) we
recently set up with Digital, more training centres, and tighter
relations with our ISVs and channel partners.

We are also looking at adding to the four offices we already have
in China, and to the three in India. Korea is another possibility
for increased presence.

In Southeast Asia, we currently have offices in Philippines,
Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and will establish one in Indonesia
within the next six months.

BATTLE WILL CENTRE ON INTRANET FRONT

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Yap Cheng Theng

NETSCAPE has made it clear it is not in the browser war with
Microsoft but in the intranet war as it unveils its strategy in the
corporate world and in the Asia-Pacific.

Speaking to reporters after launching Navigator 3.0 in Hong Kong
recently, Quentin Gallivan, VP, Asia-Pacific Sales, Netscape
Communications, said the company intends to compete with Microsoft
in three ways: support cross-platform environment; support open
standards and provide intranet solutions at a better
price/performance level and lower cost of ownership.

"Microsoft Internet/intranet products support only the Windows
environment, only 38 per cent of the entire marketplace. Our
products cover 100 per cent of the marketplace as we provide
multiplatform support including Windows, OS/2, Mac and Unix," said
Gallivan.

Corporate Sales

Stressing that 80 per cent of Netscape's current sales come from
corporations, Gallivan said Netscape's initiatives in this market
include Navigator; Netscape One, the developers programme targeted
at both developers and independent software developers; Navio, a
new division that will look into using Navigator on gaming and
paging devices as well as interactive TV sets; and Actra, a
solution for electronic commerce.

On the server side, Gallivan said the enterprise server, mail
server and news server are now available with certificate server
and directory server  available by the end of the year.

Netscape recorded US$75 million in revenues for Q2 ended June '96.

Citing analyst projections, he said by end 1996, the company may
well hit the US$300 million range.

In Asia, Netscape's strategy is two-fold. The first is to develop
local partnerships in every country and secondly, to set-up Asia-
Pacific offices to provide in-depth technical and product support
as well as marketing functions.

"We want to get the Asia-Pacific faster into Netscape's product
lifecycle," said Gallivan, which is why the company recently opened
an office in Hong Kong, he added.

Following this, there will be an office in Malaysia and Korea
within the next six months.

Netscape will also deploy mirror Web sites in the region which will
have more localised content and more accessible information.

A mirrored Web site is operational  in Australia, being built up in
Japan and will be set up in Hong Kong and Singapore towards the end
of this year.

Netscape has appointed Hong Kong's JOS Distribution as its master
distributor in January this year. Sales have been growing 30 to 40
per cent month-on-month, said Albert Chan, GM, JOS Distribution.

NETSCAPE UNWRAPS CROSS PLATFORM OS

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Tim Bajarin

If you had ever wondered about Netscape's intentions of turning
their popular browser into a cross platform operating system, you
can wonder no more.

Netscape recently announced the Netscape AppFoundry, which is a new
application model for developing enterprisewide applications.

Eighty per cent of Netscape's revenues come from the use of their
browsers and network software in enterprise systems.

Their goal is to gain 30 to 50 per cent market share in corporate
environments where client-server architecture is becoming standard
even for mission critical operations.

Cross Platform Technology

They see their main competition coming from Lotus Notes and
Microsoft's Back Office, but Netscape is bullish about their
projected goals since they believe that they have an edge due to
their true cross platform technology.

At the heart of the AppFoundry is a set of tools that would let
users build applications based on a common intranet infrastructure.

Netscape claims that with these tools a user could develop and
deploy a fully distributed knowledge repository that is built once
and can run anywhere.

More importantly, it could work with legacy systems databases,
platforms and even applications.

This is the original vision of all of the software gurus who have
been touting object-based back-end software for over a decade.

Cross Platform

However, the Internet, and more particularly, intranets, make it
possible for a true cross platform object software model to emerge
and Netscape plans to be in the forefront of this development.

The AppFoundry could be pivotal in this scenario as it would create
the back-end network and applications layer that would work on any
existing desktop PC, as well as thin clients.

At the core of AppFoundry is something call ed Netscape SuiteSpot,
where network productivity applications, such as publishing,
collaboration, messaging, search and indexing and directory and
security reside.

A user would utilise this SuiteSpot to link these applications to
company-specific applications such as R&D, human resources, sales
and distribution, finance, customer service and marketing.

Over the next nine months, Netscape will create and develop the
tools to deliver on this concept, starting with Netscape SuiteSpot
software, a full service intranet suite, followed by the Netscape
One and Development tools.

By Q1 of 1997, they will start delivering the AppFoundry
applications and tool kit, which will then give users a set of
enterprisewide solutions.

This new venture is interesting since it uses Java and JavaScript
source code, which will be given free and is downloadable,
modifiable and viewable from the 'Net.

With their AppFoundry program, Netscape is clearly on a path to
take Microsoft head on and push to have their Netscape browser
become the GUI not only for the 'Net but for all applications in
the future.

With the AppFoundry, they now have a set of development tools that
is truly cross platform and one that should make them a formidable
competitor.

HK OEM FIRM turns to innovation

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Mby Joy Tang

Manufacturing VGA cards for OEM and ODM customers is no longer
enough for Hong Kong company Express Office Automation.

Six years after acting as an OEM/ODM VGA card shop, the company has
decided to offer a value-added series of VGA cards for the retail
market under its Elephant brand name (see photo at right).

According to Andson Lam, MD, Express Office Automation, the firm
currently supplies more than 50 per cent of the world's VGA cards.

However, lack of product differentiation has forced local companies
to compete largely on price, quantity, or by cutting material
costs.

The convergence of PC, video and TV technologies were behind Lam's
decision on VGA cards as his first retail product family.

"Since MPEG software technology today has already advanced to
supporting 28 to 50 fps, we believe that it's also time for VGA
cards and MPEG software to replace the hardware MPEG card in
providing smooth video CD entertainment on the PC and television,"
he said.

Lam added that users prefer to record computer images onto video
rather than storing them onto the hard disk. "To do so, they need a
VGA-to-TV converter," he said.

In addition, edutainment applications are best viewed on a large
screen TV than on the standard 14-inch PC monitor, he said.

"It is the first time we have something for retail," Lam said. "If
we produced a conventional VGA card, it would be the same as any
other. I could not have added a brand name."

After six months of R&D by a six-man engineering team, Express
Office Automation came up with the Elephant Power Video series of
VGA cards which currently has 12 models based on chipsets from
Alliance, Trident, S3, and Cirrus Logic.

Unique Features

The distinguishing feature of the cards is the optional US$40 EV-
TO-03 PC-to-TV signal converter module daughtercard, which fits
onto a custom-designed, 20-pin connector built onto each card.

The value-addition comes from optimising VGA output for TV
resolutions.

Robert Chan, Express Office Automation's engineering manager, said
that the latest US chipset and digital-to-analogue circuit
technology had been employed to achieve near-PC monitor quality on
the television display.

"The EV-TO-03 is designed with an anti-flicker and phase-locked
loop circuit to provide the best performance of VGA-to-TV
conversion," he said.

"Users can connect their PCs to a standard TV through an external
S-Video or composite TV connector, and adjust the horizontal and
vertical screen position externally."

Interest in the product has been promising, with over 4,000 cards
sold in two months of promotion.

Bundling agreements have already been forged with PC companies Ta
Chi Computer in Beijing and East Ocean Computer in Shanghai, while
other partnerships are under discussion in the US, Germany, Korea
and Israel.

Lam projects sales of 5,000 to 10,000 VGA cards a month.

About 3,500 VGA cards and 2,000 daughtercards a day are being
produced at the company's Shenzhen factory, and production volume
is expected to reach a million units annually.

The company  is also working on a project to design a motherboard
for an Internet appliance. Lam said that the motherboard will
integrate VGA, TV output, I/O, audio and modem functions in a
notebook-sized form factor.

ASIAN FIRMS TRYING TQM FOR QUALITY

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

As Asia's economies continue to boom, many companies are now facing
quality management issues which will determine their future success
in the global business arena.

Convincing employees to take responsibility for their production
lines and make their own decisions may be the toughest obstacle
companies in Asia will need to overcome.

Positive results can be achieved through departmental initiatives
that fulfil local objectives, provided there is support from senior
management to implement Total Quality Management (TQM) programmes.

A new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), The Quest
for Quality: Mastering Management in Asia examines TQM, focusing
primarily on quality in the Asian context.

The report bases its conclusions on a survey of several hundred UK
and Hong Kong firms, examining how companies in Asia have adopted
TQM and what benefits and pitfalls they have experienced.

To evaluate different approaches to quality, the report compares
TQM and Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and concludes that
BPR can be seen as the successor to TQM.

Pros And Cons

While TQM involves systematic performance measures, benchmarking,
empowerment and continuous development, BPR deals with the process
of "deconstructing" a company to better meet customer needs.

BPR examines a company's entire future structure and then attempts
to reorganise things according to senior executives' ideals.

However, companies cannot achieve dramatic restructuring without
the right human resources co-operation and management expertise.

On the other hand, TQM tends to deal with corporate and local
culture first.

A TQM process may involve a certain amount of restructuring - most
commonly, a move towards cross-functional work structures.

BPR and TQM can be integrated successfully through a dual-track
approach designed to incorporate the TQM process with the corporate
planning process.

Having defined its mission for quality, management must then
determine what is critical to achieving successful results.

A full review of the company's strengths and weaknesses in relation
to these critical success factors should reveal important areas
where improvements can be made.

Asian Responses

According to the report, Asian junior and middle managers are wary
of TQM, but senior managers tend to view it as the only authentic
revolution in management practice in the last 40 years.

The report offers guidelines on the different approaches to
implementation of TQM and provides various measures on how to
measure results.

The tendency to run companies in a traditionally patriarchal way is
widespread in Asia, with the CEO seen as a father figure
responsible for all management decisions.

The report warns that ISO 9000, traditionally regarded as the
internationally recognised standard of quality, should not be
confused with ongoing TQM programmes.

While it may increase competitiveness and satisfy clients, it is
unlikely to foster a culture of continuous improvement.

Most companies which implement successful TQM programmes see
certification in ISO 9000, at best, as one of a number of important
milestones on the way to a broader and more long-term goal.

A case study in the report looks at the success of a TQM system
established in the 1980s by Hong Kong's Kowloon-Canton Railway
Corporation (KCRC).

Benefits have included significantly raised profits and increased
customer and employee satisfaction.

Since 1990, operating costs have dropped by 19 per cent and the
KCRC has re-invested 11 per cent of the profit into the company,
passing on the remaining 8 per cent to the passengers through fare
reductions.

A case study on Texas Instruments in the Philippines reveals the
company's move away from a hierarchical structure with dogmatic
leadership focused on making products, towards a "flatter" network
structure with an inspirational leadership seeking to create new
markets.

The report concludes that an analysis of successful companies shows
that they have common characteristics: strong leadership and clear
vision; an empowered workforce; effective use of information
technology and teamwork; and careful management of resources to let
the company do "less with more".

The report shows that successful TQM strategies can be implemented
and results achieved in Asia, despite the indigenous cultures and
work philosophies common throughout the region.

It also shows that TQM can benefit all tiers of a company and, if
implemented correctly, result in higher production capacity, higher
bottom-line profits and job satisfaction among employees and,
ultimately, end-users.

IBM CHANGES TACK TO GAIN REVENUES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Isabelle Chan

IBM, the world's No. 1 computer company, raked in revenues of US$70
billion last year. The years prior to that saw Big Blue's financial
performance stagnating in the US$60 - US$65 billion revenue
bracket.

Although the revenue figures are probably the envy of many small as
well as large companies, IBM felt it was not growing.

"We realised we couldn't really grow, and it was critical for us to
grow," said Andrew Shields, director of Sales and Channels, Asia-
Pacific, IBM Software, speaking to ACW recently.

Eighteen months ago, IBM was restructured and the IBM Software
Company headed by John Thompson, was born.

"We see software as the lynchpin between IBM hardware and services.
If we succeed in software, we can sell more services and hardware,"
said Shields.

The IBM Software Company can be said to be facing the same problem
as corporate IBM.

Despite revenues of US$12.7 billion in FY'95, making it the largest
software company in the world, Shields said its software business
was not growing. "Software was a profitable business for us, but it
was not growing the way we wanted," he said.

One-third of the total software business was found in large systems
or mainframe, which was not growing, Shields said.

"The growth was in desktop or distributed systems software.
Although we are seen as a major player, we need to become No. 1 in
order to compete with companies like Microsoft and Novell," said
Shield.

"We realised that if we continued with what we were doing, we could
not become No.1 as the competition had too much of a headstart."

Therefore, Shields siad the strategic direction for the software
group was to shrug off its proprietary history and be "open".

New Strategies

To do that, IBM embarked on technology acquisitions of companies in
collaborative/workgroup computing and supporting multiple
platforms.

In addition, it began to develop internal products that also worked
in a heterogeneous environment.

The Lotus and Tivoli acquisitions not only offered products that
fitted into IBM's network-centric computing focus, but also
provided access to markets that Big Blue did not have.

The story does not end here. IBM still had a number of issues to
address.

Firstly, because its focus was solely on direct selling, it lacked
resources to cover the whole market.

"We didn't have enough people to cover the market, and our
competitors were gaining market share. So we decided to focus on
our business partners and formed the BESTeam programme," said
Shields.

"Particularly in the last two years, we realised the value of
external business partners in growing IBM. The challenge is to
build both internal and external channels and to work in harmony."

According to Shields, the new programme essentially helps its
BESTeam members to increase revenue, reduce costs and enhance the
company's image. IBM currently offers BESTeam members free
technical and product training till the end of the year.

The Business Enterprise Solution Team (BESTeam) programme has some
700 members, and the number is expected to hit 1,000 by year-end.
The initial target was 250 for 1996.

Ninety per cent of IBM's Asia-Pacific software revenues last year
were generated through direct selling. Shields is aiming for 80 per
cent of desktop software in the Asia-Pacific to be sold through its
external channels.

"So far, we're pleased with the results, and we are set to achieve
our target. At the end of July this year, 75 per cent has been sold
through our business partners," he said.

Comparing with IBM's Asia-Pacific software revenues of US$2 billion
last year, Shields said he expects a better performance this year
with a target of US$2.3 billion, half of which will be from desktop
revenues.

Although IBM will continue to be strong in its traditionally big
markets Japan and Australia, its key focus will be on the growth
markets in Asean and Greater China.

Market-oriented Approach

Shields also said that IBM needs to move from a sales-oriented
approach to become more of a marketing-oriented company in order to
be successful.

"We found that IBM is the largest software company in the world
which most people didn't realise,  including ourselves. We need to
communicate it and tell our customers what we are doing," he said.

When asked if the negative image of OS/2 has had any impact on the
rest of IBM's software products, Shields said: "There's a negative
image of OS/2, and we've been reacting to the negative press. But
we have to stop it, and we don't have to apologise for it. OS/2 has
done well in the market it was targeted at, which is the corporate
market.

"We have new products, but OS/2 is just a small piece of the pie.
IBM's focus is on open systems software and we're focusing heavily
on middleware," he added.

It appears IBM is turning around with a completely new strategy.
But is the IBMer ready for this new open approach?

"We are our own biggest enemy in terms of understanding what we
are. But the IBM culture is very strong. Many IBM staff have been
in the company for many years, since the days when we "ran" the
industry," said Shields.

"Now that we are employing people from outside, the negative
aspects of the IBM culture will break down, and people will become
more open minded."

HOME IMAGING HOLDS EXCITING POSSIBILITIES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

THE day is not far off when consumers will be able to take a
photograph, manipulate the image and print it on a printer at home.
This is Hewlett-Packard's vision for the future.

Its Home Imaging Division, formed about 18 months ago, focuses on
the development of this new concept, said Vjomesh Joshi, general
manager, Home Imaging Division, HP.

According to Joshi, 60 million photos are taken each year, and over
29 per cent of PC owners would like to manipulate photos on their
computer.

HP has earmarked 1997 as the year when its vision to bring
photography to the home PC will become reality. According to Joshi,
the division will introduce a home imaging system next year.

Joshi believes market opportunities exist as the number of
multimedia home PCs is expected to grow from 40 million this year
to 120 million by the year 2000.

The key success factors for the technology to become mainstream are
many. Joshi believes the technology has to reach a price point that
is affordable to consumers, have high photographic quality, be easy
to use, and be integrated with on-line services.

SECURITY, COMMUNICATIONS VENDORS GET ACT TOGETHER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by John Stephens

Traditionally data communications and security have been two
completely separate disciplines.

Companies that produced state-of-the-art communications products
did not dabble in cryptography, while security specialists were not
prepared to invest in the highly competitive world of data
communications.

This led to the emergence of conflicting standards and requirements
for communication and security.

Does a mass market for secure communications  exist? And if it
does, who are the users?

A few years ago the answer to this question would have been in the
negative.

The few existing users were restricted to the financial and
government market sectors.

However technology has opened up new opportunities for
communications which did not exist a few years ago.

New business practices such as telecommuting, cybershopping and
'Net-based financial services are driving the requirements for low
cost, convenient and effective secure communications.

Security will become an integral part of data communications in the
future. The day will come when users will purchase communications
products with built-in security without being aware of its
presence.

Security Features

Building security into communications products should not mean that
security will be degraded.

To illustrate, we can use as an example the integration of security
features into the analogue dial-up modem. I use the modem as an
example only because it will be the most commonly used
communications device for the foreseeable future.

However similar arguments could be applied to leased line modems or
digital ISDN products.

There are some modem manufacturers who claim to offer a high degree
of security because they encrypt the data which passes through
their devices.

The provision of encryption does not in itself guarantee security.

The type of algorithm used to do the encryption is a critical
feature that a user should look for.

The average user is not qualified to determine the strength or
weakness of a manufacturer's proprietary algorithm.

To consider an example, it would be possible for a manufacturer to
build a buffer in a modem that stored 100 bits of data.

The contents of the buffer when full, would be read out in the
reverse order.

The effect of this would be blocks of 100 bits of data whose order
is reversed. While the data on the telephone line would appear
unreadable, it would be a trivial exercise to reconstruct the
original message.

This is a rather simple example but it demonstrates that the
average user has no chance of assessing the strength of the
security in a product.

The solution is to go for products that make use of security
techniques which are in the public domain and have been
independently assessed by experts in the field of cryptography.

The use of public domain algorithms creates further problems.

If the details of an algorithm are known, then the security of the
data passing through the algorithm depends on security given to the
cryptographic keys  that are used.

Secure Key Management

There are products on the market which use the DES algorithm that
meets the criteria of being an independently verified algorithm,
and uses a single fixed key for the encryption of data.

Because these types of products generally have no means of changing
the cryptographic keys, the user is left with a product which is
useless.

Users should look for products which offer a secure key management
facility.

One such technique for secure key management is  the Diffie Hellman
key exchange.

The technique makes use of public key algorithms to securely
establish encryption keys between communicating modems.

Forward looking manufacturers of communications products are
looking to security vendors for help in combining communications
and security.

It will not be long before we will see fully secure LAN, ISDN and
X.25 interface products.

We will also start to see security being incorporated into the
communications standards.

HARDCOPY BUSINESS SET TO LEAP IN ASIA

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Hewlett-Packard is looking to grow its hardcopy business with major
investments by its Business LaserJet Division and Inkjet Printer
Group in the fast-growing Asian markets.

According to Chris Morgan, marketing centre manager, Peripherals
Group, Asia-Pacific, HP, the company's hardcopy business grew about
45.4 per cent, almost doubling the overall market growth of 22.8
per cent.

The highest growing countries, which grew more than 100 per cent,
are New Zealand, the Philippines and Indonesia, said Morgan.

According to Rich Raimondi, general manager, Business LaserJet
Division, Hewlett-Packard, the division is now looking to grow the
market, and is making major investments in Singapore and China.

In a bid to be more consumer-oriented, HP has introduced a change
in its manufacturing process, according to Pradeep Jotwani, general
manager, Consumer Sales & Marketing, Hewlett-Packard.

Its long term strategies were to move closer to the customer
through regional diversification; to increase contract
manufacturing for flexibility; and to improve and integrate the
information systems and delivery mechanisms.

HP ADDS EXCITEMENT TO PERIPHERAL MARKET

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Isabelle Chan from San Francisco, USA

The action in the printer and scanner markets today may seem dull
when compared to the exciting advancements in the PC or networking
arena.

But the Internet and future applications are set to make printer
and scanner markets more compelling technologies and more
interesting to watch.

According to senior executives at the recent Hewlett-Packard Asia-
Pacific Technologies Symposium in San Francisco, USA, peripherals
like the printer and scanner are set to become mainstream products,
with the Internet and new applications for the growing home market
being a driving force.

"Information created between 1995 and the year 2000 will be equal
in quantity to all information that previously existed," said Rich
Raimondi, general manager, Business LaserJet Division, Hewlett-
Packard.

"The Internet is, therefore, driving a new set of information needs
and requires a more efficient work-flow model."

HP's Digital Workplace strategy will streamline office processes by
integrating printing, scanning and the Internet in a new model of
information distribution.

According to HP, the increased use of networks and network printing
has accelerated a move from copying to 'mopying', a term that
describes the process of creating multiple original prints or
mopies on a laser printer.

Raimondi said the fundamental premise of mopying is to take pages
away from copier machines.

Over the past few years, lasers have become faster, cheaper and
more reliable.

The developments have resulted in a trend towards printing mopies
rather than multiple copies of an original.

Quoting Dataquest's research findings, Raimondi said 40 per cent of
users are already "mopying" on their laser printers.

Leveraging its experience in PC, printer and networking, HP is
scheduled to roll-out a mopier by year-end, said Raimondi.

HP's Inkjet Products Group is also broadening its product focus to
develop devices tweaked for specific applications such as large
format and photographic printing, instead of today's versatile-type
devices that handle a variety of printing needs.

On the scanner front, this peripheral has extended its role beyond
being a tool for graphic designers, and has carved a new niche for
itself in the new digital information age.

According to Phil Faraci, general manager, Greely Hardcopy
Division, HP, scanners are becoming "everyday devices". They are
now adopted as digital input devices in mainstream business
offices.

Faraci said the new concept is "scan to share", bridging paper and
digital communications. The benefits include faster transmission of
information, lower costs, and greater control as users can easily
manipulate information from the desktop and print only what is
needed.

Driving the demand for scanners are its ease-of-use, the growth in
computational memory power and the availability of low-cost output
devices.

"Three years ago, there were no low-cost output devices to exploit
the scanner's capabilities. Today the printer quality is improving,
hence the increase in scanner demand," said Faraci.

According to figures from market research firm InfoTrends Research
Group, the number of flatbed scanners is estimated to increase from
1.3 million in 1995 to 2.8 million in 1997.

DISPLAYS BECOMING BIGGER, BRIGHTER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Joy Tang

The 1996 Society for Information Display Symposium (SID), held in
the US earlier this year, reflected a number of diverging trends in
the display market.

According to Dave Mentley, VP of Display Industry Research at
Stanford Resources, there were a number of technical breakthroughs
which are close to commercialisation.

The viewing angle of LCDs is set to see some changes. "In a sign of
the maturing of the AM (active matrix) LCD market, viewing angle
improvement has become a major focus," he said. "What was once just
a minor nuisance and a point of differentiation between active and
passive matrix addressing has now become an obsession. The idea is
to get to the same viewing quality as the CRT monitor in an LCD."

Mentley noted that some LCD monitors today have better performance
than some CRT monitors.

"As with everything else, the means to improve the viewing angle is
very complicated," he said.

"The latest and most intriguing is the in-plane switching mode.
Hitachi's Super TFT is based on this technique and NEC just
unveiled their version. Both samples were nothing short of
stunning."

Mentley stressed that the technique is actually decades old, but
the tools to implement it became available only recently.

"The results so far show that they do work and clearly can be
made," he said.

Other improvements in viewing angle employ high voltage drivers,
such as those by Vivid, thinner cell spacing, and multiple
alignment domains.

Another clear trend during the show had to do with packaging, such
as that for notebook computers.

"Notebook computer users used to ask why the manufacturers left so
much of a border around the display. Why not just make the display
bigger?" Mentley explained.

Mentley said that Mitsubishi had unveiled at the show a new 12.1-
inch TFT LCD with a 3.5-mm border at the bottom, so that the
distance from the bottom of the module to the edge of the display
viewing area is only 3.5 mm.

"The left and top borders are larger, but not by an excessive
amount. This is quite a feat of mechanical and electrical
packaging," he observed.

"The ability to do this advanced packaging could separate the
display world into the haves and have-nots of packaging, and this
will have serious implications for the ability to address advanced
applications. High density electronic packaging is not a trivial
task."

CRTS vs Flat Panels

CRTs may lose their place one day to flat panel monitors, and
progress is being made. "The wide angle TFT LCDs discussed above
play a key role in the viability of this market," said Mentley.

"Price clearly plays the biggest role. At the SID meeting, NEC
quietly unveiled a 20.x-inch, 1280 by 1,024 display based on a type
of in-plane switching. The display was truly astounding. There were
one or two dead sub-pixels out of about 3 million.

"The viewing angle was about plus and minus 80 degrees in the
horizontal and vertical. The colours were saturated and it used
analog addressing.

"Samples are expected to go out at US$5,000 later this year. Expect
every stock trader in the US to have about five of these things."

Mentley felt that the progress was due to the bottom dropping out
of the 8.x to 10.x-inch TFT market.

"Since these smaller displays apparently can't even be given away,
it makes sense to take the old fabs and make something that is
desired," he said.

"Instead of 4-up 9.4- or 10.4-inchers, why not make a 1-up 20.8-
incher? It won't be a multi-million unit market, but the high end
of the monitor market has been begging for workstation-type flat
panel displays for years. IBM/DTI is reportedly doing a similar
thing with their 16-inch TFT LCD, but without the in-plane
switching."

Mentley added that  Fujitsu announced a workstation-quality, 25-
inch diagonal, 1,280 by 1,024 colour AC plasma display by 1997.

"This is the first time that anything better than 0.50 mm dot pitch
has been discussed for colour plasma. How they will produce it is
still unclear," he said.

Miniature displays, which are sub-one-inch, high resolution (more
than or equal to VGA format) displays, are another area to watch,
according to Mentley.

"Some of the most intriguing research and development work is going
on in the miniature display area. Besides the poly-silicon thin
film transistor, there are many new approaches," he said.

"Thin film EL, diffraction gratings with and without Liquid
Crystal, polymer dispersed LC on Silicon, LED, FEDs, field
sequential PDLC on a chip and the DMD are a few of the most
developed approaches.

"There are probably many more. We should expect very good colours
and high pixel counts in the near future."

Mentley presented his findings in the May 1996 issue of
International Display Report, an electronic publication from the
SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International)
Newsletter Service.

CHINA'S NETWORK HUNGER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

The China networking market started to boom in 1993 and by 1994,
almost all the well-known US vendors rushed in, fueling even faster
growth. Between 1993 and 1995, the market quadrupled in size.

Although the networking market accounts for less than one tenth of
the total IT market, its share is increasing.

In 1995, 1.15 million PCs were sold in China. With about 42 per
cent currently connected to a network, the network market was worth
RMB4.5 billion (US$540 million) in 1995.

Network users in China however are in general not familiar with
advanced network applications such as voice and image
transmissions, and primarily use the network to transfer files or
share resources.

China started to build large scale computer networks in the early
1980s when the government built 12 WANs.

These WANs included the Railway Information Network, Banking
Network, and Meteorological Information Network.

The Railway Information System was the earliest nation-wide
network. It has 4 levels, with 70 nodes per level for a total of
700 medium and small computers, 20,000 PCs, and 4,000 terminals.

By the end of 1995, about 1.11 million computers were connected
into networks. The average growth of the connection rate has been
about 37 per cent a year since 1990.

The percentage of computers networked grew about five times between
1990 and 1995.

Still Low-End?

Nearly 80 per cent of networked computers are PCs. The rest are
workstations, servers, and larger computers. About 51 per cent of
the networks are LANs. Over half of the LANs are primarily utilised
for file sharing. Around 10 per cent of the LANs are also used for
e-mail.

Most of the WANs were low-speed. An ordinary telephone line is the
most common connection method. Over half of the WANs run at 2.4
Kbps, although 9.6 Kbps is becoming more popular.

Point-to-point data transmission accounted for more than half of
WAN usage, while e-mail accounted for 21 per cent.

Buying Criteria

China still functions on price. The Chinese usually seek the latest
technology at the lowest price. During the earlier phase of the
networking industry, lower prices won the tug-of-war. However,
higher functionality is starting to become more important.

Price ranks as the most important criteria when buying networking
equipment, but it also represents the number one impediment to new
technology.

New technology, such as ATM, 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet, and
Intelligent Switching Hubs are expected to become more popular only
at the turn of the century.

The Golden Projects

The Chinese government's national information infrastructure
projects are the key market. The Golden Projects alone drive a
large segment of the network market.

The Golden Bridge project will run from 1993 to 2002 and develop an
infrastructure for State macro-economic planning activities. It
will link information centres in the 30 provinces and
municipalities, covering 500 cities.

The system will involve a satellite-based ISDN network and fibre
optic land-based system and rival the ChinaPAC and SESA services
provided by the MPT.

The total investment in the project is currently projected at about
RMB20 billion (US$2.38 billion).

The Golden Customs project will run from 1993 to 2003, linking
information systems in foreign trade companies to form an EDI
network. This will also  lead to automatic customs declarations.

The system will run on a satellite backbone using e-mail and EDI
applications linking many different foreign trade departments of
government and industry.

The first phase of EDI implementation is already complete with a
pilot system at Beijing's Capital Airport and two further systems
are being installed in Shanghai and Guangzhou.

The Golden Card project will run from 1993 to 2003 and is designed
to develop a system of national banking transaction cards.

The development of two national information centres will be central
to the project. The basic aim is to build credit and cash usage
amongst China's 300 million urban residents. Currently there are
only 3.2 million cards in the whole country.

Network decisions are still being made and Golden Card could use
either Golden Bridge and ChinaPAC (the MPT packet switching
service), or both.

The Golden Tax project runs from 1994 to 1998 and supports the
recent development of a national value-added tax system.

The project will be based around the Clearing Centre of the
People's Bank of China which already has an extensive network with
over 100 servers and 4,000 terminals.

In its initial phases, Golden Tax will create a demand for RMB500
million (US$59.5 million) in hardware and software.

The Golden Medical project started operation in 1995 and is being
designed to provide accurate health care information on a national
basis.

The system will be based on the Golden Bridge network and will
initially connect around 50 hospitals.

The Golden Intelligence or CERNET project began in 1995 and is
designed to link all university campus networks, eventually
spreading to middle and primary schools.

By the end of century, CERNET will be the biggest Internet user in
China. Initially, there will be one main network centre with 10
satellite centres around the country.

The Golden Enterprises project will begin in 1996 and is designed
to improve information flow between enterprises and between
business and government.

This system will be based on the Golden Bridge network.

The Golden Agricultural project will commence in 1996 and establish
a national agriculture database. Again the Golden Bridge network
will be used for the project.

The Green Card project will run from 1995 to 2000 and is designed
to implement a national network to support the deposits and
withdrawals from Post Office savings accounts.

It is worth noting that China, after Japan, has the second highest
savings rate of any major economy at around 33 per cent.

Again, the Golden Bridge network will be used for this system.
Ultimately, the system will have to cover 10,000 post offices in
500 cities.

Forecast Ahead

In addition to Golden Projects, the 12 nation-wide National
Information Networks established in the 7th Five Year Plan need to
be upgraded.

The networks involve economics, science and technology, public
security, defence, statistics, post & telecommunication,
electricity, civil aviation, meteorological, railway, and
population control.

These projects will need an estimated investment of RMB100 billion
(US$12 billion) over the next 10 years. The Chinese government
plans to provide 20 per cent of this.

More than 50 per cent of the technology and equipment used in the
projects are already network industry products.

Assuming that the government follows through on its commitments,
the China network market will be worth at least RMB5 billion
(US$600 million) over the next decade.

If private investment follows, the market potential for the
countrywide networking projects will be around RMB10 billion (US$
1.2 billion) per year during the next 10 years.

The size of the Chinese network market in 1996 will also reach
RMB10 billion (US$1.2 billion).

The market will continue to grow at a healthy clip.

The most popular segments will relate to the Internet, on-line
information services, network training and technology transfer.

SERVICE PROVIDERS PUT USERS ABOVE ALL

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by William Oei

NETWORK servicing in the Asia-Pacific is becoming increasingly
sophisticated as Western-based vendors start scaling up their
operations here.

Anixter, for example, recently unveiled a grand masterplan to
expand its presence here, spending over US$10 million in 1996 alone
on building up its infrastructure.

ITS, a division of the SITA Network Group, also announced an
increase in its service offerings in the region, unwrapping three
new services for Cisco users and a flexible package scheme from its
Cisco Technical Assistance Centre in Australia.

"We are not in the drop-ship business where you can get by without
interfacing with the customers," said Bob Grubbs, president and
CEO, Anixter, who was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, recently.

"We have to get down to the end-user level and get in touch with
the customers."

This, as the company found out, was not always so easy in this part
of the world.

"Restrictions in some parts of Asia such as Indonesia, India and
Vietnam sometimes prevent us from achieving this," said Kuala
Lumpur-based Jimmy Goh, managing director, Southeast Asia, Anixter.

"In these cases, we have no choice but to work through partners and
distributors. We have to be flexible enough to adapt to different
economic and political situations."

Anixter, who has reseller agreements with vendors such as Bay
Networks, IBM and Xylan, plans to leverage its core competencies in
value-added distribution, cabling systems and project
implementation for networks.

According to Grubbs, the greatest challenges for the networking
industry in Asia is the shortage of skills here and the incomplete
public network infrastructure.

To help ease the skills shortage problem and to add value to its
basket of service offerings, the company is in the midst of setting
up training facilities for the transfer of networking skills to
Asia.

"We want to be the greatest value-added providers," said KH Wun,
president of Anixter Asia-Pacific.

"The holders of technical knowledge in the US currently don't have
a proper means of transferring knowledge to Asian customers. We
want to help fill this void."

He added that training and education only accounts for about 3 per
cent of Anixter's total business but the company seems happy with
that level of revenue contribution.

"We are transitioning to a specialist company to focus on building
the network infrastructure," said Wun.

"That's our vision and our ultimate goal. In some parts of the
world, we have already achieved this but not in Asia."

To achieve its objectives here, Anixter has been steadily putting
the necessary pieces in place.

"The staffing for the Asia-Pacific has increased by a large scale,
both in numbers and skillsets," said Wun.

"For example, the Southeast Asian offices have tripled its
recruitment of skilled personnel over the past year. We have also
boosted our infrastructure with bigger sales and warehousing
locations and ventured into new territories such as Vietnam."

In Southeast Asia, the fastest growing market for Anixter,
Malaysia, has been at the centre of the company's expansion
activities.

"Malaysia is now the regional headquarters of our Southeast Asian
operations," said Low.

"We are setting up training facilities and an interoperability lab
in the Malaysia office to better serve our customers in the
surrounding areas."

He added that the interoperability lab will serve as a testbed for
functional testing of different LAN and WAN configurations when it
is fully operational by year-end.

SITA subsidiary, ITS, is also increasing its service offerings to
cater to the maturing demands of its networking customers in the
region.

"As a service company, it is imperative that we look after our
customers," said Andy Cocks, director of the newly set up ITS Asia-
Pacific Australasia client services division.

"The new client services division will enhance this strategy by
introducing a number of customer-focused initiatives."

Three new packages - Cisco Essential; Cisco Plus; and Cisco Select,
boost the company's Global LAN Internetworking Solution, a
worldwide integrator partnership that the company signed in June
with Cisco.

"Customers no longer require break/fix support," said Cocks.

"As products become more complex, we need to be able to offer
value-add in troubleshooting, product information and software
updates."

ANIXTER PICKS SCITOR FOR DATACOMMS

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Value-added network services provider Scitor has been awarded a
US$8 million, three-year contract by Anixter, to provide data
communications services for Anixter in 60 locations across the
world.

Anixter has replaced its multi-vendor overseas data network with
Scitor's global network, a network which spans 225 countries.

Anixter will implement Scitor's Frame Relay, ISDN dial back-up
services and real-time network monitoring platform.

NETMANAGE HOLDS ALL THE ACES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

NETMANAGE, the vendor behind the Chameleon range of desktop
applications, is taking a holistic approach to the intranet market
with a full suite of products.

"Browsers only constitute one-sixth of the intranet market and will
not be our main focus," said Bobby Srinivasan, managing director,
Asia-Pacific & Latin America, NetManage.

"We have been involved in the Internet ever since we were
established in 1990. In fact we wrote Winsock which was one of the
factors which precipitated the growth of the Internet."

HK TELECOM LEADS IN ATM TECHNOLOGY USE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Yap Cheng Theng

HONGKONG Telecom became one of the earliest adopters of ATM
technology in the region when it launched an ATM service with
fibre-optic access running at 155 Mbps in Hong Kong.

According to Jeff Lui, senior product manager, ATM services,
Hongkong Telecom, the company began looking into such services back
in 1994.

Trials began only in September last year and spilled through to
March this year. The two companies that took part in the trials
were the Hospital Authority and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club.

Trials have also been conducted internationally with Cable &
Wireless Trans-Atlantic, Taiwan's ITA and US-based Sprint over
satellite link.

There will be three phases to Hongkong Telecom's ATM project which
involved HK$70 million (US$9 million).

The first phase will provide ATM connection; the second will
provide integration with its FrameLink service, based on Frame
Relay technology; and the third will be to provide international
ATM access and integration with other services.

The second phase is expected to be launched within a year, and the
third phase depends on market demand, said Lui.

Four ATM loops have been built, two each in Hong Kong island and
Kowloon.

Explaining Hongkong Telecom's focus on both ISDN and ATM
technologies, Lui said the company will continue to offer both
services, with ISDN phase target small and medium businesses and
ATM at large corporate customers.

Hongkong Telecom is also investigating 25 Mbps ATM technology as an
option on the desktop.

The monthly rental for the first 15 km of the ATM service is
HK$16,000 (US$2,064 ) and every additional 20 km costs  HK$10,000
(US$1,290).

Other tariffs involved are installation costs of HK$32,000
(US$4,128), internal relocation at HK$16,000 (US$2,064) and
external relocation costs of HK$32,000 (US$4,128).

CAN CA'S OPENINGRES LAST THE LONG HAUL?

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

TALK about rebirth of a product, one can't help but take a hard
look at OpenIngres.

This RDBMS, formerly the core product of ASK/Ingres, was acquired
by Computer Associates (CA) three years ago, but now seems to be
hanging cold out there in the market.

To be fair, CA has added new features to OpenIngres, in line with
its intention of acquiring first and integrating later.

Recently, this RDBMS was given another injection to ensure its
longevity. CA wants it to be open and to run on hardware platforms
from desktops to enterprise servers.

The maintenance release of OpenIngres 1.2/01 will be first made
available for Sun Solaris 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5x by next month.

Other platforms targeted for release before the end of November
this year are HP-UX 9.x, 10.x, IBM AIX 3.2x, 4.1x, Windows NT 3.51,
DEC Open VMS 6.1, 6.2 (Alpha and VAX), DEC Unix 3.2x, Sun OS 4.1.3,
SCO OpenServer 5.0, UnixWare 2.0x, NCR GIS 2.03x as well as servers
from Data General, Pyramid, Sequent and Siemens.

Added Features

Added features include SMP, cluster SMP and MPP technologies to
ensure support for intelligent datawarehouse and replication across
all environments, and OpenIngres/ICE for Internet/Intranet
functionalities.

Despite these additions, the survival of OpenIngres in the
marketplace is doubtful.

Allan Tan, industry analyst, Worldwide Services Group, Dataquest
Asia-Pacific, said OpenIngres is comparatively not popular in Hong
Kong.

Overall, the largest RDBMS player in Asia is still Oracle, followed
by either Informix or Sybase.

On the Unix platform, OpenIngres is facing challenges from IBM's
DB2 as well.

While there is a potential market for OpenIngres, Tan does not see
it coming  close to what has been achieved by the other three
players.

"A database vendor should be perceived as having good alliances
with hardware vendors. CA's profile hasn't really been strong in
this region," said Tan.

He said another drawback is CA's strategy of offering dual database
with OpenIngres and Jasmine, the OODBMS with a multimedia and
Internet-enabled toolset.

No Hybrid Applications

At CA World '96 in New Orleans recently, chairman and CEO Charles
Wang  made it clear that CA does not believe in hybrid applications
in the database arena and has no plans to combine the two products,
except to leverage on each other's technology.

"History has shown that it is hard for any vendor to offer two
types of databases as it create confusion in the marketplace," said
Tan.

According to Dataquest's first half 1995 estimates, the worldwide
RDBMS revenues of US$2.5 billion are split between IBM with 35 per
cent market share, Oracle with 19 per cent, CA with 11 per cent,
Sybase 8 per cent, Informix 5 per cent and the remaining going to
smaller players.

However, on both the server database and Unix database market, CA
was not even listed in Dataquest's top list of players.

The first half 1995 estimates for server database worldwide are
US$2.2 billion and a significant market share is split between IBM
with 40 per cent, Oracle 18 per cent, Sybase 9 per cent and
Informix 6 per cent.

On the Unix platform, however, Oracle dominates.

Out of the US$770 million estimates for the first half of 1995 for
Unix database, Oracle grabbed 48 per cent, Sybase 21 per cent and
Informix 16 per cent.

OpenIngres' survival is further challenged with the emergence of
Universal Server offered both by Oracle and Informix.

CA has not made any indication of ever offering Universal Server
functionality.

In a white paper by market research firm Aberdeen Group for July
1996, Universal Servers have been considered the RDBMS technology
for the next decade.

Although RDBMS has survived for 20 years focusing on simple types
of data such as integers, scientific floating point, character
strings, date/time and money, the research firm said RDBMSes are
under considerable technology pressure as "they do not handle
highly complex information well".

Universal Servers, on the other hand, the paper said, "will allow
IS organisations to extend their current RDBMS to handle complex
data types and work better with new technologies such as Intranets,
relational OLAP and latest development toolsets, ensuring that
enterprises can continue to leverage their existing investments in
RDBMS".

Challenges Ahead

While CA's effort in injecting more features and functionalities to
OpenIngres is commendable,  there are also others who remain
sceptical.

At Ingres World '96 in New Orleans in conjunction with CA World
'96, John Gilworth, Ingres System Administrator, Information
Systems Department of US-based HealthCare Compare was positive to
the changes and enhancements made to OpenIngres.

"Ingres is starting to lose third party support but with the new
enhancements, I believe CA is coming up as a strong player now. It
is important for CA to continue development support for Ingres," he
said.

Another Ingres user, Randall Eash, VP, Technical Service said CA's
major problem is implementation and belated execution of marketing
strategy.

It looks like CA has an uphill task ahead in getting Ingres back
into the mainstream of enterprises.

While it remains to be seen whether OpenIngres can survive further,
pressure is definitely mounting on CA's shoulders to prove its
critics wrong.

The heat is on, CA.

DIGITAL MCS GETS ISO 9002 FOR CUSTOMER SERVICES

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Customer requirements are behind the recent ISO 9002 certification
awarded to Digital's Multivendor Customer Service Centre, said
Matthew Liang, director, Multivendor Customer Services, Digital
Equipment Hong Kong.

He said Digital MCS is the first vendor to obtain an ISO 9002
certification for multivendor customer services in Hong Kong.

In the case of the MCS, ISO certification revolved around creating
a framework for standard processes and continuous improvement for
customer services like complaint handling.

Regina Luk, logistics and distribution manager, Digital MCS, Hong
Kong, said the ISO certification effort began in November 1995,
culminating with the ISO 9002 award from the Hong Kong Quality
Assurance Agency this July.

SCO AIMING TO BE LEADER IN UNIX SYSTEM SOFTWARE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

THE Santa Cruz (SCO) has extended its product offerings, aiming to
be the leading supplier of Unix system software for business
critical environments.

Explaining SCO's vision, Certina Ma, sales and marketing manager,
North Asia, SCO, said product directions will focus on three areas.

The first area is its commitment to deliver Windows to Unix
integration, with the announcement of a new product called Vision
FS, a file and print server. This follows its acquisition of IXI
and VisionWare.

Vision FS is the latest addition to SCO's Vision Family of Windows
to Unix integration products that include XVision, a PC server;
TermVision, a terminal emulator which allows PC users to store and
retrieve files in Unix; SQL Retriever, a tool to access SQL
database and SuperVision, a systems management tool.

The second area is the merged product of OpenServer and UnixWare
called Gemini, scheduled to be out by mid-1997.

In Asia, Ma said OEM sales for Gemini will be concentrated in
Taiwan, Korea and Japan.

However, in the run up to Gemini, SCO will continue to deliver
enhanced versions of OpenServer and UnixWare i.e. OpenServer 5.0.4
and UnixWare 2.1.1, bundled with migration tool kits for Gemini.

A layered product solution is SCO's third focus. Aimed at providing
Internet and connectivity services, its latest announcement is the
OEM availability of Network Client Operating System (NC/OS).

SCO claims NC/OS is the first low-cost, small footprint software
designed as a reliable, time-to-market solution for developing
Network Computers on standard Intel-based processors.

MOTOROLA PREPARES TO HIT MOBILE PC MARKET

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Joy Tang

Motorola has begun the Asian rollout for PC Card-based
multifunction peripherals to catch the wave in the fast growing
corporate mobile computing market.

"Three million PC Card (PCMCIA) modems are expected to ship
worldwide in 1996," said US-based Bob Leibowitz, director of
marketing, Mobile Computing Products Division, Information Systems
Group, Motorola.

"Modem-and-LAN adapters are a small but important part, with about
300,000 expected to ship in 1996." Leibowitz said that until
recently, it had been more expensive to buy a combination PC card
than purchasing each function separately.

The company will focus on countries where the notebook market is
more mature, namely Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore
and Hong Kong.

Said Leibowitz: "We will provide features that customers want at a
reasonable price with Motorola quality and support."

Leibowitz said that compressed transmission of voice, video and
data would fuel the popularity of applications like
videoconferencing, whiteboarding, and technical support through
remote diagnosis.

The killer application for PC card modems, however, would be the
intranet, he said.

Though the products were launched in the US in March, their
introduction was delayed in Asia because of homologatory
requirements. According to the company, products which conform to
PTT requirements are approved in 30 to 90 days.

Motorola's Information Systems Group, the umbrella organisation for
the Mobile Computing Products Division, plans to seek out resellers
who can offer custom bundles unique to their areas.

"The resellers are closer to the marketplace," said Ron Waeghe, VP
and GM, Asia-Pacific, ISG, Motorola. "The right software today
might be the wrong software tomorrow."

Products launched by the company include Montana, a 28.8 data/fax
modem PC card, and Mariner, a 28.8 data/fax/LAN card with cellular
connectivity, together with the secure SecurID modem.

H.K. WILL INCREASE TECHNICAL SUPPORT

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Motorola's Information Services Group plans to set up an Internet-
based response centre for technical support from Hong Kong, its
Asia-Pacific headquarters within a year.

Ron Waeghe, VP and GM, Asia-Pacific, ISG, Motorola Asia-Pacific,
said that the secure Web site, which would provide answers to
requests from simple questions to full-blown technical support, is
currently being tested by distributors.

Technical support is being offered  directly by Motorola's ISG in
Hong Kong, Japan, and India, and also through value-added
distributors.

Waeghe also said that collaboration between groups in the largely
decentralised Motorola was probable, though this was in the
preliminary stages.

"There is synergy between the Motorola Computer Group and the
Information Systems Group. We could package ISP solutions for the
marketplace."

Waeghe said that in the Asia-Pacific, the ISG grew 400 per cent
from year-end 1994, and the run rate had doubled since last year.

NEW M'SOFT OS GOES DOWN TO PDA LEVEL

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

On September 16, Microsoft formally announced their newest
operating system that is designed to be used on devices other than
a desktop computer.

Its initial use will be in a hand-held computer, originally known
as Pegasus, but now referred to as the HPC (or hand-held PC).

Microsoft had originally planned to introduce this new OS at Comdex
on November 17, but sources say they moved up the launch date to
get another message into the market quickly.

The OS inside Pegasus will now be called Windows CE. It had been
code named Gryphon.

The CE stands for Compact Edition, but it could also stand for
consumer electronics.

It is so named because Microsoft will push this OS for use in
various consumer electronics products that deal with digital data
access and delivery.

When the HPC makes its debut later in November, it will be
positioned as a mobile desktop companion.

The HPC concept is a hand-held computer that reportedly looks much
like the popular HP 200 LX, only slightly larger.

It will be positioned as a mobile Windows device that allows users
to carry desktop data with them wherever they go.

Although small in size, it will have a very clean approach to
synchronising data with the desktop.

Think of it as a data take-away device that allows you to pull
files off the desktop and take them with you anywhere you go.

While Windows CE is a different OS from Windows and all
applications for it will have to be written from scratch, it has
the same GUI as Windows 95.

That makes it very easy to learn and use.

Critical Product

This new OS from Microsoft is a critical product for them if they
are to take Windows beyond the traditional desktop PC market.

There is no way that they can downsize the original Windows 95 OS
for use on low-powered, small memory and low-cost based digital
consumer appliances.

Windows CE can work in one megabyte of DRAM and can also be used on
systems with processors other than those made by Intel.

Microsoft' s Windows CE will cause the analytical community to
focus on this operating system and its potential for use in real
consumer products.

This new OS is Microsoft's response to the recent Navio challenge
in their current tit for tat browser war with Netscape.

Microsoft stressed that Windows CE is for any "digital appliance"
and used examples of smart phones, smart set-top boxes and even
auto GPS systems to explain how Windows CE can be used in the
market.

The smart phone idea is perhaps the most important first real
digital appliance for the home that either Microsoft or Netscape
can focus on.

Web Applications

Although there are many vendors trying to get a Web TV into the
home as the first low cost Internet appliance, many of us who look
at the consumer adoption cycle for technology are not convinced the
Web TV will be successful.

For one thing, the traditional consumer is used to getting his
information from nightly newscasts that come in the form of live
full motion video, with various media rich illustrations.

But, the Web as it is today, delivers information only in text and
pictures.

The traditional consumer wants information delivered over the Net
instantly and with real time video, audio, animation and 3D.

Getting that on the Web will take much greater bandwidth and could
be years away.

On the other hand, I think that the consumer is ready and
interested in a phone that lets them e-mail.

One approach to this is a smart phone that is application specific.

That means that this device would connect to an existing phone and
be a keyboard and small screen in which the consumer can send e-
mail messages at will.

All they would need is a connection to some type of e-mail service,
such as ATT Mail or MCI Mail and the e-mail address of the person
they want to send their message to.

This "smart phone" could also be modular and although at first
might just be a small screen, keyboard and modem, it might be
upgradeable to take a larger screen, which you could then use for
Internet access to Internet Yellow Pages and the Web.

The initial smart phone for e-mail access would be very low cost,
although it would need to be based on some type of consumer OS.

That is where Microsoft's Windows CE and Netscape's Navio products
have real early consumer potential.

Future Potential

Over time, a consumer electronics OS, whether it be an off shoot of
Windows 95 like Windows CE is, or Navio's consumer technology,
which would be tied to Netscape's Navigator, could also be used on
smart set-top boxes, CD-ROM- and DVD ROM-based systems connected to
the TV.

Someday in the future, it may actually become the OS for use on the
digital TV, stereo systems and any other digital appliance in the
home.

That is why these new announcements from Microsoft and Netscape are
so important.

They are clearly set to be the big guns going after the consumer
electronic space where digital appliances will rule, and where no
single OS or Web environment is a standard today.

Whoever wins this battle for the hearts and minds of the consumer
vendors and users, will be the biggest winners of this digital crap
shoot to bring technology to the home, which to us marketing folks,
is where the real numbers are.

CA REAPS BENEFITS OF CUSTOMER CARE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Eighteen thousand visitors from 66 countries, 150,000 diskettes
given out, over 30 million pages of text produced: that sums up CA
World '96, held in New Orleans to celebrate Computer Associates'
20th Anniversary.

Charles Wang, CEO, in his speech wanted his technology extravaganza
to be the friendliest and he may well have achieved it.

Wang even invited every attendee at this year's CA World to attend
CA World '97 for free!

A mere marketing ploy? After spending close to US$10 million to
hold the event, CA would definitely not want  its guests to go home
disappointed.

The point here is that innovation alone does not ensure success
today.

Good innovations along with good marketing strategy would assure a
far better success.

It is a matter of convincing users that your technology works for
them via innovative marketing tools. CA recognised this and is
moving forward.

For the past 20 years CA had three core strategies: internal
development, acquisitions and integration. In recent years, forming
strategic partnerships became equally important.

CA's strategy has its share of critics. Some of the more cynical
say it killed products it acquired and gives poor technical
support.

Yet the company is strong and is worth US$3.5 billion today.

Can it survive for the next 20 years? Wang admitted four main
challenges lay ahead of CA.

That is to find ways to build applications of the future; to manage
and deploy these applications across the enterprise; to perform
real, profitable business on the Internet and the World Wide Web;
and to heal the critical 'disconnect' between people and computers.

Product directions have been clear too: multimedia, object
modelling and OO technology are declared the way to go.

Can we really blame CA for trying to lure new customers and
maintain its customer base?

The success of a company depends on the whims of its customers who
may abandon it any time.

CA's bottom line is: deliver on your promise and technology. A
little bit of pampering does no harm either. It is an added value.

ATM WAN SWITCH SALES TOPPER

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Newbridge Networks has topped the industry in ATM WAN switch sales
worldwide, according to IDC, Dataquest, Vertical Systems Group and
In-Stat.

IDC, in its 1995-2000 analysis of the frame relay and ATM equipment
markets, estimated that Newbridge had 40.5 per cent of the
worldwide revenue for ATM WAN switches.

According to IDC, the market for ATM WAN switches will jump from
US$247 million last year to US$543 million this year. Estimates
from the analysts for the worldwide ATM market by the year 2000
range from US$2 to US$3 billion.

NEWBRIDGE EQUIPS AUSSIE NETWORK

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Newbridge Networks has been chosen to supply equipment to Optus
Communications for Australia's first commercial ATM network,
OptusNet.

OptusNet, which has a maximum budget of US$30 million, will offer
high bandwidth applications such as high-speed LAN connections,
broadcast video, video-conferencing, high-speed Internet access and
intranet transport.

Under the terms of the five-year agreement, Newbridge will build on
Optus' existing nationwide synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)
infrastructure with a number of offerings.

The company will provide 36170 MainStreet ATMnet backbone switches,
which support both frame relay and ATM, in Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide, Canberra, Brisbane and Perth.

Multimedia and LAN interconnection services will be provided by the
36150 MainStreet ATMnet access switch, while the 36120 MainStreet
frame relay switch will handle lower-speed frame relay services.

Phil Jacobs, COO of Optus Communications, said that Optus is
confident that the Newbridge equipment will meet Optus' current
network needs, while providing a flexible platform for future
services and products.

PICTURETEL MAPS MAJOR GROWTH PLANS IN ASIA

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Yap Cheng Theng and Raymond Tan

PICTURETEL, which  consolidated its lead in the global
videoconferencing market this year, will go through an aggressive
growth phase in Asia, with plans to open up offices in Shanghai and
Kuala Lumpur within the next four months.

By the end of 1997, the company will add offices in Bangkok,
Jakarta and Guangzhou, said Peter Woo, regional director, Asia-
Pacific, PictureTel.

A customer service support centre in Singapore, to be operational
next month, is also in the pipeline to provide better support
partners and resellers, said Woo.

The Asia-Pacific currently contributes only 10 per cent of the
company's corporate revenues of US$346 million. Woo intends to
increase it to 15 per cent by the next calendar year.

Overall, PictureTel grew at a compounded rate of 50 per cent over
the last few years.

Steve Johnson, marketing director of PictureTel's group systems,
said the company has to date installed more than 26,000 group
videoconferencing systems.

"We had a good year in 1995, having added 4,500 group systems to
our installed base.

"More than 100 customers already own over 30 of our group systems.

"This makes us the market leader, and we now hold 51 per cent of
the global videoconferencing market," Johnson said.

He added that videoconferencing is becoming a mainstream
application among corporate businesses, with 21 of the top 25
companies in the US and 54 per cent of Fortune 500 companies being
users of PictureTel systems.

Asked about the company's desktop system installed base, Johnson
said both PictureTel and Intel command 85 per cent of the desktop
videoconferencing market.

"The market share split between us and Intel is about 50-50," he
said.

In an earlier interview with ACW, Norman Gaut, chairman and CEO of
PictureTel, said the desktop market is growing 100 per cent in both
unit and revenue terms.

He said the company will likely ship 50,000 desktop video
conferencing systems in fiscal year 1996, twice the amount
PictureTel shipped last year.

IBM BREAKING INTO ASIA'S EMERGING SOFTWARE INDUSTRY

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

IBM is investing for the future in the region with long-term
projects in China, India, and Vietnam.

"The Asia-Pacific software division is leading worldwide in IBM,"
said Mike Colleary, IBM's director, Emerging Markets, Asia
Pacific/Middle East with responsibilities for the software market.

He added that IBM would be building alliances and boosting skill
sets in expectation of future business opportunities in key
marketplaces.

According to Colleary, IBM is committed to grow the China and India
software industries.

"We are working with software developers to create applications,
and with governments, ministries and major enterprises to create
office automation breakthroughs," he said.

Colleary noted that China and India shared many similarities.

"Both of them are rapidly growing environments, with good potential
for software growth; they have native language requirements, and a
huge skill base for software products," he said.

"The difference is that projects in China are megaprojects, which
need a lot of sophistication, especially support from mainframes to
desktops. In India, projects are typical of corporate
organisations.

"Both are building software export as an industry. Developers want
to create programs and get returns on them instead of working for
offshore vendors."

Colleary added that IBM has an interest in the fledgling Vietnam
market as well.

"Vietnam is just starting," he said. "They don't have the growth of
India and China, and most of the business is done through
international companies.

"There is a need to build an infrastructure around automation and
computerisation. They need to drop barriers to market entry, and
get computer technology and application software to the masses."

IBM has gained momentum in establishing University Technology
Centres in China and India, which offer certification courses on
IBM software.

Colleary disclosed that IBM has invested over US$25 million in
China's education market alone.

REGION DIVIDED INTO 3 OPERATIONAL AREAS

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

NCR last month regrouped the 11 countries in its Asian region into
three geographical areas, namely Greater China, Southeast Asia and
Korea.

NCR Greater China, headed by MD Peter Zee and headquartered in
Beijing, covers Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, while DW Choi will be
responsible for NCR Korea as VP, NCR Korea area.

Former NCR Asia MD, Victor Ang, has been promoted to VP, NCR
Southeast Asia area, and will oversee NCR Southeast Asia from
Singapore. The Southeast Asia region for NCR stretches from India
and Sri Lanka in the west to the Asean region in the south.

The company had its first profitable quarter since 1994 with second
quarter profits of US$11 million, with the Asian operations more
profitable than the corporate average, said Greater China MD, Zee.

NCR has targeted to become profitable in 1997, and should break
even by the end of this year. Zee explained that the company had
tried to take on too much before.

NCR SAYS RE-ALIGNMENT PROVIDES MORE FOCUS

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Joy Tang

The recent re-alignment in NCR Corporation's Asian operations will
enable greater focus and growth for the company, said Peter Zee,
MD, NCR Greater China area, and president of NCR China.

According to Zee, the differences in the 11 countries covered by
NCR within its former Asia-China area in the past made it difficult
to cover the region properly.

"We grew so fast in the Asia-China area that we could not give
enough attention to each country," said Zee.

"Moreover, the geographies had different cultures and were at
different stages of development."

With NCR Asia now split into NCR Greater China, NCR Southeast Asia
and NCR Korea, the synergy within each sub-region has increased,
said Zee.

The heads of each sub-region are able to influence corporate
policy, in contrast to one voice before.

"There is a lot of business synergy," Zee said. "We understand the
customer requirements better. Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan are all
Chinese speaking countries, and the economies are very close."

He added that NCR Greater China will continue to focus on its core
competencies. "We are definitely in the computer business,
especially for high availability, transaction processing, and
datawarehousing technologies," said Zee.

"We are also a leading IT solutions provider in the financial,
retail and computer industries."

Zee said that NCR had invested heavily in the financial industry in
Greater China in the past and is now expanding into mid-range and
high-end computing. The current focus is to support Unix and
Windows NT.

As such, Zee said that the corporate structure within NCR Greater
China would be leveraged to help customers understand and manage
their businesses better.

Another challenge for Zee is the rapid growth of China, where NCR
Greater China is based.

"We do not have enough resources to keep up with the growth," he
said. "China is too big for us to set up branches in every
location."

NCR's solution is to work with channel partners, but a delicate
balance has to be achieved.

"We need enough partners to help us to grow, but not too many as to
create a price war," Zee said.

"We are looking for value-added channels, who can provide
solutions, rather than just box-movers."

CHECK POINT SETS UP BASE IN SINGAPORE

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

Check Point Software Technologies has formally set foot in Asia
with the opening of a Singapore office.

The company has close to 10,000 installations worldwide, 15 per
cent of which are in the Asia-Pacific, including Japan.

The office, headed by regional manager Anthony Lim, will develop
and support Check Point's OEM and channel partners in Asia,
excluding Japan.

"Singapore was chosen as it is an easy place to do business in,"
said Marius Nacht, VP, Check Point Software."Everything is well
organised. The need for the product is there, and the
infrastructure is there. It was also easy to find good technical
resources."

"Singapore is a geographical and logistical hub," added Lim. "Many
companies and partners already have big offices there."

Nacht said he may add more offices in Asia, with Hong Kong as a
possible site.

The company has a distribution presence in Japan, Australia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and India.

ASIAN FIRMS UNWILLING TO PAY FOR FIREWALL SECURITY

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Joy Tang

It is a paradox: firewalls are known to be an essential hedge
against Internet hacking, yet many companies are not willing to
purchase them in Asia.

"Users expect firewalls to be cheap or free in this part of the
world, " said Anthony Lim, Singapore-based regional manager, Check
Point Software Technologies.

Marius Nacht, US-based VP, Check Point Software Technologies,
explained that firewalls were designed to allow firms to connect to
the Internet or each other without exposing themselves.

"The router is the most basic security device, but it is not
sufficient," he said. "For a minimum level of security, users need
a gateway computer running Unix or NT, with firewall software
installed."

Nacht said users should ensure that their firewalls include access
control, user authentication, encryption across networks, gateways
and PCs, reporting and auditing, as well as have anti-virus
capabilities.

Most of these features are already available in Check Point's
flagship Firewall-1 application.

Nacht added that virus detection capability and a high availability
version of Firewall-1 are targeted for delivery at year-end.

"We are also looking into developing active network management
functions," he said.

According to a February 1996 report by IDC, worldwide firewall
shipments are expected to hit 1.5 million units by the year 2000.

The research firm said that Check Point had a 40 per cent of the
global market share for commercial firewall software in 1995, with
its closest competitor holding only 9 per cent share worldwide.

"We are by far the leading firewall company,"said Nacht, dismissing
the threat of a shakeout in firewall companies.

"If anyone has to give up the business it sure won't be us."

In its three years of operations, Check Point has gained close to
10,000 customers, including names such as DHL and Ericsson,
worldwide.

In the second quarter ended July 31, Check Point Software
Technologies earned US$7.3 million in revenues, a 373 per cent
increase over the US$1.5 million sales for the same period in 1995.
Net income rose 284.7 per cent to US$3.2 million.

SYMANTEC ANNOUNCES SECOND INTERNET TOOL

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

SYMANTEC has launched another Internet-specific product, Internet
FastFind following the announcement of Cafe, a Java-based
development tool.

According to Daniel Schneersohn, regional director, Symantec,
Internet FastFind is a set of tools allowing users to search
information on the Internet easily.

"Some of the frustrations of surfing the Internet are that it's too
slow, it takes too long to find what you're asking for or not
finding it at all," he said.

With Internet FastFind, Symantec claimed users need no longer put
up with these frustrations.

Internet FastFind combines simultaneous multi-engine search,
notification of changes to selected Web sites, FTP and network
sites, extensive Internet file searching as well as zipping and
unzipping capabilities.

Compatible with both English and Chinese Windows 95, it lets users
simultaneously search several search engines such as AltaVista,
Yahoo and Infoseek, check for duplicates, prioritise and present
the information in one Web page. It is available for Win 95 and
NT4.0, but a Mac version is being evaluated.

NEC WINS S'PORE PROJECTOR DEAL

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

NEC Singapore has won a tender by the National Computer Board (NCB)
to supply all primary schools in Singapore with its MultiSync MT600
LCD projectors.

The tender is part of NCB's AITP (Accelerating the Use of IT in
Primary Schools) programme.

NEC's tender, worth S$3 million (US$2.1 million), includes the
installation and maintenance of 400 MT600 projectors which carry a
street price of around S$9,999 (US$7,089) per unit.

"The Singapore government have realised the importance of equipping
students with a firm grounding in computer-literacy," said Noel
Hon, MD, NEC Singapore.

"NEC has always been a strong advocate of the use of IT in
education. This tender helps us to promote our goal."

The tender win also boosted NEC's average sales of the MT600, a
product it first launched in May in Singapore this year, to 100
units per month.

This figure, said Hon, accounts for 30 per cent of the total
projector market in Singapore.

NEC Singapore's other projects in the education field include
Super-Yuki Pro, a multimedia learning software program, for the
Student-Teacher Workbench and a soon to be announced project with
the National Institute of Education.

FORRESTER REPORT GIVES NETWARE THUMBS DOWN

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

A recent report from Forrester Research, Novell at the Crossroads,
has concluded that large corporations no longer consider Novell a
strategic vendor and believe NetWare is a legacy operating
environment.

Interviews with 50 senior IT executives revealed that while 90 per
cent of large companies use NetWare today, only about half of them
or 48 per cent, said they would still use it in three years.

It was also found that 72 per cent of those polled said Novell will
not play a part in their Internet/ intranet plans.

"Users are very dissatisfied with Novell," said Jon Oltsik, analyst
with Forrester's Computing Strategy Service.

"Large companies believe NetWare is a legacy technology. NT seems
like a better strategic solution - it can do file and print, run
applications, and includes native support of TCP/IP."

"So far, Novell's marketing message - that NetWare will seamlessly
transition into the Intranet - has fallen on deaf ears.

"IT managers are already building the Intranet with Netscape,
Microsoft or Lotus. Novell is not even on the radar screen," said
Oltsik.

While Novell prepares products to address user needs - like native
TCP/IP and cross-platform services - it will face 18 months of
decreased sales volumes.

Forrester estimated that Novell's revenue will decrease by 25 per
cent this fiscal year and continue to decline until 1998 when it
settles at around US$1 billion.

Oltsik added: "Before its next-generation products are ready,
Novell will have to lower prices and offer bundled solutions to
encourage its installed base to upgrade."

While Novell is in trouble, it is not out of the game. Oltsik has
two things in its favour: a strong balance sheet and a large
installed base.

But according to Forrester, intranet technologies will ultimately
replace NetWare, so Novell needs to quickly transition into a
provider of standards-based services that enable the intranet.

NetWare On Ice

The report recommended that large companies put their NetWare
environments on ice for the next two years and evaluate new
intranet technologies and vendors as they emerge.

"CIOs should not panic and rip out NetWare. The right thing to do
is spend tactically on file and print for the next two years and
begin to implement intranet protocols and products as they mature,"
said Oltsik

HOW THE ANALYSTS VIEW HP

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

"HP will be maintaining its stronghold No. 2 position but it is
being too ambitious about wanting to be No. 1 by next year.

"Compaq is the clear leader. I don't see HP displacing Compaq as
No. 1 over the next one or two years. It may be a little late. For
one, its networking products have never been price competitive.

"Acer will get stronger, and possibly at the expense of the others
but not HP or Compaq. IBM too will get stronger, although Digital
is still floundering.

Norman Miranda, managing analyst, Datapro Information Services

"The two markets that will determine Hewlett-Packard's chances at
being No. 1 are China and Australia where Compaq has been the
leader.

HP is already outselling Compaq in China. If HP becomes stronger in
Australia, then its goal may not be out of its reach.

"IBM continues to be strong; doing well in China and Australia.
Acer is also doing well in Hong Kong and Malaysia but it is still
not strong in the corporate side in some developed markets.

The strong players in the long run are Compaq, IBM and HP."

Janardan Menon, analyst, Dataquest Asia-Pacific

BIG SERVER PLAYERS BITE BIGGER CHUNKS

from ASIA COMPUTER WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996, Vol. 17, No. 36

by Isabelle Chan

The PC server hardware market is showing signs of an impending
shake out. The low-level players, now holding a smaller piece of
the pie, are buckling under pressure from the big boys like Compaq,
Hewlett-Packard, Acer and IBM.

Quoting the top five rankings by IDC in Q2'96 for the Asia-Pacific
server market, Steve Haslett, marketing manager of HP's Personal
Information Products Group, said Compaq continues to lead the pack
with a 22.7 per cent share, followed by Hewlett-Packard with 13.3
per cent.

Trailing behind are Acer and Digital with 10 and 7.8 per cent
respectively, followed by IBM with 6.6 per cent.

The "others" category accounted for a total of 26.8 per cent market
share. This percentage is a significant drop compared to the
consolidated market share of 42.8 per cent in Q1'96.

"The server business is booming, but market figures show the start
of a shake out with the bigger hardware vendors gaining more
dominance," he said. "Historically, the 'others' category accounted
for about 50 per cent of the total market.

"The figures increasingly show that customers are looking for
reliability and quality in the big brand names. Our market share
gain is probably gained at the expense of the other small players,"
he said.

Managing analyst Norman Miranda feels this is true particularly in
the high-end segment where service and support are important.

Although Miranda and Janardan Menon of Dataquest Asia-Pacific agree
on the general trend of a shake out, both believe there are markets
where the small vendors will continue to be a major force.

Meanwhile, No.2 player Hewlett-Packard is investing in two key
areas with the intention of overtaking Compaq as market leader.

The first is to marry its server and networking business, an
approach which Hewlett-Packard admits it should have adopted
earlier.

"We ran the networking and server businesses separately, and
therefore, failed to capitalise on our networking strengths. We
have since realised that, and are now working hand-in-hand to boost
our market offering," said Haslett.

"We're positioning our networking product portfolio as an
additional accessory to the servers."

According to Haslett, HP believes it will be able to emulate its
success in China where it has managed to capture the No.1 spot with
its NetServers, and displace reigning leader Compaq as the leading
player in the Asia-Pacific by next year.

"We're closing the gap between ourselves and Compaq. Our Asia-
Pacific business is growing at a run rate of about US$150 million
annually, and we expect this to double next year," said Haslett.

According to him, Asean is the fastest growing region for HP's
NetServers, led by Indonesia and Singapore with more than 100 per
cent growth.

The second leg of HP's strategy is to attack the low-end PC server
segment with the launch of the HP NetServer E30 optimised for
Windows NT and NetWare.

HP will be shipping early next month a low-end NetServer at PC
price points.

"We should have entered the market with such a product a year ago.
Now that we're launching the E30, we intend to dominate the low-end
area, and expect our units to grow substantially in the next two
quarters," said Haslett.

SONY TO DEMONSTRATE DOLBY AC-3 IN LAS VEGAS FOR FIRST TIME

     Growing Dolby AC-3 bandwagon will receive significant new
member at this week's Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show (CES)
when Sony for first time will demonstrate working prototype of
Dolby AC-3 processor.

     Sony plans demonstrations of working AC-3 mockup at Bally's
Hotel suite, while "cosmetic" nonworking prototype is likely to be
displayed at Las Vegas Convention Center room where company is
mounting its main exhibit, Hi-Fi Vp Vic Pacor said.  Bally's
demonstration will be of prototype processor using discrete digital
processing, meshed with existing high-end "M"-series speakers sold
under ES franchise, including new SS-M1CN center-channel speaker,
due for spring delivery at $500 list.  Pacor said Sony will bill
AC-3 showings as "technology demonstration only," indicating that
company "is not yet prepared" to discuss specific marketing plans. 
He said additional specifics on AC-3 launch could be available in
spring, when Sony has scheduled series of annual "zone" sales
meetings.

     Sony's first AC-3 product is likely to be outboard processor
rather than integrated receiver, Pacor said.  Product delivery is
expected to "coincide" with launch of its first DVD players, he
said.  Commitment to show AC-3 in Las Vegas was hastened by
agreement last month designating that as mandatory DVD audio system
in NTSC markets and as optional system in PAL and SECAM territories
(AW Dec 11 p1).  Sony's AC-3 support is "a follow-through on our
commitment to take a leadership position on DVD," Pacor said.  He
indicated that if AC-3 had been confined to audio system for
laserdisc, "we probably wouldn't have been interested."

     Statement of Sony support gives important boost to fortunes of
AC-3, although Dolby technology has been on significant momentum
roll since system was unveiled by Denon, Pioneer and others at Las
Vegas show 2 years ago.  Statement seemed to quash speculation that
Sony would develop home adaptation of Sony Dynamic Digital Sound
(SDDS) system now competing with AC-3 and Digital Theater Systems
(DTS) technologies in theatrical community.

     Notwithstanding Sony plans, AC-3 would have been significant
story anyway at Las Vegas show, where "AC-3-ready" will be
ubiquitous buzz term reminiscent of "digital-ready" marketing label
that greeted CD bandwagon launch decade ago.  Typifying others,
Definitive Technology plans demonstration of "AC-3-ready"
PowerField subwoofer, 125-w, 12" box available separately at $549
and marketed as part of BP 2002 home theater speaker system.  Also
following suit is Phase Technology, which plans 5-model
"AC-3-compatible speaker system" for home theater at $500.

     Wide range of AC-3 is promised throughout CES, including
Technics, which said it will join growing roster of companies
planning audiovideo receivers combining AC-3 with THX processing. 
However, specifics on Technics product weren't available by our
deadline.  Harman Kardon said it will "preview" AC-303 outboard
processor for AC-3, which is set for late-spring delivery at $799
list.  "The availability of program sources with full 5.1-channel
discrete audio is one of the most exciting developments in home
theater in recent years," Harman Kardon Pres. Chris Stevens said.

     As for DVD movement itself, number of player prototypes
promised by primary and secondary vendors could fill own
independent trade show.  With unified DVD specifications in place,
Las Vegas show marks unofficial start of competitive DVD derby,
even though first products won't reach store shelves for at least
9 months.

     Companies not showing DVD players at Las Vegas seem exception,
not rule.  Scarcer still are those not promising DVD leadership
positions or not pledging to be involved in first round of product
deliveries.  While much of DVD news will be generated on main show
floor, highlight will be series of consecutively timed DVD news
conferences planned for eve of show Jan. 4 (Thurs.) by Pioneer,
Sony, Thomson, Toshiba.  At our deadline, Pioneer and Sony were
close-mouthed as to what they planned for announcements later this
week.  However, Thomson and Toshiba have taken more aggressive
postures, promising to lay out DVD product and promotional
specifics.

     Thomson news conference invitations promised DVD marketing
announcements under RCA, GE and ProScan labels, as well as
unspecified software component.  Retailers that met with Thomson
officials last month said company has drafted definite plans on how
it wants to bring DVD to market, based on philosophy that first
hardware dealers will be encouraged to carry software titles. 
Retailers told us Thomson seemed poised to announce specific ways
of helping retailers market DVD software, but Dec. meetings
produced few specifics.  Other expected highlight of Thomson
announcements will come when it identifies "major Japanese partner"
with which it says it has struck multiproduct OEM agreement on
which company is basing pledge to market first-generation DVD
player at $499 (AW Dec 18 p4).

     Sanyo said it developed laser pickup capable of reading DVDs

     Sanyo said it developed laser pickup capable of reading DVDs
and conventional CDs.  Dual-use red laser pickup, which will have
output power of 5 mw, will be built using DVD wavelength of 635
nanometers, one of 2 wavelengths specified in unified DVD format
announced Dec. 8.  Unlike existing dual-focus pickups requiring use
of 2 lenses, Sanyo device uses LCD shutter system to change
characteristic of laser needed for specific types of disc.  Sanyo
said LCD method makes possible smaller and more reliable pickup. 
Sample shipments of new pickup will start in March, Sanyo said.

FIRST EOSONE SPEAKERS DUE AT BEST BUY IN APRIL

     Full line of Eosone speakers is expected to reach Best Buy
store shelves on time in early April, said Arnie Nudell, pres.,
Genesis Technologies, Vail, Colo., which is working with Polk Audio
on project (AW June 12 p1).

     Eosone products will be exclusive to Best Buy in U.S., but
also will be marketed outside country through international
distributors.  Nudell said Eosone goods will be produced at Polk
factories in Baltimore and San Diego.   Genesis and Polk executives
originally had planned to discuss specifics of Eosone project at
this week's Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show as means of
generating publicity for line and attracting international
distribution.  But Nudell and new Polk Pres. James Herd said plan
was scrapped in favor of lower profile rollout.

     With few exceptions, Eosone line will include dipolar speakers
and will be marketed as ideal for home theater and music
applications, Nudell said.  Line includes 3 tower speakers that use
so-called "radiant surround field" technology.  Flagship model will
be called RSF-1000, $2,200 per pair, featuring own built-in 175-w
powered subwoofer.  Lower priced RSF-600 and RSF-400 towers won't
be self-powered, Nudell said.  Two separate powered subwoofers are
planned for Eosone line, 12" model with built-in 150-w amplifier,
10" variation with 100-w.  There's also molded satellite speaker
system called "the Egg" and RSC-300 center-channel speaker.

     Dedicated rear-surround speakers are among few Eosone models
not to have dipolar design, partly because they're intended to mesh
with new Dolby AC-3 system, Nudell said.  He said all Eosone
drivers will have been "designed from scratch," not pulled from
shelf.  Line is aimed for maximum mix-and-match flexibility for
Best Buy customers interested in assembling high-end home theater
speaker package, Nudell said.

     Announcements last spring publicizing Eosone collaboration
between Polk and Genesis said Eosone line would be aimed at "an
upscale buyer" with "design attributes spun off from the Genesis
line of high-end loudspeakers."  Herd has said agreement to form
Eosone venture followed 2 years of talks between Polk and Best Buy
that started when companies agreed to explore ways of better
merchandising specialty audio speakers in Best Buy's
self-service-oriented "concept" stores.

     Polk executives have emphasized that its label won't appear on
Eosone products or marketing materials because of fear that that
would cause "an unnecessary distraction" from telling "very
powerful" Eosone brand story.  Fear of offending Polk specialty
accounts presumably also played key role in decision to divorce
Polk brand name from Eosone-labeled products.

     Meanwhile, "Eosone International" was one of 4 "strategic
business units" (SBUs) created by Polk in "major organizational
realignment" announced last month.  Other SBUs are for Polk Home
Entertainment Products, Automotive Products, Manufacturing. 
Automotive and home SBUs will be managed as "free-standing profit
centers," Polk said.  It said goals of restructuring are to
simplify organization to "clarify lines of authority and
accountability" and move "operational" decision-making further down
in organization.

EIA HAILS RECORD OCT. AUDIO SALES

     Double-digit increases in portable audio and components
overcame modest declines in systems and aftermarket autosound to
push factory audio sales to 13.9% increase, setting all-time record
for any previous month, EIA Market Research Dept. said.

     Overall Oct. shipments climbed nearly 14% to $1.066 billion
from year-earlier $935.73 million.  Record was set despite 2%
decline in systems to $216.42 million and 0.8% dip in aftermarket
car audio to $165.07 million.  Home theater boom continued to spark
once-beleagured components category, pushing shipments to 33.4%
gain to $258.18 million.  Portable audio shipments were up 20% in
Oct., posting monthly record sales total of $426.03 million
compared with year-earlier $354.91 million.

     For 10 months, total shipments topped $7-billion, rising 5.9%
to $7.03 billion.  Components led all categories with 13.8% sales
increase to $1.58 billion.  Other segments posted modest increases,
portable audio climbing 5.4% to $2.37 billion, aftermarket car
audio up 3.1% to $1.68 billion, systems rising 1.9% to $1.4
billion.

     Home theater boom prompted surge in audio components sales
that followed many months of consecutive declines.  EIA's Consumer
Electronics Mfrs. Assn. (CEMA) credited recovery to "white-hot
sales" of speakers and audiovideo receivers.  For Oct., receivers
rose 41% to $66.4 million, and surpassed $400 million for
Jan.-Oct., CEMA said.  Turntables also were pleasant Oct. surprise,
rising 27%, said CEMA, which didn't reveal actual sales estimate. 
Overall home speaker sales doubled in Oct. to $84.3 million,
spurred partly by fivefold rise in sales of surround sound speaker
packages for home theater, CEMA said.

     Trade group said 20% Oct. sales rise in portable audio to
record $426 million was category's best posting since April 1992,
when shipments rose 20.2% from year earlier to $156.74 million (AW
June 15/92 p5).  CEMA reported 6% rise in sales of boombox stereos
without CD to $28 million, while CD boomboxes posted "healthy" 17%
increase.

     Unspecified decline in rack system sales hurt overall systems
category in Oct., CEMA said, emphasizing that sales were up 2% for
10 months.  Pattern for most of 1995 repeated itself in Oct., with
strong sales of compact systems supporting category.  Aftermarket
car audio sales "held relatively steady" in Oct., CEMA said,
without mentioning 0.8% decline in month.  Shortfall came despite
11% rise in sales of car speakers, CEMA said.

     CEMA quoted Yamaha Mktg. Dir. Thomas Graham as saying that 33%
rise in Oct. components sales "gives further affirmation to the
escalating home theater ownership trend."  He said:  "Consumers are
learning that home theater is more than just video and requires
high-performance audiovideo receivers and components coupled with
quality speakers to truly recreate the movie theater experience."

     Here's EIA breakdown of factory audio sales for Oct. and
year's first 10 months:

DSS PRICES DECLINING AS COMPETITION HEATS UP

     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to drop
and competition increases, entry-level product appears poised to
dip below $300.

     Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) low-end RCA DSS system that
started 1995 at $699 was being advertised by year-end at $499 and
retailers said profit was in danger of drying up.  To combat
falling prices, some retailers are focusing on stepup RCA and Sony
DSS products that promise 20-25% profit margins, but slower sales. 
Overall, 1995 sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expected
to surpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close to
million subscribers.

     "You've got some very big players coming into the business
[next year] and many aren't going to be able to take the high
road," Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you
are 6 to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  Lower retail
tickets are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba and Uniden
enter DSS race this year, with Uniden already indicating it may
price product in $499-$549 range.  In addition to DSS, Alphastar
and EchoStar plan to introduce own services -- latter partnering
with Philips to bring Magnavox product to CE retail.  Even
Primestar, which primarily has leased equipment to consumers, has
tested sales through multicable operator TCI.

     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2
powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCA
and GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has been
advertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony model, which
originally had $749 suggested price tag, was featured in Wiz ad at
$648.

     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers who
have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones where
hardware is offered to consumers virtually free and profits are
made on service.  EchoStar spokeswoman conceded as much, noting
that as hardware becomes low-margin product, programming could be
used to offset lost profits.  EchoStar hasn't formally released
pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware retails could
hit $500 with programming at $20.

     Alphastar has said it will avoid selling own brand at CE
retail, relying instead on combination of Amway, satellite
distributors and multilevel marketing.  Company signed agreement
with Samsung Electromechanics in Aug. to build integrated receiver
decoders (IRDs) and said it's seeking similar agreement with 2nd
supplier.  Both Samsung and 2nd supplier are expected to sell
branded product to CE dealers.  "I would think that for this
product the equipment would pass the cost curve much more rapidly
than the marketing cost of attracting a subscriber," said Alphastar
Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein, whose company plans to launch
120-channel service in first quarter with hardware packages at
$600-$700.  "When that happens it makes sense to give the box away
because the long-term value is in the subscription and the ongoing
revenue that comes from that subscription."

     But with so many satellite systems to choose from, future of
category hinges on manufacturers' ability to differentiate
products.  Many retailers already have said they won't give
category same amount of shelf space dedicated to other products
such as VCRs, meaning that suppliers will be battling for every
square inch.

     "The big question will be whether manufacturers can create
clear differences for consumers so they can make choices," Tops
Appliance City Senior Vp-Gen. Mdse. Mgr. Rick Jones said.  "When
you can't [tell differences] you end up dealing with a price issue
and end up with $499 satellite systems."

     DMX Inc. said it will mount its first official display at Las
Vegas Consumer Electronics Show to trumpet DMX Direct, 120-channel,
CD-quality direct-to-home digital music service delivered via

     Top post at McIntosh Lab "is not just a job, it's a dream,"

     Top post at McIntosh Lab "is not just a job, it's a dream,"
company's newly appointed Pres. Thomas Shaeffer told us in
responding to our questions on why he gave up what he described as
successful industrial design and consulting business to become
successor to Ron Fone, now ADS pres. (AW Dec 18 p6).  Shaeffer said
he believes his "balance" of global engineering, marketing and
production skills made him top choice with Clarion management over
host of other candidates who reportedly vied for job.  He
sidestepped virtually all our questions on what factors spurred
Clarion managers to decide not to renew Fone's contract, but
praised Fone for making "a great contribution" to McIntosh during
his 4 years as pres., hailing him for "revitalizing" brand and
expanding breadth of McIntosh products into home theater arena.  As
for complaints from McIntosh dealers about product shortages --
some so severe that some merchants have dropped line -- Shaeffer
said "the reasons why we got here are less important" than strategy
for fixing problem.  But he declined specific comment on latter,
citing desire to discuss gripes with specific accounts at upcoming
Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show.  He did say keys to remedying
shortage problem include "strengthening our efficiency" in product
management and "increasing our national purchasing power."  He
promised no-nonsense approach in trying to win back disgruntled
dealers and said his personal "style" will be to "promise less and
deliver more."  He asked that critics judge his performance "by my
results and not my words."  Shaeffer ruled out expanding
distribution of McIntosh brand beyond its traditional
carriage-trade status.  Loyal dealers are like "an extended
family," he said.

     Sun TV & Appliances income declined in 3rd quarter ended Nov.
25 to $1.37 million (8 cents per share) from year-earlier $4.21
million (24 cents) on 1.8% sales increase to $202.63 million.  For
9 months, income fell to $3.83 million (22 cents) from $11.08
million (63 cents) on 11.6% sales gain to $550.35 million. 
Same-store sales fell 12% for quarter, 0.7% for 9 months. 
Chmn.-CEO Robert Oyster said company was "disappointed" with drops
in same-store sales, which he blamed on "continued competitive
pressures" and "a sluggish retailing environment."  While company
was "not surprised with lower comparable-store sales given the
competitive environment in which we are presently operating, we had
hoped to see growth during the beginning of the holiday selling
season," Oyster said.  "Another phenomenon which causes pressure on
comparable-store sales occurs when we increase the number of
locations in a particular market," he said.  "While it is difficult
to quantify the amount of sales drawn from existing locations to
the new location, we do know that comparable-store sales will be
affected when we open a new store in an existing market area."

     Onkyo's Japanese parent said it expects to post ordinary
profit of Yen 900 million for fiscal year ending in March.  Company
originally had projected 45% profit rise to Yen one billion on 7%
sales increase to Yen 42 billion.  However, slower-than-expected
sales in Europe in 2nd half of year caused company to revise profit
projection downward.  Despite revision, profit projection would be
sufficient to negate cumulative multiyear Onkyo loss, which at its
worst was Yen 4 billion.

     International Federation of Phonographic Industry (IFPI),

     International Federation of Phonographic Industry (IFPI),
London-based music industry trade group, said it had to shut down
Guangdong, China, office because of threats arising from its
efforts to thwart CD piracy.  There are 297 CD and CD-ROM plants in
world, of which 30 are in China, and pirated copies represent 59%
of China's CD market, IFPI has said.  "We've heard through somebody
that contract killers have been employed," IFPI Communications Dir.
Catrin Hughes said.  Leads were "pretty solid," Hughes said.  "It's
not the sort of thing you take a chance on."  IFPI offices in
Beijing and Shanghai remain open, and Guangdong office will go back
on line as soon as threat is resolved, she said.  In recent years,
threats forced temporary closures in Taiwan and Thailand.  "We
reopened in Taiwan, and now we've cleaned up the market," Hughes
said.  IFPI Dir. Gen. Nic Garnett said his group had heard "from
reliable sources" that hit men had been contracted for by Chinese
CD factories targeted for piracy investigations.  He said "we are
looking to the Chinese authorities to provide us with the necessary
security to carry on our operations."  China's 30 CD factories
produce 75 million discs annually.  IFPI said it believes as many
as 45 million of those are pirated copies that sell on Chinese
streets for few dollars.  In Oct., after 2 years of negotiations
with IFPI and under pressure from Clinton Administration, Chinese
govt. agreed to adopt worldwide antipiracy "source identification"
(SID) codes administered by IFPI in London.  Under agreement, all
of China's CD factories are obligated to etch ID numbers on all
molds used to press CDs.  Since Nov., any CD offered for sale in
China without SID can be confiscated by authorities.  Referring to
reported threats of contract killers, Garnett said "we have clearly
reached a critical point if the pirates have to resort to these
measures."

     Lucasfilm THX Div. said it has worked with "several" THX
licensees to develop center-channel speakers for home theater
"whose horizontal design simplifies placement and maximizes
performance."  New speaker designs "combine the low, horizontal
shape popular with home theater consumers with a new driver layout
that provides the focused vertical directivity required in a
THX-certified speaker," licensor said.  Special vertical
"midrange-tweeter-midrange" array, flanked by pair of woofers,
"focuses the sound toward the viewer while providing a wide and
even horizontal dispersion of sound," it said.  Home THX Dir.
Anthony Grimani said development "is an important step for home
theater.  Consumers are going to enjoy better-sounding systems
because they can place their speakers correctly where before there
was always a compromise.  They're getting a speaker that meets all
of the THX requirements and their needs as well.  First to market
new speakers are Atlantic Technology, McIntosh, Snell.

NOW YOU SEE IT IN THE WINDOW, NOW YOU DON'T
By Franklynn Peterson & Judi K-Turkel
===========================================================

     Ever since the Macintosh and its pet mouse captured the
public imagination, engineers for IBM compatible makers have
been trying to duplicate its appeal.  Few engineers figured
out why so many people found the Mac appealing, so they
focussed on what looked obvious: the mouse.
     After the moving mouse moves the screen's cursor to the
exact spot a user has chosen, perhaps to a box designed to
signal "start," the user hits a button built into the
mouse's head.  And that starts the program.  But nearly
every program also builds in a way to issue commands without
a mouse.  So the mouse is not an absolute requirement.
     When IBM compatible computer engineers failed to
duplicate the appeal of the mighty Mac, they turned to
software engineers.  At least  they  discovered the major
aspect of the Mac's appeal: its every-program-works-the-
same-way-and-looks-the-same user interface.  Apple's mouse
has little to do with this similar look and feel.
     The real equivalence comes from the way Apple
accommodated software programmers who were interested in
writing for the Mac.   They gave all the programmers small
shortcut programs (called  tools  in computer jargon)
enabling them to finish their programs quicker.
     Prominent among tools was the pull-down menu, dialogue-
box facility that's at the heart of all Macintosh programs.
Behind the scenes, programmers don't have to reinvent ways
for each of their programs to send output to hundreds of
various printers, because the Macintosh computer itself
handles that onerous chore.
     The Mac machine came first.  And along with its closed
architecture came detailed requirements for programs,
graphics, looks, commands, files.  Mac programs were written
to match the Mac standard which has hardly changed since the
first Mac.
     The IBM PC came with open architecture, and without
standardized requirements.  Now that the IBM compatible
peddlers would like to develop a Mac-like interface, every
major program has to go through major, expensive rewrites.
     Microsoft itself had some problems using Windows.
After years of effort, it just finished writing the Windows
version of its cornerstone word processing program,  Word.
     Mac has one other major plus going for it.  Users seem
able to perform many tasks on-screen at one time.  In truth,
only one program is ever at work, but your other programs
and their files stand ready to be used.  Unlike IBM users,
Mac owners moving around among programs don't need to save a
file and quit a program, then load the other program and
file.
     At least five years ago, we tested Quarterdeck's  DESQ,
subtitled  The Multi-Window Software Integrator.   It let
uses move among windows from phone list to database to
spreadsheet to whatever.
     While its developers couldn't make computer users sit
up and take notice, they did patent key aspects of
windowing.  That may eventually be their ticket to fortune.
     This year, four other major companies are trying to
sell Mac-type pseudo-multitasking on IBM compatibles.
Microsoft (and IBM's) Windows is one.  They're still trying
to breathe life into the Presentation Manager pseudo-
multitasker that operates on Windows which was announced
fully four years ago!
     Tandy has its own pseudo-multitasking shell for its IBM
compatibles, DeskMate User Interface.  It features the Mac-
like pull-down menus and pop-up dialogue boxes.  Mostly,
Tandy's sold it to use with Tandy computers and few non-
Tandy programs run under it.
     Wang's expensive Freestyle software does very smooth
pseudo-multitasking.  You can use it with some existing
hardware and existing software, or buy it complete with Wang
hardware.  Technologically, Freestyle most lives up to the
multitasking promise.
     Wang also offers an add-on system called ClearView.
When you add ClearView to Windows, it forces your computer
to look and act like the traditional Macintosh interface.
     Hewlett-Packard is banking on New Wave, its version of
the "iconic environment" that works with Windows on IBM type
computers.  To run on their interfacer, they're putting on
sale a database, network and e-mail manager, and peripherals
router they're calling New Wave Office.
     A few years ago, it seemed obvious that the Microsoft-
IBM combo would be hands-down winner among IBM Mac mimics.
But IBM and Microsoft seem intent on smashing Windows.
     All the smart software makers were betting on Windows
and modifying programs to run on it.  All the smart software
buyers were also betting on Windows and hedging budgets
until it developed.  Both of these foresighted groups are
still waiting to see something in the Windows.
     It does look like IBM and Microsoft will finally emerge
as the bruised winner.  But while IBM and Microsoft have
dirtied their windows in public, smart buyers have stood
around waiting until the product is absolutely positively
finished before investing heavily in new PCs.
     With so many big names pushing windows and
multitasking, we're betting that the early 1990s will see
consumer shift to IBM style windows.  But windowing
technology can't be used effectively on most IBM compatible
PCs sold before 1990.
     Chips in those computers can't manage more than a
million bytes (1M) of RAM memory.  1M is enough RAM to hold
the chapters of two typed books.  But it's not enough to
hold several sets of program instructions plus the files
currently using each of those programs.  That's why today's
Mac IIs come equipped with 5M of RAM.
     Many pioneers are using clever makeshift chips combined
with software to get around this problem.  Sold by acronyms
such as LIMS, EMM, EMS, EEM, they all try to make do with
puny RAM.  They work-or don't work-depending often on
nothing more predictable than luck.
     Computers with the relatively new 386 chip can finally
manage enough RAM memory to juggle multiple files and
programs.  But programmers are still rewriting most programs
to take advantage of this skill.
     If you're tired of waiting, you'll probably have to
upgrade the RAM memory in your older IBM compatible PC.  And
you may have to upgrade your computer's display circuit and
display monitor.  Watch for a forthcoming column on that
topic.

RSI - CURSE OF THE KEYBOARD USER?

Conflicting judgements on repetitive strain injury (RSI) have left
employers confused. Only months after Judge John Prosser rejected a
damages claim from a Reuters journalist describing RSI as
"meaningless", the highest RSI settlement to date (#79,000) was made to
a former Inland Revenue typist. Below we look at what RSI means and how
to minimise the risk of an outbreak.

RSI affects the hands and arms and can cause extreme pain and
disablement. It is increasingly associated with keyboard use. But the
term is misleading, according to Khaled Choudhury, a consultant
ergonomist at London-based System Concepts, because there is no
specific medical condition called repetitive strain injury at this
point in time.

He says: "RSI is an umbrella term, which is used to describe a range of
medical conditions affecting the upper limbs. Such conditions include
tenosynovitis (inflammation of the tendon sheaths in fingers), carpal
tunnel syndrome (inflammation/irritation of the median nerve in the
wrist), tendinitis (in the hand and forearm), and various other
shoulder and forearm problems."

Risk factors
There is no foolproof way of preventing RSI but the risks can
definitely be minimised. A number of factors are common to most
outbreaks:

* A physical/ergonomic deficiency in the workstation, or in the way the
person works at it. For example, poor posture or a keyboard position
which encourages excessive movement of the wrists.

* Added pyscho-social stress, such as a problem with the work itself,
or between a group of workers and their boss. Other possible pyscho-
social risks factors include software which is difficult to use, or the
threat of redundancy.

* The pressure on the individual to carry out the work (both at the
computer and away from it) whether imposed by the employer or by the
individual themselves. This means that RSI can affect even people who
do not spend many hours typing continuously at a computer.

* Adverse environmental conditions, such as poor lighting. People may
be adjusting their sitting position in order to avoid screen
reflections, or get enough light and this may lead to bad posture.

Minimising the risks
Such ergonomic and job-design issues are not normally top of the
company agenda, but if heeded they can help to reduce the risks of an
outbreak.
It is, for example, possible to buy ergonomically designed keyboards.
These look quite different from the standard QWERTY keyboard and put
more emphasis on the user's comfort.
The new keyboards attempt to minimise wrist movement when typing,
reducing stress on the neck and shoulder muscles. Suppliers include
Apple Computer, which also sells an ergonomically designed mouse, and
Kinesis of Bellevue, Washington.

Choudhury says the QWERTY keyboard encourages poor wrist posture, but
the cost of replacing standard keyboards with ergonomic ones (except in
special cases) will prove unrealistically high for most organisations.
Apple's costs around #199 ($300 ).

But there is much more to RSI than the keyboard used. Jeffrey Boyling,
a consultant ergonomist and chartered physiotherapist who advises the
Financial Times, says RSI cannot be blamed on a particular design of
keyboard. "I have seen cases of RSI involving all manner of keyboards,"
he says. Usually two or more of the risk factors mentioned earlier
contribute to a case of RSI.

Perhaps more important than worrying about keyboards is to get risk
assessments carried out on staff who use computers, looking at both the
equipment used and the way each user works at it.

Such assessments are now a legal requirement, following the
introduction of new Health & Safety regulations on display screen work
in January 1993.

New regulations
Andrea Caws, a consultant ergonomist at System Concepts, says under the
new regulations employers must:
* Assess their workstations and the health and safety risks of workers
using them. They must then take steps to reduce those risks.
* Adhere to at least the minimum ergonomic standards for screens (eg
screens should be flicker free), keyboards, mice, desk, chairs and the
physical environment, such as lighting.

* Plan display screen work to introduce variety and breaks.

* Pay for eye tests related to display screen work. If glasses are
needed specifically for VDU work, the employer must pay.
* Provide information and training on how to work safely at a computer.

Once employers start to carry out risk assessments, they often find
that there are already RSI problems among staff. One foreign-owned City
merchant bank found RSI among some of its secretaries. And a big-six
accountancy firm has RSI problems among some of its accountants, but
considers its professional staff too valuable to spend their time
completing self-assessment forms to show whether their working
environment complies with HSE guidelines.

At the opposite extreme some companies are prepared to pay heavily to
make sure that they comply.
One Japanese merchant bank based in the City has spent well over
#30,000 to get the working environment of its 300 computer users
assessed by ergonomics consultants. It used consultants costing #600 a
day and able to carry out about five assessments a day.

However, it is cheaper to send a number of staff on training courses
and transfer assessment skills in house, especially if staff change
desks and offices frequently. This is because the legislation says that
every time someone moves desk, they have to be re-assessed. Prices and
course lengths vary from #300 for a one-day one-person course to #3,000
for a two-day 20-person course.

Whatever approach is chosen, Choudhury warns that the government's
estimate of how much it costs to conform to the regulations is woefully
inadequate, especially if you discover problems and have to get someone
in to sort them out.

What if an employee gets RSI?
But what do you do, if despite the best intentions, an employee
complains of RSI? Choudhury advises employers to treat the complaint
seriously and carry out a risk assessment of the employee's work space
as required by the HSE regulations. This can be performed by a staff
member who has been on an appropriate training course or examined the
regulations, or by a consultant. But if no steps have been taken
before, and the employee's condition is serious, the employer may
already be in trouble.
The next step is to get a medical diagnosis, either from a general
practitioner (GP) or, if the GP is out of his/her depth or does not
wish to get involved, a specialist. The advantage of employing a
specialist (such as a chartered physiotherapist with experience of RSI
cases) is that he/she will keep you up to date on the employee's
condition, so you won't have to depend on secondhand information from
the employee.

Boyling says: "Medical advice should be sought early, even if it is
only to reassure the individual that they have not got a clinical
problem." If they are suffering from aches, pains and fatigue, this may
be remediable by improving the ergonomics of the work environment.
However, if there is a clinical problem, RSI is curable if the
individual is treated early enough.

The first thing a specialist is likely to advise is that you reduce the
amount of time the RSI sufferer spends at a keyboard. This depends on
the severity of the case, but it is not unusual for RSI sufferers to be
restricted to using a keyboard for five minutes an hour.

Under the regulations, employers can also be asked to provide
meaningful alternative work for staff with RSI. Many are confused as to
what this means and, if the wrong alternative work is provided, it can
add to the stress the RSI sufferer is under. For example, if a temp is
brought in to do the RSI sufferer's work under his/her supervision, the
person with RSI may feel that they aren't needed.

Stress-related RSI
A more constructive approach is to look at the design of the original
job and see if there is something about it which is causing stress and
needs to be changed.

In fact, Choudhury expects many future RSI actions to be brought by
professional (as opposed to secretarial) staff on the grounds that they
were subjected to too much stress. This is a feasible line of attack,
because amongst other clauses, the HSE regulations say that software
and job design shall not be a source of stress.

He says: "Many organisations call us in to see their secretaries and we
tell them that their professional staff are equally at risk." One RSI
case going through the courts concerns a City worker who is seeking to
prove that he was working under undue stress.

Choudhury believes that companies' neglect of the requirements of
professional staff using computers will come back to haunt them.

The Hand Book (Preventing Computer Injury) by Stephanie Brown, a New-
York based professor of piano, is available from Ergonome, 145 West
96th St, Suite 800, New York, NY10025. In it, the author uses her
knowledge of the hand positions which can injure pianists, to give
advice to computer users. Tips include: keep the natural wrist line;
let the wrists float; let the elbows hang free; relax the ring and
little fingers; don't squeeze the mouse; rest the hands when not
keying. The book was reviewed by Jeffrey Boyling in the FT on 12
January 1994.

FIRST UK TELEWORKING QUALIFICATION LAUNCHED

The Telecottage Association has launched the first formal qualification
for teleworkers (people who use computers and telecoms to work away
from the main office - either at home or at a local computer resource
centre, such as a telecottage/telecentre).

The 20-week part-time course was developed at Moorlands Telecottage in
Staffordshire as part of a European collaborative project and has now
been approved by the City and Guilds Institute. Alan Denbigh, executive
director of the Telecottage Association, says the course gives
practical tuition in everything from business viability and finance
(for those wanting to set up their own businesses) to information
technology, self-management and business administration.

The first courses will be run at Axe Vale Telecentre in Devon, Leek
College in Staffordshire, Ryhl in Wales and Moorlands.  So far there
are no set fees for the courses.  At Leek College the course is free
and Axe Vale has sponsorship from BT to help keep costs to a minimum.

Lynn Chadwick, who is in charge of the teleworking course, says: "So
far most interest has come from people planning to set up telecentres
or start their own businesses from home".

The Teleworking Association was set up in 1993 to provide help and
support to those working from home or involved in running telecottages
or telecentres.  More information from Lynn Chadwick on (UK): 0538
386674.

PORTABLES LEADER COMPAQ ADDS SUB-NOTEBOOK

US pc supplier Compaq is now the top worldwide supplier of portable pcs
- up from fourth place in 1992, according to initial 1993 Dataquest
figures.

The company has a 12 per cent share of the worldwide portable market by
units, up from 8.7 per cent in 1992, and has also doubled its share of
the overall US pc market, closing in on both Apple and IBM.  The
introduction of several lower-cost ranges of pcs and portables has
helped to fuel its growth.

Earlier this months, the company introduced its first sub-notebook pc -
the Compaq Contura Aero, which it says is 33 per cent lighter and 40
per cent smaller than most notebooks pcs.  Aero is smaller than most
notebooks pcs.  Aero is smaller than an A4 sheet of paper and weighs
less than three-and-a half pounds.  It costs #999 (excluding VAT) for
the monochrome-screen version with 84 MB megabyte hard disk.

The machine has an Intel 486 processor operating at 25 Mhz and a PCMCIA
Type II slot into which credit-card sized peripherals (such as modems)
can be added.  More expensive versions are available.

The Aero can operate for four to six hours, depending on whether an
internal battery charger is used to recharge extra batteries while
others are in use.  It is pre-loaded with Dos, Windows, TabWorks (which
simplifies the management of Windows files), Lotus Organizer (an
integrated package with a calendar and planner), and WinLink file
transfer software and cable for exchanging files with a desktop pc.  In
the office, Aero can be connected to a large monitor and keyboard via
#75 Desktop Convenience Base which provides extra ports for plugging
such things in.

Compaq describes Aero as a `no compromise' notebook.  One compromise is
that, although it can be connected to a floppy disk, it doesn't have
one of its own.

MOTOROLA PLANS `WIRELESS DATA' COMMUNICATORS

Yet another personal communicator is being described as "not like
Apple's Newton".  The last company to promise such a device was Compaq.
 NOt is it US company Motorola's turn.  Meanwhile, Apple has dropped
the UK price of the Newton (a hand-held organiser and computer to which
communications devices can be attached) to #499 (incl. VAT).

Motorola plans to announce next month the first personal communicator
with the built-in ability to send data over a digital wireless network.
 Robert Growney, chief of Motorla's wireless data division said:  "Our
device (the Envoy) is going to be different" from the Apple Newton and
AT&T's Eo communicator.  The price, yet to be fixed, "is going to be
attractive".

KEY TRENDS IN EMAIL FOR LOCAL AREA NETWORKS

The take-up of electronic mail on local-area networks is rapid. Lotus,
the market leader, says it has doubled the number of users of its
cc:Mail electronic mail (email) package in the past year.

On pages six and seven of Business Computing Brief, and in three pages
of the next issue, we take a look at email products from over 30
suppliers, with details of their features, the standards they support,
and the kind of computers they run on. By comparing this data with our
1992 survey, it is possible to see some of the key trends emerging in
email for local-area networks (Lans).

Support for standards
Standards compliance is now an issue with almost all users and the
products listed reflect that demand. X.400, the international standard
for addressing messages sent to different systems, is now offered by
most suppliers. X.500, the directory services standard, is starting to
appear in some suppliers' literature.

Another standard, of a de facto nature, is MHS (Message Handling
System) from Novell. This provides a useful common platform for makers
of email software. It incorporates the means for exchanging messages
between different systems, leaving the product supplier free to
concentrate on adding features for the user.

Mail filtering and workflow
Two of the new features that users are beginning to look for are
workflow and mail filtering. Both can easily be adapted to the user's
requirements. Workflow can, for example, direct mail to another person
if the addressee is on holiday. Or it can manage the flow of a message
around a group of users.
Mail filtering differs in that it acts only on messages in the user's
in tray, prioritising messages. Both workflow and mail filtering are
bridging the gap between electronic mail and specialist groupware
products.

Integration
Users, and third-party suppliers, want software that will integrate
with other programs and systems. Email is becoming the corporate data
highway for transporting any kind of electronic cargo. Links with
document management systems, with transaction systems and with external
communications systems are now a common requirement.

Two competing sets of programming interfaces have emerged to meet this
need to connect with other systems - MAPI (Messaging Applications
Programming Interface) and VIM (Vendor-Independent Messaging), which
was instigated by Lotus and has the support of Borland, IBM,
WordPerfect and others.

In 1992, we drew attention to the rise of the terms, 'client' and
'server'. In the context of email, client software gives users the
means of displaying and creating messages. The server supplies various
services to the client machines connected to it. These include the
"post office" (or message store), the directory of users, and any
gateways to other systems.

Most major suppliers offer client software for different machines, such
as pcs and Apple Macintoshes, that can work from the same server
software. Also, they usually offer the server software for a selection
of different machines, typically running on Unix or Windows NT.
The final development to note is the advent of wireless working. All
the major suppliers are working on products that will work over radio
links.

The software listed varies widely in cost, power and application, and
in the completeness of its compliance with standards. Before buying it
is wise to seek advice from as independent a source as possible on
matters such as sizing and interworking with existing systems.

AMERADA HESS KEEPS STAFF COSTS DOWN WITH IMAGING TECHNOLOGY

For most companies, the biggest problem in dealing with invoices is to
actually pay them. When 10,000 invoices a year land on the desk,
however, the difficulty becomes one of keeping track of them and
ensuring that the item billed has been supplied satisfactorily and
invoiced correctly.

Amerada Hess, the US-owned oil company with offices in London and
Aberdeen, found its payment procedures even more complex: as a member
of a number of consortia operating North Sea exploration and extraction
projects, Amerada Hess also has to allocate portions of some invoices
to its varying consortia partners.

Accounting for waste
Amerada Hess, which had a UK turnover of US$734m in 1993, became an
operator, as opposed to just a consortium partner funding other
companies' operations, in 1983. Since then, it has become the biggest
offshore acreage holder in Britain.

"We have expanded tremendously," says financial controller Roger
Thorne. "But our objective has always been to do so at minimum cost -
which includes minimum headcount. One average accounts payable clerk
used to process around 4,000 invoices per year - with other personnel,
such as accountants, business planners and engineers, also examining
many of the invoices. We couldn't expand our business without incurring
more invoices - requiring more resources.

By 1991, Amerada Hess knew that Scott Field, the largest North Sea
development of the decade, was to come on stream in 1993. "As a partner
in consortia developing Scott, we were looking at 100 per cent growth.
We did not want a 100 per cent increase in clerks, accountants or
business planners," says Thorne. "We knew we had to get an electronic
system of some sort to capture and process financial information."
Investigation across all industries led to a six month review of
workflow systems. Chevron, a California-based oil company, was using
Filenet's image processing and workflow software, which seemed the most
effective.

Installation and application
Amerada Hess signed Filenet and UK-based IMI Computing to develop an
Invoice Payment System (IPS) in January 1993; installation was complete
by September.

Every paper invoice received is scanned into the system using imaging
technology, and given a unique number which is also stamped on the
paper invoice. This is filed in case the auditors, consortia partners,
VAT office or any other body wishes to see it later.

Once scanned in, each invoice is checked on screen to ensure it is
correctly added up, has the vendor name and invoice number and its
commitment reference, which tells the company when it purchased or
rented the item or requested the service. The clerk can tell by this
number whether she is looking for a contract, purchase order, service
order, or work order (part of a large purchase order, similar to a sub-
order).

Windows technology enables the clerk to verify certain elements of the
commitment, called compliance. She can see if the goods billed have
been received - based on data keyed in by the recipient of the goods.

If the invoice is for a simple order and the goods have been received
and match the purchase order, the bill is paid. If the compliance is
outside the scope of the clerk, it is routed electronically via Digital
Equipment's Teamlinks package to an accountant and/or engineer who
receives a message flashed onto the screen saying there is an IPS
referral. This message remains on screen until deleted by the user.

"Engineers validate work done, while the accountant verifies the
commercial terms of the invoice and cost-codes it to the right account,
which may be a department of Amerada Hess or one of our consortia
partners," Thorne explains. "With 102 joint ventures now in place,
accounting can be complicated."

The system knows at all times where an invoice is and when it has to be
paid. Reports are called off by accounts payable, which show when a
member of staff has "sat on" an invoice for too long, and indicate that
the invoice is due for payment.

Once approved, the invoice goes back to the clerk, at which point the
system reads the code and automatically sends the bill to the payment
queue at the general ledger department for a cheque to be issued. When
the invoice is paid, details are passed back to IPS to provide a
complete audit trail.

If at any time the vendor/service provider telephones to check on an
invoice, instead of ringing round the building to locate it, the IPS
gives the clerk its current status. It used to take a day or longer to
trace an invoice; now it takes minutes. If someone goes away, the
system automatically routes the invoice to a delegated employee.

Once paid, invoices are electronically archived with all vendor
information, who approved the invoice, commitment compliance, goods
receipt information etc.

Time is money
The IPS is much quicker and more accurate than the old system, in which
all accounting information was keyed in to the computer from the paper
invoice, and added to by an engineer and/or accountant if necessary
before being sent to the general ledger. Now accountants can also
interrogate the general ledger on screen when analysing costings or
making forecasts, switching to the IPS if any particular item needs to
be checked.

Reports which can be obtained from the system include invoices which
will become overdue if not paid immediately, payment by vendor per
month, payment history of a single vendor (useful when investigating
complaints about slow payment), and volumes of work handled by any
employee.

IPS provides another very important benefit, too, when Amerada Hess is
being audited. "Because we spend #350m ($525m) on exploration and
production, our joint venture partners want to audit us," explains
Thorne. "In the past we would have to dig out all the paperwork and try
to segregate information. It took the equivalent of two full-time
employees per year - and paper was easier to lose.

"Now we tell IPS to look for all relevant invoices and leave the
auditors in front of a screen for as long as they wish."

Amerada Hess now handles 50,000 invoices per year, still with five
accounts payable clerks and six or seven accountants. If the VAT office
ever decides that it will accept imaged copies of invoices, vendors
will be asked to keep invoices electronically, eliminating all paper.

In the meantime, 65 people use the system, based on six cornerstone
large-screen pcs in accounts payable for heavy-duty image processing
(such as checking images which have just been scanned), and smaller pcs
for other users (also used for other business tasks). Although Amerada
Hess couldn't say what the complete system cost, as it has developed it
jointly with Filenet, it estimates that it has saved up to #200,000 per
year in projected staff increases.

"IPS has allowed us to maintain our previous high standard with 100 per
cent efficiency, and given us the confidence to manage an invoice
processing system in a secure environment." Paying invoices has, in
fact, become almost painless.

TAKING TIME TO LOOK AT SCHEDULING

Staff at Rockwell Collins can now book appointments with each other
electronically, using pc-based scheduling software. Previously,
scheduling meetings between busy people was a Herculean task. But today
many wasted phone calls can be avoided, and countless Post-It notes
saved, by using the group scheduling system.

A scheduler is a computerised diary for each individual in a
corporation, which can be accessed by others to register appointments,
check availability and post messages. Linked to the corporate
electronic mail (email) system, a scheduler can contact a number of
people simultaneously then route replies back to the originator. It
will also keep track of available resources such as meeting rooms,
audio- visual aids and the like, and allocate them on request (if
available) and according to pre-determined criteria.

Schedulers have been available to mainframe users for some years, but
have entered the limelight with the advent of groupware (software that
supports team work), and of powerful pc-based systems which will
operate in a client-server environment (where processing is shared
between high-speed computer servers and pcs on a network).

So now is a good time to take a fresh look at schedulers in the light
of new products and downsizing. Also, because many users have become
computer-literate, they may be ready to move to a computerised diary
system.

Rockwell Collins UK, a subsidiary of the US avionics and communications
corporation Rockwell International, has recently expanded the use of
schedulers at its Reading offices, where some 200 staff are employed.
Last autumn, Jenny White, software engineer at Rockwell Collins, was
asked to identify a system which would help to coordinate the
activities of senior managers. Although there was a scheduler available
on the in-house IBM system, it was memory-hungry and not very user-
friendly. What was needed was a system which would run on a variety of
pcs on the Banyan Vines network from a server pc, and integrate with
the existing Vines email system.

Staff at Rockwell Collins were used to Franklin organisers - a loose-
leaf paper diary/organiser which is issued as standard throughout the
company, and which provides a methodology for identifying and
accomplishing tasks. Jenny White looked at the computerised version of
the Franklin organiser - Ascend - but found it expensive at around #100
($150) per user, and slow under the Windows graphical user interface.
She also found it difficult to move between users' schedules.

Rockwell Collins' US parent was already using Calandar from
Microsystems Software (a company based in Boston, USA) on two of its 96
Banyan servers on a wide area network (Wan). At around #35 per user,
Calandar was very competitively priced, and a powerful product. Last
November it was installed in a department of 20 people at Rockwell
Collins UK on a trial basis.

How it works
Calandar provides a daily or weekly view of your appointments, tasks
and messages, a yearly navigator screen which gives an overview of
yearly activity or allows you to move quickly to another day, and a
monthly group graph, which shows availability of all group members and
resources at a glance.

The Windows version has an optional button bar which provides access to
other views and features. For example, you can click on the "change"
button to access another individual's records, if security allows. You
can also click and drag to create, move and delete appointments.

Using the create/modify screen you can ask the system to suggest a time
when various individuals and resources are free. Then you can make the
appointment and await replies - the screen shows the status of each
appointment by a traffic-light icon (green denotes everyone has
accepted, red tells you someone has declined and amber that all replies
have not yet been received). If not everyone can attend, the people
involved must sort things out, perhaps by phone. However, the system
will not allow you to make appointments which create conflicts for
resources.

When you receive a new activity, you can easily view, reply, or forward
it to another person or leave it unanswered for the time being, through
a pop-up menu.

Diaries are password-controlled, but you can allow proxy access to
yours without a password at various levels.

Additional useful "accessories" are an address book, called Calodex,
which can be integrated with word processing or automatic phone
dialling; a telephone message facility; a hot-call facility, which
allows you to see if another call is waiting and notify the operator if
you want them to hold; and a "pegboard" which shows who is in or out of
the office. You can also print a record of appointments to refer to
when away from your desk.

Appointments and messages can be emailed to others who do not have a
Calandar account if their details are recorded in Calodex, and other
individuals can be included on invitation lists for reference.

User reactions
Jenny White says the scheduler has been readily accepted by staff
taking part in the trial. "I have been surprised at how quickly it has
caught on. If I want to upgrade the system now, I have to do it out of
hours because everyone's using it. We quickly started to get requests
from other departments and this month we have implemented Calandar
across the organisation on a 70 user licence, using a variety of pcs --
XTs, ATs, Dells, PS/2s and Toshiba laptops." A training programme will
involve Microsystems Software's UK reseller, Accurate Technology, in
training for key individuals who will then train others in the
organisation.

Has there been any adverse reaction from users? "Some people think
there's a duplication of activity between the Franklin organisers and
the scheduling system," says White. "After all, you can take your
organiser to a meeting, and so can everyone else, but you can't all
take pcs along just yet. So there is some duplication, but it's a
matter of showing the result is worth it, and creating a culture in
which everyone consults the scheduler regularly. That is what the
training will aim to achieve."
White believes the scheduler will not only save time for people making
appointments, but will also help staff with their work in other ways.
"For example, here in the computer department, we work to service level
agreements. If you're going to be away, you can actually print out your
tasks and give them to someone else to follow up."

Cross platform capability
The email system provides the engine for Calandar, which integrates
with all leading local-area-network-based email systems including
cc:Mail, Microsoft Mail, Vines Intelligent Messaging and Novell's MHS,
and is available in Windows, DOS and Macintosh versions, all sharing
the same database. There is also a Wan version which can support up to
128 databases with up to 1,000 users in each database. At Rockwell
Collins, the scheduler is used locally in Windows and DOS versions.
Calandar has been on the market since 1989 in the US, where it has over
300,000 users, but it has only recently become available in the UK
through Accurate Technology, based in Wokingham, Berks. According to
Bob Getchell of Microsystems Software, the product is particularly
suitable for "corporate entities with many servers and many email users
and connectivity between local area networks and a corporate email
facility."

Other UK corporate users include Walker Crisps, Guinness, Inchcape  and
British Telecom. In the US, Calandar is sometimes used to schedule
video conferences because it supports different time zones.

Scheduling software can save many unproductive phone calls for
administrative staff who need to make appointments, book meeting rooms,
arrange conference calls and keep track of itineraries and key tasks.
With remote access from portables, schedulers can also be useful when
away from the office. But even so, rumours of the death of the diary
are greatly exaggerated.

SPECTRUM COUNTERSUES SCULLEY FOR $300 MILLION

John Sculley, Apple's former CEO, resigned abruptly after only four
months as chairman and chief executive of Spectrum Information
Technologies. He filed a suit against Spectrum's president, Peter
Caserta, charging that he had been duped into joining the company by
"fraudulent misrepresentations". Now Spectrum has countersued. It is
claiming breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, mismanagement
and theft of trade secrets against Sculley and is seeking $300 million
in damages.

GROUPE BULL LOSS

The severity of French computer company Groupe Bull's financial
problems is emphasised by its net loss before restructuring costs of
FFr3.42 billion ($583 million) for 1993 compared with a loss of FFr2.45
billion in 1992. Sales fell by 6.4 per cent to FFr28.25 billion in 1993
and operating losses were FFr1.89 billion. Recently the European
Commission demanded that the French government, as controlling
shareholder, suspend plans for a FFr2.5 billion capital injection in
the company.

AMSTRAD WARNS OF POSSIBLE FULL-YEAR LOSS

Amstrad chairman Alan Sugar has warned shareholders that the consumer
electronics group might report a full-year loss. This followed the
announcement of an unexpected first-half operating loss of #1.89
million (against a #9.1 million profit a year earlier), a sharply
reduced pre-tax profit of #1.75 million (against #5.61 million) and a
31 per cent fall in turnover. Despite the operating loss, Amstrad was
able to report a pre-tax profit because of net interest earned on its
substantial cash balances which had grown from #112 million to #143
million.

IBM UPGRADES AS/400 MINICOMPUTER

With the aim of stemming falling revenues in one of its most critical
business areas, IBM has announced a higher performance version of its
widely-used AS/400 minicomputer. The new product, the 9406 Model F97,
will support 4,800 workstations (twice that of the current top-of-range
model F95) and provides 20 per cent more power and up to 30 per cent
more disk storage. Next year IBM is expected to announce another
significant upgrade of the AS/400 family based on the PowerPC chip - a
new Risc processor co-developed with Motorola and Apple Computer.

CHEAPER PEAK TIME PHONE CALLS

In the latest of a series of price cuts, BT is to abolish from March 9
the peak weekday rate for phone calls made between 9am and 1pm. BT says
the reduction will save customers, mostly business, up to 25 per cent
on calls and will cost the company #350 million ($515 million) a year.
Some analysts say the price cuts will do nothing more than complete the
#500 million of price cuts required this year by the regulator, Oftel.
Others see the impact of growing competition from Mercury (which
immediately announced it was scrapping its own "prime-period" from
March 9), and from other new and potential competitors including MFS
Communications of the US which plans to enter the heavy-use City of
London telephone market in April.

AT&T'S FIRST HEAD FOR EUROPE

US telecoms group AT&T has appointed Pier Carlo Falotti as its first
European chief executive. The move is seen to show the priority AT&T
gives to building its European business as telecoms in Europe undergo
radical liberalisation. Falotti, aged 51, was the former European head
of computer manufacturer, Digital Equipment, and more recently chief
executive of US software group ASK. AT&T is currently negotiating with
the French and German state telecoms companies about a possible
alliance. It is also in talks in the UK with Energis, the National Grid
subsidiary, which is to launch a third national long-distance telecoms
network.

DON'T IGNORE THE USERS

The Public Accounts Committee has criticised the Department of
Employment for failing to learn from previous computer projects about
the need to involve users fully. The Department of Employment began to
introduce its Field system in 1988 for regional offices responsible for
training and enterprise programmes. But when these activities were
taken over by employer-led training and enterprise councils (Tecs) in
1990, it continued with the system without finding out what they really
wanted. Although the department continued to develop the system, by
August 1992 most Tecs were using the #48 million system "only partially
or not at all", and most did not feel it had enhanced their
performance.

CROSS-BORDER BANKING OPENS UP

EDS the data services company, has bought a 32 per cent stake in Ibos,
the Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander's cross-border
electronic banking system, as part of a plan to open it to other banks.
Some 5 per cent of the new company set up to market Ibos will be owned
by its financial adviser, Goldman Sachs, with the other 95 per cent
being split equally between its three main partners.

The two banks said Ibos, which allows banks to transfer cash between
accounts in different countries within seconds, would in future be open
to any bank which paid a subscription fee of about #50,000 a year. The
Ibos partners believe it will be cheaper than its competitors such as
Swift, the Brussels-based transfer system owned by banks.

INTERNET USERS URGED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS

Users were urged to change their  passwords after a sweeping break-in
into the online mailboxes of thousands of users of the Internet
computer network. Earlier this month, an Internet security
investigation team spotted what might be the largest computer security
breach on Internet. The team said it wasn't clear whether the
intruders, known as "crackers", had "vandalised" computer systems or
unleashed damaging computer viruses. The crackers installed software
programs that watched users link up with remote computers on Internet,
thereby creating a log of names and passwords.

KILLER COMPONENTS
Prefabricated application building blocks are coming. The only question is
when.

By:
Alan Joch, Senior Editor

The days when one programmer could bang out a commercial-grade application
are over. The size and complexity of most applications are just too great
for one mind. Enter components--prefabricated parts of applications that a
developer can string together to create a sum greater than its parts.
Today, componentware is neonatal, residing largely in the incubators of
organizations such as Component Integration Labs, Microsoft, and the Object
Management Group (OMG), with their OpenDoc, OLE, and CORBA standards. In
this series of articles, we tell you how you can deal with and develop
applications using these developing standards.
But are they the future? David A. Fisher thinks not. As a program manager
for the National Institute of Standards & Technology (Gaithersburg, MD), he
helps administer $150 million in government funding to find new and better
ways to create component-based software. So far, NIST has chosen to fund 16
projects. ``We picked the radical ideas floating around,'' he says.
   These ideas come from organizations at polar extremes. On one side are
the almost-mythical research institutions, such as AT&T Bell Labs and
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). On the other side are obscure
start-ups, with names like Aesthetic Solutions, Semantic Designs, and even
Tom Sawyer Software.
   At the heart of NIST's program is the goal to make components and the
skeleton applications that they plug into easier to build. The benefits to
corporate developers would be shorter development time, more-reliable code,
and more efficient use of development resources. The program also seeks
ways to create a viable component market that spawns an industry of
commercial component developers who can expect sales volumes large enough
to recoup their programming costs.
   How might we fulfill these goals? Check back in five or seven years.
That's when Fisher expects the research NIST is funding today to start to
see daylight as commercial products. These products might consist of new
languages with radically different ways of expressing program requirements.
``In the past, we've had some success by focusing on interface standards,
but that's not a long-term solution,'' Fisher says. ``Interface standards
have life expectancies shorter than the standards-setting process.''
   New automation tools would generate both the needed component and the
mechanism for gluing it together with other components. If languages and
tools address the details of building component-based applications,
software developers can focus solely on an application's features,
performance, and reliability. ``We want developers to concern themselves
with content over form,'' Fisher says.
   But that desire isn't new. It's what spawned CASE, object-oriented
programming, and today's more down-to-earth version of componentware.
What's more, developers don't often complain that there aren't enough
creative ideas for making software development easier; missing are
here-and-now technologies that can help developers build programs today.
   It's to that strength that OLE and CORBA (and soon, perhaps, OpenDoc)
play. That's what we will explore in the following pages.

INTEGRATION, NOT PERSPIRATION
CORBA, OLE, and OpenDoc: Three technologies for desktop components face
off

By:
DAVID S. LINTHICUM

Choose one from column A, one from column B, and one from column C. Presto:
You have an application.
   Why shouldn't it be that easy? After all, you can build an entire
personal computer by selecting off-the-shelf components. Why can't you
build a software program the same way?
   You can, if you understand how to use today's three main component
technologies: CORBA, OLE, and OpenDoc. Developers who work exclusively in
Windows have it easiest: Microsoft has been chumming the waters for more
than two years with Visual Basic custom controls (VBXes) and OLE controls
(OCXes).
   But all is not perfect with Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding
technology. Its learning curve can be daunting, and even when you've
mastered it, you hit disappointing limitations like its lack of
inheritance. (Inheritance is one of the cornerstones of object-oriented
(OO) development.) Ask developers about the alternatives, and they'll
describe OpenDoc as if it were an objet d'art on a pedestal. Unfortunately
for most production shops, OpenDoc will remain as impractical as a museum
piece until the technology finally ships and is embraced by third-party
component vendors.
   The ground is even shakier for developers who code for Macintosh, OS/2,
or Unix. They have nothing like OLE for get-it-done-now jobs. And their
best-hope component environments, from OpenDoc to CORBA descendants like
SunSoft's NEO (Networked Objects), are infants.

Controlling OLE
   Unless you've been lost in Myst for the last three years, you've
probably heard the hoopla over Microsoft's OLE 2.0. In short, it provides
the event-handling, file-managing, and information-sharing mechanisms that
serve as the plumbing of application components like OLE Controls.
Moreover, OLE is an integral part of Windows 95 and other Microsoft
operating systems.
   But OLE has a big drawback: Despite its name, it does not support OO
development. OLE-based components don't offer inheritance--the capability
to move data and functions from existing objects into new objects for use
inside an application. You can alter OLE components using aggregation, but
you cannot extend the capabilities of an OLE component through standard OO
programming operations.
   (In contrast, CORBA-based platforms, like OpenDoc, do support the OO
model religiously. Developers can extend the capabilities of OpenDoc
components, or other CORBA-based object request brokers (ORBs), through the
same OO development practices found in C++, Smalltalk, and many special
client/server tools.)
   OLE Controls are a mix of an OLE automation server, which allows one OLE
Control to expose its class modules to other OLE Controls, and an OLE
in-process server, which is a server OLE implements as a DLL. OLE Controls
support embedding; OLE automation; event notification; and the capability
to connect objects, which establishes two-way communications between an
object and an application. This link lets an object notify an application
when there's a change in its data or when a user has fired an event, such
as executing a mouse click. In addition, OLE Controls register themselves
in the Windows registry (through the DllRegisterServer function), provide a
licensing feature, and offer property editing. These new features ease some
development chores for those who build OLE Controls.
   How do OLE Controls work within an application? As the figure below
show, they transform user-generated events (such as mouse clicks) into
messages that communicate with the application (the container in OLE
parlance). OLE Controls use these events to trigger event handlers that
carry out the bidding of the OLE Control.
   There are two major steps in the process of creating an OLE Control.
First, you must design the control, which means creating, writing, and
compiling the code that draws the control and sets up all the methods and
data encapsulated inside it. The code eventually becomes a DLL with an .OCX
or .DLL extension. Second, you need to design the interface that will allow
Microsoft's Visual Basic, Borland's Delphi, or other appropriate
development environment to use the OLE Control. OLE Controls are DLLs and
are not linked to a single application.
   The communication between applications and OLE Controls is through a
messaging interface. The host application tells the control what to do
through this interface, and the control carries out the operation. Every
OLE object has a receptor, known as a sink, to receive an application's
instructions. In some cases, however, a user may generate an event within
an OLE Control, and the control needs to communicate this to the
application. OLE Controls set up these two-way communication links
dynamically. The control first tells the application what language it can
speak. The application then sets up the proper sink to accept this
language, and the two sides make a connection.
   To ease development, OLE provides standard events (called stock events)
for each OLE Control. These are the base events that developers build on to
create their OLE controls. The OLE Control parent class, Microsoft
Foundation Classes' COleControl, manages stock events by default. To make
an OLE Control interactive, developers must add interface methods and
properties. Methods provide the OLE Control with basic behaviors;
properties generally include color and fonts for use in the OLE Control.
Methods and properties together make up the basic mechanism that allows the
appearance and values in the control to change as application processing
takes place.
   But OLE Controls are difficult for many developers to understand and
even more difficult to build. For instance, OLE requires that a developer
invoke 126 functions just to get at 13 interfaces. However, Microsoft's
firm support for the standard has led to such handy tools as the AppWizard,
a dynamic template generator for use with Visual C++ that lets you develop
OLE Controls and other OLE parts without having to code from the ground
up.
   Support for OLE Controls is growing. Development packages such as
Borland's Delphi, Microsoft's FoxPro and Access, and Visual Basic all
support OLE Controls, as do most Windows-based client/server development
products.

OLE Control Roots
   While OLE Controls may represent the future, VBXes are by far the most
successful implementations of component-based development. VBX-based
application development typically consists of setting up many of these
components within a host environment and allowing them to interact as an
application. Developers usually just place VBXes inside interface windows,
then tell the appropriate component properties within the tool what will
happen when the program invokes the VBX. You can often add these VBX
components to an application without having to write a single line of code.
It's plug-and-play programming. Most Windows development tools, such as
Visual Basic, PowerSoft's PowerBuilder, Borland's Delphi, and most C++
compilers can use VBXes.
   VBXes are everywhere. You can purchase them by the score at prices
ranging from free to $3000. They'll do everything from faxing within an
application to providing visual buttons to managing complex financial
information. On-line services, BBSes, and Web servers offer many freeware
or shareware VBXes.
   But all has not been well in the VBX world. VBXes aren't based on any
particular standard, and many developers consider them kludges that are
closely linked with Visual Basic. And precisely because the list of
third-party vendors is so varied, ``buyer beware'' is the mantra for users
of VBX components. Generally speaking, VBX vendors test the products only
with a few select development tools, not with all potential development
environments. Some PowerBuilder developers say many VBXes aren't compatible
with that platform's client/server development environment. Even Visual
Basic developers find that bugs in VBXes keep them from playing well with
other VBXes.
   These problems will soon become moot. Microsoft is abandoning VBX in
favor of OLE Control to promote the OLE agenda. For those of you who build
VBXes, Microsoft provides a VBX-to-OLE Control migration toolkit as part of
Visual C++ 2.0, the premier development environment for VBX and OLE
Control.

Using OpenDoc
   If OLE Controls are king for Windows environments, then OpenDoc is the
crown prince for many Unix, OS/2, and Macintosh development efforts.
OpenDoc has a lot on OLE, including its full support for inheritance.
OpenDoc has a better interface than OLE partly because developers can do
more with fewer API calls. OpenDoc also supports irregularly shaped
objects, overlapping parts, and the capability to have a variety of parts
active at the same time. (However, ``active all-the-time'' OpenDoc
components can cause performance problems since they all require CPU
cycles.)
   OpenDoc programs consist of documents, parts, container applications,
part editors, part services, and a part viewer. You build applications by
grouping OpenDoc parts inside a document (see the sample below). Parts
typically have part editors or part services, which enable users to view or
manipulate parts, depending on the application.
   The container is a stand-alone application that a developer has modified
to support embedded OpenDoc part editors and services. Part editors display
and modify the contents of a part, as well as provide a user interface for
making these modifications. The user interface could include menus,
controls, tool palettes, or other elements for interacting with the
contents. For example, an OpenDoc part could be a bar graph that will go
into an annual report. By invoking a part editor, a user can display and
alter the information.
   Part services provide the background features of an OpenDoc part and the
user interface for manipulating the contents of that part. For example, a
database-access part would build in the database-access functionality as a
part service. Part viewers allow users to see and print the contents of a
part. A viewer is useful if a developer would like the user to be able to
examine but not change the information in an OpenDoc part.

Something Completely Different
   Developers will find OpenDoc a radical departure from traditional GUI
application development because it gives them a component discipline that
other architectures, including OLE, have yet to match. OpenDoc is a set of
shared class libraries with a platform-independent interface defined by an
interface definition language (IDL). It uses object skeletons based on
CORBA-compliant System Object Model (SOM) base classes. It's easy to add
new parts at any time because the SOM objects dynamically bind.
   The IDL and SOM base of OpenDoc allow part editors built with various
compilers and programming languages to talk with each other using a common
communications mechanism. SOM includes a component-packaging mechanism.
When building OpenDoc objects, developers can use this mechanism to package
part editors using binary class libraries for shipment as DLLs; you can
send a part to someone and be sure the recipient will have the appropriate
viewer to see the part. SOM is the OO heart of OpenDoc, and it's where
OpenDoc gets its inheritance capabilities. Inheritance lets developers
subclass OpenDoc parts and either use or override methods and data
delivered using the DLL binaries. This feature brings the concept of
extendable parts to OpenDoc, which is one of the real selling points of
this technology.
   On paper, OpenDoc offers a number of technical advantages. But is
creating parts any easier than coding controls in the OLE environment?
Actually, the process of programming an OpenDoc part is straightforward.
You create the interface in an IDL source file, run the SOM precompiler on
your IDL code, add the body of the implementation code, compile the whole
thing into a DLL for Windows or the equivalent in other environments, and
you're ready to roll. Building OpenDoc parts requires fewer steps than
building similar components as OLE Controls.
   When creating an OpenDoc part, you must first subclass ODPart, which is
an abstract class that brings with it 60 methods to define the behavior of
a part. You customize behavior of a part by overriding any of the default
methods that came with the part. You can create a workable OpenDoc part by
implementing as few as six methods. Thus, creating OpenDoc parts is a snap
for most developers in almost any programming environment and platform. The
only real trick is to track which methods OpenDoc calls while your part is
working in a production environment.
   With OpenDoc, you can also create links between objects, or a permanent
reference from one part to another. When data changes in one OpenDoc
object, it automatically changes in the other. For example, developers
could use one OpenDoc component to track information in the stock market in
real time, and send information to update a graphical depiction of the data
in another OpenDoc object.
   The component-based nature of OpenDoc allows developers to create or
migrate components on one platform and use them on other platforms that
support the standard. OpenDoc, as with other CORBA offspring, supports OLE
2.0 by encapsulating OLE components inside OpenDoc components. Apple and
the other proponents of OpenDoc are realistic. They are well aware that the
technology has a tough battle to win the desktop, so OpenDoc's OLE support
allows developers to mix and match both OpenDoc and OLE components in the
same development environments.

Mac Development
   Thanks to Apple's strong support, OpenDoc is the obvious choice of
component technology for the Macintosh. Apple is a member of Component
Integration Laboratories, the consortium that is creating and promoting
OpenDoc. And Apple now uses OpenDoc to deliver a component-based
architecture for System 7. (Microsoft is also porting OLE 2.0 to System
7.)
   In many ways, System 7 and OpenDoc are functionally equivalent to
Windows 95 and OLE. However, Macintosh developers have only a few select
OpenDoc tools to use, many of which are still evolving. Oracle Power
Objects uses BASIC and will support OpenDoc component development on the
Mac. (Power Objects also supports VBXes and will probably someday support
OLE Controls.) Novell's AppWare and the forthcoming MacApp also support
OpenDoc. But there's a significant problem: Commercial OpenDoc components
are basically nonexistent. For the near future, developers will have to
depend on OLE components.
   OpenDoc's cross-platform capabilities bring a great advantage to
software developers. These capabilities offer much better interoperability
with other environments (such as Unix and even Windows) than OLE does. IBM,
for example, will sell OpenDoc for Windows 95 and Windows NT, as well as
OpenDoc for OS/2 and A/IX. Macintosh developers are looking to straddle the
standards by using a mix of OpenDoc and OLE development environments.

Unix: Up For Grabs
   In the Unix world, the component market is still anyone's game.
SunSoft's Solaris, Hewlett-Packard's HP/UX, and Next's NextStep operate in
the world of CORBA as well as environments defined by proprietary
component-based solutions.
   SunSoft's Solaris clearly stands in the CORBA camp with the company's
NEO specification. NEO, under development for three years, was scheduled to
ship in volume early this year. NEO is not just a component-based
development standard; it's Sun's vision of how it will deliver OS and
application software in the future.
   The problem with NEO is it's just now becoming available. SunSoft
provided early developer release (EDR) toolkits for NEO to a few select
customers last year. The EDR provided a CORBA-based object request broker
that supports C and C++. The NEO ORB routes object requests from objects
that reside on Solaris-based workstations to a network link.
   Another problem is NEO's shaky adherence to the OO model. The
specification supports single instead of multiple inheritance. SunSoft's
first release of NEO will include support for CORBA 1.2-based services such
as naming, event, life cycle, and persistence. After adopting the new CORBA
2.0-based services, SunSoft promises NEO will support transactions,
concurrency control, externalization, licensing, and querying.
   For developers, the most compelling reason to investigate NEO is the
power of the environment. If you develop in an all-Solaris shop, NEO may be
the only way to go when moving toward components in the short term. If NEO
lives up to its promises and fully supports CORBA 2.0, it will be a solid
contender in the distributed object market. However, OpenDoc will still
shine for component-based development on the Unix desktop, and developers
should focus on the tools and technology that make use of OpenDoc. It will
provide component compatibility within Solaris and within other
environments as well.
   Next is crashing ahead with its own proprietary component-based
standard, Portable Distributed Objects (PDO). Through an alliance with Sun,
Next sells the OpenStep environment for Sun workstations. OpenStep is also
available for Windows 95 and Windows NT systems, thus competing with OLE
and OpenDoc. OpenStep supports PDO and NEO, and it could be the
CORBA-compliant client of choice for both Unix and Microsoft OSes when the
dust settles. There is even talk of a PDO-based distributed OLE standard.
   PDO, however, is proprietary. You use the Objective C environment to
assemble PDO components into applications. PDO objects communicate over a
network through standard Objective C messages. In many ways, the Objective
C language delivers the ORB features of PDO, rather than an underlying
standard such as CORBA or Microsoft's COM. This limitation makes NextStep
no better than other proprietary development environments. However, PDO
will provide connections with CORBA-compliant ORBs and OLE 2.0.
   To build applications using PDO within the NextStep environment, you
must rely on the NextStep developer tool suite. Although Next provides an
effective development environment, it's the only game in town. Therefore,
developers looking to hedge their bets with several development tools may
want to steer clear of this environment. The tool suite includes a Project
Builder, Interface Builder, Object editor, and Class browser. On top of the
Developer tool suite, Next provides Enterprise Objects Framework, which
offers links to standard relational database servers so that they appear as
objects within the Objective C environment.

VHS or Beta?
   The issue of component-based development may be more political than
technical. OpenDoc, from a developer's perspective, is far superior for
component-based application building than OLE. However, OpenDoc is still in
the ``too new to tell'' phase, while OLE is a reality. OLE is also
associated with the applications juggernaut: Microsoft. There are a few
innovative vendors that support OpenDoc development, but most
nonproprietary components and component-based programming tools you can
purchase today are based on OLE and OLE Controls.
   In many respects, 1996 will be the year that determines how significant
OpenDoc and other CORBA-based component environments are in your
development efforts. OpenDoc will succeed or get out of the way so
Microsoft can take over the component-development market. Successful
component-based development will come to pass only when we finally have a
single standard. Today, there are just too many oars in the water.

An OLE Control interface consists of a pointer to a function table that
sits between the container (an application) and the OLE Control.

Illustration: Figure: How an OLE Control Works with an Application
1. User-generated events, such as a mouse click, send off a message to the
OLE application.
2. The message tells the application (known in OLE parlance as a container)
what action it should perform.
3. Containers and OLE controls communicate through a messaging interface.
Every OLE control has a built-in receptor, called a sink, to receive
instructions from an application.
4. Sometimes a user generates an event within an OLE Control. To
communicate this event to the container, the control tells the container to
dynamically set up a sink to receive the communication.

HOW TO WALK THE STANDARDS TIGHTROPE

As the OLE and OpenDoc standards continue to evolve, developers must make
sure works in progress aren't harmed by any abrupt changes in direction.
Developers can take one of four approaches to these shifting sands: Go OLE,
go OpenDoc, go both, or wait and see.
   OLE 2.0 is a great fit if you develop only for Windows 95 and Windows NT
since it's part of those operating systems. If you go OLE, you base your
application-development efforts on an obtainable technology. This
here-and-now advantage led approximately 375 software vendors (so far) to
publicly declare their allegiance to OLE. But OLE comes with a price:
Applications are difficult to build because OLE 2.0 has an overly complex
interface. Thus, developers need to absorb a lot of low-level detail before
they get OLE to sing and dance.
   With OpenDoc, you can build CORBA-based objects that have the capability
to operate within a desktop environment. OpenDoc provides an easier
approach to development and is better for cross-platform applications, so
it's a solid fit for Unix, Macintosh, and OS/2 environments. OS/2, in fact,
is built using the System Object Model (SOM), which gives it and OpenDoc
common ancestry to CORBA.
   OpenDoc even supports OLE, so you can embed OLE 2.0 objects directly
into its OpenDoc components. Also, OpenDoc is a better bridge to networked
applications, thanks to its kinship with CORBA 2.0, whose creators have
already worked out how to distribute object throughout enterprises. On the
other side, Microsoft has still not released the final version of Network
OLE (see ``Components Everywhere,'' page 99).
   But delays plague OpenDoc also, and the success of OLE 2.0 and
Microsoft's considerable influence give many potential OpenDoc supporters
second thoughts. Development tools using OpenDoc have also been slow to
appear, so only a handful of products, such as AppWare, will support
OpenDoc when it finally becomes a reality sometime later this year. Novell
didn't help the situation at last year's Unix Expo; the company appeared to
be hedging on its OpenDoc support and seemed to be flirting with OLE. News
like this places OLE alternatives in a holding pattern.
   OpenDoc has a better approach to component-based development and better
platform support, but it could still lose the big game to OLE.
   Other component technologies include Iona's Orbix, Digital's
ObjectBroker, IBM's SOM, Expersoft's XShell, SunSoft's NEO, and HP's ORB
Plus. Although these six technologies provide CORBA compatibility, most are
based on CORBA 1.2 and therefore can't play well with each other. Things
are changing, however. The OMG's new CORBA 2.0 specification finally
provides enough detail to allow developers to create object request brokers
(ORBs) that work together.
   Some development shops take the politically correct approach: They
support OpenDoc, CORBA, and OLE. But it's expensive to keep developers up
to date on tools and training for all the different technologies. Some
other organizations have chosen the cheaper path of waiting to see which
way the industry goes before committing resources. However, watching and
waiting could be the most dangerous option of all, since component
technology moves so quickly. Those who choose to stand still now could find
that it's almost impossible to catch up later. You can't blame developers
for getting frustrated with the entire situation as they watch the factions
of component development fight it out.

COMPONENTS EVERYWHERE
Microsoft's Network OLE and the OMG's CORBA are competing to distribute
components on your network

By:
TOM R. HALFHILL AND SALVATORE SALAMONE

Stick an object on a network and assume that applications will be able to
use it. The idea is simple in the broadest sense, but the devil is in the
details. So far, nobody has been able to come out with a standard way of
dealing with distributed components that addresses enough of the problems
and has enough support to take hold. Two standards stand a chance.
   OLE may be the 800-pound gorilla of desktop-component technologies, but
it's more of a rhesus monkey in the jungle of distributed components. To
gain bulk, the upcoming Network OLE will use remote procedure calls (RPCs)
to let companies scatter components throughout the enterprise and enable
them to communicate.
   But there's already a gorilla in this territory: the Object Management
Group's (OMG's) Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard.
It tackles the same problems, but its object-request-broker (ORB)
architecture gives developers greater programming-language and OS freedoms
than OLE. And with technical roots that extend back to 1990, CORBA is a
specification that's further along the evolutionary path.
   So which one is for you? Like all other complex questions, the answer is
a hedge: It depends. But to make your decision, you need to understand how
Network OLE and CORBA work.

Network OLE
   Due in 1996-97 with the next version of Windows NT, Network OLE adds a
third tier to your client/server network. It lets you encapsulate the
critical code that contains your business rules into relatively lightweight
components that you can distribute across the network as you see fit. For
security, performance, or upgrading ease, you may locate the components on
client systems, enterprise servers, or special component servers. Thus, the
third tier can be more conceptual than a physical entity.
   A three-tier architecture requires a mechanism that keeps track of
distributed components and lets clients access them. Network OLE has just
such a feature.
   Network OLE is an OS layer that insulates applications and components
from the hairy details of network transports and component tracking. If it
works as Microsoft is promising, it will be transparent to users and
translucent to network administrators. Users won't need to know whether the
OLE objects they're using reside on their local machines or on other
networked systems. Administrators will decide where to install the objects,
and Network OLE will maintain the invisible links even if the administrator
moves or updates the objects (see ``Extending the Reach of OLE,'' November
1994 BYTE).

Priming the Pump
   Microsoft is doing two things to pave the way for Network OLE. First, it
is urging software developers to support OLE 2.0 in all new software. The
more OLE 2.0 features that programs support, the more benefits they'll
automatically inherit under Network OLE. Second, Microsoft is offering a
glimpse of what's to come.
   A new remote automation mechanism in Visual Basic 4.0 (VB4) Enterprise
Edition lets you build and deploy distributable objects (they're called OLE
automation servers). You can scatter these objects across a network and
call their methods from any client application that's an OLE automation
controller. Some examples of OLE automation controllers are Microsoft's
Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, and VB4; Borland's Visual dBase and
Paradox for Windows; Novell's Quattro Pro; and Powersoft's PowerBuilder.
   Until now, the only way you could use OLE over a network was to
dynamically link or embed OLE objects in your applications. In other words,
you could manually embed an Excel chart in a Word document if Word was on
the client machine and Excel was on a file server, but you couldn't write a
Word macro that called Excel's OLE methods on the file server. VB4 provides
the remote automation mechanism that lets the OLE controller application
call the remote OLE object's automation methods programmatically.
   For example, today you could write a VB program that sends 10 values to
a copy of Excel on the same computer and ask Excel to compute and return
the sum of those values. But you can't do that if the copies of VB and
Excel are on different machines on a network. With VB4 remote automation,
you can.
   Remote automation uses a new OLE proxy on the client machine and a
remote automation manager on the server (which could be a traditional
server, another client machine, or a component server). When a client
application calls the methods of an OLE automation object, it first checks
the OLE object registry (see the figure ``Stepping Stone to Network OLE'').
The registry knows whether the called object is on a local machine or a
remote machine. If the object is on a local machine, the request passes
through the regular OLE proxy to the object.
   If the called object is remote, the new OLE proxy handles the request.
It translates the OLE call into a Windows NT-standard RPC and sends it over
the network to the server. At that end, the remote automation manager
translates the RPC back into a regular OLE call and forwards it to the OLE
object. OLE callbacks are handled the same way.
   It's not quite as cool as full-blown Network OLE, but it's enough to
whet your appetite. Network OLE will be more robust and will offer many
more features. For example, it will work with the NT file system to
automatically keep track of objects if you relocate them on the network. It
will also let you link applications and objects created with any
development tools, not just VB4. (Technically, VB4 makes this possible, but
Microsoft's licensing agreement requires that one of the OLE objects must
be VB or created with VB.)
   The advantages of a three-tier architecture will become more obvious as
the technology becomes more widespread. By delivering a preview of Network
OLE in VB4--and by laying the groundwork with OLE 2.0 in today's
software--Microsoft is building a solid distributed-objects strategy for
the future.

Technology Tango
   Network OLE isn't the only technology to consider. The OMG recently
released CORBA 2.0, a revision of the original CORBA specifications. But
what happens to CORBA in the next year--especially how the standard evolves
to enhance portability and interoperability--could hold the key to the
future of componentware.
   ORBs are the cornerstones of the CORBA architecture. In a distributed
environment, they provide a common platform for objects to request data and
services on the client side and for servers to send their responses back to
the client objects (see the figure ``Objects in Orbit''). ORBs hide
interoperability details from the client and server objects, so such issues
as what programming language and OS each object uses don't stand in the way
of their communication. Thanks to ORBs, a client object doesn't even need
to know the location of its server counterpart, which may be on the same
machine or on a computer thousands of miles away. It's the ORB's job to be
the matchmaker.
   A client application makes a request for some kind of information. The
request has two basic parts: an object reference for a particular object
and the action the object is to perform. The client creates this request by
calling stub routines specific to an object (through the interface
definition language, or IDL, interface) or by constructing the request
dynamically. Either way, the client sees the same interface regardless of
what language the object is written in or where it lives on the network.
   The stub routine (or dynamic request) routes the request to the ORB. The
ORB is responsible for maintaining mechanisms to find the requested object,
preparing the object to receive the request, and communicating the data
inside the request. During the request, the ORB locates the appropriate
object implementation, transmits the parameters of the request, and
transfers control to the object. Once the object is done with the request,
it passes control back to the ORB along with the results. The ORB then
passes control back to the client application.
   CORBA 2.0 built on this architecture and addressed some of the
shortcomings in the original version. Specifically, it includes bridging
technology, which provides for communication between ORBs, and an optional
Distributed Computing Environment-based (DCE) interoperability scheme.
CORBA 2.0 also adopted TCP/IP as the standard communications protocol to
help ensure out-of-the-box interoperability between different vendors'
TCP/IP implementations of CORBA. The DCE can also be used as a way for
objects to communicate, but it is an option that users must choose to
implement. These enhancements extend the portability and interoperability
of the standard.
   CORBA is part of the larger Object Management Architecture (OMA), which
includes CORBAservices and CORBAfacilities. CORBAservices provide basic
operations, such as object class management, instance management, and
security. CORBAfacilities offer link management, print services, and
E-mail. Such facilities will help extend the portability of CORBA into such
areas as groupware and transaction monitors.
   In some ways, what is happening to CORBA is analogous to what has
happened to network OSes (NOSes) in recent years. When they were
introduced, many NOSes offered such basic services as print and file
services. But for those NOSes that moved from being aimed at the workgroup
to being honed for the enterprise network, developers added more
capabilities, such as directory and security services.
   In a similar way, the OMG has added services to CORBA and expanded the
ways users access them. For example, the proposed licensing service lets a
CORBA developer use the Object Licensing Service for monitoring and
possibly metering an object's usage. This lets users write a program that
tracks an object's usage and bills customers based on the number of times
they accessed an object and how long an object was used each time. Such a
service goes beyond the basic functional interoperability that is required
in object-oriented applications development.

Looking Ahead
   Back to the jungle. For better or worse, OLE is the object technology
that dominates most desktop-development efforts today. As Microsoft extends
OLE's reach into a distributed environment, the combination of the client
stranglehold with strong network services could create an insurmountable
mountain for CORBA.
   A possible compromise scenario is an object-development environment,
where the desktop is dominated by OLE and the backbone is CORBA. Ideally,
there would be a simple way to link the Windows desktop with objects
residing on Unix and OS/2 servers. Today, companies such as Expersoft (San
Diego), Iona Technologies (Dublin, Ireland), Genesis Development (West
Chester, PA), and Visual Edge Software (Montreal) offer products designed
to bridge the OLE-to-CORBA gap.
   However, all these solutions are proprietary. The OMG is working on an
OLE/CORBA specification that would standardize the process in which a user
would be able to carry out an operation on a CORBA object from OLE-enabled
applications. Last summer, the OMG received over a dozen vendor proposals
on how to close the OLE-to-CORBA link. Basically, the OMG's efforts could
lead to the definition of an OLE/COM (Component Object Model)-to-CORBA
gateway that provides a mapping between COM and OMA.
   In the meantime, developers are left to watch the standards evolve and
to bet development resources on a large gorilla or a committee-designed
camel.

Visual Basic remote automation uses a remote OLE proxy that converts OLE

An automation manager translates the RPCs back into normal OLE calls and

Object request brokers (ORBs) act as a common platform for objects to
communicate. The client object routes a request through stub routines (via
the IDL interface) or as dynamic requests. The ORB finds the appropriate

object finishes acting on the request, the request goes back to the ORB,
which passes control back to the client object.

SERVER MANAGEMENT
Keeping a World Wide Web site healthy depends on your choice of Web server
and OS. Here are some interesting variations.

By:
JON UDELL

The sun never sets on The BYTE Site. Once I launched it, I became
responsible for a service that a growing international clientele expects to
be able to use 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
   How do you keep this kind of service humming? Two crucial variables--the
World Wide Web server application and the OS--govern your management
options. Here's a look at some combinations I've tried so far.

NCSA Server, BSD/OS
   The most manageable Web servers run on Unix (or Unix-like) OSes.
Consider the Dell PC on which I've been running the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) server + BSD/OS combination. It's a
headless box; I borrowed the monitor long ago and never returned it. Why
bother? A telnet window on another workstation--located on the local
Ethernet or anywhere on the Internet--is fully equivalent to the Dell's
missing console. I can dial BIX from a DOS subnotebook, telnet to the Dell,
stop the NCSA server, launch EMACS, edit the server's configuration files,
and restart the server.
   If the server and its related utilities were GUI-oriented rather than
command-line-oriented applications, they could export the same control
capabilities using the X Window System. You'd need more than a DOS
subnotebook to run the X server, of course. But the point is that location
doesn't matter in Unix computing: You can do just about anything from
anywhere.
   A healthy Web server needs to be running on a healthy system, of course,
so the scope of the management task goes beyond just monitoring the httpd
(the Hypertext Transport Protocol daemon) itself. You also have to pay
attention to ftp and mail services; organize, prune, and back up files; and
read and analyze system logs.
   Unix doesn't make any of this easy for a novice, and mastering the
seemingly endless number of interactions between shell scripts and
configuration files requires a huge investment of time and effort. But
advanced users leverage that investment by packaging routine management
tasks into shell scripts and scheduling them to run periodically.
Automation and remote access are the keys to effective system management.
Unix shines in both departments.

Netscape Commerce Server, Windows NT
   Telnet and EMACS get the job done, but should you really have to depend
on 25-year-old character-mode tools? A number of second-generation Web
servers, led by Netscape's, export management interfaces as Web
applications. The Netscape server's administrative tool set has two parts:
a collection of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) forms that document the
tasks a web master can perform--creating a user database, viewing a log,
securing a directory--and a corresponding set of Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) programs that perform those tasks.
   When you install a Netscape server, you really install two servers
attached to different TCP/IP ports. The public server,
http://www.byte.com:665/ in my case, presents a home page. The
administrative server, which I set up at http://www.byte.com:666/, presents
an authentication dialog box and then a page of management options.
   Why a separate server? One key administrative task is stopping and
starting the primary server. Because the Netscape server's process control
depends on CGI, you might be able to shut down the primary server using its
own CGI mechanism, but you'd be sawing off the branch you're sitting on.
   Because it leverages Web technology, Netscape's server administration
enjoys the same portability as all other Web applications. Local and remote
X, Microsoft Windows, and Mac browsers all run the administrative
applications identically. On the server side, the CGI wrapper provides the
same capabilities on any server OS. For example, I ran the Netscape
Commerce Server on Windows NT, which lacks the remote access features that
Unix provides. No matter. A user of Netscape's administrative tool set
doesn't have to know what OS underlies the server.

WebStar, Mac System 7.5
   A new member of The BYTE Network Project's family of Web servers is the
Apple Internet Server, a Power Mac 6100/60 running StarNine's WebStar.
Currently this machine is running as an intranet server--it's connected
only to the BYTE LAN, not to the Internet. I've mirrored the contents of
The BYTE Site onto the WebStar server, and I'm now using it to collaborate
with BYTE's design department on a redesign of the site's graphics.
   WebStar's administrative application handles the usual chores: defining
users and groups, configuring logging and suffix mapping, and tweaking
communications buffers. It communicates with the WebStar server entirely by
means of Apple Events. This means that on a LAN, you can administer WebStar
from any Mac, since Apple Events readily cross machine boundaries on an
AppleTalk network. This scheme won't work on an IP network, however. This
is because even with Open Transport, Apple's latest transport-independent
technology, core Apple networking services, such as file sharing and Apple
Events, can't yet ride on IP.
   What to do? Eric Zelenka from StarNine pointed me to a CGI application
called RemoteAdmin.acgi (not shipped with the Apple Internet Server, but
available from http://www.starnine.com). It exports an HTML forms interface
to WebStar's administrative functions.
   Like Netscape's approach, this arrangement affords both remote access
and portability. Any browser, whether Mac-based or not, can now control a
WebStar server over the Internet. The browser speaks HTML to
RemoteAdmin.acgi, which in turn sends Apple Events to WebStar (see the
figure ``Managing WebStar on an AppleTalk Network'' above). Because the
System 7.5 Finder can itself be driven by Apple Events, it should be
possible to write a more ambitious CGI application that can manage files on
a Mac server, operate Control Panels, and even restart a Mac.

WebSite, Windows NT
   O'Reilly and Associates' WebSite provides a suite of Win32 management
tools, including Server Admin, which controls security settings, data-type
mappings, and transaction logging. It's really just an interface to the
Windows NT (or Windows 95) registry where WebSite stores the values of its
control variables.
   Because the NT and Windows 95 registry editors are remote procedure call
(RPC) enabled--that is, you can point one machine's copy of RegEdit at
another's registry, even across the Internet--WebSite is as capable of the
same sort of limited remote management as any Windows 95 or NT application
that stores configuration data in the registry. To make RegEdit work across
the Internet, add a line like

192.168.1.1 MYSERVER

to the WINDOWS\LMHOSTS file. This line maps the target machine's IP address
to a NetBIOS name that Windows networking services, such as RPC, require.
(See ``Wide-Area Windows Networking,'' January 1994 BYTE, for more on
NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP.)
   This setup works, but it's slow over dial-up IP because RegEdit uses a
slow link inefficiently. To improve performance and simplify the interface,
WebSite's designers made Server Admin RPC-enabled. From my Windows 95
machine at home, I can tweak WebSite registry values on an NT server at
BYTE over the Internet.
   But while Server Admin works well in RPC mode, I've had poor luck using
another tool, WebView, to remotely scan The BYTE Site for broken hypertext
links. With WebSite, as with Windows NT in general, RPC-based remote
administration is a hit-or-miss affair. You must specifically modify each
application that exports a control interface through RPC, and even then
your mileage varies, depending on the characteristics of the administrative
application and its data.
   So what's the general solution for remote management of NT systems and
applications? Enter WinFrame.

Purveyor, WebSite, and WinFrame
   Citrix Systems' WinFrame transforms Windows NT into a multiuser OS with
a flexible and efficient remote GUI. For the past month, WinFrame has been
running on one of The BYTE Site's development servers (a dual-processor
Intergraph TD-4), and it has revolutionized how I develop and manage the
site.
   Check out the screen on page 107 showing The BYTE Site's WinFrame
command center. You're looking at my home Windows 95 PC on a 28.8-Kbps
dial-up link to the Internet. The window titled ``TD4'' is a projection of
the Intergraph server's console, and it could just as easily appear on a
LAN- or dial-up-connected Windows 3.1 or DOS machine, or on one of the new
WinFrame-aware terminals from Wyse.
   There are a lot of things going on at once in this window. A detailed
description follows.
   WebView. The WinFrame server is running WebSite. In theory, I can scan
its web from home using WebView's RPC capability. In practice, this process
works faster and more reliably when I run it directly on the server and
export its user interface using WinFrame.
   Perl. The MS-DOS icon represents an instance of Perl running a script
that summarizes the IP addresses in the production server's log.
   Performance Monitor. Here I'm watching two Web-server processes: WebSite
on the WinFrame and, through the WinFrame system, Process Software's
Purveyor on the production Windows NT/Alpha machine. The WinFrame box can
see the Alpha/NT box's Performance Monitor, because vanilla NT's
Performance Monitor is RPC-enabled.
   Until I installed WinFrame, I couldn't remotely monitor the Purveyor
process because I couldn't directly access the Purveyor box's Performance
Monitor. Ditto for Event Viewer, shown here watching both systems' event
logs. Ditto also for Registry Editor, Server Manager, and User Manager.
   File Manager. With megabytes of log data and reports accumulating every
day, my server management routine involves slinging a lot of files around.
With the two servers' file systems cross-mounted, I can run plain old NT
File Manager on WinFrame's remote console and effectively manage both.
   Users of Purveyor 1.1 will especially like being able to use File
Manager remotely. Although 1.1 exports all its Control Panel functions to
remote Web browsers by means of CGI/HTML, you still have to use a File
Manager extension to set permissions on uniform resource locators (URLs).
Purveyor on Windows NT can't export that function to remote administrators;
Purveyor on WinFrame can.
   Control Panel. Under Unix, GUI administrative tools are just wrappers
around more-primitive command-line tools; that's why you can manage Unix
remotely using just telnet. NT's versions of these tools are natively
graphical, so they're easy to use, provided you're sitting at the console.
But even if you use a third-party telnet on NT, you can't stop,
reconfigure, and restart the system services that the Control Panel
controls. WinFrame exports control over these vital services to the remote
administrator running Windows 95, Windows 3.1, or even lowly DOS.

Back to the Future
   So far I've described only the benefits of Windows NT remote control.
WinFrame is currently the only player in this field. None of the Windows
3.x remote-control programs has yet stepped up to the plate, nor has
Microsoft's own Systems Management Server. When they do, will Citrix wind
up on the bench?
   I don't think so. WinFrame's remote GUI is a godsend for the manager of
an NT-based Web server, but its multiuser dimension makes it much more than
just an NT remote-control product. The Citrix vision of Web-based computing
represents a serious alternative to both the existing CGI/HTML standard and
the distributed-component architectures currently being advanced by Sun and
Netscape (Java) and Microsoft (Blackbird).
   Consider the suite of Web-based tools I'm now writing to support
administration of the Virtual Press Room (see ``Perl Magic,'' December
BYTE). First-generation Web technology dictates a CGI/HTML solution. That's
doable, but if you've been following my CGI adventures, you know that
mimicking a live GUI using a series of forms-based transactions can get
hairy.
   Second-generation Web technology (the Java/Blackbird approach) promises
to export the live GUI through the Web as a dynamically acquired component.
Sounds great, but I won't deliver tools next month based on Java or
Blackbird; these technologies aren't ready yet.
   WinFrame, in contrast, relies on old-fashioned development tools, such
as Visual Basic and Delphi. And it updates the even-more-old-fashioned
mainframe- or X-like model of computing, enabling Visual Basic/Delphi
applications to run on a multiuser host with local access to data while
displaying on Windows terminals.
   Too retro for your taste? By the time you read this, Citrix will have
shown a Web browser that displays off-the-shelf Windows and Win32
applications running on a WinFrame host located across the Internet. I'm
bullish on Java and Blackbird, too, but there are a lot of Windows
applications kicking around, and Citrix's approach ought to make you stop
and think.
   WinFrame also pours fuel onto the NT-versus-Unix debate. John
Montgomery, who edits this column, neatly frames the issue this way: ``NT
gets you from zero to 60 more easily than Unix, but you need Unix to get
from 60 to 100.'' I agree. And now that I've experienced the power of
Citrix's Unix-like extensions, I'll never want to settle for vanilla NT.

3-D WITHOUT RISC
Intergraph's TDZ-400 puts two Pentium Pros to work speeding 3-D graphics

By:
DAVE ROWELL


In 1994, Intergraph gambled that it could abandon RISC for multiprocessor
Intel boxes and still get 3-D-workstation performance. Now comes the payoff
with the Pentium Pro. Intel's new chip delivers RISC-level performance and
x86 compatibility, too.
   The 150-MHz Pentium Pro is fast; our BYTEmark CPU test (32-bit code)
shows its integer performance is 2.1 times that of a 90-MHz Pentium, and
its floating-point performance is 2.6 times faster. The 200-MHz Pentium
Pro, announced after we completed these tests, should be as fast--or faster
than--any RISC chip except Digital Equipment's 21164 Alpha. Intergraph
plans to ship a 200-MHz version of its TDZ workstation before 1996, with
prices $2500 higher per CPU than the 150-MHz models.
   We tested the first Pentium Pro system, a $24,195 Intergraph TDZ-400
with two 150-MHz Pentium Pro CPUs, 64 MB of RAM, a 2-GB SCSI hard drive,
and a 21-inch monitor. The systems come with Windows NT 3.51, a PCI-bus GLZ
graphics card, built-in Ethernet, PC Card slots, a quad-speed CD-ROM drive,
and a keyboard with microphone and stereo speakers. The TDZ-300 has a
single Pentium Pro, the TDZ-400 has two, and the deskside TDZ-600 has four.
The new models carry slightly higher prices than the old Pentium line
(around $1000 more for comparable TDZ configurations with 150-MHz Pentium
Pros).
   Our test configuration used Intergraph's newest 3-D card, the GLZ1T--a
GLZ1 accelerator with an added texture-processing board. In addition to 12
MB of video RAM (for double-buffered, 1152- by 864-pixel graphics with
24-bit z-buffering), the card has 8 MB of memory for storing texture maps.
It has the same $8000 price as the 24-MB GLZ2 we tested in the TDZ-40 (see
``3-D Graphics Go Zoom,'' September BYTE). All GLZ cards support the OpenGL
3-D API under NT.

Exceeds Expectations
   We were surprised by just how much the Pentium Pro boosted the TDZ-400's
3-D graphics performance. The TDZ-400 ran the OpenGL Performance
Characterization Committee's Viewperf 3.0 test 2.5 to 13 times faster than
the TDZ-40 with two 100-MHz Pentiums and ran the rendering tests with
Bentley Systems' MicroStation three to four times faster (not shown).
   Based on the BYTEmark tests, the floating-point speed difference between
a 100-MHz Pentium and a 150-MHz Pentium Pro is 134 percent (2.3 times),
while the GLZ1T's texture processing provides only a 15 percent boost
(based on Intergraph's tests). Intergraph attributes the gain to the
Pentium Pro's floating-point speed, better memory architecture (i.e.,
interleaving, an integrated L2 cache, and a more efficent CPU bus), and
improved OpenGL drivers for its GLZ cards. Intergraph's Mogle, a
multithreading OpenGL driver for the MicroStation, provided a 5 percent to
50 percent performance boost by putting both processors into play.
   Intergraph cast its lot with promising standards: x86 compatibility,
PCI, Windows NT, and OpenGL. For 3-D visual computing applications like
mechanical CAD, it's a winning combination.

NEW MEDIA IS THE MESSAGE
The latest breed of PowerPC-based Macs integrates sound, speech, video,
telephony, conferencing, graphics--and an affordable price

By:
RICK GREHAN

The new line of Power Macs exemplifies Apple's market pitch: easy-to-use,
fully featured multimedia systems right out of the box. The latest
triad--the Power Mac 7200, 7500, and 8500--come equipped with integrated
audio, video, networking, telephony, CD-ROM, conferencing, and speech. As
you go higher in the line, the bundled support gets richer.
   Perhaps the best pitch of all is the pricing. These Power Macs, with
their healthy collection of built-in features and prices ranging from $1949
(for the 90-MHz 7200 with 8 MB of RAM) to $4199 (for the 120-MHz 8500 with
16 MB of RAM), will compete well against even the most aggressively priced
Intel-based machines.

Common Denominators
   All three Power Macs in this group share a remarkable number of similar
features. Even though some of the similarities are architectural (all have
three Peripheral Component Interconnect [PCI] slots, for example), most of
them fulfill multimedia and communications requirements.
   All models include stereo-audio input and output ports. The digital side
of the systems' audio-generation capabilities boasts 16 bits of resolution
and a sampling rate up to 44.1 kHz (CD-quality sound). On the
communications side, all models include 10Base-T and AAUI-15 Ethernet
connectors. And all models include high-speed DMA serial ports, compatible
with GeoPort telephony/fax hardware.
   As usual, Apple paid close attention to the design of the boxes
themselves. For example, the 7200's top is held on by hidden latch releases
under the front bezel. Release those, and the top slides off to reveal the
power supply, disk drives, and a hinged inner cover that holds the PCI
cards in place. The memory slots are beneath the drive units--a position
that at first appears impossible to get at without major disassembly. But
the entire drive and power supply unit is also hinged, and it swings up to
provide easy access to any corner of the motherboard.
   Of course, hardware is only part of the story. If there's Windows
software that you can't live without, all three models can run SoftWindows
from Insignia Systems. Both the 7500 and 8500 models' impressive software
bundles include PlainTalk (the combined text-to-speech and
speech-recognition engine) and Apple Media Conference (a QuickTime
application that incorporates videoconferencing, whiteboard collaboration,
and more).
   We tested Media Conference by hooking a Power Mac 8500 to a 7500 across
10Base-T Ethernet (see the screen on page 114). The video was jerky but
usable, and we could relay messages and freehand sketches on the shared
whiteboard. Unfortunately, application sharing is not supported, and the
audio quality was poor.

Power Mac 7200
   The low-end model of the series, the Power Mac 7200, houses a 75- or
90-MHz PowerPC 601 processor. Memory starts at 8 MB, but you can expand
that to 256 MB. Similarly, a baseline 7200 houses only a 500-MB SCSI drive,
but an internal expansion bay supports another SCSI device (and, remember,
there's always the rear SCSI connector for external drives).
   The 7200's graphics system is built around a 64-bit data path to the
video memory (a standard feature on the other models as well), and you can
expand the baseline 1 MB of video memory to 4 MB for up to 1280- by
1024-pixel resolution (or 1024 by 768 in 24-bit color).

Power Mac 7500
   Although the 7500 system we tested included a PowerPC 601 processor
running at 100 MHz, you can upgrade the system to a 100-MHz 604 processor
via a swappable CPU daughtercard. (A 604 has a significant performance
advantage over a similarly clocked 601, thanks to the 604's increased
number of execution units and dynamic branch prediction.)
   The chassis of the 7500 is virtually indistinguishable from that of the
7200, and it shares the 7200's easy access to internals. However, the 7500
incorporates hardware beyond that of the 7200, including an S-video input
connector and an internal DAV (digital audio/video) connector that accepts
video compression/decompression cards. (The 7500 also has a composite video
input.) The beefier processing power of the 7500 supports real-time video
playthrough, as well as video capture (up to 320 by 240 pixels of NTSC at
15 frames per second).

Power Mac 8500
   The 8500 is a desktop minitower design, as opposed to the
``monitor-stand'' design of the 7500 and 7200. Inside beats the heart of a
PowerPC 604 with a pulse rate of 120 MHz. You can upgrade the 8500's system
memory from its base of 16 MB to a dizzying 512 MB.
   While the 7500's composite and S-video connectors are input only, the
8500 adds output connectors for both. The 8500 also supports video
playthrough and capture. Capture rates for the 8500 are 25 fps with NTSC
(but the documentation warns that you'll need a 2-GB hard drive for that).

PowerPC Performance
   The models that we received from Apple all had 256 KB of L2 cache
installed. The 7200 came with 16 MB of RAM and a 500-MB hard drive, while
both the 7500 and 8500 had 24 MB of RAM and a 1-GB hard drive. We compiled
the BYTEmark native-mode benchmarks using version 7 of Metrowerks'
CodeWarrior and ran them on each system, being careful to set 604
instruction ordering on the 8500.
   All three models performed well in the integer BYTEmark tests, but less
so in the floating-point tests. The 90-MHz 7200 turned in an integer index
of 1.05 and an FPU index of 0.64--what you might expect from a 90-MHz
Pentium with a throttled FPU. The 100-MHz 7500 scored 1.18 on the integer
tests and 0.71 on the FPU tests. The 120-MHz 604-based 8500 produced an
integer index of 2.1 and an FPU index of 1.4, putting its integer score on
a par with that of a 150-MHz P6 system.

The Attraction
   These are desktop machines, not server boxes you'd want to hang drives
from and slide into a closet. For the price, all these systems provide
excellent performance, good expandability, and a generous serving of
prepackaged peripherals: CD-ROM, stereo audio, video ports, network
hardware, and so forth. The only people we'd advise against buying one of
these Power Macs is anyone whose business involves a great deal of
number-crunching.
   But for those looking for an easy-to-set-up home machine, or a workhorse
multimedia system for the office, these Power Macs can definitely do the
job.

ULTRAFAST ULTRASPARCS
With an innovative crossbar and multimedia architecture, the first 64-bit
UltraSparc workstations thrust the spotlight back on Sun

By:
BEN SMITH

Sun's highly anticipated 64-bit UltraSparc processor has arrived in two new
high-performance workstations: the Ultra I Model 140 and Ultra I Creator3D
Model 170E. The stakes are high for a company that has lost significant
ground in the workstation market to sexy systems from Hewlett-Packard and
Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI). But with the Ultra's innovative
packet-switched crossbar and specialized Visual Instruction Set (VIS), Sun
has a strong hand to play. Although its benchmark numbers are nowhere near
those of a Digital Equipment Alpha running Microsoft NT, the 170E easily
outperforms everything else that runs the Solaris OS on a single
processor.
   For this review, we tested the Ultra I Model 170E, the higher-end,
167-MHz system with 64 MB of RAM standard. The less elaborate Model 140
hosts a 143-MHz UltraSparc processor and includes a standard 32 MB of RAM
(see the table ``Sun Specifications'' at right for a list of standard
features for both models).
   Both systems are enclosed in the same compact chassis, about the size of
a deep-dish pizza box (16 by 17 by 4 inches), and both models support two
RS-423/RS-232 connectors, a parallel port, a CD-ROM drive, and a 3 1/2-inch
floppy drive. Sun had not finalized pricing at press time, but the Model
170E will list for under $30,000; the Model 140 will come in under
$20,000.

By the Numbers
   According to our benchmark testing, the 167-MHz Ultra 170E performs at
roughly 1.8 times the speed of a 90-MHz Pentium. But because the BYTEmark
test suite does not take advantage of the UltraSparc's specialized
instruction set, the benchmark results do not tell the whole story. And you
really need a shared-memory multiprocessor system to fully appreciate the
new UltraSparc Port Architecture (UPA), a distributed-arbitration
multimaster crossbar (see the Technology Focus box for details).
   When we ran real-world applications--applying special-effect filters to
large graphics images, rendering complex texture maps, and displaying
high-motion MPEG video clips--the performance advantages of the UltraSparc
architecure became obvious. The 64-bit VIS versions of these kinds of
graphics and video applications will realize another order-of-magnitude
boost in performance. Even without software recompilation, the Ultra I
delivers an extremely fast platform for graphics applications.

UltraGraphics
   The UltraSparc processor includes a set of dedicated single-cycle
instructions to enhance performance. VIS dramatically cuts the number of
clock cycles required for graphical and video operations.
   For example, VIS includes an array operation for slicing 3-D volumetric
data. This operation, accomplished with a single UltraSparc instruction,
typically requires 24 instructions, according to Sun. Other specialized
one-cycle instructions support such operations as conversion instructions
for packing and expanding pixel data, arithmetic instructions for
manipulating large graphics images, and fixed-point compare instructions
for examining the z-buffer during 3-D rendering.
   The UltraSparc uses two sets of registers to process graphical commands:
The integer registers crunch address calculations for the image data, while
the floating-point registers handle manipulation of the image data. This
division of labor deploys the maximum number of registers and augments
instruction parallelism.
   The UltraSparc also supports a wide range of video-compression
algorithms, including H.261 (the standard compression algorithm for H.320
videoconferencing), MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, and JPEG. Again, the UltraSparc
supports specific functions for motion estimation, the most common
operation used for video compression. The result is outstanding
full-motion, full-screen video playback without any external
video-acceleration hardware (see the table ``Features of the Ultra I'' for
more of the processor's features).
   The Ultra graphics board does not have special-purpose 3-D graphics
engines, such as you would find in SGI systems. But the 24-bit RAMDAC and
frame-buffer controllers, combined with VIS operations and UPA data
transfers, generate the kind of 3-D effects that you would expect to see
only on high-end 3-D boards, such as the SGI Reality Engine. We created
smooth fly-throughs of complex 3-D objects with Gouraud shading, lighting,
depth cueing, and even texture mapping.
   Of course, your applications can't tap the Ultra's graphics enhancements
until the specific 3-D modeling libraries are compiled and linked for the
Ultra architecture. But all your UltraSparc-based systems will benefit once
you've made that initial investment. With workstations that support
dedicated 3-D processors, you have to budget for that specialized 3-D
hardware each time you invest in a new system.

Long Life and Good Fortune
   With regard to raw number crunching, Ultras may not be peers to Alphas.
But when evaluated as graphics workstations rath-er than as compute
servers, these systems have no peer in price/performance.
   With applications that take advantage of the VIS instructions, such as
CAD and Photoshop, the Sun Ultra I Creator3D Model 170E performs well above
any other single-processor workstation currently available.

BEST LOW-COST PRINTER ON THE LAN
HP's new LaserJet 5Si MX will be the printer of choice for large
workgroups

By:
DAVE ROWELL

Network printers at the low end of the price range are getting faster. Case
in point: Hewlett-Packard's new LaserJet 5Si MX. It's fast, and it comes
with some great features for printing on the LAN. The 5Si MX's print-engine
speed is 24 pages per minute (ppm). Its predecessor, the 4Si MX, has a
17-ppm engine. The 5Si MX holds 1100 sheets of paper, can handle 11- by
17-inch paper, and comes with bidirectional management software. This
software supports real-time monitoring and control of the printer by
administrators as well as users. All this for $400 less than the 4Si MX.
   We tested the LaserJet 5Si MX on a mixed NetWare 3.1 network with Macs
and Windows-based PCs. We ran NSTL's network-printer benchmarks and
compared the results to other recently tested network printers (see ``12
Network Printers Set the Pace,'' November 1995 BYTE). Our testing revealed
that although the new LaserJet didn't have the highest numbers in any one
category, it consistently ran near the top in all categories (speed, print
quality, features, and usability). As a result, the LaserJet 5Si MX
produced an overall score higher than any printer in that group.
   The 5Si MX has a slightly improved print-quality score over the 4Si MX
(both are 600-dpi printers) but ranks considerably higher in features,
usability, and speed. HP's new LaserJet is fastest in its price class. In
fact, it's competitive with the more expensive 30- to 32-ppm printers,
although its 100,000-page monthly duty cycle is still only half as high.
   Options include a 2000-sheet input tray ($1299), a mailbox with eight
100-sheet bins ($1889) for separating print jobs, a duplexing unit ($669),
and an envelope feeder ($549).
   If you don't need a direct network connection and PostScript, you can
consider the LaserJet 5Si (no MX) for $3499. It lacks the MX's 350-KBps
JetDirect Ethernet/Local Talk card and PostScript SIMM, and it has 4 MB of
RAM instead of 12 MB.

Cool Software
   HP has upgraded the JetAdmin software so that it now provides easy
network configuration and management, including installing printer drivers
for users over the network. With bidirectional printer communications, you
can now track print jobs over the LAN in real time, getting such details as
where the job is in the queue, how much of the job is complete, or where it
will be output.
   Bidirectional drivers adjust to configuration changes automatically, so
you always know what type of paper is in each of the 5Si's size- and
capacity-sensing trays. With easy configuration, slick software interface,
and neat new features like booklet printing and gray-scale watermarks, this
printer is fun to use. If you're looking for a faster network printer that
won't keep you from balancing that budget, check out the 5Si MX. It's the
best in its class.

NEW AND IMPROVED
The LaserJet 5Si MX beats the 4Si MX in every way. We derived scores using
NSTL test and evaluation methodology. Quality, features, and usability
scores are scaled to a perfect 10.

TEXTURE DETAILS

Texture mapping adds realism to 3-D displays by draping 2-D patterns, such
as wood grain or a Landsat image, over 3-D surfaces. Ideally, it adjusts
the patterns for perspective and surface shading. More capable workstations
keep texture maps readily available in dedicated memory within the graphics
subsystem. Texture mapping can then move quickly into a rendered image
without bogging down the host system. Several of Intergraph's GLZ graphics
cards, for example, store 8 or 32 MB of texture data and pipe it to the
image midway through the rendering process via a 64-bit, 256-MBps graphics
bus.
   Though fast, dedicated texture memory is costly and limits image size
for some applications. Storing texture data in system memory extends
texture storage. Using OpenGL texture-object extensions, Intergraph's
texture-processing hardware can store large texture maps in system memory
and use the dedicated texture memory as a cache, moving data between the
two areas over the relatively fast Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)
bus.

PLAINTALK

The recognition engine inside PlainTalk (which is bundled with the Power
Mac 7500 and 8500) gets better all the time. We ran some informal
experiments on it, testing its recognition tolerance. Even if we used fake
Italian, fake Russian, or genuine Southern American accents, PlainTalk
correctly identified its commands.
   The recognition engine is based on phones, context-sensitive rudimentary
sounds used in speech. (These rudimentary sounds are known as phonemes.)
Phones are context-sensitive in the sense of their phonetic usage. Hence,
the t in truck is one phone, while the t in bottle is a different phone.
   PlainTalk's phones are speaker independent. They are the composite of
500 speakers from North America, which has the effect of eliminating the
influence of accents. If our contrived Italian and Russian accent tests
were any indication, PlainTalk's recognition engine apparently works better
than its designers anticipated.

THE CROSSBAR: AN END TO INTERRUPTS

The Ultra uses a packet-switched crossbar instead of the more traditional
interrupt-driven bus. This design cross-connects many different subordinate
buses of varying widths and speeds.
   Conceptually, it's a multiplexed bus (i.e., multiple data transfers
occur simultaneously). In an interrupt- or control-line bus, only two
devices can communicate in one direction at one time. All other devices or
subordinate buses must wait until the bus controller handles their
requests. This design works well for single processors and single-tasking
(or cooperative multitasking) OSes, but it does not work well for
multiprocessor systems with intelligent subordinate systems.
   The packet-switched crossbar passes data from subsystem to subsystem via
18 small chips located near the memory bus on the motherboard. Each
connection to the crossbar supports its own buffering and can handle
different subordinate bus speeds and widths.
   The 64-byte cache size determines the size of the packets (the basic
element of transfer data). A 128-bit-wide subordinate bus will not degrade
to four fetches of 32 bits each just because the subordinate bus at the
other end of the switch is only 32 bits wide. The 32-bit circuit may take
four clock cycles to load its data, but the 128-bit circuit still consumes
the data in a single clock.
   While the smaller data path is loading (or unloading), the wider channel
can service other transfers. For that matter, other subsystems can carry on
communications even while data is moving between the first two. The
packet-switched crossbar solves the problem of bus contention as well as
the inefficiencies of connecting at varying data widths and speeds.

MIB MAKES LIFE EASIER FOR LAN MANAGERS

By:
SUSAN COLWELL

The LaserJet 5Si MX is one of the first printers to support the standard
SNMP management information base (MIB) for printers. To provide
administrators with a consistent means of managing LAN printers, the
Printer Working Group developed, and the Internet Engineering Task Force
accepted, the standard MIB in mid-1995.
   The standard MIB means that each printer will store status information
and respond to SNMP requests in a consistent manner through its SNMP agent
software. In the case of the LaserJet 5Si MX, the SNMP agent resides in the
upgradable firmware of the printer's JetDirect network card. The agent
software monitors network traffic directed at the printer, filters out SNMP
commands, and returns or sets values stored in the printer MIB to monitor
status or change printer configuration.
   To provide better response (asynchronous) to SNMP and other management
software, HP changed the LaserJet 5Si multifunction I/O port, creating a
separate channel for printer management (a datagram service). As a result,
you can still control the printer while it is receiving print
data--canceling a print job before it finishes, for example.

WEB SITES: DON'T BLINK
From your mind to the Web--it's frightfully easy to build an on-line
business. The only dangers: Timidity. Planning. Meetings.

By:
Raphael Needleman

I am in my office at BYTE's headquarters talking to my boss, publisher Dave
Egan. He is asking me about the Internet, about this site and that service,
grilling me with rapid-fire questions that are making it obvious to me that
even my best efforts to keep up with the state of the 'net are not enough.
Question, answer, question, answer. Finally I get frustrated and say, ``I
don't know! I can't keep up!'' I put my head down on my desk. And Dave says
to me, ``My boy,'' (Dave really talks like that when he thinks he knows
something you don't), ``My boy, that is the definition of opportunity.''
   I hate to say it (and I never will to Dave), but he is right. On the
Internet, business can transcend the physical world. Building equipment and
mailing reports gives way to simply posting bits on-line, and the basic
rules of commerce change dramatically. Have an idea? From your mind to the
'net--it's that simple. No factories, no offices, no heavy start-up costs
required. Take your idea, put it on-line, and see if it sticks.
   Some Web business ideas are lousy, of course. In fact, like most
small-business ventures, the majority of Web concepts will fail. But you
don't know until you try. We recently discovered, however, that there is
one way to guarantee the failure of an on-line venture: Wait on it.
   True story: We had a great idea. It was unique; it was hot. So we had
meetings, we drew up plans, we drafted proposals. Because we first wanted
to plan it perfectly, we did not build it. But by the time we were ready to
get moving, somebody else had come up with the same idea and implemented
it. We lost.
   We learned from that experience and have applied that knowledge to our
current on-line venture, our Web presence. The BYTE Site (www.byte.com)
changes daily. Sometimes the changes are subtle.
   In 1 hour, I watched our Webmeister, Jon Udell, implement and refine a
totally new interface on our search results page. He created a navigational
tool for lists that, in its broadest sense, is similar to a tabbed dialog
box--you really have to see it yourself to understand how well it works.
   Sometimes the changes are dramatic, as they are once a month when we
post selected stories from the latest issue for all the world to see. And
every now and then, we clean house completely, as we did in November, and
totally revamp and redesign the site.
   But the point is, we've learned. Jon doesn't seek endless planning
meetings before he improves the site. He just does it. The only limit to
our site's improvements is the speed at which we can think.
   And here's what we've thought up: It's called the Virtual Press Room.
Jon has been writing about this application for a few months in his monthly
feature, the Network Project. Briefly, VPR is an application running on our
Web server that lets people in the computer industry--the people who send
us baskets of paper press releases every day--submit their releases to us
electronically. The concept is simple: A vendor logs on to the VPR and
pastes the press release into an on-line form.
   Once that is done, a program running on our server full-text-indexes the
release and puts it in the database. Any of our editors, including those on
the road and in our satellite offices, can scan for releases by company,
product, technology area, and date.
   If you've visited the BYTE Site, you know that we already have two years
of BYTE magazine archived and fully searchable. We now index press releases
alongside our archive, so when you look for articles on a topic, you have
the option of also seeing the vendor-supplied press releases relevant to
your search. We think it's a pretty cool implementation of a simple but
powerful idea.
   But the important point is that we got this thing up and running quickly
and cleanly, without a lot of fuss, because we have a smart guy who likes
tinkering with the Web and who understands the business of BYTE's editorial
department. Jon will be changing and updating the BYTE Site, and the VPR
component of it, frequently. Fortunately, because the application runs
completely on our site, we won't have to send out masses of update disks to
all the people who regularly use it. We'll just improve the product as we
go. So don't blink.

SELF-SERVE INFORMATION
Fax-on-demand delivers Touch-Tone access to timely news and data.
Long-term, it can save labor and marketing costs.

By:
DAVID ESSEX AND STEVEN J. VAUGHAN-NICHOLS

I'll fax it right over,'' you say, and thus begins a solid 20 minutes of
wasted time: Find the document, stand in the fax line, dial the wrong fax
number, find the right one, stand in the line again, send the fax, go back
to your desk, and take the inevitable call: ``Could you fax that again? 
Our machine ate the last page.''
   There is a better way. It's called fax on demand (FOD), and it applies
to a number of new products that enable callers to request faxes directly
from your fax server. No matter what your business, if you get a lot of
calls requesting printed information, you should consider FOD.
   FOD systems deliver documents stored in a dedicated repository (and,
occasionally, corporate data that isn't normally stored in faxable formats,
such as PCX and TIFF). Callers can dial in from their fax machine's handset
and get documents returned during the same call, saving phone costs for the
sender. More typically, they choose documents and enter the fax number
using a Touch-Tone phone. The FOD system then transmits the requested
documents on a separate line.
   FOD systems for in-house use are often sold in turnkey form, with
preconfigured voice and fax boards already installed in a computer. You can
also put one together using Visual Basic-like development toolkits. We
looked at DOS-/Windows-based software that is also available in kit form
(i.e., the software vendor also sells voice and fax boards).

FOD Facts
   Conceptually, FOD systems are simple. The voice board receives DTMF
tones generated by the caller's handset and passes them to the FOD
software, which reads and plays back the appropriate voice messages stored
on the PC's hard drive. (None of the reviewed programs accepts pulses from
rotary dialers.) When the caller identifies a specific document, the FOD
software loads it and sends it to the fax board for transmission. The fax
board then transmits the document to the phone number specified by the
caller.
   To put the four FOD systems we tested on equal footing, we ran all our
tests on an IBM PS/1 57C, a 33-/66-MHz 486DX2 system with 700 MB of disk
space and 16 MB of RAM. The machine was equipped with a one-line Dialogic
D/41D voice card and a one-line GammaLink GammaFax CPi/100 fax card (Ibex
Technologies' FactsLine required a second Dialogic board). Two outgoing fax
lines is a more typical setup, but little is gained by testing the second
line, since the relevant queuing issues exist on a one-line system.
   To flood the system with requests, we made three calls in rapid
succession, requesting two one-page documents during each call. We measured
fax-throughput times for each pair of document transmissions and then
averaged the results. We sent all faxes to the same machine, a Ricoh RF
860. VP Express was slightly faster than the other programs at transmitting
faxes held in a queue, but the difference in performance among these
solutions was negligible.
   All four programs have some features in common. For starters, each is
best run on a dedicated machine. Even in these days of gigabyte-capacity
drives, disk-space requirements alone make putting FOD software on a user's
PC unrealistic. Also, FOD software doesn't get along well with other
programs. Almost all these programs specifically discourage the use of
memory management software, and with good reason: They don't work well--if
at all--with a memory manager loaded.
   None of these programs is easy to install. Be ready to spend at least
two days shaking out all the software conflicts and putting together a
decent voice-menu tree. Once our installation wars were over with, though,
each program performed well. All worked with the basic file formats
typically used in faxing--PCX, TIFF, and ASCII--without any trouble. Each
also proved reliable in the face of disconnections and other failures.

Copia International's FaxFacts
   All these programs were troublesome to install, but Copia
International's FaxFacts 5.0, which requires you to make directories in DOS
and manually invoke the installation routine for each program disk, took
the installation-complexity prize. Once in place, however, this MS-DOS
program worked well.
   FaxFacts comes with a Windows interface, but it limits you to printing
and viewing faxes and playing back voice messages. All the real action
happens from the program's MS-DOS interface.
   In our tests, we found FaxFacts to be a solid, reliable performer. For
example, you can call from one phone and have FaxFacts send a document
while you're still on the line. Still, if you want to make significant
changes to your setup, such as add-ing new menu items, you need to bring
the program down.
   FaxFacts also does a decent job of tracking its work, saving daily data
into dBase DBF-compatible files. However, to generate the best reports, you
might need to buy a dBase-compatible report writer. We found FaxFacts'
reporting module to be insufficiently detailed for serious data tracking.
   The program supports broadcast faxes using ASCII mail-merge lists. While
it would be better if FaxFacts could work directly with data from a
personal information manager (PIM), this is still a handy feature.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that it can fax directly from an ASCII
file.
   FaxFacts requires relatively few system resources, as FOD programs go.
You can run it on as little as a 386SX, but we don't recommend using the
computer for anything else.

Ibex's FactsLine for Windows
   Ibex Technologies' FactsLine for Windows 2.0 is by far the simplest of
these four programs to install. Unlike the others, it uses a standard
Windows installation routine. The Windows interface makes it far easier to
configure than the other programs, which require you to fight your way
through scripting languages to call data from a database or to change the
menu tree. With FactsLine, these jobs are a breeze. You can automatically
turn off menu items leading to old documents, and FactsLine lets you
reconfigure the system, and even update the voice-menu tree and documents,
while you're on-line.
   As you might expect, FactsLine, with its dBase databases and Windows
interface, comes with a variety of easily accessible reports. These reports
can be displayed on-screen, printed, or (which we were amused to find)
faxed.
   But all this comes at the cost of system resources. You won't want to
run FactsLine on anything less than a 33-MHz 486DX with 8 MB of RAM. More
of both, as always, would be better.
   When all is said and done, though, FactsLine is the best of the group.
It costs more--in addition to its heftier system requirements, it uses a
minimum of two voice boards--but you'll find its ease of use, flexibility,
and reporting power to be worth the extra expense. Highly recommended.

Nuntius's CommandFax
   Nuntius's CommandFax 3.5 handles all the usual FOD jobs (e.g., sending
requested faxes on the same call or via a return call) with aplomb. That's
a good thing, because getting CommandFax to that point can be a pain. While
there should be a Windows version of CommandFax out by the time you read
this, the DOS version we tested will have you manually tweaking
configuration files before you're done.
   CommandFax is also the most demanding of these four programs when it
comes to system resources. For example, it won't work well with any
expanded-memory manager (according to the documentation), but it requires
at least 1 MB of expanded memory. For people with old LIM expanded-memory
boards, that's fine, but others will be left in a quandary.
   CommandFax's reporting tools are nonexistent. While the program keeps
copious logs in dBase format with FoxPro-compatible indexes, you'll need
another program to make sense of the data.
   That said, CommandFax has a pair of shining virtues that may make it the
best choice for some users. Unlike the other programs, CommandFax can use
network fax servers for its outgoing faxes (Telephone Response Technology
has a higher-end product that does this, too), and LAN users can send out
faxes via the program's fax card. CommandFax manages this remarkable feat
by using Intel and DCA Communications' Communicating Application
Specification (CAS). This additional capacity makes CommandFax an ideal
choice for any office that needs to send ready-made and impromptu faxes
alike to a large number of customers.

Telephone Response Technologies' VP Express
   VP Express (VPX) 1.1 is a good middle-of-the-road product. While it
doesn't have all the virtues of FactsLine, in our testing it was marginally
the fastest at handling an overload of fax calls. VPX is also
straightforward to install and maintain--if you can keep an eye on it.
While the program has the simplest Windows interface of the group, some of
its setup query boxes aren't what they appear to be. The menus don't
specify what will happen when you try certain buttons and other menu
choices.
   Although the manual says you need a 75-MHz or faster computer for decent
performance, we found that VPX actually ran better than its competition on
our supposedly suboptimal 33-/66-MHz 486DX2 system. VPX is also very
flexible at handling incoming lines. While CommandFax and FaxFacts might
have you negotiating arcane commands for each line, VPX has one easy-to-use
window display that makes managing separate lines simple.
   Unlike the other programs, VPX can be expanded into separate fax and
voice-mail systems. While full-featured voice mail is separately priced
($395), small offices looking for a catch-all solution might prefer VPX
over the other programs.
   VPX also has adequate reporting capabilities. But if you want to work
over the numbers to see what your customers are up to, you need separate
DBMS or reporting software. All told, we still prefer Ibex's FactsLine for
its fast installation and superior ease of use.

SUMO GRAPHICS GIANTS WEIGH IN
Two massive software bundles from Corel and Micrografx go belly-to-belly
for the Windows 95 graphics-suite crown

By:
STANFORD DIEHL AND G. ARMOUR VAN HORN

On the heels of the office-suite successes (and Microsoft's apparent TKO),
graphics heavyweights Corel and Micrografx now battle for the Windows 95
graphics market. Both companies tout the obvious advantages of buying a
graphics suite from one vendor: a comprehensive one-buy solution, smooth
integration across modules, one-stop support, and a discounted overall
price.
   But we think the two products will attract different markets. While
CorelDraw 6 will appeal to current Corel shops and other graphics
professionals, the Micrografx ABC Graphics Suite targets the general
businessperson's graphics-production needs by skillfully wrapping the
company's most popular graphics applications in a Microsoft
Office-compatible interface.

Big, Fat Graphics
   Also in the spirit of the office suites, these bundles are huge and
ungainly. The basic installation of CorelDraw 6 takes a whopping 180 MB.
The ABC Graphics Suite fills about 85 MB. You can run CorelDraw from a
CD-ROM, but it still requires up to 32 MB of hard disk space. When we ran
the Corel applications from a double-speed CD-ROM, performance was
unacceptably slow, even on a 60-MHz Pentium system.
   We also had problems installing from some CD-ROM drives. Information on
Corel's World Wide Web site blamed real-mode CD-ROM drivers. Older systems
might also experience problems with scanners, drawing tablets, video cards,
and other hardware not specifically supported by Windows 95 drivers. The
stability of drawing-tablet drivers was so poor at the release of Windows
95 that Micrografx chose not to support any pressure-sensitive tablets with
this version, even though earlier versions supported them.
   For all practical purposes, these suites need Pentium systems with 16 MB
of RAM and a 1-GB or larger hard drive. It's time to bite the Windows 95
resource bullet.
   If you've got the hardware, though, these suites are significantly
improved for Windows 95, with judicious right-click menus, drag-and-drop
support, long filenames, multithreading, and OLE 2.0. This type of
functionality, as well as upcoming Windows 95 software, such as PageMaker
6, should let Windows 95 (or, better yet, Windows NT, which can host both
of these graphics suites) compete with the Mac for the professional
graphics market.
   But unlike the office-suite market, graphics shops have not embraced the
single-bundle philosophy. The graphics market has responded well to
specialized niche products from Adobe, Macromedia, and Quark. Nor does this
market show any signs of becoming Windows-only. Adobe Illustrator,
PageMaker, Photoshop, and Macromedia FreeHand are clearly committed to both
Windows and Mac platforms. Corel and Micrografx remain specific to
Windows.

The Reigning Sumo Champ
   Corel has removed Ventura Publisher from the CorelDraw package but, as
usual, has added lots of new stuff. The problem for Corel has always been
integrating new modules into a consistent whole. The company has made
strides in this area, especially with PhotoPaint, but the overall suite
still feels somewhat cobbled together.
   Corel has made some features, such as layer control in CorelDraw, easier
to use by bringing more functions to the first level of a roll-up menu. But
overall, the applications are hard to learn and use unless you're a
seasoned CorelDraw designer.
   Dedicated Corel shops should appreciate the upgrade. The new
applications are impressive, especially when it comes to 3-D illustration.
Corel Dream 3-D, a Windows 95 port from RayDream Designer for Windows and
the Mac, is a high-end tool for 3-D modeling and rendering.
   If you're familiar with 3-D design (and especially if you've used
RayDream Designer before), you'll be immediately productive with Corel
Dream 3-D. Another new application, Corel Motion 3-D, animates your 3-D
models. The Micrografx Instant 3-D application generates slick text
effects, but the ABC suite does not support 3-D modeling.
   The new Corel Presents module supports a full range of multimedia
elements, including sound, video, and transitional effects. Corel also
bundles an excellent screen-capture applet, a module that the ABC Graphics
Suite needs and lacks.
   Corel's inclusion of professional illustration tools infuses the bundle
with high-end functionality that you simply won't get from the ABC suite.
But if you're looking for a general-business graphics solution, CorelDraw
is overkill.

Sumo Business Graphics
   Micrografx has pulled together a focused graphics suite for the
mainstream office. When installing the suite, you can include Micrografx
icons on the toolbar of Microsoft Office applications. When you click on
the Micrografx icons from within either Word or Excel, you end up in an OLE
frame, with the launched application activated.
   Picture Publisher and Designer (but, sadly, not FlowCharter) work within
the new Office Binder. The Binder requires plenty of resources to
efficiently handle a large set of integrated files, but if you've got a
fast Pentium system, it's a convenient way to manage work projects.
   Neither Corel PhotoPaint nor Micrografx Picture Publisher can match the
full functionality of Adobe Photoshop, but with either of these suites you
get a powerful image editor. Picture Publisher shows off its Windows 95
architecture with a task window that displays multithreading in action and
with its support of Kodak's 32-bit Precision Color Management System.
Meanwhile, Designer has moved closer to the professional power of CorelDraw
by now handling up to 32,000 layers, matching CorelDraw's placement
precision of 1 micron, and making Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) its native
format.

The Suite Choice
   CorelDraw 6 has more-powerful applications for the graphics
professional. But if you want an easy-to-use set of graphics tools for the
office (and Office) user, the ABC Graphics Suite is the better choice.

THE CHALLENGE OF TELEPHONY INTEGRATION

By:
Stanford Diehl


The great challenge of computer telephony integration (CTI) is to combine
computer-based media technologies (e.g., voice, fax, and speech
recognition) with a wide range of often-proprietary telephony equipment
(e.g., telephones and switches). Signal Computing System Architecture
(SCSA), a standard that's supported by a wide range of CTI vendors, defines
a modular architecture for seamlessly integrating computer-based
applications with diverse telephony hardware.
   SCSA includes both a software and a hardware specification. The SCSA
Telephony Application Object (TAO) Framework and the SCSA Hardware Model
are independent. The TAO works over a variety of hardware models, including
proprietary devices, by implementing a switch-fabric controller. This
controller, specific to the underlying hardware, receives resource requests
from TAO and translates the request to the specific hardware interface.
   The Service Provider Interface (SPI) sits on top of the
hardware-specific switch-fabric controllers, providing developers with a
consistent interface to different vendors' hardware devices and software
components. The SPI enables different hardware and software
computer-telephony modules to interoperate seamlessly.
   The application worries only about the abstract telephony features it
needs from the system, instead of the specific hardware devices that
support those features. This design delivers resource and location
independence to the application. When an application requests a particular
set of features (e.g., a text-to-speech component and a fax line), SCSA
creates a group of resources that can service the request.
   Such a group can contain one or many physical resources. SCSA manages
the resources for the application, in effect pooling a diverse set of
physical devices into a single, customized system. Once a call or other
application event is over, the functional group is destroyed and the
physical resources become immediately available to other applications.
   Simple fax-on-demand solutions, such as those reviewed here, don't
require the rich functionality enabled by SCSA. But vendors such as Copia
and Telephone Response Technologies rely on SCSA to integrate higher-end
resources (e.g., speech recognition or conferencing) and to negotiate
complex switching across multiple lines.
   The final result: a portable, cross-platform, hardware-independent
architecture for CTI.

NATIVE TRANSFER

A Windows graphics suite must handle large data files and distribute them
across multiple application modules. In the past, the challenge has been in
transferring these large data sets without bogging down the system. OLE
2.0's Uniform Data Transfer technology makes this process more efficient.
   Before OLE 2.0, applications used global memory as the medium of data
transfer, and a Clipboard format (e.g., CFXT or CFTMAP) to describe the
data. Different transfers (OLE 1.0, DDE, the Clipboard, or drag and drop)
required different protocols and API functions. Under OLE 2.0, a pointer is
transferred from the data source to the data recipient. The data object
itself then determines a standardized format for the transfer.
   When you select a data object and drag it out of its source, the
destination OLE container supports two data types--the Native Format and
the Presentation Format--each of which might contain several additional
components. The Native Format can be almost anything. Corel applications
use the Corel Metafile Exchange (*.CMX) format, introduced as the clip-art
format with CorelDraw 5. The Presentation Format includes elements
previously supported by the Windows Clipboard (Device-Dependent Bitmap,
Windows Metafile, Rich Text, and text), along with two new formats for
Windows 95: Device Independent Bitmap and Extended Metafile.
   When a client application accepts a data object, it selects the format
of the highest quality. If the program is privy to the Native Format (which
is likely if the client and server are from the same vendor), there's no
need to revert to a less accurate format for the transfer.

20 BIG-PICTURE MONITORS
NSTL evaluates the best large-screen monitors for today's highly graphical
applications

By:
CHANDRIKA MYSORE


Once you've experienced a big screen, it's really hard to return to a
15-inch box. Becoming less of a luxury, a 21-inch monitor can support 1600-
by 1200-pixel resolutions, a Plug and Play (PnP) architecture, and slick
software controls. Power users will appreciate running multiple
applications on the desktop. Graphics designers, CAD engineers, desktop
publishers, and heavy-duty spreadsheet junkies absolutely require a large,
high-resolution tube for mission-critical work. We tested 21-inch monitors
(and 20-inch ones from Apple, IBM, and Tatung) to find the best overall
model, the model with the highest-quality display, and the best overall
deal on the market.
   Out of the 20 monitors, 10 use the Hitachi picture tube, five use the
Matsushita picture tube, and the other five use tubes from Sony,
Mitsubishi, or NEC. We tested the monitors under Windows 95. Some of them
were too new to support specific drivers for Windows 95. Thanks to the PnP
availability, Windows 95 configured the PnP monitors on the fly. For the
monitors that did not support PnP, we configured them in 1280- by
1024-pixel SVGA resolution.
   With an average dot pitch of 0.26 mm, the text appears crisp and clear
on the screen. The maximum vertical refresh rate was 97 Hz at 1280- by
1024-pixel resolution and 82 Hz at 1600- by 1280-pixel resolution. At these
high refresh rates, the display is absolutely flicker-free.
   These neat features, however, come with a huge price tag. The
most-expensive monitor we tested was Nanao USA's Flexscan FX2-21 ($3499),
and the least expensive was Smile International's CA2111 ($1780). In this
roundup, the average price is $2255. (In our last report, the average price
was $2243.)
   You'll need a strong back to lift these behemoths and a large work area;
the average weight is 74 pounds, and they take up voluminous desk space.
The Philips Magnavox CM2137 consumed the least power at 110 W, and the NEC
Multisync XP21 the highest at 197 W. Fortunately, all the monitors we
tested, except for the Daytek DT-2102M, are Energy Star-compliant, so they
consume less than 30 W in idle mode; and with VESA Display Power Management
Signaling (DPMS) compliance, the internal power management system kicks in
(consuming less than 30 W of power) when the monitor is idle. If the
monitor is in idle mode for a long time, the VESA DPMS will put the unit in
sleep mode, consuming less than 8 W of power.
   The IBM P201, Nanao Flexscan FX2-21, Nokia Multigraph 445X, and the
Philips Magnavox CM21BA cost more than the rest of the products tested here
for a reason; they have higher bandwidths (up to 250 MHz) compared to
low-priced products at around 130 MHz and thus provide higher vertical
refresh rates (close to 85 Hz) at higher (1600- by 1200-pixel) resolutions.
Because we tested all the monitors in 1280- by 1024-pixel resolution, we
did not evaluate these four monitors at these high refresh rates. We
consider them to be in a class of their own, offering a higher usable
resolution that is worth the price for those who need it.

How to use this guide
   Our overall score for the best color monitor is based on the
weighted-average results from quality tests and usability and features
evaluation. The quality tests are executed using the NSTL-developed
software tools, Klein gauge, power meter, luminometer, and eyepiece. The
best-overall and low-cost winners are based on overall performance scores.
The high-quality winners are based on the quality scores.

If this column is checked, the monitors are shipped with software controls
to adjust the display orientation. Press a menu button on the front panel,
and the control menu pops up on the screen.

The prices listed here are the manufacturer's suggested retail price
(MSRP). Street prices will be lower.

The viewable size is the diagonal measurement of the maximum display area.

Illustration(s):
Illustration: Illustration: A Look at the Big Picture

POWER MODULE
Includes the power supply for the monitor with integrated power management
circuitry. When the power-saving feature is forced, the power consumption
is less than 8 W in idle state. Look for Energy Star- and TCO-compliant
monitors.

DEGAUSSING COIL
Wraps around the picture tube. The Earth's magnetic pull and movement of
the active display cause the picture tube to magnetize, resulting in image
distortion. By pressing the degauss button, the degaussing coil
demagnetizes the picture tube.

YOKE
The coil around the CRT drives the electron beam to a specific pixel on the
screen.

VIDEO BOARD
Residing at the rear of the CRT, it controls, amplifies, and processes the
video-signal input from the system's video card.

SCREEN SURFACE
The flat screen is treated with antistatic coating. The antistatic coating
reduces the electric charge on the screen, and the antiglare coating
reduces the reflection on the monitor. Also look for ergocoated and
ergopaneled screens. These special coatings provide sharp images and reduce
eyestrain.

FLYBACK TRANSFORMER (FBT)
The power source to transfer the electrons from the back of the monitor to
the screen in the front.

HORIZONTAL SCANNING CIRCUITRY
Browses the electron beam horizontally on the screen (measured in kHz). The
monitors with higher horizontal scanning frequency provides less flicker on
the screen.

BNC/D-SUB CONNECTORS
Look for monitors with both BNC and D-sub connectors. At high scanning
frequencies, we preferred BNC connectors over the D-sub because the
connectors provide additional shielding between the video input and the
signal lines.

LCD
Displays the status of the monitor operations, selected main and
subcontrols (to adjust the display), resolutions, scanning frequencies, and
so on. The monitors with an LCD don't come with the on-screen menus to
adjust the display.

CONTROLS
The functions of the control buttons should be labeled clearly. We
preferred on-screen controls with a minimum set of buttons over the
old-fashioned two buttons/control or thumbwheel control.

HIGH-QUALITY MONITORS

Monitor manufacturers are changing the concept of access to monitor
controls. Fading away is the traditional monitor with control buttons or
thumbwheels for adjusting brightness, contrast, and so on. Monitors of the
next generation have just a few buttons and on-screen menus.
   Of the 20 large-screen monitors tested here, 14 of them had on-screen
menus. These menus include controls to adjust brightness, contrast,
degauss, horizontal and vertical size, position, pincushion, barrel, and
color matching. In addition, progressive vendors add controls for
convergence, geometric distortion correction, horizontal and vertical
moire, dynamic focusing, video select, and input port select.
   To access these controls, you press a button on the monitor, and a menu
pops up on-screen. Most of the monitors have similar buttons that function
as the menu, select, and exit buttons. Some of the monitors still have
buttons or thumbwheels for brightness, contrast, and degauss. Our testing
team was impressed with the organization of the on-screen menu used by the
NEC Multisync monitors.
   As these monitors move onto desktops, manufacturers are making them
easier to view by building them with antistatic, antiglare, antireflective,
ergocoated, and ergopaneled screens. Of the 20 monitors, 17 support 1600-
by 1200-pixel resolution in noninterlaced mode. At this resolution, the
text on the screen or data in spreadsheet cells must be flicker-free to
reduce eyestrain. To achieve a flicker-free display, these monitors use
vertical refresh rates of as high as 82 Hz. Nine of the monitors comply
with the TCO emission standards, and only 12 of them carry FCC Class B
labels.
   These heavyweight monitors use a lot of power to display sharp and crisp
images. Power consumption ranges from 110 to 197 W in active mode. All the
monitors (except Daytek's DT-2102M) are equipped with the built-in Display
Power Management System (DPMS). With this electronic circuit embedded, the
monitor automatically saves power and switches to a low-power mode
consuming less than 30 W in idle mode. If the monitor stays in idle mode
for a long period of time, it further saves energy by switching to sleep
mode, where it consumes less than 8 W. Users can set the time to switch to
these modes. In our power management test, the Philips Magnavox CM2137
received the highest score, consuming 84.6 W. It was followed by the NEC
Multisync XE21. All the monitors, except the DT-2102M, are Energy Star
recipients.
   The NEC Multisync XE21 rated higher than all the other monitors in our
overall performance and usability tests. For under $1900, this monitor is
also a winner in our low-cost category. The Viewsonic 21PS and the
Panasonic C-2192P come behind the overall winner in the performance
evaluation.
   The Viewsonic 21PS and the Panasonic C-2192P cost just under $2000 and
have the same physical appearance, with similar control buttons and
software used in the pop-up screen menu. These monitors perform similarly
because they both use the Matsushita picture tube. During our series of
tests, we noticed that both monitors squeak when switching from text to
graphics, with a lot of delay. The Panasonic C-2192P's quality performance
is close to the top score, and it received an outstanding score in
distortion tests.
   NEC's XP21 rated the highest in the image-quality tests. The XP21 costs
$400 more than the XE21, but it provides a higher 1600- by 1200-pixel
resolution, higher horizontal and vertical scanning frequencies, and more
factory presets and user-settable display modes. This is the only monitor
that comes with the Access.bus connector. The Access.bus supports
bidirectional communications for future enhancements (see the text box
``Access.bus Technology'' on page 125).
   The Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 21TX scored the highest in our features
rating, providing a high resolution of 1600 by 1200 pixels, extended
warranties, on-site service, and BBS support service. It also has such
high-end control features as focus, signal level, and digital control. Most
other monitors lacked some of these features. Although the Diamond Pro 21TX
was our high scorer in this area, it is not an FCC Class B residential
monitor, lacks unlimited technical support, and has a high dot pitch.


For superior quality and control...
BEST OVERALL
NEC Multisync XE21

The NEC Multisync XE21 uses an opticlear screen and an NEC picture tube. It
has excellent on-screen menu controls that let you adjust the display at
the touch of a button. A Plug and Play monitor, it comes with outstanding
documentation; toll-free and on-line support services offer excellent
technical support to end users. It received a high score in NSTL's power
management tests. For $100 more, our third choice, the Panasonic C-2192P,
offers 1600- by 1280-pixel resolution with a higher quality worth the
price.

Excellent quality and services
HIGH-QUALITY
Apple Multiple Scan 20-inch

The Apple Multiple Scan 20-inch is the only monitor that featured a bonded
panel screen and a Trinitron picture tube, providing superior performance.
This 66-pound FCC Class A monitor comes with optional TCO-compliant
support. You get a one-year warranty with unlimited toll-free technical
support, a BBS, and on-line support services. It does not support on-screen
menu controls to adjust the display. Our second choice in this category,
the Panasonic C-2192P, costs $150 less than our winner. With 0.25-mm dot
pitch (one of the lowest in this series of monitors), it provides a
high-quality display at a resolution of 1600 by 1280 pixels. Its quality
score is very close to the winner, and its overall performance is slightly
higher in this category.

Impressive quality, usability, and price
LOW-COST
NEC Multisync XE21

At$1899, the NEC Multisync XE21's 19.8-inch display delivers a maximum
resolution of 1280 by 1024 pixels, a superior set of support features, and
impressive usability. Our second choice in this category, the Tatung
CM-20MKR, provides 1600- by 1200-pixel resolution and costs $100 less than
our winner. However, its overall performance is significantly lower than
that of the XE21. The Tatung CM-20MKR monitor had lower performance in our
legibility, resolution, convergence, and contrast-ratio tests. However,
with 0.28-mm dot pitch, its quality performance was slightly better than
that of the XE21.

PIVOT 1700: A MOVING ALTERNATIVE

Now you can physically rotate your monitor to view the full 8.5- by 11-inch
word processing document without scrolling. Portrait Display Labs recently
unveiled a 17-inch color monitor displaying images in both landscape and
portrait modes. The Pivot 1700 monitor is compatible with Macs, Power Macs,
and PC compatibles running Windows. The provided software does not deliver
a portrait view in full-screen DOS mode, but it offers 50 lines of
portrait-viewing capability in a DOS window. The DOS-window capability is
limited to simpler applications, such as word processing, programming, and
analyzing code. It is not recommended for heavy-duty CAD work.
   It is as easy as pressing a hot key or clicking on a screen icon to
rotate the image without closing any of your applications. With this
flexibility, you can switch between the two modes depending on your
applications and work load. If you think you need a 21-inch monitor for
viewing long documents in high resolution, the Pivot 1700 could be a
cost-effective alternative. For a street price of only $1199, the Pivot
1700's vertical height is 12.7 inches; for over $2000, the vertical height
of 21-inch monitors is only 12 inches.
   The Pivot 1700 supports resolutions of up to 1024 by 768 pixels (768 by
1024 pixels in portrait mode) at 76 Hz and 1280 by 1024 pixels at 60 Hz
with a dot pitch of 0.26 mm. It is compatible with most Windows graphics
cards having at least 1 MB of video memory. But the WinPortrait 2.0 driver
that comes with the monitor did not support the MGA Matrox graphics card.
The driver for the Matrox card will be available in later versions. The
Pivot 1700 is capable of displaying a full, readable, life-size display of
an 8.5- by 11-inch document, with lots of room for toolbars, icons, and
other windows in portrait mode. It comes with the WinPortrait graphics
drivers (the rotating capability) and a three-year limited warranty.
   The layout of the monitor's digital controls is designed with long, soft
touch buttons. These buttons reside on a semicircular projection at the
bottom of the screen in landscape mode. When the monitor is rotated
clockwise to display portrait mode, the control buttons move along with the
monitor and reside at its left side. This monitor complies with the Energy
Star and MPR II standards.

ACCESS.BUS TECHNOLOGY

The Access.bus is a bidirectional-communications industry-standard bus for
peripheral connectivity. Peripherals that support the Access.bus provide a
connector or port connection that is similar to a phone-jack connector. It
can connect peripherals such as monitors, printers, modems, mice,
keyboards, scanners, and digitizers to the system.
   The advantage of the Access.bus is hassle-free installation. You can
connect an Access.bus device (e.g., a monitor) to your system, and the
system automatically identifies and configures it for optimum performance.
The system and the attached device automatically configure themselves by
communicating via the Access.bus, thus eliminating the memory-hogging
platform-specific driver installation, DIP switches, jumpers, or
terminators.
   The Access.bus connection protocol was developed by Digital Equipment
and Philips Semiconductors in 1985. Because of its simplicity, it is widely
accepted as an industry standard. Many hardware peripheral vendors plan to
provide this connection in future products. This connectivity can be
provided on existing peripherals and software-controlled devices. NEC
Technologies has a head start in this game by offering an Access.bus
connector on its XP series of 17- and 21-inch monitors.
   With the Access.bus connection, you can connect up to 125 devices to
your system in daisy-chain fashion, without having to manually configure
each device. For example, you can connect your system to the monitor via
the Access.bus, connect the printer to your monitor, connect your modem to
the printer, and so on. The order in which you connect is irrelevant. If
you want to add another device into the chain, it can be plugged in
anywhere, and the system will know what I/O to use to address that device.
   The system communicates with each of the connected devices via the
Access.bus, and each device is intelligent enough to respond to the system
calls. Because the device communicates via the Access.bus, the platform on
which it is connected becomes irrelevant. The Access.bus can also be used
to update the flash ROM on the peripheral.
   Windows 95 provides a Plug and Play device featuring an automatic
detection of the monitor. Here, the monitor identifies itself as a Plug and
Play-compatible device easing the setup and configuration time. With
Access.bus compatibility, peripheral manufacturers should make their
products more intelligent to accept and send instructions back and forth to
the system.

HOW WE TESTED

We tested the monitors in noninterlaced mode at 1280- by 1024-pixel
resolution at a refresh rate of 60 Hz and determined image sharpness,
resolution, convergence, legibility, contrast ratio, and power management
in a Windows 95 environment. In DOS mode, we tested the image quality and
distortion using Displaymate Professional 1.0 from Sonera Technologies.
   We installed the monitor-specific Windows 95 drivers for each monitor,
if they were provided. Because Windows 95 was released only shortly before
testing commenced, only two monitors (from Nokia and Tatung) came with
specific drivers for Windows 95. We tested the rest of the monitors with
configurations based on manufacturers' suggestions. Many suppliers advised
that we let Windows 95 automatically configure their product as a standard
Plug and Play monitor. For those monitors not compatible with Plug and
Play, testers configured them to SVGA at 1280 by 1024 pixels.
   We tested the monitors on an S.A.G. Electronics STC 120 running at 120
MHz with a Matrox Millennium video card. Only two NSA Hitachi monitors were
not compatible with this card. At the time of testing, Matrox did not have
the drivers available for the NSA Hitachi monitors. This incompatibility
caused the monitors to lose their settings during testing. Our technicians
had to restore the settings for each screen resolution. This
incompatibility did not affect the performance of these monitors. Matrox is
in the process of including support for these monitors, and it should have
released the drivers by the time you read this.

DISPLAY QUALITY
We used the NSTL-developed software utility to measure the image sharpness,
contrast ratio, and misconvergence of the monitors. Using 1- and
2-pixel-thick RGB lines at the edges of the screen, we measured the
sharpness of the image. We also displayed horizontal and vertical lines
across the entire screen, looking for the resolving capability of the
monitor. We then examined the monitors for overlapping and spacing between
lines.
   To measure the contrast ratio, we used a large, white rectangular box at
the center of the screen and measured the luminance levels for both the
white rectangle and the unilluminated border surrounding the white box in
candellas/meters2, using a Tektronix Lumacolor II J18 Photometer. A higher
ratio indicates greater contrast, making the image more visible in high
ambient-light conditions.
   To measure misconvergence, we used Klein Optical Instruments' optical
gauge, which contains three prisms. By varying the red and blue prisms in
this device, the displayed white line on the screen was aligned
horizontally and vertically. This is the convergence correction required to
display the image without misconvergence.
   We measured the quality of the image by examining a series of 25 screens
using Displaymate Professional 1.0. Screens included color and gray-scale
displays, blooming effect on color and black-and-white text, moire patterns
on multiple resolutions, consecutive text and graphics switching, and
geometric display of rectangles and circles. We used the same software to
calculate the distortion index of the monitor by recording a series of
screen measurements.
   We also tested these monitors in a real-world scenario for legibility
and power management capabilities. We inspected various fonts in multiple
sizes for legibility and readability in a Word document from a normal
viewing distance. Testers measured the power consumption in a full, active
Windows environment; in a Windows screen-saver mode (using the blank
screen); and in an idle or a low-power state using a Digital Power Meter.
   The price cutoff to qualify as a low-cost monitor was $1900, which is
$355 less than the average price. We were able to select the best low-cost
monitor from a group of four monitors.
   Our best-overall score included the weighted average of 42.9 percent of
the overall performance score, 14.3 percent of power rating, and 21.4
percent of features and usability each. The quality score was determined by
the weighted average of 46 percent of image-quality tests and NSTL tests
each and 8 percent of distortion tests. We determined the overall
display-quality score by calculating the weighted averages of the
image-sharpness (40 percent), contrast-ratio (10 percent), convergence (20
percent), and legibility (30 percent) tests.

FEATURES
We weighed some features more heavily than others to determine the features
score for each monitor. Some of them are dot pitch, minimum and maximum
horizontal and vertical frequencies, display modes, display controls, and
internal power management. Energy Star- and TCO-compliant features were
weighed heavily overall.

EASE OF USE
We examined the ease of use for each monitor by scoring documentation,
technical support, and physical use, such as tilt, swivel, and cable
lengths. Our technicians gave a subjective score (based on guidelines) for
each usability feature. The usability testing was completed by the same
technician on all the monitors.

ON-SCREEN MENUS

Of the 20 monitors we tested, 14 had display controls in an on-screen menu.
Monitors supporting on-screen menus have the least number of buttons and
lights. The buttons on the monitor display the pop-up menu, select the
controls in the menus, and increase or decrease the selected control. Some
of the monitors automatically remove the menu from the screen if the menu
is idle for a given period of time. This can be annoying when you haven't
finished with the adjustment. Testers preferred that the menus stay on
until the testers wanted to exit.

CIRCULAR VS. RECTANGULAR

to the rectangular type. Based on our subjective usability testing,
technicians expressed a preference for those with circular bases, citing
them as easier to move, tilt, and swivel.

CONGESTED BNC CONNECTORS

We tested the monitors using BNC connectors, if provided. A BNC cable
connector has five connectors, one each for RGB (a total of three), H-sync,
and V-sync signals. Some monitors place the five connectors in one row,
with equal spacing in between the connectors. This is the preferred,
easy-to-use placement. Other manufacturers, such as Nokia, position the
connectors in two rows, with RGB in the first row and the H- and V-sync
connectors in the second row. This arrangement is inconvenient, because
there is not enough room between the rows to grasp and twist the
connectors.

POWER TOOLS FOR DATA DRILLING
IQ/Objects and PowerPlay help you find information buried in complex
databases. One is a better analyst, the other a better query/report tool.

By:
DAVID S. LINTHICUM

When it comes to automated tools that deal with masses of data, different
products take different approaches. Query/reporting packages help you
create views from complex queries, pass them along to a DBMS, and take the
results and format them for presentation. Analysis packages slice and dice
data, perform what-if analyses, and ``drill down'' to get more detail. The
buzzword that describes what they do is on-line analytical processing
(OLAP). Many of these tools don't perform the initial queries. Instead,
they operate on data tables provided by a separate query package. Although
there is some overlap in functionality, the two types of tools complement
each other. In many organizations, both will find homes as the eyes and
ears of busy executives.
   In this review, we look at one tool from each category: IQ/Objects, a
query/reporting tool from IQ Software, and PowerPlay, a data-analysis
package from Cognos. (Note that each vendor also makes a package in the
other category: IQ's analysis tool, announced in November 1995, is
IQ/Vision. Cognos's query tool is Impromptu.) Both packages reviewed here
provide connections to popular relational database servers, produce a wide
variety of reports and graphs, and run under Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.
Because of their different purposes, however, that's where the similarities
end.

IQ/Objects
   With its many features, IQ/Objects (IQ/O) is a good general-purpose
reporting tool for Windows. It comes with a Report Designer, a run-time
Report Viewer, and a Knowledge Base Editor for creating logical database
views.
   The reporting capabilities are impressive. IQ/O supports single- and
multiple-column layouts, with vertical and horizontal data depiction. You
can embed OLE 2.0 objects inside reports and print multiple reports, each
from a different query and with its own format and data representation
(e.g., charts and tables) on the same page. You can define 2-D and 3-D
cross-tab reports using single or multiple columns and put multiple objects
in cross-tab cells.
   IQ/O offers eight types of graphs, including pie charts, bar charts,
scatter diagrams, and line charts. Report developers can include logical
print objects and report areas that appear only when a predetermined
condition is met. This means you can create reports having multiple detail
and summary sections with different formats (e.g., each specific to a given
state), and the appropriate query and format will be automatically chosen
at run time. Also, you can use the results of one query as input to
another.
   Using IQ/O, you can create custom columns that extend a database's
physical schema, and you can also create user-written functions to
manipulate data and perform calculations. IQ/O provides complete control
over formatting, allowing borders, shadows, background images, and fills
for objects, selected report areas, and the entire report. You can export
your report to Windows metafiles and to text, comma-delimited, PostScript,
and Excel files.
   You design a report graphically, dragging and dropping columns from an
object window to a report. IQ/O comes with several predesigned report
templates, and you can add custom templates. Group editing lets developers
change multiple objects at once, and you can define and apply object styles
as needed. You can browse data while you're designing a report and see
on-screen what the report will look like, eliminating the need for most
test printing and saving time and materials.
   The object-oriented structure of IQ/O lets you create reusable
objects--reports, charts, queries, and documents, as well as imported OLE
objects--and incorporate them into new queries and documents. IQ/O can link
report objects so that an object will change automatically when you change
another object that's linked to it. This saves time in report maintenance.
   Report output can be saved for later viewing either in IQ/O or by the
separate, smaller IQ Viewer that's included with the less-expensive
personal edition. You can also create prompts to make it easy for users to
request reports directly.
   While IQ/O can do its query processing entirely on a workstation, it can
also off-load some of the computing to one or more IQ SmartServers. These
can query back-end databases, create formatted reports and views, and ship
the query results back to the workstation.

PowerPlay
   PowerPlay is a suite of four programs that lets developers and end users
create interactive reports and graphs and perform some what-if analysis.
PowerPlay comes with Explorer, Reporter, Portfolio, and Transformer
components, plus a separate Cognos Scheduler.
   PowerPlay Explorer provides a point-and-click interface to check out
data. Transformer takes 2-D data from database tables and creates the
multidimensional data that Explorer and Reporter use. Portfolio organizes
PowerPlay reports into interactive briefing books. Cognos Scheduler can
execute Transformer as a batch process at specified times.
   With Reporter, the heart of the PowerPlay package, you can build
interactive and automated reports in a variety of formats. The Reporter
environment is similar to that of Explorer, and you can display data in
cross-tab, column, and free-form reports. PowerPlay supports pie, bar,
line, simple point, and correlation graphs.
   With Reporter, you select only the specific subset of data you need to
work with, without having to deal with a complete answer set from the
database. In Reporter, as with IQ/O, you create reports by dragging and
dropping data elements from a multidimensional view created by Transformer,
called the Category Tree. Each report includes a dimension line that shows
what dimensions are available in your extract and the levels of detail you
can access in each dimension.
   Developers can include ad hoc calculations to derive new data from
values in the database extract. Automatic features let you suppress
zero-value data as well as highlight exceptional (i.e., out-of-range) data.
You can create data filters, and rank and format the data for custom
reports.
   One feature that differentiates PowerPlay from the kind of
report-writing packages that have been around for years is its interactive
nature. When you want more detail, you just double-click on a category
button to drill down. To show data as a graph, you simply click on the
appropriate PowerBar button. This interactive capability lets developers
distribute reports that end users can continue to explore and interact with
to get information they need.

Finding the Data
   IQ/O and PowerPlay can work with a wide range of local databases and
remote database servers, including Oracle, Sybase, and Informix, as well as
others through Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). Each tool has its own way
of rerepresenting physical data to provide developers with new ways of
looking at the data as well as ways of subsetting or sanitizing data for
the end user (see the Technology Focus).
   With IQ/O, you can directly edit the SQL statements it produces before
processing the query. You can have it query multiple databases, and the
package supports distinct and aggregate functions. To use a database from
IQ/O, you must first create a special data dictionary using the Knowledge
Base Editor. The result is a repository file that contains a profile of
your database, the objects in it (e.g., tables, views, and synonyms), and
the relationships between those objects. (The newest version, IQ/Objects
5.1, released after this review was done, automatically sets up
relationships between tables and other repository objects.) A knowledge
base covers one or more databases, each with one or more tables and any
number of columns. You can also create global custom columns.
   In addition to an IQ/O knowledge base, you must provide a data source
that defines the name or location for the physical database plus connection
information. You can change the data source and knowledge base globally or
for individual reports. We found this feature quite useful when working
with several databases that store information using the same schema. The
end result is an object browser that you can use with the Report Designer
to select data for your report.
   Using a database with PowerPlay is slightly more complex and confusing
than with IQ/O, but the Cognos product adds multidimensional capability.
PowerPlay organizes data using three basic concepts: dimensions,
categories, and measures.
   PowerPlay represents standard relational data using dimensions, which
give developers and end users a flexible way of looking at data.
Multidimensional analysis is the exploration of data up, down, and across
critical dimensions of data. This capability increases the value of
corporate data. For example, multidimensional reports help you distinguish
the impact of each business area on other areas.
   Categories are individual items of data that make up a dimension.
PowerPlay organizes data within a dimension; categories are grouped into
hierarchical levels. You move down the hierarchy by drilling down to more
detail. The drill-down levels provide the flexibility to work on data at
any level you want. With Explorer and Reporter, you select database
information from a Category Tree. Measures are indicators that represent
values, such as revenues, expenses, and target inventory levels, calculated
or summarized from a combination of categories.

Creating Reports
   To create a report using IQ/O, you start by selecting from the available
report templates: an empty report, as well as free-form, column, cross-tab,
and label templates. After this, you can drag and drop objects from IQ/O's
Object Directory into your report. As we added objects to the IQ/O report
we were creating, we discovered that we could set their attributes,
formatting, and other look-and-feel features. From here, we grouped header
or footer areas by selecting objects that we wanted to relate. It's here in
the group headers/footers that you place totals, subtotals, and counts for
each data element. You can format these pretty much any way you want. If
you aren't using a group footer or group header, you select Report/Sort
Order.
   We could see how the report was taking shape by selecting Quick Preview.
IQ/O queried the database and selected only enough data for a single page.
It then opened a report viewer window showing how the printed report would
look. After making further changes, we could return to the viewer windows
and select Refresh to see the effect of the changes. Another option is Auto
Refresh, where the viewer windows update automatically as you make changes.
Only when our report was complete did we print a sample page to confirm
that the hard copy looked like the graphical image. Then we saved the
report to disk.
   PowerPlay provides similar features, but it requires a different,
somewhat more involved procedure. To begin a new report, you select the New
Report icon from the PowerBar, which opens up the Samples directory, where
the report templates are stored. From here, you double-click on the report
you want to use as a default. Now you can add data categories--detail,
summary, or a mixture of both--by navigating through PowerPlay's
multidimensional structure. You add categories via the Category Tree dialog
box. By double-clicking on categories, you can expand or contract the
hierarchy, selecting data as you go. For example, if you press the Add Row
button, Reporter adds a category. A plus sign next to a category indicates
that lower-level detail is available.
   To filter data, you change the dimension line of PowerPlay through the
Filter dialog box. You format the data by changing fonts, applying styles,
and displaying formats, as well as by resizing columns and rows. You can
also rank categories from the Explore menu. Here you enter column
information, and Reporter automatically ranks the data within the report.
To perform calculations, you need to create a calculated category, a data
point that exists only in PowerPlay and not in the physical database. You
do this by holding down the Control key while selecting one column, then
another, and defining the mathematical operations (i.e., add, subtract,
multiply, and divide) to use.
   After the report is complete, you enter title information. Then you're
ready to save the report or send it to the printer.

Power or Convenience?
   When looking at these two reporting and analysis tools together, you're
faced with the issue of power versus convenience. IQ/O provides an easy
method to create simple reports and graphs for all sorts of reporting
applications. It's easy to extract data from existing databases and from
database servers, and the Knowledge Base component lets you customize the
database view to suit your reporting needs precisely. Drag and drop is a
first-rate method of selecting objects for a report, and the ability to see
what a report looks like while you're defining it is a real help. It's also
quite useful to be able to control the query down to the SQL level, and the
reusable objects make it fast and easy to create new reports.
   PowerPlay is more complex than IQ/O but provides more power. The
Transformer provides the developer with the means to look at 2-D databases
as if they were multidimensional. This model greatly improves an end user's
ability to analyze data inside a corporate database. In addition, the
innate ability to make reports interactive makes PowerPlay the better type
of tool for creating ``point-and-shoot'' applications for nontechnical
users.
   Which tool you pick depends on your requirements. If you need an
effective query tool for ad hoc reporting, IQ/Objects is your best bet. If
you need to do hard-core OLAP and don't mind spending the extra time to get
there, you're ready for PowerPlay.

RESTRUCTURING DATA

While an analysis tool like PowerPlay works its magic on a multidimensional
database, a query tool like IQ/Objects looks at relational tables and
flat-file databases to create a desired view--and often produces the
multidimensional data that an analytical engine needs. Just how does a
query tool organize its data?
   One approach might be a large, comprehensive multijoin, but this could
be impossible or impractical, as well as highly wasteful and inefficient.
IQ/Objects takes a different approach, creating what's called a star
schema. In essence, this is a table formed by joining the most important
base tables and connecting to it smaller subsidiary tables. The subsidiary
tables hold keys for accessing other data (see the figure ``Data Is the
Star''). At first blush, this might sound like a slight variation on a
relational database system, but it differs significantly in that the
subsidiary files are all linked to a central data table. This creates a
data topology similar to that of a star network. Database systems that
support star schemata include Red Brick, Oracle, Sybase, and Informix.
   The alternative is a true multidimensional database, such as Oracle's
(Redwood Shores, CA) Data Warehouse or Arbor Software's (Sunnyvale, CA)
Essbase. A relational table represents data as a 2-D flat matrix. A
multidimensional database, however, stacks multiple tables into a 3-D block
(see the figure ``Cubic Data''), much like pages in an Excel spreadsheet or
Quattro Pro notebook. More-powerful multidimensional databases extend this
metaphor into higher dimensions by ``stacking'' blocks into hyperblocks.
While these constructions offer greater flexibility, they also consume more
computing power and considerably more overhead. For a query tool, creating
a true multidimensional database is overkill; for an analysis engine, a
multidimensional database is ideal, giving maximum flexibility for slicing
and dicing data to create new views and for drilling down to increasing
levels of detail.


Illustration(s):
Illustration: Figure: Cubic Data
Multidimensional databases don't use flat tables related by key fields and
values. Instead, they stack 2-D tables into cubes, cubes into 4-D
hypercubes, and so on. This structure lets you create different views and
slices of data by approaching it from different directions and along
different dimensions.

Illustration: Figure: Data Is the Star
IQ/O creates a star schema for its data, taking original relational tables
and combining them into a new format that speeds up report generation.

HOW THE WEB WILL CHANGE COMPUTING
Browsers and dynamic interpreted languages like Java enable developers to
write client/server applications that are inherently multiplatform

By:
STEVEN J. VAUGHAN-NICHOLS AND RACHEL SCHMUTTER

Web browsers, those graphical front ends to the Internet, are multiplying
faster than bunnies on a rabbit farm. As fast as they can, software vendors
are adding Internet connectivity to their programs.
   Fax-software vendors like Delrina have added browsers and other Internet
connectivity programs to their communications suites. Lotus Development's
integrated InterNotes Web Navigator browser in the new version of Notes
Release 4) merges Notes- and Web-based data. Other software developers are
upgrading their word processors, document managers, and even CD-ROM
programs with Internet connectivity.
   Internet mania is more than a fad, however: It marks the beginning of
what many analysts feel is a fundamental shift in how we compute. ``The
browser will increasingly be the user's interface to the corporation and
the world,'' says Dennis Freeman, marketing director at Frontier Technology
(Mequon, WI), an Internet-software developer.
   The latest version of the Navigator Web browser from Netscape (Mountain
View, CA; (415) 254-1900; http://home.netscape.com) typifies this trend.
Navigator 2.0 provides a wealth of new features (see the screen), but one
of the most important is its support for the Java programming language from
Sun Microsystems. Java lets developers of Web servers extend the
capabilities of browsers beyond merely viewing information. A Java-enabled
Web browser can download programs, called applets, such as data-entry
forms, spreadsheets, animations, and graphics. Any client, provided it runs
a Java-enabled browser, can access the Java application (for more
information on Java technology, see ``Wired on the Web,'' page 77).
   Netscape's Navigator is the most popular Web browser (various estimates
give it about 70 percent market share), and version 2.0 will be available
for the Mac, Windows, and Unix. The company's lead in the Web browser field
lets it promulgate extensions to HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language used
to create Web pages, and to add new functionality such as the fast loading
of low-resolution images and real-time chat to home pages. Other
capabilities like fully threaded newsgroup reading and NetScape's Secure
Sockets Layer for secure transactions, which other commercial companies can
license, illustrate how Netscape is becoming much more than a mere vendor
of browsers.
   ``Netscape is not trying to build Web browsers or Web servers, it's
trying to build an infrastructure to support public and private distributed
computing,'' says Jeremy Allaire, president of New World Media
(Minneapolis, MN), a consultancy specializing in on-line systems and the
Internet. ``Netscape is building an operating system.''
   Netscape's browser isn't the only one that will support Java. Other
browsers, including ones from Spry and Sun, will also support the new
language.
   Web browsers are changing in other ways. A more robust version of
Netscape's program, called Navigator Gold (priced at about $79), breaks the
boundary between browsers and HTML authoring tools by integrating a WYSIWYG
authoring environment. Navigator Gold also provides you with a word
processor.
   Meanwhile, other browser developers continue to improve on the Web's
built-in hyperlinking capabilities. The SlipKnot 1.13 browser from
MicroMind (slipknot@micromind.com) for Windows and OS/2 downloads data from
all local HTML links (i.e., links specific to a given Web site) to your
system in the background. This allows you to get a broad view of a Web site
either on- or off-line. Spyglass and NCSA are adding a similar feature to
their browsers, but SlipKnot lets users pick and choose what links they
want downloaded.
   As browsers encroach on the turf of traditional applications such as
word processors, as well as that of tools for developing custom front ends,
companies like Microsoft are adapting. For example, Microsoft is
investigating ways in which Visual Basic can act as a front-end development
tool for the company's Internet Explorer 2.0. The company is also
developing an electronic publishing tool (known as Blackbird) for the
Microsoft Network and the Web.
   Internet connectivity is important, agrees Chris Flores, Microsoft's
product manager for Visual Basic. But he also says the Internet is just
another extension for Visual Basic, which is a popular tool today among
corporate developers for creating custom front ends. More than 1000 custom
controls are available for Visual Basic developers today, Flores says, and
several companies are developing controls for Internet access. However,
Visual Basic is not a strong cross-platform solution thanks to Microsoft's
Windows-centric strategy: There's no Visual Basic for the Mac, and few, if
any, OLE Controls that will run natively on the Macintosh.
   Netscape faces formidable competition but is ahead of Microsoft and
other developers in building the ultimate TCP/IP network tool interface,
says New Media's Allaire. Furthermore, Netscape is doing so at the
application level for three major end-user operating systems: DOS/Windows,
MacOS, and Unix.

Illustration: Illustration: The new Netscape Navigator, available for
Windows, the Mac, and Unix, delivers E-mail with graphics. Navigator 2.0
will also include bidirectional E-mail that supports encryption and digital
signatures, as well as fully threaded newsgroup reading that corporations
can use for secure internal discussion groups. The Netscape word processor,
available only in the Gold edition, lets you drag and drop text and objects
and link images to HTML code. It also provides tools for document and image
conversion.

INTEL BEATS THE CLOCK ... AGAIN

By:
Dave Andrews


Intel's surprise rollout of its 200-MHz Pentium Pro (aka the P6) processor
will force its competitors in both the RISC and CISC camps to play catch-up
this year. Most industry insiders expected Intel to release a 150-MHz,
256-KB-cache version of the Pentium Pro for desktop PCs and workstations in
1995, then follow with a 166-MHz, 512-KB-cache version for servers in the
first quarter of 1996.
   Instead, Intel is releasing those chips as scheduled, plus 180-MHz and
200-MHz versions during this quarter. (Both will have 256-KB cache and,
like the 166-MHz Pentium Pro, will be built on Intel's .35-micron
manufacturing process.) Intel will also release a 200-MHz, 512-KB-cache
Pentium Pro in the second quarter of this year.
   Intel experienced better-than-expected yields with its .35-micron
process, which helped accelerate the release of the 200-MHz processor,
company officials said. Several PC manufacturers told BYTE that the early
availability of the 200-MHz version was a pleasant surprise. Intel's
competitors were probably not as pleased: BYTE's cross-platform CPU
benchmarks indicate that the 200-MHz Pentium Pro delivers 2.8 times the
integer performance of a 90-MHz Pentium, and about 3.5 times the
floating-point performance.
   The 200-MHz Pentium Pro will show up in the kinds of workstations
typically powered by RISC CPUs. Peter Lowber, senior analyst for
workstations and servers at Datapro (Lexington, MA), says the 200-MHz
Pentium Pro undermines the RISC value proposition. Although Digital, SGI,
and HP will likely surpass Pentium Pro performance when they release new
chips this year, Lowber says the RISC vendors must demonstrate
substantially superior performance over relatively inexpensive Intel
solutions.
   The news is worse for Intel's x86 competitors, AMD and Cyrix. AMD, which
recently acquired NexGen, and Cyrix both sell Pentium-class processors now
and won't ship Pentium Pro competitors for running 32-bit software before
the end of this year. Meanwhile, Intel's Pentium prices have plummeted. A
200-MHz, 256-KB-cache Pentium Pro sells for $1325 (in quantities of 1000);
a 75-MHz Pentium costs just $158 (the 60-MHz Pentium originally sold for
$878). ``I think Cyrix and AMD will have problems,'' Lowber says. ``They're
playing catch-up again.''

Intel's RISC competitors will release new processors this year that should

currently being built on a .35-micron manufacturing process, Intel's
competitors are expected to release even higher-performing .3x-micron chips
(not included in this chart) late this year.

BETTER TOOLS REDUCE PAPER CLUTTER

By:
Jon Pepper


Personal scanners are going to become easier to use, be able to capture
color images, and be less expensive. First made popular by Visioneer (Palo
Alto, CA) and its PaperPort hardware/software system for Windows and the
Mac, personal scanners typically integrate OCR, archiving, annotation, and
other software tools with a small sheet-fed scanner.
   Personal scanners will soon offer more extensive support for color. Many
products already let you add existing color images to a black-and-white
document, but PageScan Color ($399) from Logitech (Fremont, CA) also lets
you scan and capture color images at 24-bit resolution. Support for color
capture will become more important as inexpensive color printers increase
their penetration into businesses, analysts say. PageScan Color can also
capture images at 8-bit gray-scale resolution. You can detach its scanning
head to scan bound material or book pages.
   Another new entry, PaperEase (about $249) from Primax Electronics
(Sunnyvale, CA), comes with an automatic document feeder, which can handle
up to 10 sheets at a time. PaperEase integrates with most Windows
applications (a Mac version is planned for the first half of this year),
including fax and E-mail, and comes with document-annotation and archiving
software. You can fax directly from the PaperEase hardware without using
fax software. The copier controller in the scanner lets you enlarge,
reduce, crop, and change the brightness of scanned documents. PaperEase
currently scans at up to 400 dots per inch (dpi) and 256 levels of gray
(8-bit gray-scale). Primax says it will have a model that can capture color
in the first half of this year.
   Visioneer's latest unit, the new PaperPort Vx (about $369, available for
Mac or Windows), offers an enhanced hardware and software system. It's
easier to install, it's faster, and it supports 8-bit gray-scale images,
the company says. New SharpPage technology automatically focuses and cleans
up scanned images to provide more accurate OCR or higher-quality faxes,
according to Visioneer. Maximum scanning resolution will be 400 dpi. The Vx
will connect to either the serial or parallel port. Visioneer wouldn't
confirm that it will release a color version during the next 12 months, but
a company official says it is reasonable to expect one.
   A new entry from Hewlett-Packard, the 4S, is about the same size as
Visioneer's original PaperPort and uses Visioneer's PaperPort 3.0 software.
HP's 4S doesn't support color capture. At $349, it's almost as expensive as
the color Logitech unit, but analysts say HP's entry will further
legitimize this market. HP will offer the PaperPort software with its
flatbed scanners so users can get the functionality of the integrated
filing and OCR with any HP scanner.
   Look for increased improvements in ease of use and lower prices, says
Kristy Holch, who tracks image-capture products for BIS Strategic Decisions
(Norwell, MA), a market research and consultancy firm. MicroTek (Redondo
Beach, CA) already sells its PageWiz bundle, which offers 8-bit gray-scale
scanning, an automatic document feeder, and other features, for just $199.
The company is also developing a color version. Holch says ease of use will
be a critical factor in a personal scanner's success.
   ``Conventional things like image quality, bit depth, and high resolution
that are often used to differentiate professional flatbed scanners are not
the issue here,'' she says. ``The whole thing has to be easy and
automatic.''

Illustration(s):
Illustration: Illustration: Graph: Personal Scanners
Personal scanners fit on the desktop and are designed for individual use.
They offer lower- resolution scanning than flatbed scanners because their
prime focus is document management, not professional desktop publishing.

EXPERT ADVICE HARD TO GET

Use of expert systems at help desks is declining, despite these systems'
potential and value for support. That's the assessment of the annual survey
of help-desk and customer-support practices conducted by the Help Desk
Institute. The report says a major barrier is the cost of implementing an
expert system, which typically requires personnel to feed the expert
engines. Increasing demands on support staff make it hard to free up time
to feed the system. But use of expert systems may increase in the future.
Some support programs now have cognitive engines that learn as you log
problems and requests. And vendors are teaming with providers to supply
preloaded knowledge bases.

HIGHER DATA SPEEDS COMING FOR PLAIN PHONE LINES

By:
Salvatore Salamone


New technology promises to add life to the ubiquitous plain old telephone
system. One technology, called asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL),
is an intriguing solution for Internet access, video on demand, and
videoconferencing. Unlike a related technology called high-bit-rate digital
subscriber lines (HDSL), which supports equal transmission rates (typically
1.5 or 2 Mbps) both upstream and downstream to the user, ADSL delivers much
higher bandwidth downstream than upstream. Telephone companies and
information providers will use ADSL--with existing phone lines--to deliver
high-speed services to the home or the small office.
   ADSL uses digital signal processing and multiplexing techniques to
deliver between 9 and 10 Mbps of downstream data over existing copper phone
lines (typical systems will offer about 6 Mbps). This is much faster than
V.34 modems, which offer 28.8 Kbps, and ISDN, which offers 64 Kbps (or 128
Kbps if you combine the two B channels of a Basic Rate Interface line).
Cable modems offer comparable 10-Mbps data delivery rates but require
coaxial cable to run into the home or office. Cable modems may also suffer
performance degradation as the number of users increases, but ADSL is a
point-to-point solution that shouldn't suffer from decreased performance.
   ADSL and HDSL devices plug into a regular phone line like a modem, but
unlike traditional modem technology, two people can't each just buy a modem
and dial each other up. Transceivers must be installed at the users'
premises and at the phone company's central office (see the figure).
   In addition to supporting high-transmission rates to the user, ADSL can
sustain speeds up to 640 Kbps upstream, a transmission rate suitable for
sending commands to control a movie on demand. Similarly, you can use the
upstream channel to send commands to Web pages and to take advantage of
ADSL's ability to transmit graphical images at a higher bandwidth
downstream.
   At last year's CeBIT show, Orckit Telecommunications (Tel Aviv, Israel)
demonstrated the transmission of MPEG-2 video from an NTSC videotape player
at 8 Mbps downstream and 640 Kbps upstream using a pair of ADSL modems. (A
6.2-Mbps downstream link can support four channels of compressed MPEG
video.) At the Telecom '95 show in Geneva, many companies demonstrated new
ADSL equipment and applications.
   Aware (Bedford, MA) and Analog Devices (Norwood, MA) have codeveloped a
chip set for Aware's ADSL Internet Access Transceiver. The transceiver
delivers slightly more than 6 Mbps downstream and 224 Kbps upstream over a
distance of 12,000 feet between the transceivers (data rates of up to 8
Mbps can be achieved over shorter distances).
   Until recently, HDSL required two or three pairs of copper wires (ADSL
requires one pair). But Orckit and Meta-link (Tel Aviv, Israel) have
announced HDSL chips that require just a single pair of copper wires.
Analysts say that HDSL's limited downstream bandwidth makes it less
attractive for Internet access, but these improvements should strengthen
HDSL's position as a more efficient alternative to today's T1 lines. ADSL
will enable the telephone companies to deliver entertainment services. And
using both ADSL and HDSL, they'll be able to provide PC services, such as
access to remote LANs and the Internet.

Illustration(s):
Illustration: Figure: ADSL: High-Speed Delivery
A typical ADSL system uses existing copper wires. It can deliver data from
different bandwidth-intensive services at a rate of about 6 Mbps while

FASTER ADSL

By:
S.S.

The next generation of ADSL promises to deliver even higher bandwidth over
existing copper phone lines. Several semiconductor manufacturers, including
Analog Devices and Motorola, have developed signal-processing chips for a
version of ADSL that will operate at 25 or 51 Mbps. However, delivery at
these speeds will be over shorter distances than with other
implementations--about 4000 feet for 25-Mbps transmission and 1000 feet for
51-Mbps.
   The faster versions of ADSL will be used in fiber-to-the-curb projects
currently being deployed by telephone companies. Such systems offer higher
bandwidths by bringing fiber-optic cabling to the curb of a home or
business and then using the existing copper connection to get from the curb
to the building.

BLASTS FROM THE PAST

5 Years Ago in BYTE

386 replicant on the loose. AMD finally unveiled its clone of Intel's 386.
We correctly noted that users everywhere would benefit from the competition
in the PC CPU arena. Also, Rich Seifert, coauthor of the Ethernet 1.0
specification, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the standard by asking
BYTE readers to imagine a world without networks. A world without the
Internet? We might as well imagine a world without politics or religion.

10 Years Ago in BYTE

Apple's long-awaited Japanese-language version of the Macintosh, called the
DynaMac, made its debut to favorable reviews. It featured 512 KB of RAM and
Kanji installed in ROM, and it wasn't available in the U.S. The Kanji Mac
was apparently a smart move. Japan is now Apple's second-largest market
(behind only the U.S.), the company says. Apple Japan made $1.8 billion in
revenue in its latest fiscal year, up 48 percent over the prior year.

15 Years Ago in BYTE

No-pen PDA precursor. We checked out a new hand-held computer developed by
Matsushita and Friends Amis and sold by Panasonic and Quasar. The 14-ounce
unit featured a 159-column by 8-row LCD display, 2 KB of programmable
memory (expandable to 4 KB internally), and 16-KB internal ROM with four
sockets to hold ROM applications. An acoustic-coupler modem was optional.
We said that with a little practice, the small 65-key keyboard wasn't a
distraction (but our fingers, like our waistlines, were smaller then).

PDA VENDORS IMPROVE PC LINKS

By:
D.A.


More robust links to PCs and Macs will strengthen the connectivity of PDAs
to desktop applications. Analysts don't think this improved connectivity
alone will make PDAs a household item--long battery life, a seamless
interface with wireless services, and the ability to fit in the pocket are
also important--but they say it is critical.
   Officials at several PDA companies admit that their first iterations of
PDA-to-PC connectivity solutions were limited, despite indications that
connectivity was a high priority among PDA users. A study conducted by BYTE
in 1994 showed that 89 percent of users felt that the ability to
automatically synchronize their PDAs with their desktop PC files was either
somewhat or very important; they also wanted to be able to send and receive
E-mail and faxes (see News and Views, June 1994, page 34). Now those
improved connectivity solutions are either available or under development.
   Developers are also adding PDA-to-Internet connectivity. For example,
AllPen (Los Gatos, CA; 415 399-8800), a developer of Newton OS
applications, will release Web browsing software for Newton-based
applications this year. Although the software won't initially support
graphics, it will let you upload and download information through HTML
forms.
   ``Handwriting recognition is not the PDA's killer application,'' says
Jon Hulak, senior analyst at BIS Strategic Decisions (Norwell, MA).
``What's more important to people is the ability to synchronize basic
two-dimensional database information found in personal information
managers. That's critical information, and it's constantly changing.''
   The PDA-to-PC connectivity programs are improving, but they could be
better, says Ed Colligan, vice president of marketing at Palm Computing
(Los Altos, CA), which develops PDA applications. ``Synchronizing your PDA
with your personal computer needs to be as simple as pushing a button.''

New PDA-to-PC Solutions At a Glance

APPLE COMPUTER'S MESSAGEPAD

COMING: THOUSANDS OF INTERNET ON-RAMPS

By:
Dave Andrews


A new class of low-cost devices may soon replace the personal computer as
the most common method of getting on the Internet. The phone companies, as
well as major database vendors like Oracle (Redwood Shores, CA), are
providing new ways to make it easier to access the Net.
   Philips Home Services (Burlington, MA) is collaborating with Oracle to
develop a system that will let you send and receive electronic mail over
the Internet and other E-mail systems using a screen phone. Subscribers
will receive a Philips P100 screen phone (see the photo), which has an
alphanumeric keyboard, and their own E-mail account. Paul Chapple, a
spokesman for Philips, says that although the P100 costs about $399, that
price will drop to $300 later this year and will probably fall to $200 in
1997.
   Such a phone will have numerous advantages over a PC, Chapple says,
including lower cost, faster boot-up, and smaller size. You could use it in
your kitchen or living room to tap into services ranging from electronic
banking, shopping, E-mail, and, of course, for conversing.
   The Internet-enabled screen phone does not compete directly with a PC,
Chapple says. ``You're not going to use a screen phone to manipulate large
amounts of data,'' he says. ``Instead, we see it as adding PC functionality
to the telephone.''
   At the recent Telecom '95 show in Geneva, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison
described a $500 computer that would contain almost no software and would
download its operating system and applications when turned on. The device's
primary applications will be Internet browsing, sending and receiving
E-mail, word processing, and videoconferencing. The low cost of these
devices will promote more plentiful networked computers, Ellison says.
Users will carry a smart card to pay for rental time on these computers.
And cable TV companies plan to use their infrastructure to deliver low-cost
Internet on-ramps.This approach is currently being test-trialed in parts of
France.
   One variable still unknown is how much consumers will have to pay to hop
on the Internet over these low-cost devices. Philips says it hasn't
determined if it will bill subscribers at a flat monthly rate or on a
per-call basis. Officials at AT&T, which plans to roll out a dial-up
Internet access service this year, say they haven't determined their
pricing structure either. The company does plan on having more than 200
access points to give as many users as possible Internet connections
without having to pay additional long-distance phone charges.

TWO-WAY PAGERS: THE NEXT PDA?

SkyTel (Washington, D.C.) is offering two-way paging service in the U.S.,
and others are expected to follow this year. SkyTel says it will continue
to expand coverage of its personal communications service (PCS) beyond the
1300 cities currently supported. Analysts predict that as the hardware
shrinks, and links to personal computing improve, this product category
should see tremendous growth.

Two-way Pagers Today
SkyTel Pager ($399), service starts at $25/month; 5.5 ounces; several weeks
of power on AAA battery; receive messages of up to 500 characters;
15-character responses, or 95-character responses when using optional
connection to HP palmtops; E-mail gateways.

Near Future (1996)
Two-way pagers from other companies; links to notebooks and other palmtops;
rules-based E-mail routing; bigger message capacities; two-way PC Card
pagers.

Distant Future (1997 and beyond)
Two-way pager chip sets integrate directly into palmtops, notebooks; PDAs
with integrated wireless messaging.

THE METER'S RUNNING WITH COMPUSERVE'S SPRYTE

By:
Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols


Monthly Internet access for the cost of a burger and fries sounds
appealing, but a closer look reveals the amount of on-line consumption time
will be less than satisfying. CompuServe's (Columbus, OH) new Spryte
Internet services will soon be available throughout North America and major
European and Asian cities for $4.95 per month. ``Now every family can join
the Internet,'' says Tim Oren, vice president of CompuServe's Internet
Division.
   Spryte customers will receive the Spry Mosaic Web browser; Spry Mail;
and a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) authoring tool called Home Page
Wizard. But under the $4.95-per-month plan, Internet connectivity will be
limited to three hours a month. Other pricing plans are available,
including one in which 20 hours of connectivity will cost $19.95. But after
that, additional hours on all of the plans are $1.95 an hour.
   ``Customers want flat-rate pricing. They don't want to have a timer
going when they hop onto the Web,'' says Joe Picard, marketing
representative for Digital Express, an Internet provider on the East Coast.
Picard notes that his company offers SLIP/PPP services at a rate of $35 a
month. Dan Cunningham, chief financial officer of PSI, one of the oldest
nationwide Internet providers, echoes Picard's sentiments. ``CompuServe is
just doing the same old thing by offering an hourly based pricing
system.''
   Nielsen Media Research and CommerceNet's recent survey of Internet usage
indicates that the average Web user spends six hours a week on the Net.
Under CompuServe's best plan, that means the typical user would pay $28 a
month, which is about the same as the flat-rate pricing schemes of most
Internet service providers. One advantage Spryte will have over some local
service providers in rural areas is its local-call availability, thanks to
CompuServe's widespread X.25 network.
   But even this advantage may not last for long. Ameritech, a
telecommunications company, and Concentric Network, an Internet services
provider, are collaborating to provide local-phone-call Internet access.
The two companies will offer a range of options, ranging from five hours of
monthly connection for $7.95 ($1.95 each additional hour) to unlimited
number of hours of monthly access for $29.95. A Concentric Network
spokeswoman said this service will allow any rural carrier in the U.S. to
offer low-cost local Internet access.

INTERNET SEARCHING SOFTWARE WINS BEST OF COMDEX

(LAS VEGAS)
Innovative search software for the World Wide Web won BYTE's Best of Show
award at Fall Comdex '95. The awards recognize new products that will have
a significant impact on computing.
   Voted by the editors as the best of the best new products at Comdex,
Quarterdeck's WebCompass is an intelligent Internet search engine that
queries specified Web resources in the background. WebCompass (which also
won in the Best Internet Software category) wraps a slick agent-based
interface around any searchable Web servers you specify. The program is
able to refresh the results of its searches periodically.
   The editors awarded the Best Technology prize to Digital Semiconductor's
FX!32, a translator/emulator that allows 32-bit x86 applications to run on
Alpha/Windows NT at approximately 70 percent of native Alpha performance.
   Tseng Labs took the top spot in the Display and Sound Devices category
with its 128-bit ET 6000 graphics and multimedia engine. The ET 6000
integrates a 128-bit graphics accelerator, a video image processor, and a
24-bit DAC into one chip.
   Apple Computer's Newton 2.0 operating system for PDAs clinched the title
in the OS category. This new version is better at handwriting recognition
and offers better connectivity to personal computers and a spiffier user
interface.
   Iomega's Jaz drive, which can hold a gigabyte on removable, $99 media,
was voted Best Storage Device. Deneba took the prize of Best Application
for Canvas 5, its integrated, multiplatform graphics program. The graphics
program provides image editing, text and page layout, and drawing tools. In
the Best Utility category, PowerQuest's PartitionMagic 2.0 filled the top
slot. The program lets you use partitions as flexible superdirectories.
   IBM won the Best Notebook category with its ThinkPad 760 CD. The first
thing you notice about this Pentium-powered baby is its 12.1-inch SuperVGA
active-matrix display. Intergraph iced the Best System award for its
TDZ-400 Pentium Pro personal workstation.
   Panasonic's KX PS-8000--a multifunction color laser with 1200- by
1200-dpi output--was picked as Best Printer. Ricoh's RDC-1 Digital Camera
was voted Best Input Device. This color camera also captures audio and
video clips.
   Best Communications Software went to Symantec's PC Anywhere32
remote-control program for Windows (3.x and 95), Windows NT, and DOS. The
Communications Hardware winner was Wyse Technology's Winterm 2000/2500
terminals that complement Citrix WinFrame to provide an NT workstation for
about $700.
   Multimedia Development winner was miro Computer's Video DC20, a video
editing system that combines hardware-assisted Motion JPEG compression of
S-VHS-quality video with PAL/NTSC output; it's priced below $1000.
   The honors for Best Development Software went to Oberon's Prospero, a
rapid application development tool that implements building-block-style
programming.

A PROGRAMMER NEEDS A MAID

By:
RICK GREHAN

BYTE columnist Jerry Pournelle occasionally summarizes certain products by
saying, ``If you need this, you need it bad.'' I hope he doesn't mind my
borrowing that expression, because I have to use it to describe Geodesic
Systems' Great Circle.
   The Great Circle library fixes memory-management problems. By inserting
the library at the head of your linker's library list, you allow Great
Circle to take over the C/C++ memory-allocation/deallocation routines
malloc(), free, new, and delete. The product's manual says that after
installing Great Circle, you may never have to call delete (if you're a C++
programmer) or free() (if you're a C programmer) again. The manual is
probably correct.
   Great Circle turns the C library's ``manual'' memory management system
into an automatic garbage-collecting one. Great Circle keeps track of all
allocated memory and all pointers referencing memory. And when a chunk of
memory is no longer ``pointed to,'' Great Circle deallocates it for you
automatically (it even handles ``bizarre'' structures such as circular
lists).
   The package actually contains several variations on the basic Great
Circle library. One, for example, reports memory errors. When you link it
in and run your program, it tells you where the memory leaks are while also
describing the extent of the problem.
   In one sense, Great Circle is kind of spooky--especially on the C side
of things. The manual indicates that one reason why a piece of memory may
not be reclaimed is because an integer in your program may coincidentally
contain a value that's equal to the address of an allocated block. This
means that Great Circle prowls through your program's data regions,
searching for pointers that are attached to allocated memory blocks.
   When you install Great Circle, you're tempted to simply recompile your
application with it and never think about it again. You can certainly do
this, but Geodesic recommends a less lazy approach: The company suggests
you include the reporting library in your project at development time. This
allows you to catch and correct memory errors during development rather
than rely on Great Circle to pick up your messes.
   And this points to my one concern regarding this product: It's like a
software housekeeper. When I was young, my family was lucky enough to have
a daytime maid. She cleaned up after us. Consequently, I became quite a
slob.
   If you're a Windows user running Borland C++ or Microsoft Visual C++,
Great Circle costs $495 for full support, or $345 for 60-day support. Unix
workstation users have to pay $1095 and $795 for equivalent packages. If
you need this, you need it bad.
   Contact Geodesic Systems (Chicago, IL) at (800) 360-8388 or (312)
728-7196; fax (312) 728-6096; or http://www.geodesic.com.

TAME THE NETWORK
Get a better grip on your LAN or WAN with one of these management programs

By:
TADESSE W. GIORGIS

Network administrators need an easy way to track down their company's
hardware and software assets. They also need tools to distribute and
install software automatically during off-peak hours. And when users call
the in-house help desk, support personnel should be able to fix problems
remotely. Printer and queue management, centralized virus protection, and
storage management are added bonuses.
   For this roundup, we looked at five network management products that
address these desktop issues. All provide server and workstation
management, inventory control, electronic software distribution (ESD),
software metering and license control, and network monitoring. We did not
test device- and wire-management programs for this review.
   The reviewed products fall into two functional categories. Microsoft's
Systems Management Server (SMS) and Symantec's Norton Administrator for
Networks support WANs in addition to LANs and are therefore suited to
enterprise management. Intel's LANDesk Management Suite, McAfee Associates'
BrightWorks, and Frye Computer Systems' Frye Utilities for Networks work
only on LANs. We summarize the major features common to all five in ``The
Roles of Network Management Software'' on page 148.

The Manager's Choice
   Intel's LANDesk Management Suite is the best in the LAN category, as
well as the best overall. It has a comprehensive and well-integrated set of
tools for NetWare LANs, an excellent tutorial, and a good reporting engine.
Its modules for monitoring applications, traffic, and servers are
especially good.
   For WANs, Microsoft's SMS beats Norton Administrator for Networks by a
wide margin. By using a SQL database for data collection, SMS provides an
excellent platform for building an enterprise-wide management
infrastructure.

McAfee's BrightWorks
   With its excellent on-line references, good report writer, and
versatility, BrightWorks nips at the heels of LANDesk Management Suite for
top honors. It's a good choice for administrators managing a NetWare
environment.
   Though the BrightWorks help system is a bit skimpy, its Adobe Acrobat
viewer makes accessing the well-organized on-line manuals easy. Like
Microsoft SMS, it comes with Crystal Reports. This software gives you lots
of flexibility in designing and generating reports, as well as importing
data from ODBC-compliant databases. Only LANDesk Management Suite's
reporting tool is comparable.
   BrightWorks' cluttered interface makes some operations awkward, such as
creating software distribution packages and setting up software metering.
But BrightWorks' real sore point is performance. In our test that measures
the average size of frames transferred during an inventory scan (where
larger frames mean more efficient use of network bandwidth), BrightWorks
finished dead last, not far behind Frye Utilities for Networks but light
years behind LANDesk Management Suite and Microsoft SMS. Still,
BrightWorks' competitive feature set and pricing make it a viable choice
for NetWare installations.

Frye Utilities for Networks
   Consisting of 10 separate DOS-based modules accessible from a menu
called the Frye Menu Integrator, Frye Utilities for Networks is the most
poorly integrated product we tested. Only a few of its management modules
share a common database, while each of the modules in the other four
products write to and read from a single database.
   This virtually nonexistent support for Windows and a proprietary
database scheme hamper the usefulness of Frye Utilities. The company says
it plans an upgrade that addresses these shortcomings and that will employ
a single, ODBC-based database engine.
   Individually, the Frye Utilities are by far the easiest to install, set
up, and use. But since they are all DOS applications, Windows users must
pay special attention to conventional memory allocation. Some applications,
such as the LAN Directory, can easily run out of memory after you've loaded
network drivers, multimedia device drivers, and memory managers.
   In addition, a lack of flexibility in data management and system
administration, and a total lack of an on-line reference, earn Frye
Utilities the lowest ranking in the LAN category.
   This is not to say that Frye Utilities lacks good points. The package
provides a wealth of statistics, is very versatile, and is jam-packed with
features (see the comparison tables on pages 150 and 151).

Intel's LANDesk Management Suite
   The sole four-star product in the group, LANDesk Management Suite stands
out as the only one both to fully integrate all its management and
administration components and to use a single database. Its competitors all
rely on utility modules to complete their offerings.
   LANDesk Management Suite provides a wealth of network administration
utilities with a robust desktop management environment that includes an
application monitor, an excellent traffic monitor, and an effective server
monitor with very good alert handling. It does not take much time to set up
and configure. All told, LANDesk Management Suite scores extremely well in
all our major evaluation criteria (see the ratings box on page 147).
   Very good database maintenance and system administration, coupled with
an excellent help facility, tutorial, and reporting engine, make this
product's lack of an on-line reference seem unimportant.

Symantec's Norton Administrator for Networks
   Symantec approaches desktop management strictly from the end-node angle,
so its product does not provide services such as network and server
monitoring, threshold setting, and alert notification. Instead, the Norton
Administrator for Networks integrates the three core desktop services of
inventory management, software distribution, and application metering.
   This package's chief weakness is its lack of support for NetWare file
servers. But it also suffers from a limited, inflexible reporting tool;
below-average versatility; and poor performance that is only slightly
better than that of second-worst Frye Utilities for Networks.
   On the plus side, Norton's management console facilitates many tasks,
such as managing sites, launching core applications, and interfacing with
add-on administration utilities. Good print documentation and a
context-sensitive on-line help facility make up for the lack of on-line
references.
   Norton Administrator for Networks' significant advantage over Microsoft
SMS (which did, however, beat it in the overall rankings) is its openness.
Operating at the applications level, Norton's functions are independent of
underlying network transports and should perform equally well under any
type of LAN and WAN connection method. Symantec's software is also less
complex than Microsoft's, which is based on a sophisticated SQL database
manager.

Microsoft Systems Management Server
   For companies with geographically dispersed LANs and mixed networks,
Microsoft SMS is the best choice. It combines high quality, ease of use,
efficient performance, and decent versatility. SMS lacks software metering,
but it is excellent at software distribution and has very good inventory
components. Extensive on-line help and tutorials guide you safely through
complicated tasks.
   To provide a SQL database engine for its management product, Microsoft
designed SMS with slightly higher resource needs than its competitors.
Besides a full-scale copy of Microsoft SQL Server running with Windows NT
Server 3.51, SMS requires 28 MB of RAM. Additional management consoles also
require Windows NT Server or NT Workstation 3.51. SMS has a complex setup
procedure; but, once up and running, its drag-and-drop interface and good
on-line documentation make it easy to use.
    SMS also has the most complete security system, and its performance is
comparable to that of Intel's LANDesk Management Suite. It is alone with
the Intel product in supporting the Desktop Management Interface (DMI), an
emerging standard for identifying and managing network components.

THE ROLES OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

SERVER AND WORKSTATION MANAGEMENT includes controlling configurations,
adjusting baseline (threshold) settings to define normal operation, and
monitoring status. It additionally allows automatic identification and
reporting of inactive PCs, lost physical network connections, and logging
of client packet statistics.

INVENTORY CONTROL/ASSET MANAGEMENT gathers information on computing assets,
including server and workstation hardware, system configuration, and
software. These programs automatically track applications on workstations
and servers by scanning their drives. Inventory control programs collect
hardware and software information using lists of standard hardware parts
and known applications.

APPLICATION METERING tracks software use to ensure compliance with license
agreements. Features include monitoring of concurrent execution on server
and local drives; notification when use exceeds license limits; creation
and maintenance of a registration database for authorized applications;
blocking options to enforce compliance with site licenses; and statistical
reporting. Among the products evaluated, only Microsoft SMS lacks
application metering.

ELECTRONIC SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION (ESD) lets you remotely install new
applications and upgrades. It may employ an executable program, script
file, or batch file to define distribution criteria and execute tasks.
Ideally, the ESD module works with all major operating systems and across
bridges, routers, and WAN links.

HELP DESK/REMOTE CONTROL lets administrators fix problems by taking over
the user's machine. Administrators may remotely view and edit system files,
transfer files, chat with users, execute programs, and activate
configuration changes by rebooting the remote computer.
   Only Intel's LANDesk Management Suite comes with this capability.
Microsoft SMS requires the asynchronous modem connection Remote Access
Service (RAS), bundled with Windows NT Server 3.51 (SMS's required
operating system). Symantec's Norton Administrator for Networks requires
the optional remote-control program Norton pcAnywhere for help desk and
remote control functions. McAfee's BrightWorks requires the company's
optional NetRemote software.

NETWORK TOPOLOGY AND MAPPING identifies network segments, nodes on
segments, and other logical aspects of the network and draws a diagram of
them. Of the reviewed products, only LANDesk Management Suite provides
rudimentary logical mapping (see the screen on page 147).

VIRUS PROTECTION enables centrally managed innoculation. Only LANDesk
Management Suite comes with it, while it's an optional add-on in all other
programs but the Frye Utilities for Networks, which doesn't offer it at
all.

DESKTOP SECURITY employs software distribution, inventory, and license
metering to control user privileges. The most secure products have database
passwords and data-encryption features. Among the tested products,
Microsoft SMS has the most security features, while BrightWorks has the
fewest.

Other administration utilities may include printer and queue management,
network backup and storage management, and task scheduling.

DEFINING DESKTOP MANAGEMENT STANDARDS

Although the Internet's SNMP has played a major role in network management
standardization in the last five years (and thus has gained preeminence in
network device management), it has limitations. SNMP does not address the
configuration and systems management requirements of end nodes (servers and
workstations). So, proposals for distributed desktop standards, such as the
Desktop Management Interface (DMI), have arisen in the last few years.
Among the products evaluated for this roundup, only Microsoft SMS and the
Intel LANDesk Management Suite support DMI-enabled products.
   Defined by the Desktop Management Task Force, a 300-company consortium,
DMI is an open architecture framework designed for managing computers,
servers, peripherals, and software products. When it is complete, DMI will
contain rules for creating management interface files (MIFs). These files
specify, in ASCII text with defined grammar and syntax, attributes for
classes of products.
   The openness of DMI's architecture allows it to coexist with standards
such as Plug and Play and SNMP. DMI complements Plug and Play by drawing
configuration information from it into the standard MIF database. DMI works
with SNMP by allowing MIFs to be mapped to SNMP management information base
(MIB) files (see below).


Illustration(s):
Illustration: Illustration: In the Desktop Management Interface standard,
each network component has a management interface file (MIF) that
identifies it. MIFs can be mapped to, and closely resemble, SNMP management
information base (MIB) files. That's a sample MIB file right above.

STRONGARM TACTICS
This amazing little RISC chip has PDA written all over it

By:
DICK POUNTAIN

The handwriting is on the wall: Personal digital assistants (PDAs) need
more horsepower if they' re ever going to excel at handwriting recognition
and other CPU-intensive tasks. And the breakthrough that might carry PDAs
to the next level may be a new RISC chip called the StrongARM.
   This fascinating microprocessor is a joint project of Digital Equipment
and Advanced RISC Machines (ARM). Digital, of course, makes the Alpha AXP
family, the fastest RISC processors in the world. ARM makes the ARM610 and
ARM710 processors that drive Apple's Newton MessagePad and 3DO's
home-videogame machines. The StrongARM is founded on a hybrid technology
that combines the raw power of the Alpha with the super-efficient power
consumption of the ARMs.
   It's a combination tailor-made for PDAs. The conflicting requirements of
high speed, low power consumption, and a small chip package rule out the
vast majority of off-the-shelf microprocessors.
   The first StrongARM will be a 1.5-volt chip that runs at an astonishing
160 MHz. That might seem slow compared to the 333-MHz Alpha 21164, but it's
four times faster than the speediest chip currently available from ARM, and
it blows away everything else at this low voltage. A 2-V, 215-MHz 
StrongARM will follow shortly. For the first time, a CPU that outperforms a
high-end Pentium will be available for use in battery-powered PDAs.
   ``At these performance levels, handwriting recognition stops being a
hard problem, and voice recognition is what you can start to worry about,''
says Dave Jaggar, ARM's market-development manager.

Fabricating for Low Power
   Creating a hybrid design like the StrongARM isn't as simple as gluing
together two architectures as disparate as the Alpha and the ARM. To attain
the desired clock speeds, engineers from both companies worked together to
redesign the whole data-path and cache structure of the CPU. Nevertheless,
Digital's leading-edge fabrication process is ultimately what permits the
StrongARM to run four times faster than previous ARM chips. The
architectural changes exploit the speed of this silicon.
   Digital's newest fabrication plant uses a next-generation process called
CMOS-6, the same process Digital uses for its Alpha 21164A, which will
exceed 350 MHz. It's a 0.35-micron, four-layer-metal CMOS process that
yields high-speed, low-voltage transistors, thanks to extremely thin oxide
insulation layers only 65 angstroms deep. Ultimately, this process will
yield transistors that run at 0.9 V.
   Low voltage is a crucial design point because power consumption varies
with the square of the voltage. A chip fabricated on the 2-V CMOS-6 process
will consume only 37 percent as much power as a chip fabricated on a
comparable 3.3-V process. At 1.5 V, the power consumption is only 21
percent as much. The small feature size also reduces capacitance, saving
even more power.
   The actual die size will depend on how much cache memory is on the chip.
Although this hasn't been announced, the first StrongARMs will probably
have 32 KB of primary cache. By any measure, however, the StrongARM core is
tiny--a mere 115,000 transistors, compared to 3.3 million on a Pentium.
Digital and ARM say their goal is to achieve performance of at least 300
million instructions per second per watt, at a cost of about 35 cents per
MIPS. The first StrongARM chips are expected to consume around 500
milliwatts (less than half that consumed by a PowerPC 603).
   In the consumer-electronics market, it's not sufficient just to have the
cheapest CPU. The peripheral chips--such as memory and graphics--must be
cheap, too. Very few low-voltage peripheral chips are available today, so
the Strong-ARM is designed to work with regular 3.3-V components. This was
a tough bullet to bite because it requires two different voltages on the
same silicon, with separate sets of power rails and the attendant problems
of eliminating noise and current leakage.
   To further trim costs, the engineers designed the StrongARM's system
interface so it can be either 32 or 64 bits wide. System designers can
synchronize the interface to the CPU core (at fractional speeds ranging
from one-half to one-ninth the core frequency) or to an external clock as
fast as 66 MHz.
   An even more radical design twist is that the circuits use
edge-triggered latches with conditional clocks, instead of the more common
level-triggered latches. This means the StrongARM inputs the clock signal
into a section of logic only when that section is needed, so a function
unit consumes power only when used. To go along with this, a new
instruction stops all the internal clocks until they're awakened by an
interrupt. These features should make it easier to implement energy-saving
sleep modes.

The StrongARM Pipeline
   The StrongARM team decided against a superscalar architecture.
Superscalar pipelines, multiple execution units, and all the extra logic
required to issue multiple instructions and check for dependencies would
have increased the StrongARM's cost, power consumption, and design time.
The engineers omitted out-of-order execution for the same reasons.
   Instead of going superscalar, the StrongARM engineers chose to lengthen
the execution pipeline. While the ARM7 has three stages, the StrongARM has
five. An even longer pipeline would allow higher clock speeds, but it would
also exceed the power budget. The architecture is kept as simple as
possible, with clean data paths and low-latency execution units to take
advantage of the fast silicon.
   The original ARM architecture has a dual-purpose barrel shifter closely
coupled to the ALU. The barrel shifter handles arithmetic-and-shift
operations, and it also aligns data and extracts bytes. In the StrongARM,
the barrel shifter has been moved aside so that shifts by zero bypass it
completely. This yields a faster data path for the majority of instructions
that don't need shifts.
   Older ARMs used the main ALU to calculate address displacements, but the
StrongARM does it with two dedicated +4 adders that can calculate
concurrently. These adders are attached to the program counter and the
load/store bus. The StrongARM's register file now has five ports--three for
reading and two for writing--so a load can complete simultaneously with a
write to a register, yielding a load-use penalty of only one cycle.
   The five stages of the Strong-ARM's pipeline are instruction fetch;
register read and instruction issue; execute; buffer and cache access; and
register write. In typical Alpha style, this pipeline has extensive paths
for the forwarding of branch addresses and ALU results.
   There is no branch prediction at all. Instead, the StrongARM minimizes
branch penalties by executing branches at an early stage in the pipeline.
It calculates branch addresses during the issue stage and forwards them
past the other stages. It can also forward condition codes from an
instruction in the execute stage. For example, assume the following
sequence of compare and branch instructions:

CMP R0,R1 ; compare registers
BNE loop1 ; branch if not equal

   During the execute stage, the CMP instruction sets the N, Z, C, and V
condition flags. Meanwhile, during the same cycle, the BNE instruction is
in the issue stage, computing its destination address and the address of
the next instruction (thanks to those parallel +4 adders). The StrongARM
forwards all these results directly to the fetch stage, which costs a
one-cycle penalty if the branch is taken, but costs no penalty at all for a
branch not taken.
   This yields very good performance, considering how much extra
branch-prediction logic (and hence power) it avoids. Of course, it only
works this well for a single-issue processor. With a four-way superscalar
chip, the branch-taken penalty would be four instructions.
   The StrongARM has no on-chip FPU. However, the multiplier-adder unit
attached to the ALU is significantly enhanced. The multiplier performs
signed and unsigned multiply and multiply-accumulate operations, generating
32- or 64-bit results. The multiply-accumulate instruction is similar to
the MAC instruction in a digital signal processor. The multiplier can
retire 12 bits of result per cycle, and the adder can retire 32 bits. This
yields a total latency of two to four cycles for a 32-bit result and three
to five cycles for a 64-bit result. (The timing varies because the unit
completes short operands more quickly.) While this may seem long compared
to the latest CPUs, remember that a cycle on the StrongARM is less than 5
nanoseconds.

Down to the Crossroads
   The StrongARM chip will drive into the intersection of computers and
consumer electronics. When Digital launched the Alpha processor in 1992, it
promised that the new architecture would span the whole spectrum from
workstations to hand-held devices. But the latter category has always
seemed an improbable use of the Alpha because of the chip's voracious power
consumption. The StrongARM could fill that niche.

The StrongARM is very simple by modern microprocessor standards. It devotes
no hardware to superscalar pipelines, branch prediction, or out-of-order
execution. Its data paths are streamlined to exploit Digital's high clock
speeds. For example, the shifter no longer sits in the main ALU data path,
and dedicated +4 adders calculate address displacements.

The StrongARM's five-stage scalar pipeline is optimized for clock speeds
and low power consumption. Despite the lack of branch prediction, branches
execute very quickly because the StrongARM calculates and forwards the
address information in Stage 2, bypassing subsequent stages.

THE PC IS DEAD--LONG LIVE THE PC

In ``The New PC'' (October '95) you talk about general-purpose digital
signal processors and native signal processors providing for all the user's
multimedia needs. With these new PCs (apparently) not supporting the old
ISA standard, will I still be able to add a higher-quality sound card? I
worry that this ``architectural overhaul'' is going to take away my
hardware choices, the main reason I own a PC and not a Mac. I don't want PC
computers turned into Macintoshes; I want PCs!
Dave Gross
David=Gross%TelCom%InfoSys@
banyan.BV.TEK.COM

New PCs will still allow you to add higher-capability sound cards if you
want--just as Macs do today. The idea is to deliver a machine with a
built-in repertoire of multimedia features that is standardized across the
industry so software developers can rely on it being there. New PCs won't
rob you of any flexibility, but they will make life much easier for the
majority of users and developers.
--Tom R. Halfhill, senior editor

I enjoyed ``The New PC'' cover story in the October issue. While I doubt
that the PC as we know it is ``dead,'' I can certainly appreciate your
point of view with the advent of new and breaking technology. Send my
compliments to the photo people who got the picture of the Apple Sweep. Now
that's my next PC!
Scott Bittick
scottttick@commonlink.com

I'd like to have an Apple Sweep, too. But I have a feeling that prototypes
such as the Sweep are like the concept cars in Detroit: They're cool, but
when you try to buy one, you end up settling for something that looks more
like a box.

BURIED GOLD

Your articles on data mining (State of the Art section, October) were
wonderful! As a chemical-engineering consultant, I couldn't help but wonder
if these techniques have been explored by chemical companies to ``mine''
information from the teragigadodecahedrabytes of data collected by on-line
process-control systems. Most of this information is stored in some form
but is almost never analyzed unless something goes wrong. Then, employees
scramble to try to figure out what happened by reviewing huge data caches.
Almost always, they are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data and give up
on using their own process information. Thanks for a thought-provoking
article.
Gary S. Huvard, Ph.D.
hrc@i2020.net

Data mining is a nascent field, and the first set of experimental systems
are just beginning to see the light of day. I don't know of any
applications specifically applying DM to process-related problems. The
closest I've heard of is an application developed at NASA-Ames. It uses DM
to mine RAS spectrometer data to diagnose Space Shuttle main engines. The
developers presented a paper at the First International Conference on
Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-95) this past summer.

OF WAIS, WEBSITE, AND WINDOWS NT

I have been traveling the same road as you: text searching via NT-based Web
servers. I wish I had read ``Web Search'' (Network Project, September)
before I began my journey. Like you, I have been evaluating Purveyor and
WebSite. For simple document archives, both are sufficient. But what if you
wish to be able to search different indexes? WAIS allows multiple indexing,
and the <isindex> pages can have different names. WebSite's WebIndex tool
is very easy to use, but you can have only a single global index. I was not
able to use a <isindex> search page via WebSite. Is there a fix to these
limitations?
Robert Goldschmidt, Ph.D.
National Institutes of Health
rcgoldschmidt@nih.gov

You can run freeWAIS in conjunction with WebSite. In fact, that's just what
I'm doing with our Virtual Press Room, for two reasons: the multiindex
feature you mention (I have a VPR+BYTE index, and a separate VPR-only
index), and incremental indexing with freeWAIS. WebSite's WebIndex and
WebFind tools are based on Simple Web Indexing System for Humans (SWISH),
but SWISH itself is more flexible than are WebSite's bundled versions. I've
run SWISH on Unix but don't have it for NT yet.
--Jon Udell, executive editor

I find your Web site to be very nicely done and very responsive for a poor
guy using a 14.4 modem. Keep up the good work. Now for the brickbat. In
your 20th Anniversary section (September), you mention the IRMA board as
one of the most important networking products. The picture in your magazine

THE REAL WORLD

Finally, the promise of a technology to bridge the classic Academics vs.
Pragmatics gap! Alexander Steparov's ``Standard Template Library''
(October) provides the missing link. Most working professionals realize
that while the popular journals describe how the Ph.D.s in their
laboratories are evolving the latest algorithmic advancements using
bleeding-edge superworkstations, most production programmers are coding the
binary search or quick sort for the thousandth time on the minimal
cost-effective hardware of the real world. Congratulations on brilliantly
concise yet rich coverage of this important topic.

UGLY X WINDOW

I take exception to Tom Yager's statement (``OS Paradise,'' November) that
X Window is ugly. Is he referring to the existing GUIs on top of X Window
or to the architecture? If he is comparing to NeWs or NextStep, then there
can be a lively discussion about it. But if his comparison is with
Microsoft Windows, then he doesn't know what he is talking about. You can
implement any GUI toolkit (including Windows and the Macintosh GUI ) on top
of X. Try doing this with Microsoft Windows (in all its different flavors).
I would prefer the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) over Windows 95 any
day. If you want a slick interface, try SGI's DeskView. Lest readers think
I am unduly biased toward X, I have a few bones to pick with X, but I guess
I have the entire skeleton to pick with Microsoft Windows.
Harish P. Hiriyannaiah
harish@infosoft.com

I've used and programmed under X Window far longer than under Microsoft
Windows. While I'll confess to being a fan, X Window's support for
commercial applications is still sadly wanting compared to Windows or
Macintosh. Pick either of the most widely used toolkit layers--OSF/Motif or
Open Look--and check out any complex element (the standard File Open dialog
box, for example) that also exists in Windows. The Motif version doesn't
measure up to Windows' when viewed from any perspective: look, feel, or
API. CDE is gorgeous, but it doesn't fix toolkit-level issues. I use X
Window every day, but when I run commercial applications, I run them on a
Windows system. There are reasons we find far more mainstream applications
for Windows than Unix. X Window is one of those reasons.

LINUX FAN CLUB

``The Linux Phenomenon'' (November) implies that Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD
are difficult to use. I have installed and used Linux, commercial Unix, and
OS/2, and I can say that Linux is no more difficult than the others.
Ken Sinner
ksinner@solaria.mil.wi.us

Your ``OS Paradise'' article was very informative. However, I was
disappointed to see that Linux was not given the same treatment as other
OSes in the article. We are running the largest UUCP network in Pakistan on
Linux machines. Our gateway machine, a 486 DX2 with 16 MB of RAM, running
Linux 1.2.13, caters to more than 650 UUCP nodes. It has never crashed and
has served all our needs.

We'll give Linux a thorough road test in our Unix Special Report in the
February issue. --Eds.

UNMISTAKABLY APPROACHABLE

By:
Alan M. Stoughton


Loyal users of earlier versions of Lotus Approach and anyone looking for a
versatile desktop database will love Lotus Approach 96. Always a winner of
high marks for ease of use, this 32-bit version for Windows 95 and NT
stands toe-to-toe with its worthy opponent, Microsoft Access 7.0.
   SmartMaster, which is a new applications builder, quickly puts together
forms and tables for more than 50 familiar applications. Several new
assistants, interactive aids that do the intricate relational-design work
behind the scenes while you focus on defining the business aspects of data
and results, make their debut in Approach 96.
   The find assistant's point-and-click, fill-in-the blank query builder
allows you to quickly find database records. You can then name the
statements you build and save them for recall and execution. Named queries
also help select items for a report, a set of mailing labels, a worksheet,
or a chart. During report design, data appears in your layout due to the
enhanced report assistant, which shows a WYSIWYG preview of printed
output.
   Enterprise users will find improved integration and connectivity to
Lotus Notes and tighter integration with Lotus SmartSuite and Microsoft
Office. A new team-security feature controls access rights, assigns
passwords, and manages group or individual privileges. Approach 96 can
participate as a basic OLE client or as an OLE 2 automation client or
server. You can register, select, and address OCXes as you can internal
objects.
   The program continues its use of dBase IV as its default database
structure, with options to work with dBase III, FoxPro, Access, Paradox,
SQL Server, Oracle, and ODBC data sources. The beta version BYTE evaluated
stumbled when asked to open an Access 2.0 database, but it worked fine with
a FoxPro 2.5 file. The company explained that the problem was related to
the unavailability of Microsoft drivers for Access 2.0 and higher. A
solution is expected. LotusScript is supported by an object browser,
editor, and debugger, for those who need to venture into the Approach 96
IDE to customize their applications.

TAKE YOUR DESKTOP WITH YOU

By:
Selinda Chiquoine


Gateway 2000's 120-MHz Solo V120 represents several industry firsts. It's
one of the first portables with Intel's new 120-MHz Pentium for mobile
systems. It also offers the new Start and application keys found in Windows
95 keyboards for desktop systems. The Solo V120 comes close to supplying a
one-system solution, with the features of a high-end desktop PC in a
lightweight multimedia notebook.
   Intel's 0.35-micron manufacturing process accounts for the CPU's small
footprint (less than half the size of its 75- and 90-MHz siblings) and
subsequent low power consumption. However, the Solo systems use Opti's
Viper-N chip set rather than Intel's, which limits data streaming to around
60 MBps, whereas Intel's Mobile Triton chip set would support 100 MBps.
   With 256 KB of external burst-mode cache memory, 16 MB of RAM, a
removable 720-MB hard drive, a double-speed CD-ROM drive, 16-bit sound,
Microsoft Office Pro, and a 10.2-inch active-matrix VGA LCD (Super VGA is
optional) with 1 MB of video memory on a VL-Bus, the Solo V120 easily
fulfills Gateway's features and power goals. At 6.3 pounds without the AC
adapter but with the floppy drive, its weight is acceptable. The results
turned in by the Solo V120 on BYTE's Thumper II battery tests--2 hours, 43
minutes--are about 30 minutes less than that of the 90-MHz Pentium-based
Dell Latitude XPi P90T.
   The sleek 2-inch-thick letter-size case feels solid. The screen is large
and well protected but difficult to see in bright light. The Alps EZ Pad
pointing device and the floppy drive are integrated rather than hanging off
the notebook's edges. Other features are a PC Card Type III slot and a
modular bay (not hot-swappable) for a floppy drive or CD-ROM drive. The
machine has IR, serial, parallel, VGA, and PS/2 mouse ports. An optional
docking bar duplicates many of these but adds a line-out audio jack and a
MIDI/game port.
   The Solo V120 represents a remarkable achievement: a cool-running
120-MHz mobile computer that performs 30 percent faster than a 90-MHz
desktop system. But after just 2 hours and 10 minutes of word processing
with advanced power management on, the battery is kaput.

THE ULTIMATE PENTIUM REFERENCE

By:
TOM R. HALFHILL

How nice it would be if thorough reference works such as The Indispensable
Pentium Book were published immediately after a chip came out. Every time I
write about a new chip, no matter how detailed my story, dozens of BYTE
readers bombard me with E-mail asking for more information. Usually, there
aren't any sources to which I can point them.
   But even though we had to wait two years for this book, it's still worth
reading. It covers the Pentium in more detail than anything except the
official manuals from Intel. Unlike the official manuals, it offers a more
independent point of view. For example, it doesn't shy away from discussing
(albeit too briefly) rival microprocessors from AMD, Cyrix, NexGen (before
the announced merger, of course), and the leading RISC vendors.
   Is this book truly indispensable? Yes, if you're a systems designer, CPU
engineer, or avid wirehead. But average users will find it too technical.
The book stumbles when it tries to woo beginners. For instance, a
complicated explanation of real-mode segmented memory inexplicably precedes
a tutorial on binary numbers. But if you already know something about CPUs
and crave arcane knowledge about Pentium pin-out signals, cache protocols,
branching algorithms, exception handling, and much more, this book is the
answer to your prayers.

SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST

By:
Rick Cook

EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION: TOWARD A NEW PHILOSOPHY OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
by David B. Fogel IEEE Press, ISBN 0-7803-1038-1, $49.95

Evolutionary Computation serves as an introduction to the murky crossroads
where hot new technologies--genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy
logic, and AI--collide. The underlying notion is attractive. Instead of
designing software from algorithms, let a thousand flowers bloom. Generate
many possible software solutions, let them compete against each other, pick
the top performers, and combine their features according to rules that
mimic natural selection in the living world. Given enough ``generations,''
so the theory goes, you will end up with a superior solution that embodies
survival of the fittest.
   The practice is more complex, and the theoretical underpinnings are
messier. For one thing, not even biologists agree on what they mean by the
word fitness, and Fogel points out that the two major definitions (gene
frequency and population fitness) have very different implications for
designing software that evolves. Concentrating on gene frequency produces a
bottom-up approach that stresses decomposing the process and building from
elementary pieces. Using population fitness tends toward top-down
solutions. Given that the algorithms for real-world problems are complex
and nonlinear, neither approach is completely satisfactory.
   Evolutionary Computation's strength is David Fogel's approach. He is
neither immersed in the minutiae of his subject nor does he make grand
pronouncements. The general reader who wants to know what the fuss is about
will find Fogel's approach both informative and stimulating.

TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL

By:
Jeff MacClay

WITH OPEN EYES Voyager, 1 Bridge St., Irvington, NY 10533, (914) 591-5500,
$39.95

BEETHOVEN LIVES UPSTAIRS BMG Interactive Entertainment, 1540 Broadway, New
York, NY 10036, (212) 930-4000, $39.95

CD-ROMs meant for children are either great or horrible. The great ones
inspire and teach in a natural way, letting the child discover new material
and concepts in an intuitive, game-like fashion at his or her own pace.
   With Open Eyes fulfills this mandate nicely. It runs on Macintosh System
7 and higher or Windows 3.1 and higher, and it takes a child on a
fantastic, interactive tour of some 200 pieces of art from the Art
Institute of Chicago. Not only is the tour educational, it's fun. Humorous
icons, simple enough for even a four-year-old to understand, playfully

IS YOUR NETWORK SECURE?
Securing your corporate network while connecting to the Internet doesn't
have to be difficult. Just start with a good foundation.

By:
DAN THOMSEN AND WINN SCHWARTAU

When building new systems, there are always design trade-offs to be made
between functionality and security. Do we include the cool widget or that
boring, constraining security feature? Historically, the widget usually
won. But as Internet connectivity grows, a new class of criminals is
causing electronic mayhem and committing crimes.
   Despite the fact that strong, easy-to-manage information security is on
the top of corporate wish lists, it is often pushed to the bottom of the
heap when it comes to implementation. Security is never free, but you can
reduce the cost of secure systems by creating flexible security mechanisms
as a solid base to build on. Type enforcement is a straightforward security
mechanism that provides the flexibility to balance security and
functionality.

The Dawn of Computer Security
   In 1985, the federal government published the first set of computer
security criteria that computer professionals could understand and build
into systems. Officially called the Trusted Computer Security Evaluation
Criteria, it is more popularly known as the Orange Book. It offers a range
of ratings for secure systems. The ratings start with D, for systems with
no security, and go to A1, which requires formal methods to verify
security.
   One of the key elements of the Orange Book was mandatory access control,
where all the resources in the computer (i.e., users, files, services, and
programs) are labeled with a security level, or sensitivity. The label
identifies the degree of sensitivity of each resource, such as
Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. Labels effectively
assign the data on the system to separate ``buckets.'' The goal, or
security policy, is to keep sensitive data from getting into the
least-sensitive bucket.
   Many initial Orange Book implementations were too restrictive. The
federal government funded seven years of R&D to create a flexible
implementation. At the heart of this solution is the type-enforcement
security model.

Type Enforcement
   Type enforcement is a security mechanism that gives every program on the
system permission to do only those things it requires to do its job. This
is called least privilege and applies to applications, files, and OSes.
   Type enforcement works by grouping all the processes of the system into
classes based on least privilege. Each process group is called a domain. In
a similar manner, the files on the system are grouped into classes called
types. The Domain Definition Table on page 156 describes each domain's
access rights for each type. The table cannot be changed while the system
is running.
   The DBMS can interact only with database files, and the text editor can
interact only with user files. The World Wide Web server can read user
files but not modify them and is the only domain with access to the
network. A similar table is constructed for controlling how domains can
interact with each other.
   One of the most important file types is the executable file. Tight
controls are placed on which programs can be executed in a domain and who
can modify them. Destructive software, such as viruses and Trojan horses,
can be stopped cold because they cannot modify the executable files.

Assured Pipelines
   Providing separation of applications is not enough to ensure security;
you must also control how the information flows through the system. Type
enforcement creates a kind of pipeline to organize data flow between
programs (see the figure ``Assured Pipeline'' above).
   Many applications are part of larger systems. To assure that information
moves securely, type enforcement controls the data each program can read
and write. Each program can only read from the stage in front of it and
write to the next stage of the pipeline. No stage of the pipeline can be
skipped, and how the data flows through the system is tightly controlled.
   A divide-and-conquer approach to building secure applications is another
advantage of assured pipelines. By splitting a large program into smaller
pieces, it is easier to analyze and be sure the pieces are operating
correctly.
   For example, suppose you wanted all the outgoing mail messages to be
digitally signed before leaving your network, to prove who sent the
message. You could modify the word processor to include the digital
signature, but it would be difficult to make sure you modified it in all
the correct places. If instead you created a program whose job was to check
for the digital signature, you could feel confident the program was working
correctly. By using an assured pipeline, you can make sure no data reaches
the network software unless it has passed through the new data filter.

Type Enforcement in a Firewall
   Today, type enforcement has been incorporated in a firewall to provide
flexible isolation between networks. Isolation between the Internet and an
organization's internal network is extremely important to protect against
malicious attack. Type enforcement offers an ideal mechanism to isolate
internal corporate and organizational networks from the Internet.
   If a firewall is to secure internetwork access, placing it on an
insecure platform makes little sense. Incorporating type enforcement allows
for a flexible policy to be enforced. Equally important is to make the
policy mandatory--do not let key security information be changed while the
system is connected to the hostile network. This eliminates the possibility
of ``helpful reconfigurations'' by Internet hackers.
   Separate the two networks on the inside of the machine. An Internet
firewall's prime goal is to keep the information separate until a security
check has been performed to verify that the information is permitted to
cross the policy-driven barrier. The solution is network stack separation,
using two distinct network cards.
   A type-enforcement firewall with two network cards can also always tell
where information originated, no matter how clever the intruder. The two
network feeds are connected to two domain-separated network drivers, thus
preventing network protocol spoofing (i.e., an advanced hacking technique
where attackers handcraft network packets to mask their true origin). The
two stacks maintain control over the information coming from either side.
Only software defined and controlled by type enforcement can determine
which information may move between networks (see the figure ``Using Type
Enforcement in a Firewall'' below).
   Always be on the lookout for malicious acts. If any software on the
system tries to access information outside its bucket, either the software
is flawed or a potentially harmful entity is controlling it. Take control
of the situation. Watch the software more closely through auditing, or shut
the software down immediately.
   Finally, apply the concept of least privilege. By limiting the privilege
a system has, the amount of damage that can be caused if that system is
compromised can be limited. Consider, for example, the sendmail program. It
is the network server that receives and forwards mail on most Internet
hosts. Unfortunately, sendmail has been littered with vulnerabilities that
have let attackers take control of an entire system. The latest
vulnerability revolved around the syslog system call letting attackers
overwrite sendmail's stack and take control of sendmail. Once in control,
the attackers started an interactive shell program and launched their
attack on the rest of the system.
   Using type enforcement and least privilege prevents the syslog
vulnerability from being exploited without changing the sendmail code.
Sendmail is placed in a separate domain that can only read data from the
external network and write data into the queues to be forwarded to the
internal network. Sendmail cannot cause other programs to be created or
executed.
   Even if the attacker got control of sendmail, all he or she could do is
interrupt the mail service, which could have been done anyway using a
network flooding attack. Because type enforcement controls execution, the
hacker could not even execute an interactive shell and would have no hope
of penetrating other domains.

Not Just for Firewalls
   Many other applications can be secured cost-effectively using type
enforcement. Nowhere is security as critical as it is in cryptographic
systems. Key management controls, encryption algorithms, key distribution,
public-key repositories, and other critical subsystems can all be tightly
controlled in their own protected domains.
   Applying type enforcement and its data separation is a natural extension
to databases containing sensitive information. And in environments where
strict controls are placed on communications resources, type enforcement
can control access to the communications resources and make sure that the
software allocating the resources cannot be tampered with or bypassed.
   By their nature, secure systems are more expensive to build. As a
result, secure products often lag behind in current functionality. If you
are going to get the features into secure systems in a timely and
cost-effective manner, good tools are needed. Nowhere is that more
important than in putting the right building blocks in the OS.
   The type-enforcement security mechanism gives the OS a solid foundation
for securing applications. Type enforcement can be used to protect
applications from malicious modification by outsiders, other errant
applications, and the application itself.

MORE CONTROL, FEWER HEADACHES
You can cut support costs and hassles with integrated configuration
management tools

By:
SALVATORE SALAMONE

If you're a network administrator, you crave control. You've probably got a
list of tools you'd like for that purpose. A centrally administered menu
(in the form of a Program Manager-like shell) on each desktop could help
control how users access networked applications and control what users have
access to. This kind of control can reduce LAN support costs.
   A configuration management tool can help you manage all those desktops.
Several vendors, such as Novell, Symantec, McAfee Associates, and Computer
Knacks, offer such tools today. Typically, these packages allow a manager
to edit WIN.INI files, script commands, and limit a user's desktop choices
(for example, by removing the DOS-prompt option or by making ``Open'' under
the File menu nonfunctional).
   The desire for configuration management is not limited to Intel-based
PCs running Windows. Last year, configuration management was one of the
factors that earned Digital Equipment's Multia MultiClient system the BYTE
Best of Comdex award in the category of desktop computers (see ``Notebooks,
NT Clusters Capture Awards,'' February 1995 BYTE). The Multia is
essentially a low-cost Alpha-based Windows NT workstation that comes
bundled with configuration management features. One of the main advantages
of Digital's Multia line is the set of configuration tools; they give users
a lot of control over their desktop environment.

Integration with OS and NOS
   Configuration management tools are becoming more tightly integrated with
either the network operating system or with systems management tools. For
example, rather than just linking an icon on a user's screen to an
application on a specific server, a configuration management program might
link the execution of an application with a software metering program. In
that way, when all the licenses for a particular application are used up,
the icon associated with that application would no longer be displayed on a
user's screen. Or, you might connect levels of access (e.g., read-only vs.
write) with an organizational structure previously defined in a Novell
Bindery or network directory service. So when a new sales associate is
added to the network, for example, that person would automatically be able
to look up customer account information, while a newly added sales manager
would automatically be given the privilege to make changes in customer
files.
   Configuration management of the desktop is becoming increasingly popular
because many managers see it as a way to reduce their rising LAN support
costs. Over a five-year period, the average cost per user for LAN support
is $3278, according to the Gartner Group. That's more than $2 million per
year, on average, for a 700-node LAN. In contrast, the average annual cost
per user for equipment (including network server hardware, desktop adapter
cards, cabling, hubs, connectivity software, and installation fees) is only
$885 (most of which is spent in the first year when equipment is
purchased).
   A cost-of-ownership study by the Meta Group found similarly high numbers
for LAN support. Meta estimates that the cost per client over a five-year
period is $19,504 (or about $3900 per client per year).
   Configuration management tools can reduce the administrative burden on a
LAN staff in a number of ways (see the list on page 160). By replacing the
standard Windows Program Manager with a centrally administered desktop
manager, you can get rid of many potentially confusing options. For
example, you might provide icons only for programs the user has access
rights to. Or, you can remove the Properties Menu option on a user-by-user
or group-by-group basis to prevent tampering.
   At a higher level, you could integrate network rights into the desktop
environment to reduce administrative tasks. For example, if the marketing
group is allowed access to a graphics application, adding a user to the
marketing group in SYSCON would make the graphics application icon appear
on the user's desktop automatically. Therefore, double administration is
not required.
   User interfaces also make it easier for people to get at networked
applications and resources. Users need only click on an icon to start an
application or to gain access to a resource, such as a printer. This
reduces training costs.
   A well-designed user interface hides the complexity of a network
operation. For instance, launching an application from a UI can
transparently handle changes of directories (to load a data file) and can
direct the output to a printer specifically set up for a particular
application. Without the UI, the user might need to know where a data file
is located, how to change directories to load that file, and how to direct
the output to that printer. None of these tasks is monumental, but for a
user unfamiliar with network directories or, for that matter, uncomfortable
with working on a computer, commands to perform these tasks may seem like a
foreign language.

Helping Win 95 Users
   Some companies are looking at configuration management tools to save
training costs associated with moving to Windows 95. As Windows 95 is
rolled out in an organization, a company using a configuration management
tool may opt to keep a Windows 3.x Program Manager-like interface displayed
on everyone's PC. That way, the users see no change at all. When a
department completes its Windows 95 training, the LAN manager can go to a
centrally administered configuration tool and make the necessary
adjustments so that each PC shows a Win 95 display rather than the Program
Manager-like display.
   Another way a configuration management tool can help with the migration
to Win 95 is by controlling access to Win 95 applications. Suppose you're
moving to Win 95 department by department. You'd like users who've been
upgraded to have access to the new applications, but you don't want users
still running Windows 3.x to try running Win 95 applications (that could
mean nervous breakdowns at the help desk).
   Ordinarily, it's a nightmare trying to handle this mixed environment.
However, this administrative task could be made easier if a configuration
management tool is tightly integrated with systems management software. For
example, you might use a software-inventory program to determine if a PC is
running Win 95. Ideally, you'd like to be able to take this information and
automatically make it available to a centrally administered desktop
configuration management tool; then, a user will see a Win 95 application
icon only if his or her PC is capable of running it.
   In some cases, you might have two versions of an application on the
network--say Word 6.0 and Word for Win 95. You can probably appreciate the
administrative nightmare one would face trying to match a user's access to
these programs based on whether (and when) they've been upgraded to Win 95.
Again, you'd like to be able to off-load some of this administrative work.
It would be very helpful to have the icon for the most current application
be displayed automatically when a user's PC is upgraded.

Limit Options and Limit Problems
   Good user interfaces also reduce network management costs. Basically, a
UI limits a user's options, thus restricting the types of problems a staff
has to deal with. A central configuration tool can make certain things
invisible to the users. For example, as you add file servers, a particular
application might move from one machine to another. For some users this
change can be upsetting. They may have step-by-step instructions on how to
open a particular file. Then when a file moves, their normal routine won't
work. They might not know enough about DOS directories, NetWare drives, or
off-the-shelf applications to be able to figure out how to do things like
change a directory to get the file.
   You could also use a configuration tool to link a hardware-inventory
program and a user's ability to run an application. This would let you
check to see if a user's PC has the appropriate video card or enough memory
to run a particular application, for example. If a user's machine doesn't
have the right stuff, you'd like that information to be passed to a Windows
configuration management program so that the icon for that application is
not displayed on that machine. This would head off an application bombing
and mean one less call to the help desk.
   Configuration management tools can also be used to help project the
corporate identity. A bank that uses PCs to show customer account
information might not want a Beavis and Butt-Head screen saver flashing on
the screen. A configuration tool can make sure every terminal displays the
corporate logo instead.
   Such control over the desktop environment will be possible as new
configuration management tools become more tightly integrated with the NOS
or with systems management tools. LAN administrators will thus have better
control of user access to applications and data.

THE REAL SOFTWARE CRISIS
The shortage of top-notch programmers threatens to become the limiting
factor in software development

By:
Bruce F. Webster

Grady Booch calls it ``one of the dirty little secrets of software
engineering'': Success in software development depends most upon the
quality of the people involved. In his book Software Engineering Economics
(Prentice-Hall, 1981), Barry Boehm rigorously shows individual and team
productivity to be the leading predictor in estimating software costs; it's
twice as significant as product complexity. And any decent book on building
and managing a software team urges you to ``hire the best people.''
   Ah, there's the rub. Perhaps you've noticed that it's getting more and
more difficult to locate and then hire the best people. This isn't an
illusion; it's real, it's significant, and it's only going to get worse. It
is, in fact, the heart of the real software crisis: There is more software
to be developed than there are capable developers to do it. Demand will
continue to outstrip supply for the foreseeable future. Hence, more and
more software will be behind schedule, over budget, underpowered, and of
poor quality--and there's nothing we can do about it.
   ``Nothing?'' you ask. ``What about better schools, better tools, better
on-the-job training, better methodologies?'' Those are essential because
they raise the quality of most developers. But they do not solve the
fundamental problem.
   The conclusion I have reluctantly come to after more than 20 years of
software development is this: Excellent developers, like excellent
musicians and artists, are born, not made. The number of such developers is
a fixed (and tiny) percentage of the population. Thus, the absolute number
of such developers grows very slowly. At the same time, the demand for them
expands rapidly due to the world's increasing use of, and reliance on,
software.
   The situation is worse than it appears. Some of these innately talented
people never go into the computer industry. Many who do never develop their
full potential. Others become prima donnas, demanding large salaries and
extreme benefits. Or they become ``cowboy programmers,'' shooting from the
hip and holding teams, projects, or entire companies hostage. A few burn
out and leave the field. Of those left, only a fraction meets the
requirements for your project.
   This is not to slight the decent, talented software engineers, the ones
who study hard and work hard at developing and maintaining their skills.
Indeed, if not for them, we wouldn't have a software industry at all. But
even they can't meet the demand, and their efforts are undermined by the
mediocre (or worse) programmers.
   Suppose that companies needed in-house orchestras to produce quality
music. The demand for musicians would explode, and their starting salaries
would soar. Think about the vast number of people (especially college
students) who would take up music regardless of their talent or
inclination, guaranteed an entry-level position because companies were
desperate to fill all those seats.
   Here and there, a great soloist or ensemble would play with passion,
skill, and creativity, but much of what musicians produced would be
cacophony, especially as the newcomers and those lacking talent and skill
struggled with unfamiliar instruments and pieces. Now imagine that jobs,
companies, and lives depended on how flawlessly the players performed.
   This scenario describes the current state of software development. I saw
this for the first time when I went back to teach computer science at the
same place I had studied a decade earlier. The enrollment of computer
science majors had gone up by almost a factor of 10, yet a professor who
had been there since I was a student noted that the absolute number of
really excellent computer science students remained the same.
   In the years since my graduation, my experience in building and working
with development teams has confirmed this. Ask any manager how many resumes
and interviews it takes to find a top-notch software architect or
developer.
   As needs, costs, and opportunities escalate, some great breakthrough--a
``silver bullet,'' to use Frederick Brooks' classic phrase--may yet quell
the software crisis, reducing the complexities of development. If you wish
to bet on that, go ahead. But in the meantime, keep your eyes and your
checkbook open and grab the great programmers when you can--they're getting
really hard to find.

CLEAN UP: C++ GARBAGE COLLECTION
Here's a tool that helps you keep your code clean by taking out the trash

By:
JUSTIN MILLER

Every C++ programmer at one time or another has had the following problem:
Somewhere, somehow, your program calls new more times than it calls delete.
Or perhaps it's the inverse: Your program tries to use an object that's
been deleted. Maybe it deletes an object more than once--perhaps two, even
three times.
   These related problems can manifest themselves in mysterious ways. A
temporary string object doesn't get deleted; your program continues to run
but inexplicably exhausts memory. Other times, the manifestations are not
so mysterious. A routine attempts to dereference a pointer that is pointing
to a deleted object and the whole program crashes spectacularly.
   It's difficult to keep track of all the objects you have to delete.
Consequently, during design time, you're forced to repeatedly ask: ``When
is it safe to delete this object?'' Because this is often a tough question
to answer, this ongoing wrestling match with memory almost always
complicates your design. And even the most meticulous programmer makes an
occasional error, leading either to a global protection fault (or its
equivalent) or memory that's never freed.

Pandora's Box Closed
   The solution to all this is a garbage collector. With a garbage
collector, you never have to delete anything. The collector automatically
deletes an object when your program no longer references that object. If
you've seen garbage collectors, you're probably concerned about their
performance. Some work by ``waking up'' intermittently and searching
through memory for objects that can be deleted. This can bog down the
application.
   The speed of a garbage collector depends on its type. The most general
types of garbage collectors--which do, in fact, search through memory--are
slow if you compare them to ``manual'' memory management (i.e., explicitly
using delete). However, most of the time your program won't need such a
complicated collector. A reference-counting garbage collector is
sufficient.
   A reference-counting garbage collector is fast because it doesn't have
to search through memory. Instead, for every object, it keeps a running
count of the number of pointers that point to that object (this running
count is the object's ``reference count''). Every time a pointer is
assigned to point to an object, that object's count is incremented. Every
time a pointer is reassigned to point to a different object, the original
object's count is decremented, and the count on the object to which the
pointer is newly assigned is incremented. Also, every time a pointer goes
out of scope, the count for the object to which it pointed is decremented.
   Because the garbage collector keeps track of the number of pointers
referencing the object, it knows that when the reference count for an
object reaches zero, the object can be safely deleted (if there are no
pointers to the object, your program can't access the object).

Limitation
   The only drawback to such a garbage collector is that it can't
``collect'' cyclical structures. For example, suppose you have three
objects, A, B, and C. They are tied to one another in the form of a
circular list: A contains a pointer to B, B contains a pointer to C, and C
contains a pointer to A. Initially, some other pointer may have pointed to
A, but that pointer has gone out of scope and, consequently, this circular
structure is no longer accessible from your program. It should be put in
the garbage.
   However, since each object points to the next member of the loop, each
of these objects still has one outstanding reference. As a result, a
reference-counting garbage collector won't collect the members of this
structure; they will be ``leaked.''
   If your program does include a circularly linked list, that doesn't mean
you cannot use a reference-counting garbage collector. You can arrange to
have the garbage collector properly delete the structure, using what I call
the ``linchpin'' method. With this technique, you pick one object in the
cycle to be the linchpin object. When your program no longer needs to use a
circular structure, it pulls the linchpin; that is, your program sets all
pointers inside the linchpin object to null, thereby breaking the loop.
Since the loop has now become a linear list, the garbage collector can
delete the remaining objects appropriately.

C++ to the Rescue
   At this point, though you may be inclined to agree that a
reference-counting garbage collector would be a fine programming tool,
you're probably concerned about the time you'd have to spend to build one.
And if you do decide to build one, you must be exceedingly careful in its
construction: Any errors in the reference-counting code of the collector
would produce an unacceptably leaky garbage collector.
   Happily, C++ operator overloading permits you to implement a completely
transparent and foolproof means of reference counting. I've used this
concept to create the reference-counting garbage collection system
accompanying this article.
   RGC, my reference-counting garbage collector, defines two template
classes. These template classes emulate pointers by overloading the =, ==,
*, and -> operators. Behind the scene these operators do the reference
counting for you. Whenever the reference count of a particular object falls
to zero, these operators delete the object.
   You needn't be aware of the reference counting at all--it's entirely
transparent. And because you're unaware of the ongoing reference counting,
you can't make any mistakes regarding it. This ensures the accuracy of the
reference counts and hence the reliability of the garbage collector.

Using RGC
   Incorporating RGC in your next C++ development project is simple. First,
you'll need to include RGC.h in your source files. This file defines three
classes: TRGCObj, TRGCRef, and TRGCRefObj. The first, TRGCObj, should be
declared as the virtual public superclass of any object to be managed by
the garbage collector. TRGCRef is a template class. Its parameter is the
type for which it will act as a pointer. This type must inherit from
TRGCObj. The third class--TRGCRefObj--is also a template class. TRGCRefObj
is just like TRGCRef, but it inherits from TRGCObj so that it can be
tracked and deleted by the collector. TRGCRefObj exists so that the system
can support the equivalent of pointers to pointers.

Inside RGC
   TRGCObj includes two member functions, RegisterReference and
DeregisterReference. These functions respectively increment and decrement
an object's reference count. Additionally, they return the updated number
of outstanding references.
   Garbage collection takes place inside the TRGCRef template class. At any
given time, one of its instances (which I'll call a reference from now on)
either points to a valid object in memory or is null. TGRCRef overloads the
assignment operator so that every time a reference is assigned a value, two
things happen. If the reference had previously been non-null,
DeregisterReference is called on the object to which it had been pointing.
Then, if the reference is being assigned to a non-null value,
RegisterReference is called on the object to which it is to point. This
keeps an object's reference count accurate as assignment operations occur.
   Additionally, the TRGCRef destructor handles the situation of a
reference's pointing to an object when that reference is destroyed. The
destructor calls DeregisterReference on the object to which the reference
points. This keeps an object's reference count accurate when references go
out of scope or are deleted.
   Finally, if DeregisterReference ever returns a 0, indicating that there
are no outstanding references to a particular object, the reference will
delete the object.

An Example
   Examine the following listing fragment:

#include ``rgc.h''
class myclass : public virtual TRGCobj
{ };
typedef TRGCRef<myclass> Pmyclass;
void main()
{
Pmyclass A = new myclass;
Pmyclass B = new myclass;
A=B;
}

   When A is assigned to the pointer returned by new, the
TRGCRef::setpointer function is called. This stores the pointer to which A
is being assigned and calls RegisterReference on the object to which it
points. The second assignment (of B) does the same thing.
    But when A is assigned to B (the third assignment), a series of calls
within the overloaded assignment operator cause DeregisterReference to be
called. DeregisterReference will return a 0, since A had been the last
reference to the object it had been pointing to. The garbage collector will
delete this object (the result of the first new).
   This assignment also causes RegisterReference to be called on the object
to which A is being assigned. This increments the reference count in the
object.
   When the main function concludes, the destructors for the local
variables (A and B) are called. The destructor for B is called first, which
causes DeregisterReference to be invoked on the object to which B refers.
DeregisterReference returns a 1, since A still points to the object. But
when the destructor for A is called, DeregisterReference will be invoked on
that same object and this time will return a 0, causing the object to be
deleted.
   Note that it is important not to use ``regular'' pointers to an object
that is to be garbage-collected. A regular pointer will not be counted in
the reference count, so it's possible that the object will be deleted while
your program still holds an outstanding pointer to it.

Keep It Clean
   RGC also handles pointers to pointers. For a reference that is a
``second level'' pointer--i.e., a reference that points to another object
and that is itself pointed to--you must use TRGCRefObj. This allows the
garbage collector to work on references just as it works on objects; when
there are no references to the reference, the reference will be
garbage-collected.
   The above applies to arbitrary depths of pointers. In general, the
outermost layers of pointers may be implemented as either TRGCRef or
TRGCRefObj types; inner layers must be implemented as TRGCRefObj types.
   RGC is a simple, efficient, and robust reference-counting garbage
collector that releases you from having to keep track of when to delete an
object. It thereby ends memory leaks, ensures that you never free an object
too soon, and simplifies your code. In short, it will make you more
productive and make your C++ programs more reliable.

Illustration(s):
Illustration: Illustration: A reference-counting garbage collector's
weakness is a circular structure. Even though all outside references to the
structure are gone, each member still has an outstanding reference pointing
to it.

Illustration: Illustration: RGC is available from the BYTE Web Site at
http://www.byte.com. RGC includes RGC.h, a test-driver program, and a
self-tracing program that prints messages whenever an object is created or
destroyed or its reference count changes.

DEAD CHICKENS AND PORTABLE DATA
Jerry offers advice on disaster recovery and looks at ways to access
data--anywhere

By:
JERRY POURNELLE

Years ago, I told the VP of marketing at AT&T that if they bought KFC,
they'd end up advertising hot, dead chicken. He sighed and said, ``The
worst of it is that we'd probably advertise warm, dead chicken.''
   So AT&T bought NCR and turned it into AT&T Global Information Solutions.
Having admitted they couldn't market a cure for death, AT&T took a company
that could market small computers and slaughtered it. While they were at
it, they let NCR wring the neck of AT&T's most exciting product, the Safari
laptop. It was one of my favorite laptops--small, very portable, built-in
communications. While AT&T desktop marketing wasn't very hot, they had some
good technology, and they were beginning to move with the Safari. After NCR
was dragged in, no journalist I know ever heard from either AT&T or NCR
again. The Safari was never updated--if there are new models, I never got
the word. We can't review what we don't hear of.
   It's up to marketing to make us aware of new products, or at least that
there are new products, because I guarantee you there are plenty of outfits
out there who do let columnists know. I confess I hadn't thought of AT&T
for a year when I was reminded by a Wall Street Journal article of just
what a fiasco the AT&T/NCR merger became.
   The pity of it all is that if ever there was a company that ought to be
booming in these days of Internet and Unix popularity, it surely ought to
be AT&T. Who else would be better suited to sell you a Unix box that you
can hook directly to the Internet? I used to have one here at Chaos Manor.
Perhaps there's an updated system, but if so, they sure haven't let me know
about it. Alas.

Every now and then I get a panic E-mail message about disk drives with lost
chains, cross-referenced or nonmatching file allocation tables (FATs), and
other disk woes. Alas, I don't have time to do more than send a generic
answer. I usually advise them to try Norton Disk Doctor run from a floppy
disk. I figure that if they had Norton Utilities (NDD comes with NU)
already installed on the hard disk, they'd have tried NDD and said so. In
any event, the one thing you don't want to do if you have a disk in trouble
is install something new on it or write to it in any way.
   NDD allows you to make an Undo disk that will put things back the way
they were. You can put that on a floppy disk or on a network disk (never on
the disk you're working on!). As long as you do that, you're reasonably
safe, with one exception I'll get to in a second.
   If NDD fails, your next step depends on how important the data is. If
all you stand to lose is a few hours of installation time, you can try
mucking about with NU yourself. For example, DOS keeps two copies of the
FAT. They're supposed to match, but sometimes they don't. If you know which
one is good, you can tell NU to use the good one and ignore the other.
There are other such tricks. All are fairly dangerous in that you can lose
your files forever, but that's the worst that can happen. If that won't be
a complete disaster, you can use NU to try to recover from some stupid
application that wrote garbage in the wrong places--or more likely,
something dumb you did.
   You may even be able to recover compressed files. It doesn't say so on
the box, but NU for Windows 95 works quite well in DOS (which is where you
ought to be working if you're trying to recover files; using a disk editor
in Windows or Windows 95 [W95] is just asking for trouble). It will work on
Doublespace compressed drives.
   Understand, I don't recommend file compression. Gigabyte disk drives
sell for under $299 now, and recently we got a 3-GB drive for about $700.
With hardware that cheap, why take chances? Although file compression
usually works fine, there's a small but real chance that you'll lose
everything on one of those compressed logical drives. It's also
inconvenient.
   If you do use compression software, you really need to have NU installed
in your system. It probably won't be good enough to recover you from your
disaster, but it might be.
   If all else fails, there are data-recovery experts. My son Alex is a
partner at Workman & Associates in Pasadena, California. While they mostly
do installation and maintenance consulting, they also do data recovery. You
should be aware that this can get downright expensive. You're much better
off buying the hardware and software it takes to do frequent backups. Most
of the people who end up paying Alex to recover their data knew that, of
course.
   If your data is important enough to pay recovery experts to retrieve it,
don't use NU. And don't write to your hard disk if you can help it; because
if your problem is a failing hard disk, recovery is going to be very
difficult, and anything you write to that disk is likely to make things
worse.
   Clearly, your best bet is to make good backups before you have problems;
and if your data files are important enough that you'd be willing to pay
for their recovery, they're important enough for you to buy a tape drive.
For that matter, they're probably important enough to protect with a RAID
system or full mirroring.

I don't like Franklin Quest's Ascend 5.0. I don't like the colors, and I
particularly don't like the way it handles telephone calls. It uses the
Microsoft Dialer, which means that if you hang up the phone after your
call, your software doesn't know you've done that; and until you go back
into the software and tell it that you've hung up, it keeps the phone tied
up. It also keeps a log file open that is ``timing'' the call long after
you hung up.
   The result was that I didn't use Ascend 5.0 to dial. I'd look up the
numbers in a paper book; but since I wasn't using Ascend 5.0, I wasn't
entering new numbers in it, so I got to losing phone numbers.
   I'm not sure what I had against the rest of Ascend 5.0, but I went for
almost two months without using it. The result was a mess. I wasn't able to
keep track of appointments. I was losing phone messages. I didn't have any
priority to my work. That clearly could not go on.
   Therefore, I went back to Ascend 4.0. It has a few flaws that version
5.0 was supposed to fix, but I can live with them; and it's just easier for
me to use. The colors are brighter. It has a phone dialer that knows when I
have hung up the phone. It took me about 2 hours to go through the nine
weeks in which I hadn't updated appointments, kept my journal, done my
reports, and dealt with my priority task lists, but eventually I was done
with all that.
   The effect on my work was immediate. No more jotting down little notes
on scraps of paper and losing them. Now I have a record, and even better,
it's a record I can search. With luck, version 6.0 will be as good as
version 4.0, but with the bugs fixed; until then, I can't live without
Ascend, but I can sure live without version 5.0.
   One good thing came of all this: I rediscovered the joys of paper
logbooks. The problem with an electronic log is that you often don't have
it with you, and often you want to make handwritten notes. Carrying a
printed copy of the electronic log and using that to jot notes in doesn't
work well because the resulting book is too thick to carry easily.
   For years I carried Borum & Pease hardbound composition books. They're
like the ones you see in the drugstore, but they come page-numbered. Since
I have the habit of taping business cards, letters, and newspaper clippings
into my logbook, I've found it makes sense to use nylon strapping tape to
reinforce the binding. When I dropped Ascend, I started a new logbook. I'm
going to continue to carry that. The result is I have a book that
supplements my electronic Ascend records nicely.
   One day I suppose I'll have a personal digital assistant (PDA) that I
can carry about and jot notes into. My son uses a 286 DOS-only monochrome
Gateway HandBook for that purpose and has mastered the art of typing fast
with one hand while holding the system in the other. I still need a place
to set the HandBook down, and thus it's as easy to keep the Gateway 2000
Liberty in my briefcase. The bottom line is that so far there is no PDA as
convenient as a paper logbook, especially if you also use Ascend on your
laptop and desktop.
   Incidentally, I have friends who like Ascend 5.0 and can't figure out
why I don't.

I love little computers, but every now and then I wonder. I have two
communications from the Gas Company. One threatens my life, or at least my
credit, as well as warning that they're about to cut my gas service off for
not paying my bill. The other letter tells me I have overpaid my bill, have
a credit balance, and should not send any money.
   Something else from the same mail is prettier: two beautiful simulated
handwritten notices from a charitable order I belong to exhorting me to pay
my Pentecostal obligation. They are identical, and you have to look close
to see they weren't handwritten.
   Alex says these are reminders of how awful the world would be if it were
written in COBOL.

I guarantee you a frustrating experience installing the CDSourceBook of
American History, especially if you're running W95; but eventually you'll
get it up, and if you're at all interested in the fundamental documents of
America, you'll be glad you persevered.
   I had two distinct experiences with the installation from CD-ROM. The
first time, the installation program ran; but at about 98 percent done, it
said there was an error copying system files. If that happens to you,
cheer, because you're nearly done; just ignore the error message. You'll
still have to make your shortcut and put it on the start-up toolbar, but
that won't be a real problem.
   Alas, I didn't do that after it happened on Pentafluge, the big Pentium
that runs W95. I went over and tried the installation on SuperCow, the
Gateway 2000 486DX2/66 that runs Windows for Workgroups 3.11. It didn't
install easily there, either, requiring that I reset the machine at least
once, but eventually it was finished with no harm done.
   The CD-ROM is packed with information, from accounts of Columbus in
Spain, through George Washington's early military career through the
Revolution and right on up to World War I. All the major documents, such as
Magna Charta, the Mayflower Compact, Declaration of Independence, Articles
of Confederation, and Constitution are there. So are the entire Federalist
Papers. There are eyewitness accounts, literary works, Washington Irving,
and so forth.
   But there's more. You get Woodrow Wilson's six-volume work, History of
the United States. There are all the inaugural addresses of the presidents.
There's James Madison's two-volume Journal of the Constitutional Debates.
There is, in a word, nearly every original source and most secondary
sources needed to teach American history, all indexed and searchable.
   The viewing engine is Folio Views, about which more later. There's one
quirk you need to know about. To make it easier to find and copy material
from this wonderful collection, there is extensive paragraph
identification, useful for scholarly quoting but annoying if you're just
trying to read the documents. It's neither intuitive nor documented, but
you can turn that off. Pull down the View menu, and click on the item
Hidden; that will toggle the paragraph identifications.
   Every schoolroom and home student in America ought to have this disc.
It's that good. Highly recommended.

Attendees at Comdex and other computer shows know something about Folio
Views, because for the past few years, the convention directory has been
given out on a floppy disk. BYTE chooses the Best of Comdex show awards,
and the Folio Views-based disk sure has made my life easier. I can search
out new products by category, find booth and suite numbers, and suchlike.
This year, I am going to take the neat little Citizen PN60 printer and use
that to make out my show itinerary.
   The Folio Views 3.1 Infobase Production Kit builds databases you can
take with you. It comes in several levels, from a simple user database
construction kit through a professional kit that includes licenses that let
you distribute the run-time viewer with your product--that's what comes
with the American-history CD--to a Software Developer Kit that lets you
extend their tools and hook the whole thing in with other programs. It's
all industrial-strength software and priced accordingly. It's also pretty
solid.
   You can get your data nearly anywhere, provided you respect applicable
copyright restrictions, of course. Nexis and Lexis are obvious sources, but
in fact almost any Internet site may furnish one. If you have any level of
Folio Views, you can get a free tool called Folio Retriever that goes out
on the Internet, grabs information, and puts it into a Folio Views-editable
flat file complete with links and a table of contents. You compile that to
make a Folio Views database you can use off-line. It's portable, and it can
be copied. You can use this technique to grab a whole bunch of stuff from
the World Wide Web and evaluate it at leisure. You can then use another
tool to turn all that into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents and
put them on your own Web server.
   The Folio Views 3.1 Infobase Production Kit comes with conversion
filters for getting data out of most word processor document formats. The
version I have doesn't seem to know about older database formats like Q&A,
but I'm told the Software Developer Kit has the tools for constructing
nearly any filter device you like; and Folio Views knows how to bring in
data from any ASCII file-format system.
   Like askSam, Folio Views isn't the simplest thing to learn, but once you
have it down, it's a lot more powerful. It can be used to build salable
products from document collections or just to organize data for your own
use. I can't claim great familiarity with Folio Views and Folio Retriever,
but as Chaos Manor appears to be sinking beneath vast amounts of
information retrieved from the Web, I think I'm about to be. I've seen many
useful products built from Folio Views. If you're drowning in unorganized
data or you have an idea for a product based on documentary information,
this may be just what you need.

In The Mote in God's Eye (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, Pocket Books),
the characters all carry pocket computers that are tied into a central
database, thus linking everyone to everyone else, as well as to all the
knowledge of humankind. When we wrote that in 1970, we carefully did not
describe how it all worked, but we did make it clear that you used a stylus
rather than a keyboard.
   We now have Zenith's CruisePad set up in Chaos Manor. CruisePad is a
clipboard-size, stylus-controlled system that uses radio to link into a
regular computer network. You can connect a keyboard to it if you want, but
that gets clumsy, and if you're going to do a lot of typing, you'd probably
be better off with a laptop or palmtop. Where CruisePad shines is with
mouse-controlled operations. You can use it to make a big desktop do
anything you could do with a mouse.
   That includes accessing your Internet server or other databases. It also
includes Internet access; and most Web browsing is done by mousing around.
You can also ``type'' short replies with the stylus: you call up an image
of a miniature keyboard and tap away at the keys. That's frustrating for
touch-typists, but hunt-and-peck addicts get pretty fast with it.
   The real merit of CruisePad is for structured actions. Years ago, I
speculated that one day doctors making hospital rounds would have a
clipboard computer that would give them the patient's chart, let them make
entries, digest the information, and offer suggestions on diagnosis and
treatment. That's no longer speculation. Teaching hospitals are testing
such systems. You can even enter prescriptions with CruisePad. The result
probably won't be reliably machine-readable, but the handwritten bit map
can be attached to the patient's chart, a copy can go by fax to the
pharmacy, and a clerk can complete the data entry from a central location.
   I don't know if anyone is doing this now, but it wouldn't be difficult
to construct a program that compares the recommended treatment with what is
standard; does the same thing with dosages, taking into account the
patient's body weight; looks in the record for contraindications; and
flashes a warning if the physician has specified something outside the
normal envelope. That would certainly eliminate careless errors.
   To go from the sublime to something else, muffler and transmission shops
are also using CruisePad. Tap the screen, and up comes a list of makes and
models. Use the stylus to let the computer know the model and year, and up
comes a picture and a list of symptoms. Tap (as opposed to click) in the
appropriate places, and out comes a repair recommendation and cost
estimate.
   The U.S. Navy is trying to replace paper with CD-ROMs. The problem with
that was summarized by Gordon Eubanks, who was a submarine driver before
becoming CEO of Symantec. If you're crawling around inside an engine trying
to find out where to put a wrench, the last thing you need is to have to
come out to look at a screen. With CruisePad, you can carry the screen with
you, and as long as data access is mouse-controllable, it would be plenty
good enough.
   To utilize CruisePad, there are three ways to connect to your network:
CruiseLAN/PCMCIA, for computers with a PC Card Type II slot; CruiseLAN/ISA,
a card for AT-type bus desktop PCs and servers; or CruiseLAN/Access Point
relay boxes, for extending coverage to up to 1000 feet in diameter in
normal office environments. With a CruiseLAN/Access Point connected
upstairs, I was able to control SuperCow from every downstairs room. A
larger establishment like a hospital could put CruiseLAN relay boxes in
several places; one would almost certainly be enough for a small clinic or
mechanic's shop.
   Setting up CruisePad isn't all that hard, but you do have to get the
drivers loaded in just the right order and just the right way, and that can
be tricky. Small companies without technically competent people may want
some help, either from a franchising parent organization or outside
consultants, to get it running.
   Designing the custom database applications to make CruisePad useful is a
much bigger deal. On the other hand, given tools like Visual Basic and
Folio Views, even that's getting a lot easier, since mostly you're trying
to anticipate what data will be entered. Body temperatures, after all, have
a rather narrow range.
   More on CruisePad after we get used to it. It's not the pocket computer
from Mote, but it's sure a lot closer to it than I thought I'd have at
Chaos Manor in 1995.

For years I've talked about Mrs. Pournelle's reading program, which teaches
systematic phonics. Now, the state of California has rediscovered phonics
after over 30 years of denigrating phonics instruction, and everyone is
interested. The older version required a tutor, but the fancy new Mac
version teaches reading by using the Mac sound system to give the lessons.
She's been trying it out in selected Los Angeles schools, and the
documented results are pretty astonishing: up to five years' grade-level
improvement in reading ability from a few months of lessons with her
program.
   Roberta got enough inquiries that she wanted to make a fancy new manual
with a color cover. Unfortunately, the images she wanted to print were on
the Mac version of the program. And the only color printer we have is the
Fargo Electronics Primera, which works only with PCs. That meant we'd have
to transfer the image from Mac to PC.
   You can do that with CorelDraw 5. I have CorelDraw 6, and at some point
I'll have to install it; I'm told there are a lot of new features. You may
want to hang onto version 5 if you get version 6; readers are reporting a
variety of odd bugs. In any event, CorelDraw 5 did the job. Reading an
image in Mac format and then cropping and adjusting it to be saved in DOS
format turns out to be tedious but not all that difficult.

The most intriguing thing I read this month wasn't a book but an article in
the October 1995 Atlantic Monthly, in which Clifford Cobb, Ted Halstead,
and Jonathan Rowe examine the concept of Gross Domestic Product. When I was
in aerospace engineering, we were warned against what was called ``the
figure of merit fallacy'': the notion that you could take a complex system
and use some math to reduce its performance to a single number, which you
could then optimize. GDP is a classic case of that. The theory is that the
faster GDP grows, the better the economy. The problem is that GDP includes
everything, good and bad; under the GDP concept, the greatest economic hero
would be a cancer patient getting a triple bypass while starting divorce
proceedings. GDP, in a word, is all credits and no debits, and that's
insane.
   The authors propose a remedy that would be worse than the disease, but
their diagnosis of the problem is good.
   When I first began writing this column, I got a call from the then
director of the office that prepares the Consumer Price Index. He wanted to
know if there was some way the government could use small computers and
modems to compile the CPI. At that time, they were getting data from cities
all over the country, punching it onto IBM cards, and mailing the boxes of
cards to a mainframe. The postage alone was running a couple of hundred
thousand dollars a month.
   The CPI is in the news this week: since Social Security and other
entitlement increases are keyed to it, getting it right can be the
difference between government solvency and bankruptcy. Everyone is sure
it's wrong. There's no agreement on new ways to compute it, but at least
small computers make adjustments possible.
   GDP is in many ways more important than CPI; and my guess is that small
computers will make it possible to adjust it so it discriminates between
production and crime. All we have to do is agree on how.

The computer book of the month is by Charles Kaufman, Radia Perlman, and
Mike Speciner, Network Security: Private Communications in a Public World
(Prentice-Hall, 1995); it's both readable and complete, and if you have
anything to do with network security, you need this book.
   One last bit of advice: if you have W95 running stably, be very careful
how you muck with it. More on that next month.

AMD K6 TAKES ON INTEL P6
AMD's new K6 (formerly the NexGen Nx686) is the first x86 chip with special
multimedia instructions

By:
TOM R. HALFHILL

It takes a lot of nerve to add new instructions to the x86 instruction set
if your name isn't Intel. And it's especially cheeky if you're a tiny
company like NexGen, barely a mosquito on Intel's back.
   Yet that's what NexGen hoped to do. Last October, the company announced
its latest microprocessor, the Nx686. It was the first x86 chip to
integrate a multimedia execution unit and a new set of multimedia
instructions. Never before had anyone but Intel attempted such a bold
revision of the 18-year-old x86 architecture. Could anyone take NexGen
seriously?
   Then came stunning news. NexGen--which ranked last behind Intel,
Advanced Micro Devices, and Cyrix as a vendor of x86-compatible
chips--agreed to be acquired by AMD. And AMD promptly scrapped its own
sixth-generation CPU project in favor of the Nx686, which will now be
marketed as the AMD K6.
   The surprise announcement instantly boosted the prospects for NexGen's
maverick microprocessor. AMD is a $2 billion company that has serious
marketing muscle and high-profile customers, including five of the top six
suppliers of PC compatibles. In addition, AMD has its own process
technology and wafer-fabrication plants. NexGen, a fabless company,
subcontracts its manufacturing to IBM Microelectronics. (This partnership
may continue for some products, including the Nx586.)
   Suddenly, Intel faces stiffer competition for an emerging market of
multimedia CPUs. While NexGen was developing the Nx686, Intel has been
working on its own multimedia x86 processor, code-named the P55C. This
Pentium variant will probably make its debut in the second half of this
year, about the same time as the Nx686/K6. Intel isn't releasing many
details, but we know the P55C will also define new multimedia instructions
for the x86 architecture.
   Of course, Intel still wields more clout than AMD and NexGen. Only by
joining forces with compiler vendors, software developers, and perhaps
other chip makers can AMD ensure that the K6's multimedia extensions will
survive alongside Intel's. Before the merger, NexGen claimed it was part of
such an alliance but said the other members weren't ready to go public.
When the time is ripe, company officials say, it will be apparent that the
alliance has enough strength to make the extensions a de facto industry
standard.
   That remains to be seen. Even without its multimedia enhancements,
however, the K6 is still an impressive chip. If it lives up to
expectations, the K6 could match or beat the performance of Intel's
flagship processor, the Pentium Pro (formerly called the P6).

Multimedia Marvels
   The K6's multimedia execution unit is one of seven execution units in
the new processor. NexGen says it occupies only about 5 percent of the
chip's die area. Because the K6 is not yet in production, NexGen won't
reveal the actual die size, other than to claim it will be ``substantially
smaller'' than the Pentium Pro's die of 306 square millimeters. The
multimedia unit probably accounts for less than 300,000 of the K6's six
million transistors.
   That's not a lavish expenditure in the transistor budget of a
leading-edge microprocessor these days. But what does it buy? NexGen says
the multimedia unit recognizes about 10 to 20 new instructions. All are
designed to streamline multimedia processing, such as digitized audio,
digitized video, 3-D graphics, MPEG-2 decompression, motion estimation, and
pixel manipulation. According to Greg Favor, who directed the chip's
development, the extended instructions are fairly general in nature, so
they won't become obsolete as the industry defines new standards.
   One new instruction performs the same kind of multiply-accumulate (MAC)
function often seen in digital signal processors (DSPs). Programmers can
use the MAC instruction to multiply and add a series of numbers repeatedly
without a branched program loop. It's faster than regular x86 code because
the CPU doesn't have to execute separate instructions for the multiply and
add operations or evaluate a branch during each iteration of the loop.
   NexGen won't say much about the other new instructions, except that they
adhere to a single-instruction/multiple-data (SIMD) model, just like some
DSPs. In other words, each instruction operates on multiple operands of
data. That's ideal for multimedia, which typically consists of lengthy data
streams that must be compressed, decompressed, or otherwise transformed. In
concept, the K6's new instructions resemble a similar subset of multimedia
instructions that Sun Microsystems defined for its UltraSparc processor in
1994.
   Externally, the new K6 instructions are as accessible to programmers as
any other x86 instructions. However, NexGen hints that application
programmers probably won't have to explicitly call the new instructions
because they'll be encapsulated by higher-level APIs, such as Microsoft's
Direct-X for Windows. Certainly an ally such as Microsoft would be useful
to an industry alliance that wants to extend the x86 architecture without
the blessing of Intel. (Microsoft has no comment on this.)
   Internally, the K6 translates the multimedia instructions into RISC86
operations--the RISC-like primitives that were the most innovative feature
of the Nx586 when it appeared in 1994. The Nx586 was the first x86
processor to introduce this concept of a decoupled CISC/RISC
microarchitecture. On the outside, to x86 software, the chip behaves like a
normal x86 CPU. But inside, special decoders translate the variable-length
CISC instructions into fixed-length (albeit long) RISC-like operations that
execute in a RISC-like core.
   NexGen, Intel, and AMD are now using decoupled microarchitectures in all
their latest CPUs. They believe it's a better approach than trying to
execute multiple CISC instructions in parallel and out of order. The only
holdout is Cyrix; engineers there say a decoupled microarchitecture will
become too difficult to manage in wider superscalar designs.
   Favor says the K6's multimedia instructions are easy to execute in
parallel because they're more efficient than most x86 instructions. Each
one breaks down into just one or two RISC86 operations. The MAC
instruction, for example, translates into a single RISC86 primitive that
typically executes in a single cycle.
   According to NexGen, the multimedia unit can execute up to 6 billion
operations per second (BOPS). That's amazing if true. The fastest
general-purpose DSP--Texas Instruments' TMS 320C80 Multimedia Video
Processor--executes about 2 BOPS.
   Until AMD makes the K6 available for independent benchmarking, however,
it's unclear how often the processor will be able to sustain 6 BOPS. TI's
chip appears to have more internal bandwidth, and it uses a
multiple-instruction/multiple-data (MIMD) model instead of a SIMD model
like the K6 uses. If the K6 comes anywhere close to sustaining 6 BOPS when
running real-world multimedia software, it will be a significant
accomplishment.

Bottlenecks Begone
   There's a lot more to the K6 than its multimedia unit. The new chip
fixes several shortcomings of the Nx586 by adding larger caches, multiple
decoders, more registers, deeper queues, and additional execution units. As
a result, the K6 is now a four-way superscalar processor; the Nx586 is a
three-way design.
   However, NexGen has discarded two key features of the Nx586: the
integrated cache controller and the dedicated bus for the secondary (level
2) cache. These were casualties of NexGen's last-minute decision to make
the new chip pin-compatible with the P54C-series Pentiums. As a
pin-compatible part, the K6 will work with the same peripheral chips as the
Pentium--for example, PCI chip sets designed by third-party vendors.
   But the downside of this decision is that the K6, like the Pentium, now
requires an external cache controller and will access its secondary cache
(if present) over the same 64-bit bus it uses for memory I/O. Sharing the
same bus hurts performance because of bus contentions.
   To compensate for this performance loss, NexGen has greatly expanded the
K6's onboard cache. The primary (level 1) caches in the K6 now total 64 KB,
compared to 32 KB in the Nx586 and only 16 KB in the Pentium. The caches
are evenly split, with 32 KB each for instructions and data. Both caches
are two-way set-associative and support the MESI protocols for
cache-coherent multiprocessing. The data cache is dual-ported and isn't
banked, thus eliminating bank conflicts. It can handle one read operation
and one write operation per cycle.
   NexGen also added a 16-KB predecode cache that's closely coupled to the
instruction cache (I-cache). The predecode cache holds special information
that's generated when the K6 fills the I-cache. For example, as part of its
predecoding, the K6 locates and marks the boundaries between x86
instructions, which are variable in length. (This step is unnecessary in a
true RISC processor because RISC instructions are always fixed-length.)
Predecoding speeds up full decoding further down the pipeline; AMD's K5 has
a similar stage.
   However, one drawback of predecoding is that it lengthens the x86
instructions by appending extra information to them. In the case of the K6,
each instruction byte gains 4 bits (1 nibble) of predecode data. This
threatens to effectively reduce the working size of the I-cache by 50
percent. To avoid this size penalty, the K6 stores the extra nibbles in the
16-KB predecode cache. Then, when the K6 fetches instructions from the
I-cache into the instruction buffer, it simultaneously retrieves the
nibbles.
   The K6 also marks branch instructions during the predecode stage and
calculates their target addresses. All branch predictions are based on a
two-level dynamic algorithm with a 2-bit history flag (strongly taken,
weakly taken, weakly not taken, and strongly not taken). The K6 stores
these flags in an enormous branch-prediction table that can hold 8192
entries. It also stores the return addresses and target addresses in two
additional caches that each hold 16 entries. As a result, the K6's branch
prediction is well over 90 percent accurate, putting it in the same league
as the Pentium Pro and ahead of other x86 processors.

Parallel Decoding
   Where the Nx586 could decode only one x86 instruction per cycle because
it had just one instruction decoder, the K6 has two decoders and can handle
two x86 instructions per cycle.
   The Pentium Pro has three x86 decoders, but two of them can deal only
with simple instructions, and the most complex instructions are detoured
into a microcode ROM. NexGen claims the K6's decoders are more capable:
They're not constrained by instruction groupings that would stall the
Pentium Pro's simple decoders, and they can decode a larger subset of x86
instructions without using microcode. (Of course, the most complex or
rarely used x86 instructions still invoke microcode.) NexGen says it
considered adding a third decoder, but simulations revealed a performance
gain of only 2 to 5 percent in return for a frequency loss of 15 to 20
percent--not a good trade-off.
   Although the maximum input to the decoders is two x86 instructions per
cycle, the maximum output is four RISC86 operations each cycle. That's
because the CISC instructions usually break down into two or more RISC-like
primitives.
   Examples: INC register translates directly into a single RISC86 register
operation; ADD register, memory gets reduced to a load operation and a
register operation; ADD memory, register results in a load operation, a
register operation, and a store operation. The worst x86 instructions can
generate dozens or even hundreds of RISC primitives. In those cases, the K6
can issue as many as four RISC86 operations per cycle from its microcode
ROM.
   The K6's pipeline gets wider toward the middle. During each clock cycle,
two x86 instructions can enter the decoders; four RISC86 operations can
exit the decoders; six operations can issue and execute; and four
operations can retire. This bulge in the middle of the pipe minimizes
bubbles and stalls and keeps the seven execution units from twiddling their
thumbs.
   The traffic cop that manages all this action is the instruction control
unit (ICU). It temporarily holds up to 24 RISC86 operations and issues them
to the appropriate execution units. This is also where the instructions get
out of order. The ICU can issue up to six instructions per cycle in any
order to any available execution unit, as long as there are no dependencies
between instructions. (An example of a true dependency is when one
instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction.)
   To reduce the chances of so-called false dependencies--instances where
register-dependent instructions might stall because there aren't any
available registers--the K6 has a large set of 48 general-purpose
registers, compared to 14 in the Nx586. Eight of them represent the eight
logical registers of the x86 architecture. The K6 can temporarily rename
the other 40 physical registers to represent any of the eight logical
registers. When a register operation retires, the K6 copies its value into
the corresponding architectural register. This is quite similar to how the
Pentium Pro uses its set of 40 physical and eight logical registers.
   A feature called register-result bypassing allows the K6 to make
completed results immediately available to subsequent instructions without
accessing main memory. Because register operations are much faster than
memory accesses, register-result bypassing can save numerous clock cycles.
Also, NexGen claims the K6 is particularly fast at loading segment
registers and at handling partial register operations. This means that it
should outperform the Pentium Pro when running 16-bit software.
   However, the K6's ICU draws from a smaller pool of pending instructions
than the Pentium Pro's instruction scheduler: 24 versus 40. And the ICU
can't track more than 12 x86 instructions at a time. A larger instruction
pool--which is a window into the running program--would allow more
flexibility when issuing instructions out of order. Still, the K6 is more
flexible in this regard than the Nx586.

Execution Time
   In addition to its innovative multimedia unit, the K6 has six other
execution units: a load unit, a store unit, two integer units, a branch
unit, and an FPU. Again, this is a significant improvement over the Nx586,
which has only three execution units and is the only fifth-generation x86
processor without an integrated FPU.
   The K6's separate load and store units will speed up memory reads and
writes, a prominent barnacle on the hull of CISC instruction sets. Each
unit has a two-stage pipeline. The store unit feeds results into a
seven-entry queue that temporarily holds them until the CPU completes all
previous instructions and resolves any dependencies. Holding them assures
that all instructions retire in original program order, regardless of the
order in which they executed.
   One exception: If a load operation depends on a pending store, the load
can bypass the store and fetch the value directly from the results queue.
Since this happens before the store unit actually writes the value to
memory, it eliminates another slow memory access.
   The K6's two integer units are not symmetrical; one can handle a
superset of arithmetic operations, including multiplication and division.
Most operations execute in a single cycle, and multiplication requires only
two cycles. Floating-point math appears to be fast, too. Although the K6's
FPU is not as heavily pipelined as those in the Pentium and Pentium Pro,
its latencies are shorter. NexGen says most floating-point additions,
subtractions, and multiplications will execute in only two cycles.
   As mentioned, the branch unit is among the most efficient in any x86
processor. Much of its work is done early, because it calculates target
addresses while decoding. If the correct target address isn't cached, the
branch unit calculates and fetches the new target during the next stage,
paying only a one-cycle penalty. However, if the branch unit mispredicts a
branch, it needs about five cycles to recover--not an unreasonable penalty
for a CPU whose predictions are more than 90 percent accurate.
   Overall, the K6's pipeline is five or six stages long, depending on the
operation. Register and integer operations typically require five stages,
and load/store operations need six. The K6 isn't superpipelined like the
Pentium Pro, so it probably can't be driven to the same high clock
frequencies. NexGen hopes to achieve superior performance with
architectural efficiency, not extreme clock speeds.
   NexGen has been testing silicon samples of the chip since September, so
the engineers can roughly estimate its actual performance. They say they
expect that the K6, at equivalent clock speeds, will beat the Pentium Pro
when running 32-bit software, and perhaps outrun it by as much as 33
percent. With 16-bit software, NexGen expects the K6 to run about twice as
fast as a Pentium Pro.
   If the K6 can deliver that level of performance on a die as small as
NexGen suggests, the new processor could achieve a significant
price/performance advantage over Intel's top-of-the-line chip. When you
throw in the multimedia goodies, the K6 looks even better.
   Of course, nobody--including AMD and NexGen--expects to dislodge Intel
as the king of the x86 market. But the K6 chip could carve out a
respectable niche and presage the multimedia microprocessors of the
future.

UNIX TAKES OFF
Unix makes Boeing's 777 something special in the air

By:
CATE T. CORCORAN

It was a long and stormy flight. A voice rang out, ``Fasten your seat
belts, return your tray tables to their upright and locked positions, and
please refrain from grepping until we're safely on the ground.'' Unix has
invaded the cockpit.
   You're probably thinking, off-the-shelf software is fine for word
processing, but only custom code has the right stuff for life-critical
applications such as aerospace. Right? Not anymore. Granted, the Boeing
777's autopilot isn't built on a Microsoft Word for Windows macro, but
Boeing did break with tradition by incorporating commercial code in the
maintenance display system on its new 777. The result: Engineers say they
cut costs, reduced development time, and still met the FAA's requirements
for quality-assurance testing and reliability.
   The Unix-based Maintenance Access Terminal (MAT) displays the health of
the plane. According to its designers, MAT is one of the first systems
using off-the-shelf software that the FAA has allowed on an aircraft. MAT
could be a first step toward eventually using standard software in
more-critical parts of the plane. The 777's overall maintenance system,
including MAT, could further save money by reducing the time planes stay on
the ground while mechanics diagnose and fix problems.
   The challenge for Boeing was to find a ready-made OS that could handle
its need for real-time response and reliability yet still be small enough
to fit within the memory constraints of an aircraft. Furthermore, the
system had to be compatible with third-party applications and add-ons.
   Boeing subcontracted Rockwell International-Collins Avionics (Cedar
Rapids, IA) to write custom software and integrate it with Venix EDS, a
commercial version of Unix from VenturCom. Rockwell also specified MAT
hardware and aircraft-based LAN components, which had to meet the special
requirements of an aircraft environment.

Keep It Up
   The 777's maintenance equipment tracks dozens of systems on the
aircraft, including the engines, engine-control systems, and landing gear.
The data-collection devices and the system that runs them are not part of
MAT. MAT provides only the hardware and system software for a maintenance
application and user interface (UI). MAT displays maintenance data on a
flat-panel LCD connected to a 486-based PC. The display sits in the
cockpit behind the first officer, so the pilots and ground crew can see it
as they board. Ground crews can also receive MAT data by connecting PCs to
ports outside the plane.
   Designers say the maintenance system reduces paperwork and centralizes
diagnostic information that was previously scattered across the plane on
various systems. In the past, flight crews and pilots examined these
disparate systems, each with a display reflecting its state of readiness.
The crews then noted the information on long checklists.
   The maintenance application now downloads the readiness information from
the on-board LAN, and MAT presents it to the crew on a central display.
Users can print the information or copy it to floppy disks for downloading
to a maintenance database. (On older aircraft, someone has to manually key
in information from the paper checklists to update that database.) The
maintenance application saves time by telling the crew what work needs to
be done and which procedures are optional, rather than requiring a crew
chief to examine several reports of data and figure out what parts need to
be replaced.
   The maintenance application may also increase the quality and type of
diagnostic information available to the crew. On the 777, sensors inside
the engine and other systems measure fluctuations in temperature and other
states.
   The sensors take temperature readings every few seconds. By assembling
the information in the database and analyzing it, the maintenance
application can catch slight variations that might indicate that the fuel
nozzle is blowing too much fuel into the combustion chamber, for example.
The nozzle might not be broken, and the temperatures may not exceed
acceptable levels, but the crew could decide to replace the nozzle or
inspect the combustion chamber to prevent the possibility of a fire.

Making Your Connections
   A Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) network connects the
aircraft's maintenance systems with MAT (see the figure ``Airborne LAN'').
The architecture could have used Ethernet rather than FDDI in the final
implementation. However, the original system design called for large
packets that would have required the bandwidth of FDDI, according to
Rockwell technical director Tom Mepham. The company later jettisoned that
plan because it was too expensive and it would have been harder to receive
FAA certification. But systems designers stuck with FDDI to learn how to
adapt the fiber-optic wiring to an aircraft environment for future
designs.
   Rockwell designed the optical data link to operate in the extreme
temperature fluctuations of the aircraft--from -40 degrees C to 70 degrees
C. Rockwell also built the LAN cards and device drivers. The Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack came from the French company Alcatel.
   Rockwell adapted commodity hardware to work under the unusual conditions
of an aircraft. It selected chips partly for their ability to weather
temperature changes, while boards had to withstand electromagnetic
interference (EMI), the gravity load, the vibrations of takeoff and
landing, and temperature changes, among other considerations. At the same
time, all the components had to be as small and lightweight as possible.
   ``We spent a lot of engineering time optimizing the mechanical design,''
Mepham says. To protect the system's hard drive from vibrations, the
company put it on shock mounting and isolated it from other parts of the
system. A housing with closed joints surrounds the system's boards to make
sure they don't emit radio waves that might interfere with plane
communications. Rockwell connects some of the peripherals using a modified
SCSI controller built from an NCR controller chip that met requirements for
low power consumption.
   To reduce power consumption, bulk, and weight, Rockwell built the MAT
display with an LCD screen rather than a CRT. The display offers a 25
percent savings in power over a CRT screen, and it weighs 30 percent less.
The box is only 8 inches deep, compared to the 14-inch depth of the CRT.
The LCD automatically brightens or dims in response to cabin light, but
Rockwell had to work hard to get the LCD screen to function reliably. The
screen's fluorescent backlight was particularly troublesome, accounting for
70 percent of the display's predicted failure. Rockwell optimized the gas
film pressures and mixtures inside the lamp to minimize the chances of it
breaking.
   Rockwell built special subsystems to ensure that MAT functions
correctly. The hardware subsystem uses an Intel 80186, and it monitors each
hardware subassembly and peripheral, including the PC's 486. Engineers also
had to modify much of the network management code so it could switch off
and disconnect from the network any monitoring systems that weren't
working, to avoid giving the crew inaccurate information. If any systems
malfunction, MAT will shut itself down. Designers believe it's better to
give flight crews no information from MAT rather than incorrect
information.

Unix: Top Gun
   Designers chose Unix for its reliability and settled on Venix because it
is modular, has real-time extensions, and supports database management
applications that run on The Santa Cruz Operation's UnixWare (see the
figure ``Unix Sandwich''). Venix also runs on MAT's 25-MHz 486, which was
the fastest Intel chip that was available at the time the project began
five years ago. Rockwell wrote about 30 percent of the system software
itself using C and small amounts of assembly language, much of it for
drivers for the hardware components.
   The rest of the software consists primarily of standard Venix modules,
which Boeing could pick and choose as needed. The MAT system software lacks
typical Unix features such as the vi editor, whose presence might be a
security risk because unauthorized users might be able to disable the
system. MAT software runs in only 16 MB of memory, a requirement on the
space- and power-constrained aircraft. For the GUI, Boeing chose X Window
System and Motif libraries from AGE Software, which run on a Texas
Instruments 34020 graphics processor.
   Boeing needed to control MAT so it wouldn't interfere with the
flight-critical systems attached to the LAN. The system had to be able to
wait for a few milliseconds while the LAN sent critical traffic that took
priority over the maintenance system. Originally, Unix was unbounded and
had no mechanism for preempting the kernel. Recent versions allow responses
in the 20-ms range, but developers can't precisely control the response
rate. Venix's real-time extensions allow a predictable response within tens
of milliseconds, which was enough to meet Boeing's requirements.

Preflight Checks
   Even though the maintenance system was not certified as
flight-essential, it needed to be more reliable than typical desktop
software. In addition, Boeing and Rockwell wanted to analyze this system's
reliability to see if it would one day be possible to use commercial
software in flight-essential systems. As a result, the testing process
became a crucial and lengthy part of the software-development effort.
   The FAA requires a review of every line of code in the systems it
certifies. On flight-critical systems, developers must write each line so
it can be tested to prove it does what it's designed to do. The testing
required for MAT wasn't this stringent. In some cases, Rockwell was able to
use standard Unix tests.
   But to improve the reliability and testability of the code, Rockwell
wrote custom code so the software could be tested line-by-line like any
flight-system software. The company also developed rigorous test software
for Venix. ``To be certified as a [flight-essential] system, you must do an
additional level of testing, where you ensure that the test suite covers
100 percent of the statements in the code,'' says Steve Fuemmeler, Rockwell
software manager. ``Industry-standard tests for commercial software did not
hit this mark.''
   Rockwell had assumed that off-the-shelf tests would execute about 80
percent of the code statements. They planned to write the remaining tests
themselves.
   In fact, existing tests executed only 27 percent of the code, and
Rockwell, VenturCom, and AGE Software spent far more time writing their own
tests than they had anticipated. ``On Venix, we wrote additional
supplemental tests that got us much closer, that did more structural
testing and coverage of the software,'' Fuemmeler says.
   In addition to the fact that tests with 100 percent code coverage aren't
available for Unix, the amount of code in systems such as X and Motif make
thorough testing impractical--another surprise to the avionics industry,
says Bob Geers, 777 electronic data management system program manager for
Rockwell. For instance, Motif has about 300,000 lines of code, and 100,000
test procedures covered less than half the code and took days to execute on
a 66-MHz 486.
   The testing showed whether the software worked as it was designed to,
weeded out any failures, and gauged how well code ran during power surges
and in high-temperature conditions. Stress testing showed memory leaks that
Rockwell was able to fix early on. The company doesn't claim to have found
every bug or problem, but Rockwell says it is confident the software runs
reliably.
   Rockwell's software designers have several recommendations for
developers who want to make their code more reliable. First, at least a few
people on the design team should have a good understanding of both software
architecture and hardware and how the two interact. Second, spend the bulk
of your time up front understanding your requirements and designing the
software to meet them. A good peer review of software design is better than
finding problems after you've written the system. Third, if you find
problems in actual operation that your testing didn't catch, go back and
see why the tests didn't catch them. If you keep track of this process, it
will improve your chances of catching these problems in the future,
Rockwell believes.
   For example, Rockwell might find problems in the software caused by
power fluctuations on the aircraft that QA didn't identify because it
didn't test for such real-world conditions in the first place, Fuemmeler
says. Rockwell wrote custom software that would allow MAT to handle power
failures of a few tenths of a second, which are common on aircraft when
they switch from auxiliary power to engine power at takeoff and landing.
The hardware flags the software during power interruptions so the software
can initialize the appropriate module.
   Usually, data loss isn't a problem because RAM will hold up for short
periods without power. Rockwell then tested the software's ability to
function during power loss with test equipment that injects a power
interrupt of the required duration. Another Rockwell test exercised all the
system calls and X library calls that the current set of applications on
the aircraft will use. The test suite ran for 10 days to check for adverse
effects on performance or loss of available memory. In the real world,
aircraft systems often run for this long. ``They'll roll the aircraft up to
the gate, keep it on, and then fly again,'' Fuemmeler says.

Bringing It In
   Despite the amount of test software Rockwell wrote, using off-the-shelf
software halved the amount of time spent in development since so much of
the code was already written. Now that it has written tests to make up for
Unix test shortfalls, Rockwell hopes to one day use Unix in more-critical
systems.
   However, the company believes it's difficult to use the X or Motif
layers in any system that has to be thoroughly tested. ``The size of X
Window and Motif, the lack of a disciplined development process with the X
Consortium, and the approach they took to develop X Window and Motif do not
lend themselves to essential levels of certification,'' Geers says. If it
were not for those layers, MAT might have qualified for flight-essential
status, he adds.
   Even with the long test cycles, Geers estimates the company still saved
10 percent or 20 percent of the time it would have spent in testing a
proprietary-code system--but it's a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison,
because the tests were not as comprehensive as would have been required in
a flight-critical system. MAT also has far more features and functions than
would a maintenance system created with proprietary code, he says.
   Other areas where Rockwell might be able to use off-the-shelf software
in the future include workstations that are used by flight attendants and
entertainment systems that are located in seat backs and arms. ``Because we
blazed a trail on the development process with commercial, off-the-shelf
software, the development savings was marginal, but in terms of the future,
it could represent significant cost savings,'' Geers believes.

WIRED ON THE WEB
It's not just for breakfast anymore; with HotJava, you'll get a jolt every
time you use your World Wide Web browser

By:
ANDREW SINGLETON

You're busily browsing the World Wide Web, clicking on links, avoiding
commitment. Suddenly, the page comes to life. Animated figures tumble from
the margins. Graphs slink sideways through time. A beveled data-entry panel
appears, complete with running totals.
   This is HotJava, Sun Microsystems' Web browser. It can download its own
programs, called applets, and run them embedded on a Web page. In many
ways, HotJava represents the holy grail of computer science--a universal,
global OS.
   HotJava retains the key advantage of a traditional Web
browser--universality. But while standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
browsers sacrifice features so they can display information on many kinds
of computers, HotJava enables you to extend an HTML browser. Any client,
regardless of its CPU or OS, can access the same applications as long as
it's using a Java-enabled browser (see the figure ``The Universal
Interface'' on page 80).
   This means client/server developers that use HotJava as a front end
might never need to install any customized client software. And if a
developer uses the Java programming language, an application might never
need to be ported to another system.

Not Just Another Browser
   While Java and Hot Java have great potential for revolutionizing the
Web, they actually predate the Web frenzy. James Gosling, a Sun engineer
and creator of the NeWS windowing system, started work on Java in 1991.
   Originally called Oak, Java was designed for programming consumer
electronics, where it would be used to create a heterogeneous network of
home appliances. This environment defined Java's characteristics as a
small, reliable, real-time interpreter that was, above all, portable and
able to leap across the wire. Searching for a useful application, the Sun
team made a foray into the set-top-box market. Then in mid-1994, according
to Gosling, ``we realized we could build a really cool browser.''
   The HotJava browser runs applets written in the Java language. Java is
an interpreted language that's based on C++ but is designed for dynamic
loading. HTML pages that are designed for HotJava have special tags of the
form <app=3Dappname height=3Dxx width=3Dyy>. When HotJava sees the app=
tag, it goes back to the Web server that the HTML page originally came from
and asks for the file appname.class. HotJava then creates a window on the
Web page with the dimensions xx,yy and runs the applet in the window.
   While Java has a syntax similar to that of C++, it's designed to work
around C++'s more problematic features, especially linking, object
instantiation, and memory management. For example, instead of including
class definitions and then linking the code, Java programmers just import
the code and definitions dynamically in a single statement. Additionally,
instead of using Delete and then chasing memory leaks, Java programmers can
just continue and let a garbage collector clean up memory.
   The complete Java kit, which is available (in most cases for free) from
the Sun server at http://java.sun.com, includes a HotJava browser, a Java
compiler (called javac), documentation, and libraries. The javac compiler
turns Java source code (java files) into class files containing bytecode, a
low-level pseudo-machine language. A virtual machine on the target platform
then interprets the bytecode.
   As an interpreted language, Java sacrifices speed--programs interpreted
on the Java virtual machine run about 10 to 15 times slower than compiled
programs do. Sun is aware of this problem and plans to address it in a
future release, which might be available by the time you read this article.
Java interpreters use just-in-time compilation to load the bytecode and
then translate it to local machine code. Thus equipped, Java should be fast
enough for any application, including real-time graphics.
   To deploy a Java applet (see the figure ``How Java Works'' below), you
just put the class files on any Web server. Regular HTTP servers work fine
for serving HotJava applications, since HotJava uses a standard HTTP GET
command to retrieve its code.
   Though easy to get and deploy, Java requires a higher skill level for
content developers than HTML. Java is a real programming language that
requires a real programmer. Programmers have to learn their way around the
standard Java library, which contains objects and methods for opening
sockets, implementing the HTTP protocol, creating threads, writing to the
display, and building a user interface within an applet.

Tackling Security
   As a user, you are probably nervous about surfing into a uniform
resource locator (URL) and splashing down into an unknown program. You
don't want the program to write viruses onto your disk, read your mail, or
broadcast nasty messages to users on your LAN. Because of the potential for
vandalism or errors, the creators of HotJava included a number of special
security measures.
   For example, a load-time check ensures reliable execution. Java is a
strongly typed, stacked language. Because of this architecture, a parser
can read the bytecode as it loads and ensure that all operations act on
objects of the correct type and that all operations parse correctly.
   Also, at run time, applets don't get access to the printer, and they can
access only a single directory on your disk. They allocate memory from a
special Java heap, and the parser checks memory access for validity.
   In addition, domain-address checks constrain network access. A setting
in the HotJava browser enables you to prevent a Java applet from
communicating with any domain except the one from which it originated.
   Is clever technology enough to prevent vandalism or security leaks from
attractive Trojan horse applets? Only time will tell. However, Java applets
are safer than ordinary Internet freeware, and Java's attention to security
sets it apart from other types of downloadable code.

Competition Looms
   Java faces its first real competition in the on-demand software category
from Microsoft's Blackbird, a system for authoring and distributing on-line
content, due to appear in early 1996. Sun and Microsoft have already
started sparring about which environment is better.
   Like Java, Blackbird dynamically loads code from a network, in the form
of OLE Controls (OCXes) inserted into a document. After that, however, the
two products cease to be similar. Java is a programming tool. It's small,
portable, and secure. A Java system is likely to be easy to maintain,
because its local installation is minimal and it loads most of its code on
demand over the network.
   By contrast, Microsoft's Blackbird is a complete authoring and
publishing environment. It harnesses all the features of Windows 95 and OLE
2.0. Blackbird documents are pages that have embed-ded OCXes. A client
downloads a document through a requester called the caching object store.
   Every object on the page receives its own global universal ID (GUID),
which enables a sophisticated caching and notification scheme--one that
could spawn, for example, a variety of accounting mechanisms for
subscription and controlled-access business models. A Blackbird client can
also manipulate local OLE servers, such as Microsoft Excel. At the server
end, Microsoft promises drag-and-drop layout tools for constructing content
from Office source materials, as well as one-button publishing of the
resulting compound documents.
   All of Blackbird's wonders come at a cost: There's no security in the
Blackbird client. A developer can send you an application that scans your
disk for sensitive information (as the original Microsoft Network client
was rumored to do) or that even vandalizes your machine. As the saying
goes, let the buyer beware.
   Blackbird was still unavailable at this writing, but it will clearly
deliver a lot more than current Web servers and browsers do. Microsoft has
promised a Blackbird client for the Macintosh; however, portability for
embedded controls is unlikely. Developers' willingness to invest in
Blackbird applications will depend on how sensitive they are to security
and whether they believe Windows is the only OS they will ever need.

The Future of Java
   In spite of Microsoft's efforts with Blackbird, Sun is committed to
establishing Java as a standard, according to chief technology officer Eric
Schmidt. Sun is building HotJava browsers for Mac OS 7.5+, Solaris, Windows
95, and Windows NT. At this writing, Spry and Netscape had announced their
intention to include Java in a next-generation browser.
   The Sun Java team has released the source code for porting to Unix
systems other than Solaris. The documentation warns that this is a
nontrivial port because of the use of graphics and thread primitives.
However, porting projects for Linux and other platforms have sprung up in
the energetic Internet freeware community. Most important, Sun has offered
attractive licensing agreements to other commercial Web browser developers
that want to bundle a Java interpreter.
   Sometime in the near future when we jack in to the Internet, when
software is delivered on demand, distributed systems are stripped down into
single servers, and our desktop computers are multimedia laptops with a
single implementation of the universal client software, we will be able to
see the technology of 1995 for what it is: huge, unstable OSes, dusty
stacks of CDs, constant upgrades and maintenance installations, phone calls
for help or for overnight delivery, server closets located on every floor,
complex and tenuous replication and distribution of data, and incompatible
applications. It's messy, it's expensive, and, thanks in part to Java, it's
soon to be obsolete.

THE WORLD'S FASTEST COMPUTERS
Down-to-earth uses, near-earth prices, and astronomical speeds are
catapulting a new generation of supercomputers out of the labs into the
workplace

By:
Tom Thompson


When the Cold War ended, it looked like the end for supercomputing, too.
But then a bank noticed that it could process more financial transactions
quicker on a Cray than it could on a mainframe. And an aluminum company
found that it could increase the life span of its metal castings with
simulations on a Convex. And a telecommunications company figured out how
to send its customer bills faster with an IBM.
   While a number of well-regarded supercomputer companies have gone
toes-up--Cray Computer (a spin-off of Cray Research), Kendall Square
Research, and Thinking Machines--this shakeout is not the death knell of
the supercomputer industry. Supercomputer companies, from old stalwart Cray
Research to new kids like Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), are alive and
well.
   But today you might well mistake a next-generation supercomputer for a
filing cabinet tucked into an office corner or even--shock hazard--beside a
desk. There's still some some custom parts inside these systems, but
they're mostly off-the-shelf workstation components. Nevertheless, such a
box packs more processing might than its ancestors did, and it sports a
double-take price tag that a mid- to large-size business can afford: around
$100,000 and up. As a business and its computing demands grow, the
supercomputer can grow along with it, by the addition of extra processors
and hard drives.

A Fast History of Speed
   In the sixties and seventies, supercomputer companies like Cray Research
got their start building systems that could handle formidable scientific
and engineering problems that used floating-point calculations extensively.
The intense computational demands of this type of work--much of it
involving nuclear research or aerospace design, motivated by the arms
race--combined with the necessity of quick results, meant that cost was no
object in obtaining the fastest hardware possible. For example, the first
Cray-1, like the one shipped to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976,
had a peak speed of 167 MFLOPS and cost anywhere from $4 million to $11.2
million, depending on the hardware configuration.
   These systems used a vector-processing design that reflected typical
engineering problems. Vectors are data arrays representing specific
quantities. For example, you might model a jet engine with one vector
representing the engine's structural elements, another specifying thermal
characteristics within the engine, and a third detailing the fluid flow
through the engine. A program that simulates engine operation
mathematically combines the vectors according to physical models, iterating
from time-step to time-step. Properly done, the simulation allows you to
study the behavior of engine parts as the engine runs, which enables you to
spot flaws in a new design or evaluate the strength of a different engine
material without ever building a real prototype.
   To boost performance, supercomputer designers oriented the system
architecture around these vector operations, adding extra hardware to the
processor to manipulate data vectors efficiently. Pipelined logic units
allowed operations such as multiple memory accesses and the rapid
combination of data vectors to overlap. To run at a high clock rate, these
special-purpose processors employed bipolar logic circuits--fast, but so
hot that they needed liquid cooling systems. High-performance--and
high-price-tag--peripherals handled the supercomputer's I/O demands.
   Compounding the system price even further was the cost of software. Some
supercomputers used proprietary OSes, and researchers often had to write
the modeling software from scratch. Nevertheless, because these research
problems required tremendous processing power, and government funding
helped foot the bill, supercomputers sold. Supercomputer companies may have
sold only a few dozen systems a year, but they charged high margins to
defray the expenses of research and building a limited run of parts.
   Because producing faster custom processors pushed the limits of
fabrication technology, new supercomputer designs became more difficult and
more expensive. Cray Research begat Cray Computer in 1989 to develop custom
processors out of gallium arsenide, a material with faster switching times
than silicon. That company eventually foundered last year due to delays in
fabricating such parts.
   Ironically, Cray Research itself kept ahead of the competition by taking
a different tack entirely. Rather than using faster processors, its 1983
Cray X-MP had up to four custom vector processors to divide and conquer
computing jobs. This system, which could deliver a peak of 941 MFLOPS, cost
anywhere from $2.5 million to $16 million.

Many Brains Make Light Work
   Then came RISC. While perhaps not as powerful as a custom processor, a
RISC processor had a significant price advantage. Manufactured by the
hundreds of thousands rather than by the dozen, their enormous economies of
scale made RISC processors much less expensive by comparison. With multiple
processors working together, a complex problem could fall by sheer numbers
rather than by raw speed.
   Another speed boost: The competitive nature of the workstation market
had RISC vendors striving to one-up the competition by boosting chip
performance. According to Jack J. Dongarra of the mathematical sciences
section at Oak Ridge Laboratory, who keeps track of the supercomputing
industry, ``RISC processors got faster quicker than anyone expected.
Although RISC first appeared in a commercial system about a decade after
the first supercomputer, their floating-point performance lags [behind that
of] traditional supercomputers by only an order of magnitude. We see the
current generation of RISC processors matching the performance of last
generation's traditional supercomputers on a per-processor basis.''
   Employing gangs of processors in parallel affects how you write
programs. You divvy up the data array, assigning different portions to
different processors. Every processor runs its portion of the program in
parallel (i.e., simultaneously) with the other processors. As the program
progresses, every processor exchanges data with its neighbors, as shown in
the figure ``Processing Schemes'' on page 50. This scheme is known as
parallel processing. A parallel-processor architecture can be scalable;
that is, to get more computing power, you can add more processors to the
existing system.
   But don't abandon vector processing just yet. In certain situations, a
vector-processing system delivers better performance than a
paral-lel-processing system, especially when dealing with complex
simulations involving huge data arrays. That's because the average
memory-access times can be shorter with vector processing, even with a
large memory space. In contrast, a parallel-processing system with lots of
memory might have to wait quite a while for data to move from one part of
the system to another (because, as on a network of PCs, a packet might
rattle around through dozens of nodes before reaching its target).
   Current vector-processing supercomputers are also scalable (up to a
point), in that you add more processors to boost performance. The Cray
X-MP, though a vector-processor machine, had a scalable architecture. Cray
still sells scalable vector-processing supercomputers, such as the T90 and
J90. Over the long haul, however, the price point of RISC processors will
allow the construction of ever-larger, more powerful parallel-processing
systems.

Supershakeout and Recovery
   During this decade, recession and the Cold War's end have shrunk
research funds drastically. The savvier supercomputer companies began
exploring other market possibilities before the money dried up. Businesses
were keen on using the processing power of a supercomputer, but they
weren't in a hurry to buy: The huge price tag was hard to justify,
especially if a business's work load outgrew the system's capabilities in
just a few years. Also, a proprietary supercomputer OS would restrict any
custom in-house applications to running on that type of system and no
other. And you still couldn't buy supercomputer software at Egghead.
   Supercomputer companies responded to these issues. To address price
sensitivity, supercomputer designs started to feature merchant or
``commodity'' workstation parts, such as IBM's Power2, Hewlett-Packard's
PA-RISC 7200, and SGI's Mips R8000. Common peripherals, such as SCSI-2
drives, 100-Mbps Ethernet, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), and Fiber
Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) network connections, also became part of
the mix and kept costs low.
   Commodity parts plus a scalable architecture also solved the growth
issue: As a business expanded, you could add more (less expensive)
processors and hard drives to meet computing demands. Prices for a basic
scalable supercomputer today, which can start at around $100,000, reflect
the new market reality.
   Finally, and perhaps most important, supercomputer companies adopted
widely accepted workstation OSes, such as IBM's AIX, Sun's Solaris, and
SGI's Irix 6. This drove a stake into the heart of proprietary software
concerns. Supercomputers can now tap into the existing base of workstation
applications and customers. When an office's work load overwhelms its
workstations, the company can reasonably migrate upstream to a
supercomputer. It can then use the workstations as terminals to submit jobs
to the supercomputer or to handle smaller jobs.

Superpower at Work
   Different markets have accepted supercomputers because of their low
price and scalable processing power. Oil companies can improve their
accuracy in finding future oil and gas reserves by processing seismic data
and simulating reservoir flow, reducing their typically astronomical
drilling costs. Car manufacturers can simulate crashes of prototypes,
speeding new--yet reliable--models into the showroom six months ahead of
the competition.
   You don't have to be in the Fortune 100 to profit from supercomputer
smarts, either. Banks use supercomputers to handle thousands of on-line
transactions and to call up credit histories within seconds. Retail
businesses sift through gigabytes of point-of-sale receipts to data-mine
important trends.
   While the supercomputers of yesterday might have generated results of
interest only to a handful of physicists, today's supercomputers offer
something for everyone. Whether it's marketing a new product, speeding
catalog-order turnaround, or manufacturing car parts, most jobs can now
benefit--economically--from the power of supercomputers.
   Alcoa Aluminum's adoption of a new-generation Convex supercomputer is a
classic example. Simulating the casting of large aluminum parts--possibly
for use in cars--is easier than actually produc-ing them. Walt Wahnsiedler,
a technical specialist for Alcoa's process design and smelting, uses a
Convex Exemplar SPP1000/CD with eight processors to model aluminum-casting
operations. These models help find ways to reduce the stress on the steel
dies used in casting, so the dies last longer than the usual 20,000
castings, thus saving costs. They also can reduce defects in the aluminum
parts themselves caused by shrinkage during cooling or by pores introduced
due to gas.
   Alcoa formerly used a Convex C1, and then HP workstations, to run
commercial simulation software. Because the Convex Exemplar's SPP-UX OS is
binary-compatible with HP-UX applications, Wahnsiedler moved the company's
commercial software to the Exemplar with few problems. ``It has improved
productivity by letting me run more simulations or run simulations that we
couldn't do otherwise,'' he says.
   For example, car companies would prefer to make parts out of large
one-piece assemblies that are more solid structurally than those made of
several pieces welded together; plus, fewer parts speeds building a
vehicle. ``With the Convex,'' reports Wahnsiedler, ``I can now simulate
these larger parts, whose models can have up to 1.5 million cells, while
reducing defects.''

Multiprocessing Architectures
   While parallel processing offers a definite cost advantage, its main
benefit--scalability--can still be difficult to achieve. That's because as
you add processors, the contention for shared system resources intensifies.
Several different parallel-processing designs address this fundamental
problem, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
   The first, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), has a simple yet effective
design, as shown in the figure ``Parallel-Processing Architectures'' on
page 46. (The SGI Power Challenge and the Cray CS6400 Enterprise Server are
examples of SMP designs.) In SMP, multiple processors share RAM and the
system bus. This design is also known as tightly coupled, or ``shared
everything.''
   Because SMP shares RAM globally, it has only one memory space, which
simplifies both system and applications programming. This single memory
space lets a threaded OS distribute its tasks among various processors or
lets an application obtain the memory it needs for a complex simulation.
The globally shared memory also makes data synchronization easy. SMP is one
of the most mature parallel-processing designs. It appeared in the Cray
X-MP and similar systems over a decade ago.
   However, this global memory also contributes to SMP's biggest problem:
As you add more processors, memory-bus traffic increases until you reach a
point where the bus gets saturated. Adding local cache memory to every
processor can reduce some bus traffic, but the bus generally becomes a
bottleneck at about eight processors or more.
   Massively parallel processing (MPP) is another parallel-processing
design. To avoid memory-bus bottlenecks, MPP does not use shared memory.
Instead, it distributes the RAM among the processors so that the hardware
resembles a network. Because of the loose distribution of RAM resources,
this architecture is also known as loosely coupled, or ``shared nothing.''
   To access the memory outside its own RAM, a processor must use a
message-passing scheme analogous to network packets. This system reduces
bus traffic, because each section of memory sees only those accesses that
are bound for it, rather than every memory access, as in an SMP system.
This enables large-size MPP systems with hundreds or even thousands of
processors. IBM's RS/6000 Scalable Powerparallel System (SP2 for short) is
an example of an MPP system.
   The downside to MPP is that it makes programming difficult, because it
breaks memory into small separate spaces. Without any globally shared
memory space, running (and writing) an application that requires a large
amount of RAM (in comparison to local memory) can be difficult. Data
synchronization among widely distributed tasks also becomes difficult,
particularly if a message must make many hops to the target processor's
memory.
   Writing an MPP application also requires that you be aware of a
program's memory organization. Wherever it's necessary, you have to insert
message-passing commands into the program code. Besides complicating the
program design, such commands can create hardware dependencies in your
applications. However, most supercomputer vendors have safeguarded
applications portability by adopting either a public-domain message-passing
mechanism, known as Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM), or a developing
standard, called Message Passing Interface (MPI), to implement the
message-passing mechanism.
   How to overcome the difficulties of SMP and MPP? The last parallel
architecture, scalable parallel processing (SPP), is a hybrid of both,
using a two-tier memory hierarchy to achieve scalability. The first memory
tier consists of a node that is essentially an SMP system, complete with
multiple processors and their globally shared memory.
   You build larger SPP systems by interconnecting two or more nodes via
the second memory tier so that this tier appears logically as one global
shared-memory space to the nodes. The two-tier memory reduces bus traffic,
since only updates to keep memory coherent among the nodes occur. SPP thus
offers the easy-to-program SMP programming model while providing
scalability similar to that of an MPP design. The Convex Exemplar is an
example of an SPP machine.

Superapps
   Because they use workstation OSes and common RISC processors, the new
breed of supercomputers inherits a stable of ready-made workstation
applications. The SMP architecture that's typical in most systems confers
an advantage as well. The globally shared memory lets appropriately
modified applications work with larger data arrays or distribute the work
load in threads across multiple processors.
   However, some software vendors don't want to modify their existing
commercial applications for fear of introducing bugs with the rewrite.
Also, fully supporting multiprocessor hardware using threads, or writing
message-passing code for an MPP system, is a daunting task.
   Fortunately, you can find ways around these issues, depending on the
application type. Many supercomputer OSes can partition the machine so that
some or all of the processors function as stand-alone systems. A company
can then fold its existing traditional work flow into the computer.
   Some partitions function in a mainframe batch-mode operation, letting
users submit jobs from terminals or workstations, while other partitions
use multiple processors to tackle compute-intensive jobs. Each stand-alone
partition can run its own copy of a mission-critical application, so the
system can handle multiple users. This arrangement also lets companies
consolidate all their computing services into one box.
   Lotus Notes is an application in point, since large companies use it as
a collaboration mechanism. A typical enterprise-level installation might
have thousands of users, managed by dozens of servers linked across the
country or around the world. A setup such as this gives a system manager
nightmares because of the software upgrades and maintenance problems
involved in dealing with these widely scattered computers. Furthermore,
data synchronization among the separate Notes databases is problematic.
   However, a properly configured IBM SP2 supercomputer can come to the
rescue. First, you configure the SP2 so that each processor operates
independently. Next, you run native copies of the Notes server, one per
processor, thus creating an array of virtual servers.
   This arrangement consolidates all the servers into a single system and
eliminates maintenance and upgrade hassles. While Notes currently limits
database access to only one server at a time (because all the servers draw
from the same database file), synchronization issues disappear. This setup
also offers mission-critical redundancy: Some virtual servers in the system
can operate as backup units, taking charge when a failure disables an
active server.
   Another existing job that supercomputers can tackle is handling large
volumes of information, either for on-line transaction processing (OLTP) or
for data mining (on-line analytical processing, or OLAP). Companies can
accumulate gigabytes of sales data daily, and supercomputers warehouse the
information for evaluation. How large can these data warehouses grow? Cray
Research has shown a 48-processor CS6400 managing a 1.6-TB (a terabyte
equals 1 million MB) Oracle7 database.
   Fortunately, such a setup does not require modification of the front-end
application. Instead, the database managing the back end routes the queries
to individual processors. Complex queries that generate multiple data
tables can go out to several processors, as long as the results of each
table do not depend on another table's data. Key to this sort of operation
is parallel-processing-savvy database software, such as Oracle's Oracle7
Parallel Server, Informix's PDQ Dynamic Server Architecture, and Sybase's
System 10 Navigation Server.
   Rob Geller, director of marketing and sales systems at MCI, uses an IBM
SP2 system to consolidate the company's demographic and billing data, which
used to be stored in several mainframes located around the U.S. The SP2 has
104 nodes and operates on a 3-TB Informix relational database. Geller uses
off-the-shelf desktop and workstation software, including Brio's BrioQuery,
to mine the data. The results help MCI refine behavioral models that direct
marketing and sales efforts. ``The SP2 has boosted the rate of our analysis
by an order of magnitude,'' Geller says. ``Queries that once took over 2
hours now take only a minute. This also lets us ask questions that weren't
possible before.''
   A supercomputer's capacity lets a company combine the data-processing
needs of diverse departments, often with synergistic results. For example,
Macklanburg-Duncan, a manufacturer of building-improvement products, uses a
Cray CS6400 Enterprise Server to integrate its customer orders and
manufacturing and financial information. The system keeps track of
inventory for 4000 different products and helps coordinate shipments to
17,000 customers nationwide.
   Previously, this data was on separate mainframes. According to Michael
Mack, Macklanburg-Duncan's manager of technical services, consolidating all
these operations on the Cray gives the company a fast response time on
orders. ``An order goes through a series of processes, and if this process
releases the order, the shipping form gets printed immediately. The entire
operation takes only 30 minutes if an order is transmitted
electronically,'' he says.
   Phone orders take a little longer: A customer-service consultant enters
an order on-line and has the option of immediately processing it or
allowing a periodic batch job to perform this task. The company warehouses
orders so that geographic and purchase-activity information can help direct
the company's decision-making. ``Because of the Cray's scalability,'' Mack
continues, ``we'll be able to add other divisions or acquisitions without
having to purchase additional machines. There will be incremental costs to
add resources, but the CS6400 gives us the ability to expand as our
business grows.''

Tall Buildings to Leap
   While supercomputer vendors such as Cray Research and SGI have used
ingenious techniques to extend SMP's performance, this architecture will
eventually reach a performance limit. In the long term, like it or not,
future application designs will have to grapple with MPP systems and
message-passing schemes.
   Unfortunately, as the description of the MPP architecture suggests,
writing such parallel code is not easy. A dearth of development tools--not
surprising, given the relative newness of MPP designs--aggravates the
situation. Debugging is especially complex, since it's difficult to isolate
a problem connected to a thread that has crashed on a single processor.
   In a scene that's similar to desktop computing, supercomputing hardware
has outpaced the software. While writing such software will take time, the
situation is not that grim: There's plenty of work for supercomputers to do
with the software that's currently available.
   Supercomputing's transition has required the parallel processes of
design simplification and standardization, the use of multiple inexpensive
components, and proper marketing--all similar paths to the computer
industry as a whole. Supercomputers have escaped their ivory-tower prisons
to help businesses with such mundane-but-crucial tasks as rapid order
turnaround and strategic decisions made with the help of data mining.
   There seems little doubt that the lessons learned in the stratosphere of
computing will eventually appear in desktop machines that routinely use
similar multiple-processor architectures. Thus, the final triumph of
supercomputing may be its assimilation into desktop computers everywhere.

CONVEX: HYPERNODE POWER

When Hewlett-Packard moved to acquire Convex Computer in 1995, it may have
looked like HP had acquired another supercomputer-shakeout casualty. But
the merger evolved out of a tight alliance that started in 1992. Convex had
plenty to offer HP: It had succeeded in fabricating high-speed gallium
arsenide CPUs--the same technology that had done in Cray Computer--and put
them in its proprietary C line of supercomputers.
   The Exemplar line of supercomputers takes the commodity-parts route and
uses HP's own PA-RISC 7200 processor, clocked at 120 MHz. The Exemplar
SPP1200/CD, a compact model, starts with two processors and is expandable
to a maximum of 16. The SPP1200/XA starts with eight processors and expands
to a maximum of 128. RAM configurations range from 128 MB to 32 GB. I/O
support includes fast-and-wide SCSI-2 and FDDI.
   The basic building block of the Exemplar is a hypernode that holds a
maximum of eight processors. Each hypernode is essentially an SMP system
where the processors and memory connect through a special four-by-five,
high-speed, nonblocking crossbar bus. Gallium arsenide gate arrays
implement the crossbar logic. When a processor accesses RAM, bus logic
called an agent (see the figure ``The Convex Hypernode'') looks for an idle
bus to memory and makes the connection. The fifth part of the crossbar is
for I/O only.
   Convex achieves scalable parallel processing by tying hypernodes
together. Four one-way toroidal rings connect the hypernodes. Called
Coherent Toroidal Interconnect (CTI) by Convex, it's based on the IEEE
standard 1596-1992 Scalable Coherency Interface (SCI). The crossbar logic
monitors memory accesses, and local (i.e., on-board) access remains on the
hypernode. Remote (i.e., off-board) accesses get passed to the rings.
Through CTI, the memories on all the hypernodes appear as one globally
shared memory space (see the figure ``Toroidal Interconnect'').
   Because the rings are actually cables, you can tie several Convex
systems together to obtain more processing power. Furthermore, you still
have one unified memory space, even though the RAM is physically located in
different machines.
   The Exemplar uses a multiprocessor verion of Unix called SPP-UX. SPP-UX
is binary-compatible with HP-UX, so the Exemplar can draw on thousands of
HP workstation applications.
   A basic Exemplar 1200/CD 2 with two processors and 128 MB of RAM costs
$128,320. A basic Exemplar 1200/XA 8 has eight processors and 256 MB of RAM
and costs $349,500. Each four-processor upgrade will set you back
$107,800.

CRAY: FASTER THAN A BOTTLENECK BULLET

Cray Research started its Business Systems Division about four years ago to
build supercomputer systems that would serve business needs. The company's
Cray CS6400 Enterprise Server uses an SMP architecture to support up to 64
SuperSparcs, each clocked at 60 or 85 MHz.
   Since bus traffic normally degrades an SMP design that's built around
eight processors, the CS6400 seems to defy logic. The system dodges this
limit by using four buses instead of one to reduce memory contention. Each
bus has its own private bank of RAM, while the processors connect to every
bus, as shown in the figure below.
   Physical memory is interleaved among all four memory banks to create a
shared memory space. You can add up to 64 memory modules to the system, for
a maximum of 16 GB of RAM. To reduce bus traffic further, every processor
module (which consists of four processors) has a 2-MB static RAM (SRAM)
cache. Bus-watcher logic snoops all memory accesses and updates the caches
to maintain memory coherency.
   To ensure optimum I/O throughput, up to 16 buses support up to 64 I/O
controllers. The I/O subsystem can manage up to 5 TB of on-line storage.
Larger storage capacity is possible via the use of either disk arrays or an
off-line archival medium, such as tape. The CS6400 supports communications
via Ethernet, 100-Mbps Ethernet, FDDI/CDDI, Token Ring, and ATM.
   To host mission-critical applications, a System Service Processor
(SSP)--which is actually a built-in Sun workstation--monitors the system's
health. In the event of a major failure, the SSP restarts the system and
logically removes the problematic hardware. The system design allows you to
hot-swap faulty hardware without interrupting service.
   The computer runs Solaris 2.4, which is a Unix S5R4 derivative from Sun
Microsystems. It can host Sun workstation applications and provide access
to database applications, such as Oracle's Oracle7 and Informix Software's
Informix Online Dynamic Server. The alliance with Sun also fits into a
strategy of offering workstation solutions (via Sun), with connectivity to
the CS6400 to tackle the huge jobs.
   A basic Cray CS6400 has one processor module and 512 MB of RAM (but no
disk) and costs $400,000. The basic system is rated at 3.8 GFLOPS, although
floating-point calculations don't normally figure into the type of work
this system does. The big box, with up to 64 processors and 16 GB of RAM,
costs about $4 million.

IBM: THE BLUE FLASH

Despite the difficulties involved in implementing MPP systems, IBM took up
the challenge and built one. Called the RS/6000 Scalable Powerparallel
System (SP2 for short), it consists mainly of parts found in RS/6000
workstations.
   The SP2 starts with two nodes, expandable to 512. A node consists of a
Power2 processor, an optional level-2 cache, some RAM (ranging from 64 MB
to 2 GB), several Micro Channel slots, an Ethernet connection, and hard
disk storage. In August 1995, IBM boosted the processor clock speed from 66
MHz to 77 MHz.
   Total system RAM starts at 128 MB and is expandable to 1 TB, while
on-line disk storage starts at 2 GB and is expandable to a hefty 9 TB. For
I/O, the SP2 supports a variety of high-speed connections, including
fast-and-wide SCSI-2, 10-Mbps Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ATM, and High
Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI).
   One problem plaguing MPP designs is the time delays that result when
data migrates from one processor to a distant one. This makes synchronizing
data or tasks difficult.
   IBM has minimized this problem by the use of a unique switch that acts
like a smart network switch. It routes data packets onto a network leg with
the target system rather than broadcasting the packets over the entire
network. The SP2 switch uses a data packet's routing information to locate
the target node's port and sends it immediately if the port is idle. If the
port is busy, the packet stays blocked until the port is ready. This scheme
reduces traffic on the system network.
   An SP2 system network consists of two types of components: nodes and
switchboards. On the switchboard are 16 switch chips and corresponding
shadow-switch chips for fault recovery, for a total of 32 chips. Each chip
has eight input and eight output ports, a data queue, and an unbuffered
crossbar. Pairs of chips (one handling input, one handling output) are
wired to construct a four-way to four-way crossbar, which implements a
16-port bidirectional multistage interconnection network, as shown in the
figure ``The SP2 Frame.''
   Nodes connect to one side of the switchboard, while the opposite side
connects to other switchboards. This setup achieves linear scalability,
because properly connected switchboards reduce the number of hops between
widely scattered nodes. Systems with more than 80 nodes require
intermediate switchboards to handle the interconnection among the nodes, as
shown in the figure ``A 128-Node SP2 System.''
   Nevertheless, in such large systems, this multistage interconnection
arrangement means that a data write to another processor takes about four
hops. This consistent hop count, whatever the system's size, reduces
synchronization problems and simplifies programming. It also provides
multiple pathways between any two nodes, which reduces packet traffic and
ensures a level of fault recovery.
   The SP2 runs AIX with MPP extensions, so applications written for
RS/6000 workstations run on the SP2. This provides a convenient migration
path from workstation to supercomputer as processing demands grow. IBM also
has ways to tie in AS/400 superminicomputers and 370 mainframes, so the SP2
supports a company's existing installation while consolidating
information.
   A basic SP2 system, with two nodes, 128 MB of RAM, and 2 GB of disk
storage, will cost you $138,000. Additional 77-MHZ nodes cost $51,300 a
pop.

POWERFUL SECRET IDENTITY

Although Silicon Graphics' first claim to fame is as a workstation vendor
whose snazzy boxes serve up rich graphics and make scientific visualization
popular, within the last two years the company has been making forays into
supercomputer territory. Arrays of its own 90-MHz Mips R8000 RISC
processors provide ample processing power for its Power Challenge
supercomputer.
   The Power Challenge has an SMP design. The basic system contains two
processors and is expandable to a maximum of six or 18 processors,
depending on the size of the chassis you purchase. Each processor can have
4 MB of cache memory, which reduces competition for the system bus. The bus
hardware performs its own bus snooping to maintain cache coherency.
   The RAM bus is 576 bits wide, enough to support one-, two-, four-, or
eight-way memory interleaving. The wide bus and memory interleaving provide
full bus bandwidth for fast page-mode accesses. System RAM starts at 64 MB
and is expandable to 16 GB.
   I/O support includes the VME64 bus with five or more slots, fast and
wide SCSI-2, and Ethernet. FDDI, Ethernet, and High Performance Parallel
Interface (HIPPI) are available via expansion cards. On-line storage
capacities range from a minimum of 2 GB up to 3 TB.
   You can boost the processing power by joining several Power Challenge
systems together via network links. The downside? The SMP model breaks down
for this arrangement. Instead, you must use the MPP distributed memory
model for programming, using message-passing to relay memory accesses to
the other systems.
   The Power Challenge runs the company's own workstation OS, Irix 6, and
can draw on its horde of visualization software. The Power Challenge system
comes in a broad array of configurations. A basic Power Challenge L system
comes with two processors (upgradable to six), 64 MB of RAM, and a 2-GB
hard drive and costs $102,800.

THE WORLD'S FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER (NOW)

In September 1995, the U.S. Department of Energy's Accelerated Strategic
Computing Initiative (ASCI) awarded a $45 million contract for the
development of a supercomputer capable of sustained 1-TFLOPS processing.
The TFLOPS system will model the effects of aging on nuclear warheads,
which are physically complex mechanisms.
   What company won the contract? Intel, the world's largest maker of
commodity parts for desktop computers.
   Because 1 TFLOPS equals 1000 GFLOPS, you can expect any such system
using current technology to be physically 1000 times larger than any of the
GFLOPS systems that are mentioned in this article. And the TFLOPS system is
big: It occupies 1500 square feet, uses more than 9000 processors, and
consumes an estimated 400 kW of power.
   The system uses Intel's Pentium Pro processor. The TFLOPS machine has an
MPP architecture whose basic element is a node, each consisting of two
Pentium Pros. Nodes mount on boards that resemble desktop motherboards
because of the commodity parts used in their construction, such as the
DRAM, PCI interface, and 82450 chip set. The only nonstandard part on the
board is the network interface (see below).
   Boards consist of two types: Compute boards and I/O boards. Each compute
board has two nodes--for a total of four processors--and 128 MB of RAM.
Additional RAM, up to a maximum of 512 MB, can be added later. Each I/O
board has only one node, but richer I/O functions. It manages several PCI
buses (and their expansion cards), the network traffic, and any disk
arrays. Each board also has 1 GB of RAM, most of which serves as a file
cache for any hard drives.
   The system has 74 compute cabinets, each housing 64 nodes (i.e., 32
boards). The present setup has 4536 compute nodes (9072 processors) and 283
GB of RAM.
   The system's two I/O subsystem cabinets each contain about 25 nodes. One
node monitors the system's health; four manage the Ethernet, FDDI, ATM, and
boot-network connections; and 16 to 20 handle the RAID arrays. Each cabinet
has more than 32 PCI slots for adding new peripherals. Each I/O subsystem
cabinet manages its own 1-TB RAID array. All the cabinets are arranged to
minimize the signal length in the InterConnection Fabric (ICF), the network
that ties the nodes together.
   The TFLOPS system arranges the processors in what's known as a 2 1/2D
mesh, as shown in the figure ``The TFLOPS Topology.'' Nodes connect to one
of two 2-D planes that build the packet-switching mesh. Each plane consists
of Message Routing Components (MRCs), six-ported devices that route signals
to adjacent neighbors. Neighbors can be on either plane, since additional
MRC connections bind the two planes together. This arrangement provides
alternate data paths so that you can replace a faulty network segment
without switching the system off.
   Each board's Network Interface Component (NIC) multiplexes all network
traffic at a low level. The combination of NICs and MRCs make up the ICF.
The ICF does not maintain memory coherency: That job is up to the OS.
   Different portions of the TFLOPS machine run different OSes. The compute
nodes run a Light-Weight Kernel (LWK) based on SunMOS and the Puma OS.
Since each compute node runs a copy of the kernel, a small memory footprint
is essential. The I/O nodes run a System V-compatible version of Unix.

reliability.

SUPER VISION

The new breed of supercomputers can pay for themselves in many ways. Dr.
Dwight Sukup, of Texaco's Exploration and Production Technology Division,
uses an SGI Power Challenge in his work. The system processes seismic data
to generate 3-D images of how subsurface formations look. These images
improve the accuracy of locating new oil and gas reserves.
   Accuracy is the name of the game in oil exploration, where an offshore
well in the Gulf of Mexico can cost up to $20 million to drill. More
important, since only one out of six wells ever finds hydrocarbons,
``anything that improves the odds so that we save $20 million at a time is
worth it,'' says Sukup.
   The imaging job begins with the collection of seismic information over a
50-square-mile area. Such a survey costs millions of dollars and takes
months to complete. The data consists of roughly 50 million seismic traces,
each made up of 2000 samples. Based on an estimated earth model (i.e., a
map of the formations), the data is imaged into a 300- by 400- by
1000-point grid. The imaging information provides data to improve the earth
model, and then the process is repeated. It might take several iterations
to obtain acceptable results.
   Any formation data available from wells in the area can improve the
physics of the model. ``Often we're doing exploration work, where there
aren't any wells. For that, we might estimate formation material using data
taken from wells over 50 miles away,'' explains Sukup. The Power Challenge
works on the seismic data, and the results are fed to a
seismic-interpretation workstation for visualization.
   By rotating and viewing slices of the 3-D formation map on the
workstations, a geoscientist can spot potential ``traps,'' or impervious
layers of strata where hydrocarbons might accumulate. This imaging work is
especially valuable in evaluating complex geologic regions around salt
structures. In these areas, the formations are a jumble of different layers
of material displaced by the upwelling mass of salt. They make suitable
traps for hydrocarbons moving through the porous strata. Geoscientists can
look inside these complicated formations to locate a trap and to predict
whether it contains sufficient hydrocarbons to warrant drilling a well.
   The SGI Power Challenge that Sukup uses has 14 processors and 4 GB of
RAM. It takes the system weeks or months to process one of his models.
However, in an industry where it takes months to get a drilling rig into
position, accuracy is critical. Plus, the SGI system costs less to operate
than a vintage supercomputer.
   Says Sukup: ``We used to have a Cray Y-MP (a 1988-era supercomputer) in
here that cost several million a year, because it required its own
maintenance staff to operate. The Power Challenge just sits there, and we
have our Unix person check it out occasionally.''

OPENDOC AND OLE

By:
Alan Joch


COMPANY
Prodigy Services Co.

DEVELOPER
Michael Twisdale, senior architect

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
C++, Java, and Telescript. Some Delphi; investigating Smalltalk.

THE PROBLEM
Expand the on-line service's distributed-processing capabilities. Find ways
to distribute applications without divulging source-code secrets.

BACKGROUND
Prodigy is building experimental OpenDoc and OLE container applications
that speak directly to the on-line service. One example is an application
that gives users a live stock-market feed with continuous pricing updates.
Any traditional business application such as Microsoft Word can act as a
container and automatically receive stock prices.
   OpenDoc works for this application because it supports in-place
activation. Stock prices can continue to feed into the application even
when it's not in the active window. OLE doesn't support this: When you
click off the application, the feed stops. ``This is a big difference, from
our point of view,'' Twisdale says. ``The coolest applications in the
future will be those that are alive.''
   ``In addition,'' he adds, ``distributed processing is simpler with
OpenDoc thanks to the System Object Model (SOM) and the Distributed System
Object Model (DSOM). You just plug in DSOM libraries. OLE is still a
single-desktop strategy. With SOM, we have automatic propagation. This
guarantees that protocols are consistent. Without this, consistency rests
with the programmers.''
   OpenDoc's inheritance is important to Twisdale: ``This lets us
distribute source code without giving away any of our trade secrets.''

STATUS
CI Labs' slow commitment to a 32-bit version of OpenDoc concerned Twisdale.
Without that support, he would have to use OLE for NT or Win 95, even if he
believed OpenDoc to be superior.
   There's also concern about OpenDoc's backers. ``When Novell creates as
much uncertainty as it did at Unix Expo, it's easier for Microsoft to sell
OLE,'' Twisdale says. ``Is Novell committed to OpenDoc? Will Apple be
around to support it? Will IBM stand behind SOM? Microsoft is launching a
huge effort to push OLE, but I don't see that happening from Novell and IBM
with OpenDoc.''
   ``If we've just developed a whole suite of applications, we're sunk if
OpenDoc support wavers. So we develop in both OpenDoc and OLE. But with
OLE, we do so screaming. OLE imposes a lot more work on developers. OLE
doesn't hide things the way more object-oriented environments do. With OLE
you have to remember how what you create will affect this operating system
or that operating system. Microsoft wanted to get to market, so the level
of abstraction in OLE is not that hot.''

OPENDOC AND OLE

By:
Alan Joch


COMPANY
MCI Telecommunications

DEVELOPER
Tony Dunbar, staff architect in the Open Platform Development Group

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
C and C++ for OS/2, Windows NT, and Windows 3.11

THE PROBLEM
``Compound documents are great stuff, but I've got to turn around 45
developers and 7000 network administrators to a new way of thinking,'' says
Dunbar. ``I have independent development groups, and it's hard for them to
collaborate, so interoperability issues don't get addressed until after we
send the [forms processing] software to the field.''

BACKGROUND
Historically, MCI's Open Platform Development Group wrote only monolithic
applications. Document-based applications would help the company adapt to
changes, especially in the old-style forms-processing program that lets end
users create a form to collect data and send it to the server. Today, as
information needs change, users create a new form. ``That's an easy way to
develop, but it's a bad application,'' Dunbar says. ``So now we're looking
at OpenDoc to address this.''

STATUS
OpenDoc could help reduce interoperability problems that arise from having
independent development staffs. ``OpenDoc brings to the table objects that
interoperate without needing direct collaboration between developers,``
Dunbar says. ``OLE is a collaborative API: It requires that two developers
work together to agree on specifications.''
   OLE's advantage? ``It's already out there.''
   To change users familiar only with monolithic applications, Dunbar is
rolling out a new interface with a document shell that introduces end users
to the document-centric approach. Within the developer staff, Dunbar will
capitalize on their experience.
   ``I have a couple of experts on staff who can focus on the
domain-specific aspects of OpenDoc,'' he says. ``This lets the application
programmers become either just OpenDoc parts builders or parts users.''
Gradually, he will introduce the programmers to new ideas like in-place
editing with OpenDoc's parts handler.
   ``The developers are ready,'' he says. ``We're experimenting with the
alpha version now. I'm banking on OpenDoc being released in beta within the
next six months.''

VBXES

By:
Alan Joch


COMPANY
Ademco, a Pittway Inc. subsidiary

DEVELOPER
Scott Bernstein, database applications engineer

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Visual Basic 3.0

THE PROBLEM
Build a high-volume imaging system that doesn't rely on the performance
vagaries and expense of proprietary turnkey imaging systems.

BACKGROUND
Over the course of a year, the company built its own imaging system using
Visual Basic and Diamond Head Software's ImageBasic, a suite of VBXes, OLE
Controls, and imaging engines. The VBXes they used included Metafile's
ViewTool, which displays black-and-white images. They also used VideoSoft's
VS Elastic, a control that changes the size of all child controls in forms
whenever you resize a window.

STATUS
The imaging system uses standard Adaptec 1542C SCSI adapters, which means
Ademco can choose almost any scanner for the best price and performance.
   The new system now contains 150,000 scanned images, which represents
about three-quarters of the images the company amasses in a typical year.
Ademco is also importing a half-million images that reside on the previous
system.
   ``The population of controls is so vast, it's not difficult to find a
VBX that does what you want to do,'' Bernstein says. ``There's no question
VBXes make things more productive because you don't have to reinvent code
that someone has already written.''
   But VBXes are not without problems. Bugs that exist in component-based
applications often surface only as general protection faults (GPFs), and
tracking down the problems at such a high level can be difficult, Bernstein
says.
   Ademco is switching its PC development over to Visual Basic Enterprise
and hopes that GPFs will be less prevalent in the world of OLE Controls.
Also, Bernstein hopes to avoid the memory leaks that occur with VBXes
because some tools don't deallocate memory when they're done.
   Does Bernstein lose sleep over whether OLE or alternatives like OpenDoc
will prevail? ``Just ask: Which technology does Microsoft support?
Companies that fight Microsoft tend to get bought.''

CORBA AND NEO

By:
Alan Joch


COMPANY
AT&T Wireless Services

DEVELOPER
Hide Horiuchi, architecture planning manager

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Windows and NextStep

PROBLEM
First, connect heterogeneous client and server environments so clients can
access data anywhere in the organization. Second, find ways to make sure
each department or region interprets data using the same business rules.
Third, maintain data integrity in an environment where data may be
replicated in different areas.

BACKGROUND
The division committed to object-oriented technology two-and-a-half years
ago when it built its mission-critical customer-care system on OO concepts
using NextStep. ``Now, we're transferring that knowledge beyond NextStep,''
Horiuchi says.
   The Wireless Services division supports two client environments:
Windows, with more than 3000 seats, and NextStep, which Horiuchi expects
will reach 4000 to 5000 seats in the next couple years. These clients
connect to mainframe or Unix servers for operational and decision support
data. ``Our assumption is that the amount of data we have is good enough,''
he says. ``But data many times doesn't turn into information.''

STATUS
The company is investigating CORBA and Sun's implementation of it in NEO
(Networked Objects) as middleware that can bridge the client and server
environments consistently. ``It's CORBA's concept of objects and the
consistent transport between heterogeneous systems that is of interest to
us,'' Horiuchi says. ``CORBA has the interface definition language for
communicating with multiple systems.''
   Horiuchi's group chose to beta-test NEO because of the product's close
ties to OpenStep. ``Sun has realized the value of OpenStep and coupled that
technology within the NEO family,'' Horiuchi says. ``The bonus for us is
the relationship between Sun and Iona, which makes a CORBA component for
platforms beyond just Sun's. This gives us some consistency when we have to
go beyond the network boundary.''
   Next's Portable Distributed Objects (PDO) does a ``pretty good job'' of
distributing objects within the NextStep environment. ``But as we become
more experienced, we're finding that PDO and CORBA each have their own
strengths and weaknesses. For performance, there are times when we use PDO,
other times we use CORBA.''
   ``From a development perspective, NEO is better than other CORBA
implementations,'' according to Horiuchi. ``It has more tools to help you
code faster, including the ability to graphically link two objects and give
them an association.''
   ``OLE has a steep learning curve and not enough tools. It's a difficult
product to use,'' he says. ``We have to pay close attention to Network OLE
because of the number of Windows clients we have. OLE is not quite
object-oriented, but there's enough commonality there that we hope to
overcome the differences.''
   How does AT&T Wireless cope with evolving standards? ``If history holds
true, there won't be one standard,'' says Horiuchi. ``There will be
different object models to use for different purposes. I'm a strong
proponent of standards. Standards are what really helps you protect your
investment. They may slow down the evolution of a technology, but they
provide a better guarantee of your investment than if one company tries to
ram a specification down your throat.''

CD-ROM MOVIEBOOK FROM SOUND SOURCE INTERACTIVE, FEATURING
SUMMER MOVIE SENSATION "BABE," MAKES LEARNING FUN

Babe, that cute little irrepressible pig and summer-movie
sensation, is fresh from his adventures on the big screen and
ready to take children on an exciting romp through the world
of interactive edutainment. Babe is making his MovieBook debut
in an irresistible CD-ROM-based storybook from Sound Source
Interactive that enables kids from three and up to learn while
having fun. Universal City Studios, the motion-picture studio
that brought Babe to the movie screen, joined with Sound
Source Interactive to bring the hit-movie sensation to the
computer screen.

Sound Source Interactive's series of MovieBooks package
turns today's most popular family films into creative and
interactive learning experiences. "Babe: A Little Pig Goes A
Long Way" is the latest title from the creative group that
brought "Black Beauty," "The Secret Garden," "The Little
Rascals" and "Lassie" to CD-ROMs and computers everywhere.

On retail shelves in time for Thanksgiving, Babe is an
interactive CD-ROM that features a 52-page storybook complete
with text, actual movie clips, photos, animation, sound
effects, games and puzzles. Mirroring the movie's plot, the
CD takes children on a multimedia journey into the magical
landscape of the little pig that could.

"With a simple click of the mouse, children can experience an
interactive adventure, from a pigs-eye view, while learning to
read and conducting activities that bring the fundamentals of
early education to life through imaginative and intuitive
interfaces," said Vincent Bitetti, CEO of Sound Source.

Bitetti explained that the goal of Sound Source Interactive's
MovieBooks is to educate while entertaining. "With Babe and
our other titles, our goal is to spark literacy, familiarize
kids with the computer, and create an educational focus within
a movie-going experience," he said. "Our MovieBooks promise to
hold a child's interest while offering quality educational
material."

Storybook Takes Children on Babe's Magical Journey

As children enter the world of Babe, they are led to Hoggett
farm and its magnificent barn by the famous trio of singing
mice from the movie. Entering the barn begins the adventure!
Children are presented with a myriad of options at this point.

Proceeding straight ahead takes them to a curio cabinet
filled with active objects and memorabilia, including the main
storybook. Children can also turn left, right or proceed
outside to a barnyard where a number of activities designed
to enhance critical and creative thinking skills await.

The main storybook is presented by clicking on the book in
the center of the curio cabinet. Filled with 52 pages of text
accompanied by animations, movie clips, games and puzzles, the
storybook interactively tells the tale of Babe's magical
journey. Children can read the story themselves or chose the
narrative option which automatically takes pre-readers through
the story, triggering animations and movie clips on cue.

In the interactive mode, the last page of each chapter
presents children with a multiple-choice reading comprehension
quiz. A perfect score on the quiz rewards the child with a
puzzle piece. Fitting each chapter's puzzle piece together
reveals a completed puzzle picture which can be printed.

Variety of Activities Makes Learning Fun

In addition to the storybook, children can immerse themselves
in a variety of entertaining learning activities. These
activities have been specifically designed by Sound Source to
teach logic and reasoning skills while providing children
with loads of fun.

In Silly Skins, children are able to place "silly animal
skins" on each barnyard resident, painting ducks with stripes,
pigs with polka dots and horses with checks.

Among the wacky skin choices is the correct choice, teaching
children deductive reasoning by allowing them to reach a
logical conclusion of matching the correct skin with the
appropriate animal. Children also learn to understand the
relationship between objects along with creative thinking and
problem-solving skills.

Children can also create a barnyard scene, clicking and
dragging animals, trucks, buildings and fences into a
landscaped picture. Here the child learns creative thinking as
well as hand-eye coordination. A hidden puzzle is another fun
learning activity, certain to challenge and amuse any child.
By solving detailed dilemmas and searching for a host of
hidden objects in less than a minute, children again use
deductive reasoning, enabling them to reach a conclusion by
interpreting a series of clues.

Additional activities include a maze where children can help
Babe rescue sheep, a missing-pieces puzzle and a Kooky Coop
where children enter a chicken house and locate objects found
in each chicken's nest. Children can also make greeting cards
to print out and color.

Pricing and Availability

Available immediately, "Babe: A Little Pig Goes A Long Way"
has a suggested street price of $29.95. Babe and other Sound
Source Interactive MovieBooks are available at most major
retail outlets, including Comp USA, Egghead, K-Mart, Price-
Costco, Software Etcetera and other fine stores.

Sound Source Interactive MovieBooks play on any 386 33MHz, or
faster, IBM PC/compatible computer running Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95. The computer should be equipped with at least 8MB
RAM, a 256-color monitor, sound card and double-speed CD-ROM
drive.

EYEWITNESS VIRTUAL REALITY BRINGS AN EXTRAORDINARILY
SUCCESSFUL BOOK AND VIDEO PROPERTY TO CD-ROM

DK Multimedia has introduced BIRD and CAT, the first two
CD-ROM releases in their Eyewitness Virtual Reality series (DK
Multimedia; CD-ROM for Windows; November 1995; Mac version
January 1996, $29.95 each, Estimated Street Price). With 22
million copies sold, the international success of Eyewitness
Books is a publishing phenomena. The series contains 56
titles, is published in over 80 countries, 39 languages, and
has revolutionized non-fiction publishing around the world.

In the spring of 1995, DK launched Eyewitness on video, which
aired prime time nationally on PBS. Critics have been raving.
"'Eyewitness' is a high-tech whiz-bang of a nature show that
looks unlike any other." USA Today (3 1/2 stars out of 4). For
the fall, DK Multimedia has created the ultimate format for
Eyewitness. By combining the best of the video and book
content, with completely new material and a stunning new
CD-ROM interface, DK has made Eyewitness come alive.

Imagine a museum in which each floor is devoted to a
different animal or environment. Now imagine walking through
the CAT wing, where every exhibit is interactive. Try to keep
your cool as tigers stroll past doorways and growl in your
ear.  Or see the world as a hawk sees it in BIRD -- from an
actual bird's-eye view.

BIRD and CAT allow computer users of all ages to explore a
living museum. Each new disc in the series will represent a
new environment, or a new floor. You will be able to move from
floor to floor, or from one environment to another by changing
discs. Users access different floors by stepping
into a virtual elevator. They can then choose between
strolling the floor on their own or taking a guided tour.
There is even a museum store offering screen savers and sound
files. Additional floors, or discs to be released in '96
include SHARKS, JUNGLE and DINOSAURS.

"Our goal is to educate by presenting information in a
creative and interactive way," explained Bror Saxberg, Vice
President General Manager of DK Multimedia, "and these CD-ROMs
are the culmination of eight years of effort across all
formats."

CAT

CAT contains interactive exhibits on 100 species of cats, from
house pets to jaguars. Information is obtained by clicking on
the exhibit. Users can view narrated video clips explaining
how the tiger's stripes help camouflage the animal in forests
and long grasses. Then by clicking on Species Distribution
users can learn where the five major species of tigers live.
Or by clicking on Conservation, users will learn that the
Indian tiger population is on the rise, but, sadly, the
Javanese tiger became extinct in 1979.

Using the latest in virtual reality technology, users
manipulate a cat's skull 360 degrees, permitting them to
explore the bone structure in a degree of detail never before
achieved. Other interactive exhibits give a dear feel for a
cat's capabilities -- for example, an interactive game allows
users to race a cheetah against people or sports cars.
Finally, the cats place in world culture is demonstrated
through numerous exhibits.

BIRD

Chirping songbirds and delightful music welcome visitors to
BIRD. Visitors begin their discovery in the Aviary. As with
CATS, users click on exhibits to learn more about the behavior
and anatomy of more than 100 species of birds. By clicking on
Birds of prey, they learn that there are 280 species of
hunting birds, known as raptors.

Ever wonder what a real bird's-eye view looks like? In the
Observatory, users can see the world as a vulture sees it,
with the central portion of the field of vision magnified two
and a half times. In addition to reading information about
birds, the user can examine such exhibits as totem poles and
amulets which illustrate the cultural significance of birds. A
Migration Map in the Behavior Room animates the migration
routes of several bird species, and a song booth allows the
user to choose and listen to a variety of birdcalls. There
are 3 main rooms in all (Family, Anatomy, Behavior) with
numerous galleries to explore, and over 30 informative videos.

DK Multimedia is a subsidiary of the innovative UK
publisher, Dorling Kindersley, Ltd. DK Multimedia employs a
staff of over 260 in London and New York and has one of the
largest multimedia production units in the world. The company
is highly respected for its visually distinctive design for
books, video and CD-ROMs.

Established in 1991, DK Multimedia has released many unique
award winning titles such as The Way Things Work, The Ultimate
Human Body, and The Eyewitness Encyclopedia of Science,
Eyewitness Encyclopedia of Nature, and Eyewitness History of
the World. The company also developed the award-winning
Musical Instruments for Microsoft Corporation. DK Multimedia
creates highly compelling education and reference CD-ROMs for
the consumer and education markets.

ANNE HOOPER'S ULTIMATE SEX GUIDE DEBUTS ON CD-ROM

Sex Therapist Offers Straightforward Advice, Shares Her Case
Files, and Instructs Home Computer Users How to Enhance Their
Sex Lives

Click on the friendly, blond woman's face and she introduces
herself, "Welcome to my Ultimate Sex Disc," says Anne Hooper,
"as a sex therapist, I've been helping men and women improve
their sex lives for the last 20 years." So begins the tour of
the newly announced CD-ROM from DK Multimedia.

ANNE HOOPER'S ULTIMATE SEX GUIDE (DK Multimedia; CD-ROM for
Windows, November 1995,- Mac version December 1995; $39.95
Estimated Street Price) is an informative, non-judgmental
program designed to enhance people's sex lives. The disc is
comprised of four interlocking components: "Questionnaires"
create a private, personal file for users; "Programs for
Better Sex" are Anne's own recommended therapeutic programs;
"Case Files" are profiles of couples' problems, such as
failing desire and lack of communication; and the encyclopedic
"Sexopedia" contains a vast array of information from ancient
lovemaking techniques to modern sex aids. The questionnaires
lead you to the appropriate programs for better sex and the
case files of interest, while the sexopedia provides an
overall reference tool.

"We believe that the combination of Anne Hooper's
informative, no-nonsense approach and DK Multimedia's
traditionally high quality, very visual style will create an
unprecedented CD-ROM on the subject of sex," said Bror
Saxberg, Vice President, General Manager of DK Multimedia.

Hitachi to Market Wide Angle TFT LCDs


   Hitachi, Ltd. <6501> has produced a television and personal
computer monitor application prototype 13.3in TFT type LCD
featuring an angle of visibility of 140 degrees, both
horizontally and vertically. Sales are to begin from mid-1996.
The new display has a depth of 21.5cm, half that of a comparable
CRT, and provides high-precision video images with no line
flicker. The price has yet to be announced.

Profit Increases for March Term at 2 Bearing Manufacturers


   For 2 manufacturers of steel balls for bearings the outlook
for the March 1996 term is for profit and income increases due
to increased demand from makers of household appliances and
small PC peripherals.  Current profits for Amatsuji Steel Ball
<6475> are expected to show a 30% increase over the previous
term to 3.4 billion yen while Tsubakimoto Precision Products
<6477> is expected to show a 26% increase to 2.7 billion yen.
The two companies, due to their no debt management style, will
show financial income with decreased profit margins due to the
reduction in interest rates while securing profit increases as a
result of rises in operating rates and rationalized
manufacturing processes.  For Amatsuji, there will be increases
in shipments of steel balls for industrial arts equipment as
well as export increases to SE Asia in addition to its PC
shipments.  Gross sales are expected to increase 9% to 20.8
billion yen while sales profits are expected to expand 43% to
3.2 billion yen.  For Tsubakimoto Precision Products, exports to
Europe and ball screws for industrial arts machines are expected
to increase.  With gross sales increasing 10% to 14.5 billion
yen sales profits are expected to show a 31% increase to 2.4
billion yen.

NEC Consigns Sparc Production


   NEC <6701> will produce Sun Microsystem's Sparc, the RISC MPU
hearts of such items as workstations.  This consignment is
linked to increased orders of ASICs for Sparc.  NEC will acquire
Sparc design data and manufacturing technology from Sparc
Technology Business, Sun's semiconductor division.  The company
plans to start production of low- cost, 64b RISC MPUs for Sparc
WSs at its Kumamoto facility in 1996.  Monthly output will be
several thousand, 8-inch silicon wafer conversions.  NEC hopes
that with the consigned technology the company will accumulate
the necessary capabilities to fabricate peripheral ICs and
expand ASIC operations.

Hitachi to Enter Full Production of Semiconductors in SE Asia


   Hitachi <6501> is getting into Malaysia with a South Korean
semiconductor maker, the first time Japanese and Korean
companies are doing so, and into Singapore with Nippon Steel
<5401>, that company's first overseas semiconductor venture.
Total investment, including construction of pre-assembly
factories for semiconductor fabrication, hovers at the 230
billion yen mark.  Production of 16Mb  and 64Mb DRAMs will begin
in 1998.  The facility in Malaysia will give Hitachi integrated
production capacity there, since the company already operates a
local plant for pre- assembly processes, and will reinforce the
company's supply capabilities in the rapidly growing
semiconductor markets of Southeast Asia.

New Line for Nikon Film Scanners


   Nikon <7731> has embarked on increased production of film
scanners, which transfer images from film to PCs.  A new line at
the company's Ibaraki-based lens subsidiary will help boost
monthly output to the 3,000- unit level in January.  Nikon is
faced with a hollowing out of camera operations, as camera sales
falter and the company shifts production overseas, but
skyrocketing growth in PCs and peripheral equipment has
reinvigorated domestic operations.  The Ibaraki plant, with
about 1,000 employees, had transferred lens operations to a Thai
facility, but the investment of several tens of millions of yen
has allowed the subsidiary to branch out into not only scanner
production to complement new, semiconductor stepper activities.

Apple's New Production Line Just for Japan


   To stop the drain on profitability in Japan because of cost
competition, Apple Computer is about to totally revamp its PC
supply structure for the Japanese market.  The company will
introduce Japanese staff into the head office R&D unit, in
addition to a special production line at the Asian production
locus, in Singapore.  Japan is Apple's biggest market outside of
North America, but the company has been experiencing increased
competition since Microsoft's debut of Windows 95.  The
revitalized R&D and production structures, supported by people
who know the Japanese market, should facilitate quicker Apple
response to market needs and thereby buoy profits.

   Starting from April, TDK <6762> will take its domestically
manufactured half finished magnetic tapes (originals),
incorporate them into home use VHS casettes at factories in
Thailand and then import them back to Japan.  A little over 20%
of the domestic monthly sales volume corresponding to 1 million
reels will be switched over to these imports.  This will be the
first time since 1977, when it first commenced the sale and
manufacture of home use video tapes, that they will be imported
and sold.  This is one link in the chain in the reconstruction
of the recording medium (media) industry which is now suffering
from unprofitability.  For reasons having to do with secure
procurement and cost reduction, originals manufactured
domestically will be assembled at TDK Thailand.  The sale of
these imports will commence after April.  Although the last
couple of  years had seen a vigorous marketing war unfold in the
domestic video tape market which had included imported products,
TDK had managed to continue producing 100% domestically by means
of concentrating production facilities

Nippon Columbia in JV in China for Audio Equipment


   Nippon Columbia <6791> will soon embark upon a joint venture
in China for the manufacture of audio equipment.  As one link in
the chain of the Hitachi Group's managerial strategy, it will
manufacture a whole audio product line including mini-components
and karaoke machines by teaming up with a local firm in Fukien
province with which Hitachi has established a cooperative
relationship for joint TV production.  The amount of paid in
capital as well as the percentage of contributory financing is
still under adjustment but it expects to settle the joint
venture contract and commence production in the spring.
Although Columbia is producing audio equipment in China on a
consignment basis, they will solidify their footing in this
growth market by building a factory at their own expense.  By
manufacturing in China, the Hard Division's 40% overseas
production ratio will be raised to over 50% in 1996.

Fuji Electric Bumps Overseas Procurement 50%


   In a new-year announcement by the president of Fuji Electric
<6504>, the company expects to increase overseas procurement of
materials by 50%, to the value of 4.5 billion yen, in fiscal
1996.  Anticipating a long-term trend in yen appreciation,
management has determined to deepen ties with overseas
facilities, including a plant producing small, industrial-use
motors in Dalian, China, to enhance cost effectiveness.  This
move should yield a four-to-five percent improvement in the
sales-to-current profit ratio.  The company will also procure
raw materials, such as copper, iron and aluminum.

Olympus Optical Targeting Profitability at Rate of US$1 = 80 Yen


   Olympus Optical <7733> aims to restructure its R&D and
manufacturing systems by FY98, to ensure profitability even at
an exchange rate of US$1 = 80 yen.  The company, which relied on
exports for more than 60% of its sales, realized the importance
of an exchange-rate-resistant strategy during the first half of
FY95, when yen appreciation was rampant.  The manufacturer's
three- year management plant includes measures the company will
employ to achieve this profitability.  For example, by FY98
Olympus Optical plans to increase its overseas production ratio
to 80%, compared with 65% at present.

Profit Increases for March Term at 2 Bearing Manufacturers


   For 2 manufacturers of steel balls for bearings the outlook
for the March 1996 term is for profit and income increases due
to increased demand from makers of household appliances and
small PC peripherals.  Current profits for Amatsuji Steel Ball
<6475> are expected to show a 30% increase over the previous
term to 3.4 billion yen while Tsubakimoto Precision Products
<6477> is expected to show a 26% increase to 2.7 billion yen.
The two companies, due to their no debt management style, will
show financial income with decreased profit margins due to the
reduction in interest rates while securing profit increases as a
result of rises in operating rates and rationalized
manufacturing processes.  For Amatsuji, there will be increases
in shipments of steel balls for industrial arts equipment as
well as export increases to SE Asia in addition to its PC
shipments.  Gross sales are expected to increase 9% to 20.8
billion yen while sales profits are expected to expand 43% to
3.2 billion yen.  For Tsubakimoto Precision Products, exports to
Europe and ball screws for industrial arts machines are expected
to increase.  With gross sales increasing 10% to 14.5 billion
yen sales profits are expected to show a 31% increase to 2.4
billion yen.

   NEC <6701> will produce Sun Microsystem's Sparc, the RISC MPU
hearts of such items as workstations.  This consignment is
linked to increased orders of ASICs for Sparc.  NEC will acquire
Sparc design data and manufacturing technology from Sparc
Technology Business, Sun's semiconductor division.  The company
plans to start production of low- cost, 64b RISC MPUs for Sparc
WSs at its Kumamoto facility in 1996.  Monthly output will be
several thousand, 8-inch silicon wafer conversions.  NEC hopes
that with the consigned technology the company will accumulate
the necessary capabilities to fabricate peripheral ICs and
expand ASIC operations.

Hitachi to Enter Full Production of Semiconductors in SE Asia


   Hitachi <6501> is getting into Malaysia with a South Korean
semiconductor maker, the first time Japanese and Korean
companies are doing so, and into Singapore with Nippon Steel
<5401>, that company's first overseas semiconductor venture.
Total investment, including construction of pre-assembly
factories for semiconductor fabrication, hovers at the 230
billion yen mark.  Production of 16Mb  and 64Mb DRAMs will begin
in 1998.  The facility in Malaysia will give Hitachi integrated
production capacity there, since the company already operates a
local plant for pre- assembly processes, and will reinforce the
company's supply capabilities in the rapidly growing
semiconductor markets of Southeast Asia.

New Line for Nikon Film Scanners


   Nikon <7731> has embarked on increased production of film
scanners, which transfer images from film to PCs.  A new line at
the company's Ibaraki-based lens subsidiary will help boost
monthly output to the 3,000- unit level in January.  Nikon is
faced with a hollowing out of camera operations, as camera sales
falter and the company shifts production overseas, but
skyrocketing growth in PCs and peripheral equipment has
reinvigorated domestic operations.  The Ibaraki plant, with
about 1,000 employees, had transferred lens operations to a Thai
facility, but the investment of several tens of millions of yen
has allowed the subsidiary to branch out into not only scanner
production to complement new, semiconductor stepper activities.

     *Welcome to the first issue of OPEN SYSTEMS REPORT, the
latest addition to the Phillips Publishing, Inc. family of
newsletters.
     In the past few years there has been much progress in the
development of products and services that automate virtually
every aspect of business operations.  Though this has had a
dramatic influence on corporate America, the full strategic
benefits of business automation have not been realized because
corporate users have found it difficult to share information
across hardware and software manufactured by different vendors.
As executives recognize that current investments in systems and
networks are a strategic asset and not just an overhead cost,
corporate leaders are realizing that systems must talk to each
other in an "open" data communications environment.
     Every other week, OPEN SYSTEMS REPORT will report on the
user strategies that will transform operations as open systems
are deployed, and keep you abreast of the vendor offerings that
will underpin your open system architecture.  Phillips
Publishing, Inc. is uniquely positioned to bring you this
information because our experienced team of editors has been
providing hard-hitting, analytical coverage of competitive
communications strategies for more than a decade.  Now here's the
news:

SURVIVING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN:  HOW A LONG-TERM OPEN SYSTEMS
STRATEGY CAN ENHANCE YOUR COMPETITIVE EDGE

     As the crisis in the Persian Gulf continues to escalate, gas
prices soar ever skyward and the stock market plummets, business
is beginning to take a harder look at the bottom line.  Though
every sector of an organization will feel a downsizing squeeze,
it is perhaps the department least understood by senior
management that gets cut the fastest: information technology
(IT).
     While most IT managers are struggling to maintain existing
systems, experts are saying a long-term plan to migrate to open
systems will provide businesses with the strategic information
tools they need to meet the competitive challenges of the coming
decade.
     "The [open systems] market is going to explode in my
estimation because you are going to be able to put [systems] in
faster and easier and better and less expensively, and you won't
have to maintain them as much," said Mike Kaminski,
communications/MAP program manager for General Motors.
     Unfortunately, most businesses continue to take a short-
term, bottom-line approach to information technology, especially
in today's economic climate.
     "The economy is tight.  Everybody is trying to downsize
layers of management," said Rick Barron, principal computer
specialist for McDonnell Douglas Corp.  "And one of our barriers
[to open systems] is short-term vs. long-term focus, which is
getting worse instead of better--exactly the opposite of what the
management book tells us is the right way to act."
     Barron likens building an open systems environment to
building a new road:  "We all know that modifying an existing
highway is a lot more painful than building a new one."
     "When you build a new one you don't think about it while
it's being built and all of the sudden, it's there.  When you're
making the change to an existing highway, it really disrupts what
you're doing," Barron explains.  "Right now, the business
community cannot afford any disruption to try to get to something
that's going to solve their problems 5 years from now."
     Even if companies don't see the need for open systems, they
need to think strategically for the future.  As Barron explains,
"You could be driving down the highway and not have traffic jams
so you say the road's not broke.  Well if you think strategically
and say, here's where the new housing developments are, here's
where the new shopping centers are...[etc.], 3 years from now,
there's going to be 3 times as much traffic.  This road is broke
strategically."

Market growth to necessitate move to open systems

     The demand for computers in business today is growing as
fast as the need for new highways.  And just as local politicians
are running their campaigns on growth strategy platforms, so are
vendors taking a stand on open systems.
     "The number of computers is doubling every year, the price
is declining every year, and the power is doubling every 2
years," says Steve Kelly, Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
marketing manager for Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC).  "If you
look at the magnitude and the growth, the only thing that can
support this long-term network infrastructure without a
bottleneck is OSI."
     Though vendors and users may agree that open systems is a
good solution, some vendors have been wary of going hog wild on
OSI product offerings because users have been slow to buy.
"'There's no open systems,' that's what the customers are saying.
And the vendors are saying, 'I got 'em...but nobody's buying 'em.
And they're both right," says GM's Kaminski.
     It seems that neither vendors nor users want to take the
initial risks.  "Would you buy the first telephone?" asks Rick
Barron.  "Would you buy the second telephone?  You've got to get
to a [point] where there's a critical enough mass [and] you
become a follower."
     How do you stop the chicken-and-egg cycle?  "We've got to
work to make sure we purchase things we ask for," says GM's
Kaminski.  "This is a partnership.  No longer can we afford to
have...users dictating in great detail saying this is what we
want and not buy it."
     But even when an IT manager decides to go the open systems
route, the burden of convincing upper management still rests on
him.  "I think what we'll see is people recognizing the business
opportunities of putting a standard network in place," says Phil
Wimpenny, program development manager for Unisys OSI products.
"If there isn't that recognition at the senior level...that this
is a benefit, then it becomes just a cost.  Those that don't back
it are going to find things are much tougher when all their
competitors can deliver faster."

Birth of an IT salesman:  How not to become the Willie Loman of
open systems

     So, how do you sell senior management on open systems?  "You
sell problems, you don't sell solutions," says Barron.  "First
off, the IT folks have to get the chip off their shoulder in
thinking they are the most important people in the world.
Everybody's going for the CEO's ear and everybody's got their own
perspective about what their contribution to the bottom line is.
     "So you can't go in and tell him you've got this great new
solution.  He doesn't care.  What you've got to do is point out
to him the problem:  'wouldn't you like to reduce this time from
5 days to 1 day?'  And you don't tell him you're doing it through
open systems.  What you say is, hey, I need $100,000 and what I
will do with that $100,000 is give you a scheduling system that
does this, a manufacturing control system that does this, allow
you to talk internationally to so and so, etc."
     Barron also suggests the Barbie doll strategy.
"Manufacturers can give away Barbie dolls because they make money
on all the accessories," Barron explains.  The idea behind this
marketing technique is to give a customer something he may not
want, but once he has it, he's hooked.
     "Electronic mail is a great example," says Barron.  "Most of
our users did not want to go to E-mail and didn't understand how
it could change the way they do business.  You give it to them,
and now you can't take that stuff away."
     Finally, a good technique is to find a highly visible area
of the company that has increased productivity or cut costs
through IT, and have the head of that department tell senior
management what IT did for him.  Then it's up to the CEO to go to
IT and ask how they can help the rest of the company.
     "We've got to deliver results," says Barron.  "Find your
focus and go in with small pockets and pilots to get there, and
force the pressure down from the top rather than take it to the
top."

OSI PRODUCTS:  SUPPLY IS GROWING, BUT IS DEMAND KEEPING PACE?

     The experts tell us that open systems is the next major wave
in computing, but when industry veterans hear this, a wry smile
seems to naturally form on their faces.  They will lean back in
their chairs, scratch their heads and chuckle to themselves.
"I've been talking about Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) since
the '70s," they will say.  And often, it's true.
     "It's a lack of products," they will postulate, as an
explanation of why the rest of the world has taken so long to
jump on the OSI bandwagon.  But judging by the proliferation of
vendors expected to display their wares at next week's Interop
conference and exhibition in San Jose, Calif.--over 175 at last
count--product availability is not the only problem.
     Virtually all major computer vendors have at least one OSI
product on the market today, or at the very least, an OSI
strategy.  It appears that the recent Aug. 15 deadline for
government procurement specifications to include Government OSI
Profile (GOSIP)-compliance as a requirement has had a distinct
impact on the speed with which vendors have brought OSI products
to market.
     In fact, most vendors' OSI strategies seem to almost mirror
the federal government's movement to GOSIP.  For example, GOSIP
Version 1 specifies X.400 electronic messaging and File Transfer
Access Management (FTAM) at the application layer.  Ten out of
the 10 vendors surveyed by OPEN SYSTEMS REPORT (see chart, pp. 4-
5) have X.400 products; 8 out of 10 have FTAM products.
     Other application layer products are few and far between,
with Virtual Terminal (VT), which is included in GOSIP Version 2,
heading the list.

Driving OSI home

     While GOSIP is clearly a driving force for vendors to
develop products, many users are still wary of vendors'
commitment to OSI.  They wonder what the real strategy is when
vendors declare a strong commitment to OSI, yet invest more
resources in developing their own proprietary systems.  Clearly,
users have some reason to be concerned: only 3 vendors in the
OPEN SYSTEMS REPORT survey were willing to disclose what
percentage of their R&D budget is dedicated to OSI product
development.
     Vendors, on the other hand, have to wrestle with a market of
users claiming it wants OSI, but, in reality, may be too short-
term minded to make the leap.  "There's a marketplace that's
opening up, but we're still in the earlier stages," observes Phil
Wimpenny, program development manager for Unisys OSI products.
     According to Wimpenny, senior management recognition of the
advantages of using information technology as a competitive
advantage rather than an overhead expense will drive user
acceptance of OSI.

A buyer's guide to OSI products

     Once you have made the commitment to migrate to OSI, there
are a few important things to keep in mind.  First, so-called
"OSI applications" are a myth.  X.400, for example, is not
electronic mail.  OSI products at the application layer, like
other OSI products, are really just protocols for transporting
information in a certain way.
     This is why, for example, Hewlett-Packard sells its HP Open
Mail application that uses X.400 separately from HP X.400.  HP
Open Mail provides the user interface for writing the letter, so
to speak.  It sits on HP X.400, which delivers the mail.
     Other vendors, such as Data General, will bundle their
proprietary electronic mail application (as the user interface)
with their X.400 product.  It is the user interface--the actual
application--that provides a means for vendors to differentiate
their products.
     It's also important to note that OSI is fairly difficult to
install.  When asked what was the average installation time for
their products, vendors responses varied widely--from 1 hour to 1
week.  It is probably fair to assume that the only way an OSI
product could be installed in 1 hour is if it is not connected to
a network.  Because OSI requires configuring all other products
on the network, and because most systems managers lack OSI
expertise, expect installation to be difficult.  Sometimes
vendors can help.  Wang, for example, offers an installation
service for core products free of charge in some cases.
     In general, it's a good idea to develop an overall OSI
strategy before buying.  While in theory it is possible to mix
and match different protocols from different vendors, today it
isn't practical.  Some vendors, in particular, are notorious for
hooking each layer together so tightly, that so much tweaking is
required to achieve true plug-and-play computing it isn't worth
it.

SHOPPING FOR OSI PRODUCTS:  FIVE WAYS TO ENSURE YOU GET WHAT YOU
PAID FOR

     True or false?  Interoperability testing tells you if a
product is going to work with other vendors' products in your
environment.  Conformance testing tells you a product complies
with international standards.  Interoperability testing is better
than conformance testing because it's more like a "real world"
situation.  If you said true to any of the above, read on.
     None of the above statements are 100% true.  They can be
true, but more often than many users realize, they are not.

What testing can do for you

     Buying an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) product is like
buying a VCR.  You want it to do what it's supposed to do (play
and record videotapes), to fit in with what you already have
(your TV set) and to work with other products that conform to the
standard (VHS tapes).
     Testing is supposed to guarantee those 3 things.  And it
does--if properly understood.  But when interpreted improperly,
testing is no more valuable than a lifetime warranty on a beta
VCR in a town that only sells VHS videos.
     Below are 5 guidelines for interpreting testing to make sure
that the hot product you thought you bought doesn't cool off
before you get it installed:

1) Understand fully what conformance testing is and what it can
do for you.

     Conformance testing is more than a rubber stamp of approval
that a product meets international standards.  Conformance
testing also shows how a product handles errors and performs
under unexpected situations:  what a product does when it is fed
bad data or how it recovers after a power surge.
     "When you build an implementation, you're crazy if you build
it so it knowingly produces errors.  You want to build it so it
works correctly," explains Howard Berkowitz, principal consulting
engineer for the Corporation for Open Systems (COS).  "Now, you
take that thing out and you want to run it against somebody
else's implementation that works correctly.  For the correct
behavior, everything's fine.  [But what happens when] someone
walks in between the 2 and cuts the cable connecting them?"
     In some ways, it can be said that conformance testing
simulates more of a "real world" situation than interoperability
testing because it tests 3 kinds of behavior:  the valid, the
invalid and the inopportune, all of which occur in the real
world.
     "The invalid says what I just sent you is garbage,"
Berkowitz explains.  "And the inopportune is where I sent
something that's a reasonable message, but it's out of context."
Because the majority of code in most OSI products is dedicated to
error handling, Berkowitz notes, interoperability testing alone
will not exercise 60-90% of what those products can do.

2) Keep vendors accountable.

     Lots of vendors will say they have conducted some kind of
testing, but it's unclear what that really means.  Sometimes
vendors may say their product has undergone conformance testing,
but it was not done at an accredited test center, or the product
did not complete testing successfully.
     Says Nancy Pierce, manager of the COS Test Center, "Having
undergone conformance testing and having completed conformance
testing are 2 very different things.  You can undergo conformance
testing and come up with a lot of failures."
     Difficult as it may be to believe, some vendors will
advertise having undergone conformance testing, even though their
products failed.
     In addition, vendors may buy conformance test software and
run it in their own labs.  But their labs may not be accredited,
either through the National Institute of Science and Technology's
(NIST) National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program
(NVLAP) or as a COS Test Center.  While the products may still
prove conformant even if they aren't tested in an accredited lab,
accredited labs will guarantee conformance if the products pass
the tests.

3) Get proof.

     The proof is in the certification in the OSI market.  What
that means today is a COS Mark.  In the near future, it will also
mean Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) registration, as soon as labs
begin to receive NVLAP accreditation and products can be tested
for GOSIP conformance and interoperability.
     The COS Mark currently requires only conformance testing,
and according to Pierce, the COS Strategy Forum rejected the idea
of making interoperability testing part of the COS Mark
requirements at its last meeting in September.
     However, the COS Mark does include an Interoperability
Analysis Service (IAS) which guarantees that if a "Marked"
product cannot interoperate with another "Marked" product, and
the vendors cannot resolve the problem, COS will intervene on
behalf of the user.

4) Find out exactly the environment the interoperability test was
conducted in.

     "Interoperability testing is important, but users need to be
aware that interoperability testing varies depending on the
environment in which the testing occurred," Pierce cautions.
"[For example,] they could be testing interoperability over an
X.25 network, and the user has an 802.3 network.  It could be
version A of a product and the user has version B."
     Users need to understand their own operating environment
fully, and then compare it to the environment in which the
interoperability test was conducted.

5) Safeguard yourself.

     Finally, write into your procurement specifications that the
vendor has to guarantee to resolve any interoperability or
conformance problems, suggests Chris Moore, product marketing
manager for Touch Communications.
     Even if a product is certified, registered and stamped with
every seal of approval known to man, problems are bound to arise.
     According to Pierce, "It's really hard to generalize about
whether or not there will be interoperability problems, but the
likelihood is pretty good that there will be some problems.  They
may be very minor.  And those problems may be very easy to fix,
but the chances that there will be some interoperability problems
when you're initially bringing a network up are pretty high."
     In the open systems marketplace, with its promise of greater
freedom of choice, users are in the driver's seat.  Vendors
should be more willing than ever to offer some sort of guarantee.

                         FLAWED VISION

Will Bob Frankenberg's attempts to abandon the legacy of his
predecessor and refocus Novell on its core competencies work?

For Sale By Owner, read the sign hung outside Building E at
Novell's Provo, Utah headquarters last month. It was a prank, of
course, and was quickly torn down by security guards. But it
accurately reflected the mood of uncertainty at the 7,000-strong
networking software market leader, where a firesale is underway
of many of the 20 businesses Novell acquired over the past five
years and where rumours persist that IBM and AT&T are eyeing the
company for acquisition.

In the 18 months since Bob Frankenberg took over the chief
executive's role from company founder Ray Noorda, he has been
forced to make a series of screeching U-turns. Initially an
enthusiastic supporter of Noorda's vision for the company,
Frankenberg has had to face the harsh reality that many of the
industry-shaking strategies set in motion by Noorda in his final
years at Novell, now seem misguided and in need of dismantling.

The Noorda dream was multi-dimensional, but it had one underlying
theme - to build Novell into a company with a breadth of products
that could stand up to the 'Redmond bully', Microsoft's Bill
Gates. Through its June 1994 acquisition of WordPerfect and
Borland's Quattro Pro division, Novell would be able to compete
as the number two vendor in the office applications software
market. Success there would come from creating a new breed of
'network applications' that resulted from the combination of the
applications with Novell's flagship product, the NetWare network
operating system. Another combination, of NetWare and Unix, made
possible by Novell's takeover of AT&T's Unix Systems Labs, would
make Novell the primary force in networked operating system
technology.

But the dream has turned sour. WordPerfect sales have atrophied,
flattening Novell's revenues and undermining the compelling logic
of building network versions of the products. Revenue growth has
fluctuated between -1% and 10% in recent quarters. At the same
time, NetWare 4, the two-year-old upgrade to the world's best-
selling network operating system, has been breaking records as
one of the industry's slowest selling software upgrades ever. And
rather than stand up to Microsoft, Novell has been forced into
retreat as NetWare has come under intense competitive pressure
from Microsoft Windows NT, which by many accounts is maturing to
match much of the unique networking functionality that previously
distinguished the Novell product.

                           THE REALITY

The upshot is that Frankenberg has been clicking the undo button
on almost all Noorda's major acquisitions in a desperate effort
to re-focus Novell on its core competencies in networking
software. Many of the very products that a year ago were going to
underpin the company's future, have now been sold off or are up
for grabs. The company has already divested itself of - or is in
the process of selling - businesses that when purchased cost
Novell close to $1.5 billion in shares and cash. Most notably,
WordPerfect and the Borland Quattro Pro assets, which it bought
for a combined sum of $965 million in mid-1994, are on the market
for an estimated $300 million; the rights to the Unix operating
systems, which came with its purchase of AT&T's Unix Systems
Labs, have been passed to Hewlett-Packard; and Novell's Unixware
Unix-on-Intel implementation has been sold to Novell's chief
competitor in the segment, Santa Cruz Operation.

James Tolonen, chief financial officer at Novell, claims that the
decision to sell WordPerfect was carefully considered and was not
a reaction to stock market sentiments: "When Frankenberg came on
board, he instituted his own strategy and decided to move away
from Ray's strategy of broadening our focus. Although he
initially supported Unix and WordPerfect, it became clear that
focusing on our core business was the best strategy."

Industry sources also point out that Novell is not quite finished
with shedding businesses and that its Appware division, which
produces software application development tools, is likely to be
dropped too. Tolonen said that several third parties had inquired
about purchasing the Appware business.

Novell has also backed out of several technology collaborations.
Most importantly it has quit its long-term involvement in
OpenDoc, an effort with IBM and Apple to build an object
communication architecture. As Gartner Group market analyst David
Cappuccio says, "Ray [Noorda] never saw a technology he didn't
like," and Frankenberg is having to live with the consequences.

                        POOR TRACK RECORD

That the WordPerfect and Unix acquisitions didn't work out is not
a surprise to some Novell observers who point out that Novell's
track record shows little success with takeovers. In his early
days at Novell, Noorda masterminded the acquisition of Santa
Clara Systems and Excelan - both of which came to little. Then
there was the acquisition of SoftCraft which failed to go
anywhere and was later resold to its previous owners. Digital
Research and its DOS clone DR-DOS was to have offered an
alternative to MS-DOS, another venture that failed to deliver on
its promise; then Unix Systems Laboratories from AT&T was to have
united the Unix world on a single standard to fight Microsoft
Windows and Windows NT.

But just how bad have things become at Novell? And how rock solid
is the networking base from which Frankenberg is trying to launch
a comeback? The answer to these questions is bound up with
Novell's competitive relationship with Microsoft.

                           THE LEGACY

Back in May 1994, when the former Hewlett-Packard veteran was
lined up as Noorda's successor, he stated that one of the primary
reasons for his interest in the position was the potential of
Novell's pending acquisition of WordPerfect. This was to have
been the final piece in Noorda's strategy to make Novell into
Microsoft's most formidable competitor.

Noorda did not see himself as someone obsessed with checking
Microsoft's expansion; rather he wanted to be seen as the man who
took action on behalf of an industry-wide resentment among both
vendors and customers against Microsoft's dominant position.
Noorda's public statements criticising Microsoft, and his efforts
to involve the Justice Department in an anti-trust investigation
of Microsoft, were all part of the crusade. It was to be his
legacy to the entire PC industry: Noorda would be hailed by
future generations as the man who stood up to Bill Gates.

Noorda's anti-Microsoft strategy has become an expensive failure,
primarily because "it is difficult to be anti-anything because
you're not selling anything", Dataquest analyst Paul Cubbage
points out.

According to Cubbage, Unix could have been the company's best bet
in taking on Microsoft. However, calling Unix the "Yugoslavia of
software", Cubbage says the different Unix backers could never
get their act together to challenge Microsoft on the desktop.
"Novell also threw away the Unix brand name, something it could
have used to great advantage in marketing," Cubbage adds.

Noorda is receiving much of the blame for Novell's wrong turn in
its business strategy, but his greatest weakness was, as one
industry insider says, that "he had a huge ego and wanted to be
as big as Bill Gates". Noorda's decisions were also emotionally
based. He not only disliked Bill Gates but harboured long-
standing resentments against other industry figures such as Lotus
Development chief Jim Manzi. Manzi earned a place on Noorda's
enemies list after the failure of efforts to merge Novell with
Lotus in 1990.

When Novell was discussing the acquisition of WordPerfect, Manzi
was also in the bidding for the $600 million word processing
giant, so Noorda saw an excellent opportunity to hit back at both
Gates and Manzi with one blow - albeit a questionably expensive
one.

Delaying his retirement until he could hand-pick a successor,
Noorda finally left Novell, confident that Frankenberg would
execute the grand plan. Yet within two weeks of Noorda's
departure, Frankenberg was sitting down with Bill Gates in
Seattle, trying to arrange a cease-fire and to end a stream of
customer complaints about how the lack of co-operation between
the two companies was affecting product compatibility and
creating technical support problems. Perhaps it is not surprising
that Frankenberg did this, he was at one time HP's Microsoft
liaison and the HP philosophy was that working with Microsoft has
always been good for business. Even Frankenberg, in various
interviews, stated that he thought Noorda had "gone too far [with
his] overfocus on Microsoft".

Part of Novell's grand plan with its acquisitions was to produce
"Super NOS". This was to be a close integration of NetWare
integrated with Unix to provide an application server - alongside
the NetWare PC LAN file and print server - that would compete
directly with Windows NT. Alongside that, the WordPerfect and the
Borland applications would provide a tightly integrated and
network-capable suite of powerful office applications,
PerfectOffice, that would compete with Microsoft's Office suite.
Add the OpenDoc software development technology being developed
with Apple Computer and IBM, and that would result in a broad
software portfolio capable of competing head-to-head with
Microsoft in operating systems, networking, applications and
applications development tools. The trouble was that it placed
the company in the path of the Microsoft steamroller and it
couldn't move quickly enough into a competitive position.

"It was a reasonable strategy but Novell just couldn't bring it
all together," says Stan Schatt, LAN research director at market
research company Computer Intelligence Infocorp (CII). "There was
never a strong Unix voice inside the company. And it was all 18
months too late. I still think that it was a wrong move to get
rid of Unix."

And although Novell's shareholders did not like the WordPerfect
acquisition, Karl Wong, software industry analyst at Dataquest,
says the company should have decided to hang on to WordPerfect.
"Novell capitulated to Microsoft too readily. It still had the
prospect of doing reasonably well with Windows 95 versions of its
software suite," he says.

But the advent of Windows 95 was the last straw. The legacy of
not co-operating with Microsoft meant that WordPerfect developers
made slow progress in readying a Windows 95 version of their
software. Even now it is not due to ship until early next year.
As a result, the launch of Windows 95 in August prompted a
nosedive in WordPerfect software sales as customers turned first
to the Microsoft Office suite, knowing it would work well in the
Windows 95 environment. WordPerfect revenues have dwindled ever
since. During the third quarter, applications software sales fell
35% to $86.1 million, representing only 16% of Novell's total
revenues. In the fourth quarter that was closer to $60 million,
or 13% of revenues, compared with $134 million, or 28% of
revenues, a year earlier.

That raised the 'For Sale' sign on all WordPerfect applications,
with one exception, GroupWise. This is the groupware package that
Novell still sees as a strategic component in its future network
focus.

But industry observers point out that there may be few keen
buyers of a business that is competing against Microsoft's 90%
market share of the $720 million office suite market. According
to Dataquest, Novell's PerfectOffice suite and IBM's Lotus
Smartsuite split the remaining 10% almost equally. Only a few
months ago, Frankenberg was talking of aiming for a 20% share of
the office suite market - inspired by an integration of the
applications with networking and groupware.

Unable to let go of his dream, Noorda, now in his early
seventies, is bidding again for WordPerfect through his
investment firm Canopy Technologies. Other potential buyers
include IBM, which might want to strengthen its SmartSuite set of
office software with a word-processing package that has a huge
installed base compared with the less than pervasive
AmiPro/WordPro. There is also a possibility of a management
buyout by WordPerfect executives.

Although shareholders applauded the news of the WordPerfect sale
by boosting Novell's share price, the move does not hearten
industry observers who question whether it is part of Novell's
carefully thought out business strategy or if it is a knee-jerk
reaction designed to revive the company's flagging share price.

The question is: was Novell pushed by the stock market to dump
WordPerfect or did it move of its own accord? Until fairly
recently, Frankenberg and Sheldon Laube, Novell's chief technical
officer, maintained their commitment to WordPerfect in interviews
and public speeches.

"You would have thought that if Novell had planned to sell
WordPerfect, it would have prepared it a bit better and not
chased away some of the top WordPerfect people," says David
Coursey, editor of PC Letter. "It diluted the WordPerfect
franchise which will make it harder to sell."

The other part of Noorda's anti-Microsoft strategy, OpenDoc, has
also faltered. Novell has passed the development of the Windows
version of OpenDoc to IBM - a move that worries some analysts.
"We know how quickly IBM can get products to market," says
Cubbage of Dataquest. "OpenDoc seems pretty much brain dead right
now."

                          THE NT THREAT

But dropping Unix, WordPerfect and OpenDoc still does not remove
Novell from the path of Microsoft. Windows NT, Microsoft's server
operating system, is rapidly gaining momentum, according to Jesse
Berst, editor of Windows Watcher newsletter: "NT is getting
better with improved file and print services." With Microsoft
pitching NT as a superset of NetWare functionality, Novell has an
increasingly difficult task in showing where it adds value.
"NetWare is still a better product in what it does, but companies
installing NT get the file and print services thrown in free of
charge," points out Berst.

"Windows NT is a serious threat to Novell," says Dataquest's
Wong.

Dataquest estimates that Microsoft will ship 1.9 million Windows
NT licences in 1995, compared with Novell's 1.3 million or so
licence sales of NetWare. What is not clear, however, is the
percentage of new NT sites that would have previously become
NetWare users or what percentage of NT sales are actually NetWare
knock-outs.

Computer Intelligence's Stan Schatt, for one, doesn't see a
dramatic move to NT within NetWare's installed base. "We conduct
more than 30,000 user phone calls each month and there is nothing
there that shows a big trend from NetWare to NT. NetWare has
about 66% of the [network operating system] market but prospects
for significant growth [beyond that] are doubtful. It will lose
market share slowly, just as any vendor with such a dominant
share can expect to."

Dataquest's Cubbage sees NT helping to grow the entire network
market which will mean that Novell's core business should grow
with the market even if its total market share declines. "NetWare
is a very good product and, as our analysis of the costs of
running networks shows, NetWare does pretty well, mainly because
Novell has ensured that support personnel are well trained,"
Cubbage says.

Dataquest reckons that about 20% of the NetWare user base will go
to NT rather than NetWare 4. In fact, where NT is displacing a
current system, in 80% of cases it is knocking out IBM's OS/2,
says the analyst group. Others agree: "Novell will remain the
dominant provider of network operating systems," says Forrester
Research, "while NT will become a critical applications
platform."

"With NT's growing popularity, companies are wondering if they
can't just install NT, eliminate Novell, and move forward.
Forrester believes the answer is no. NetWare is a network
operating system while NT is a server operating system. These are
very different animals.

In contrast to its previously aggressive tone regarding Microsoft
products, Novell has adopted a more realistic outlook on the
market regarding NT. "NT is a good product and we believe it will
be very successful for Microsoft," states Novell chief financial
officer Tolonen.

But it is not an either/or decision for customers - NT is more of
a data and applications server; NetWare is a network server. "We
see a world in which there are heterogeneous networks with
different operating systems and different hardware platforms,
with NetWare providing the 'glue' that binds them."

The strategy is to co-exist in the market with Microsoft - and
anybody else who emerges - and concentrate on Novell's focus on
its core network business. To that effect, Novell is working on a
version of NetWare for Windows NT, due early next year.

But what is the potential for that core networking business in
the years to come. Over the past two years, Novell has
encountered some difficulties in getting customers to switch
their networks to its latest technology, NetWare 4. Even now, its
most recent figures show sales of NetWare 3.1 outweighing those
of NetWare 4 , with 3.1 sales accounting for about 55% of NetWare
revenues compared with 45% for 4.1.

One reason is that NetWare 3.1 provides an adequate level of
functionality for a large number of its customers, and another is
that the initial upgrade, NetWare 4.0, had some technical
problems. These have been fixed and the product is now described
by analysts as robust.

To encourage a drift towards NetWare 4.1, Novell has cut its
price by 25% and now says that sales are exceeding those of
NetWare 3.1. That helped its networking software revenues grow by
17% during the first nine months of fiscal 1995.

Novell is also focusing on expanding the reach of NetWare through
NetWare Directory Services (NDS), although this key component has
far from fulfilled its promise yet. NDS is at the heart of
Novell's 'smart network' concept. It keeps track of NetWare users
- where they are, what they need - and automatically links users
to requested information and services no matter where these
reside on the network. In addition, extensions to NDS could be
used to manage licensing and use of applications.

Another important direction for Novell is to create virtual
networking with NetWare, to allow 'pervasive computing'. Through
NetWare Connect Services (NCS) it seeks to allow the linking of
more than 2.5 million NetWare networks into a single global
network. Novell has teamed up with AT&T to enable separate
NetWare networks to be connected through AT&T network services
and to allow NetWare users access to the Internet. Novell claims
that 15 telecommunications companies around the world have
committed to offering NCS services over the coming year. The
long-term goal is also to extend networking services into the
home through NetWare-enabled cable TV boxes and telephone
connections that could control and monitor appliances within the
home.

Key to this strategy is the development of an embedded, small-
footprint (50 kilobyte) version of NetWare which can be contained
in an inexpensive chip and can control office machines as well as
being used to network and control home-based electronic
appliances and for applications such as car monitoring systems.
Called NetWare Embedded Systems Technology (NEST), this is how
Novell hopes to achieve its stated goal of having a billion
NetWare nodes by the year 2000 - up from 50 million today.

Part of NEST is a technology that enables data to be sent over
domestic electricity lines. This may open niche markets such as
remote monitoring of electrical power use in homes. NEST-enabled
cars, another proposed application, would be able to diagnose
problems and call up and schedule maintenance automatically.

"We don't see this as a niche market," says Glenn Ricart, senior
vice president of corporate research and development at Novell.
"We see this all as networking which is our number one business.
With our technology that can use power lines to transmit data, it
opens up a world of possibilities in the home so that household
appliances can be controlled through NetWare."

Xerox and Lexmark are a couple of major names cited by Novell as
OEM device manufacturers that intend to connect office and
consumer products to the NetWare networks. Currently, NEST
contributes about $1 million a quarter to the company's revenues.

Ricart also reveals that Novell has had talks with Sun regarding
Sun's Java computer language which could also offer a more
significant challenge to Microsoft because Java is platform
independent. "The trouble with Java is that it doesn't make use
of the network as much as it could. We are very interested in a
network-enabled type Java technology," Ricart says.

In addition, to help develop applications for its smart global
network, Novell plans to offer its Net2000 set of application
programming interfaces supporting C, C++ and Object Linking and
Embedding components plus popular software development tools such
as Visual Basic, Delphi and PowerBuilder.

There is also call for software that allows users on the network
to share work, which explains why, in shedding WordPerfect,
Novell hung on to the GroupWise groupware package. Groupwise has
an installed base of some five million users and is showing
revenue growth of 100% a year, according to Novell. The software
has twice the number of users of IBM's high profile groupware
package Lotus Notes. But GroupWise is also tightly integrated
with WordPerfect applications, and one without the other might
not be as attractive to customers.

"We will continue to work with whoever purchases the productivity
applications but the two products are sold separately anyway,"
points out Tolonen.

Novell's future directions are interesting but they are mostly
vaporware for now and the prospects of the new businesses
generating significant revenues could be two to three years away.
In the meantime, Novell is saddled with trying to raise revenues
from a customer base that is considering Windows NT, that is not
upgrading as quickly as it wants it to, and that will be less
than impressed by the company's ditching of so many of its
previously strategic products.

The medicine that Frankenberg has dished out may be bitter, but
analysts say it was very necessary. Frankenberg has changed the
perception of the company from one with a floundering strategy to
one that "now seems to have a definite direction," says Coursey
of PC Letter.

Frankenberg is still purging the Noorda legacy and rooting out
the remaining Noorda loyalists among the management. In doing so,
he has brought Novell almost full circle, back to where it was in
1993, and focused on its core NetWare business.

Despite the bad news on the application sales, Novell is a highly
profitable company with net income of about $300 million on flat
revenues of $2 billion. Tolonen sees better times ahead: "Our
core business grew in fiscal 1995 and we expect continuing
improvements, especially since we will not have the same drain on
resources with the sale of WordPerfect." He says NEST is already
showing small revenues and NetWare Connect Services will start to
bring in revenues in 1996.

While Novell analysts are generally supportive of the company's
renewed focus on its core business, the short-term prospects for
growing revenues are not encouraging.

"It will take time for Novell to develop its new businesses and
to produce revenues. NetWare 4 is selling well, although Novell
had to discount the price. But there will be substantial numbers
of customers that won't upgrade because what they have is all
they need right now," points out Schatt at Computer Intelligence
Infocorp.

But has Frankenberg's paring to the core of Novell's activities
made the company, wittingly or unwittingly, an attractive
takeover target. Industry rumours are linking Novell with IBM and
AT&T, or even network systems vendors such as Cisco Systems.

Bill Gates, for one, thinks a deal is pending: "Novell is
splitting itself in two. You have to ask why they split
themselves if they're not for sale," he told a Forrester Research
conference in November.

Certainly, any purchase of Novell would amount to the largest
ever software deal - by a factor of two. Even the waning of
Novell's shares in recent weeks still puts its market
capitalisation at about $6 billion. That is a hefty starting
price for any acquirer, but it can be weighed against the 60%
market share it would be buying, the $2 billion in revenues and
the $1.2 billion in cash that Novell has stashed in the bank.

Novell's challenge now is to rebuild its NetWare franchise and
take it into a network-enabled future where corporate networks
link with each other and virtually any electrical appliance could
be a NetWare node. But no one knows for sure how far away this
future is and if Novell has what it takes to get there. Its track
record on vision has not been the best. r Tom Foremski

            NETWARE VERSUS NT - THE NOVELL CHALLENGE

Novell's decision to pare back its business to a core of products
centred around its networking software prompts a critical
question: What are the competitive differences and how much
overlap is there between the Novell NetWare network operating
system and its aggressively-pitched rival, Microsoft's
server/applications operating system Windows NT? The fortunes of
Novell over the next half decade will rise or fall on the answer
to this question. If it can convince corporate customers that
NetWare adds compelling value to their networks - even if these
are NT networks - it will prosper. If NT becomes a superset of
NetWare - or is even perceived as such - Novell will struggled to
prosper.

For many analysts, it all boils down to the design foundation of
the two technologies. Network operating software is optimised for
certain functions; a server or applications operating system such
as NT is trying to address a different set of criteria. The
primary function of network operating systems - such as NetWare
and Banyan Vines - is to allow PC LAN workgroups to share files
and printers. But distributed environments have become more
complex. Such products have been evolving to offer additional
network services. Forrester Research identifies three important
areas:

* Global directory. Directories provide consistent naming of
users and resources across the network and thus the ability to
find and use servers, printers, applications and files no matter
where they are.
* Security. Network security handles authentication of the user
and manages user privileges across the various network resources.
* Management and administration. The ability to oversee the
entire network - and implement changes, additions and deletions -
from any point.

With the launch of NetWare 4, Novell added NetWare Directory
Services - "The brains behind NetWare that allow it to self-
discover and configure large-scale, distributed environments,"
says Forrester. In addition, Novell ManageWise provided a
seamless view of the network, desktop and user environment and
"superior management", adds Forrester. In comparison, NT has
basic file and print services, naming services and NT-to-NT
security. According to Forrester, Microsoft's focus on making NT
a competitor to major Unix servers from IBM and HP results in a
lack of focus on improving NT's networking capabilities across
multiple platforms. Other observations are that:

* The NT microkernel is tuned for running applications; NetWare
is designed for network services.
* NT has NetWare 3.x-like file and print services "with
diminishing performance", while NetWare offers fast distributed
file and print with native support for DOS/Win, Mac, OS/2, Unix.
* NT's current naming scheme is limited and relies on future
technology due with Microsoft's Cairo object environment,
scheduled for 1997/8; NetWare Directory Services are scalable and
robust, but difficult to extend.
* Microsoft's Systems Management Services product is designed to
manage Windows and NT desktops - not the NT environment, SNMP-
instrumented network devices or MS Exchange; NetWare integrates
management across network product protocols - SNMP, RMON and DMI.

For large corporate buyers "NetWare or NT?" is the wrong
question, says Forrester. Rather it recommends co-existence: "The
Global2000 need both." It suggests current NetWare 3.x sites
should use 4.1 for new LANs, and when 40% of sites are running
this newer environment, there is a clear business case in terms
of reduced administration and value-added services for upgrading
the remaining 3.1 LANs to 4.1. For those fixed on an NT strategy,
Forrester suggests users should pressurise Novell to port NDS to
NT - or hope that Microsoft buys Banyan and integrates its
Streettalk directory services with NT.

COMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW via NewsNet

                         CROWDED SKIES

Will attempts to build new, vast satellite networks capable of
providing telecommunications from any portable device on the
planet succeed?

If the plans of six newly formed international consortia come to
fruition, by the year 2001 there will be 1,012 new
telecommunications satellites orbiting the Earth. Putting them
there will cost at least $20 billion - a massive figure but one
likely to be dwarfed by the tens of billions it will cost to
maintain and run them, and to build a related terrestrial
infrastructure.

The purpose of this new fleet of spacecraft, which because of
their low altitude will keep burning up in the atmosphere, is to
provide portable voice, data and 'multi-media' telecommunications
to people anywhere on the planet. If it all works, a user of a
portable telephone or a personal digital assistant (PDA) will be
able to make or take international phone calls, exchange urgent
data files or roam the Internet, even if they are travelling
through the remotest parts of China or trekking across
Antarctica.

The technological challenges - viewed by many scientists as
highly ambitious - are being tackled almost entirely by private
companies, with little governmental involvement (some governments
are hostile to the idea). The companies involved, including
Motorola, McCaw Cellular, Loral Space Systems, Orbital Sciences
and Bill Gates (of Microsoft), foresee huge revenues from
satellite-based mobile telecommunications - as much as $150
billion a year according to some estimates. The difficulty and
cost of putting the infrastructure in place, along with the
relative freedom from national telecommunications regulations,
makes the prize even greater. Any company that establishes a
clear lead may see its revenues rocket into orbit along with its
satellites.

                    TAPPING THE PHONE MARKET

The market does not require the widespread adoption of new
technologies such as PDAs or cheap, portable Internet terminals -
although they will drive demand for anywhere-to-anywhere
communications. The suppliers have judged that the current
addiction to mobile telephones will create massive demand for
worldwide bandwidth. The use of mobile telephones is accelerating
rapidly across the world; this year the number of phones in use
will grow by 58%. Analysts predict that by the year 2000 there
will be at least a billion mobile phones, compared with 50
million today.

But all of these users will be crammed into the big commercial
centres. At least 70% of the world's surface is beyond the reach
of today's mobile phones. The satellite consortia calculate that
if they can cover the whole planet, large numbers of business
people will pay dearly to remain in constant contact with their
colleagues as they roam the telecommunications desert.

This desert is not confined to the outback. Large areas of
advanced countries such as the US are beyond the reach of
conventional cellular communications; and it may never be
feasible to build terrestrial networks in many such places.
Currently the only way of bringing instant communications to
these regions is via satellites. And the only way of ensuring no
square metre is left out is by using dozens of satellites.

But the technical challenge is immense. Unlike the majority of
existing commercial communications and broadcasting satellites,
the new telecommunications satellites will not be put in
geostationary orbits (which make them appear to be fixed over a
single point on the surface of the planet). Instead, they will be
continuously circling the Earth from pole to pole at high speed
and at altitudes of between 400 km and 1,000 km. This is low:
conventional geostationary satellites are usually set at about
36,000 km. For this reason, these new satellites are said to be
low Earth orbit (LEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) systems.

The reason for flying so low is that the mobile
telecommunications companies need to reduce the time required for
the round trip of a radio message from ground to satellite. With
a geostationary satellite, it can take a few seconds; with an LEO
or MEO system, it can be reduced to a few milliseconds. That will
allow them to be used for real-time conversations which, the
network operators hope, will be indistinguishable from a normal
terrestrial or local cellular telephone call.

                         DOWN TO EARTH?

The low altitude brings a major disadvantage - the satellites are
not completely clear of the Earth's atmosphere which will
gradually slow them down and eventually cause them to crash to
Earth. Each satellite in the new constellations will therefore
have a finite life and will need to be replaced. Rocket and
satellite makers and owners of launch sites around the world are
looking forward to their first mass market and expect to earn at
least $31 billion from the business over the next five years.
This means satellite mobile telecommunications will never be
cheap.

The networks will also require complex switching. Each
constellation of satellites is analogous to a conventional
cellular telephone system except that the infrastructure of radio
transceivers is moving rather than fixed to the ground. In a
terrestrial network, the user moves past the transceivers which
pass a call from one to the other. With the satellite networks,
effectively the user is stationary while the transceivers orbit
above him, and hand over the conversation from one to the other
as each passes overhead and then moves out of range.

While a terrestrial cellular network may need several thousand
base stations to provide unbroken coverage over an area
equivalent to, for example, the UK, the number of satellites
needed to cover Earth ranges from a dozen to several hundred
(depending on the type and quality of service they provide and
the altitude of their orbits).

At least six LEO/MEO projects are underway. Between them they
will put more than 1,000 satellites in orbit, which will need to
be replaced continually. But these figures could change. More
consortia may enter the market, and some analysts believe that
some of the existing groups will be forced to merge their
projects to keep costs down. There are no plans for the satellite
networks to interoperate directly.

In 1994, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, made world
headlines when he announced his intention to develop a satellite
network with McCaw Cellular (CBR, April 1994). But the idea of
such a system is widely credited to the US company that has
already provided a large proportion of the world's terrestrial
cellular telephone networks and user terminals - Motorola.

                       MOTOROLA'S IRIDIUM

Motorola announced its intention to set up a universal mobile
communications network using a large number of low Earth orbit
satellites in 1990. It named its system Iridium. The name derived
from its original plan to use 77 satellites - the number of
electrons which orbit the nucleus in an Iridium molecule.
Subsequently Motorola found it could manage with 66 satellites.

Motorola's model is complicated. The Iridium satellites will
communicate with terrestrial subscribers through highly
directional antennas on the satellite that break each satellite's
2,000-mile wide 'footprint' into 48 overlapping zones or cells. A
packet switch aboard the spacecraft allows any cell to support up
to 256 simultaneous conversations. This means each satellite can
in theory support more than 12,000 conversations.

As an Iridium craft passes overhead, a caller on the ground
appears to move between the cells, taking about 9 minutes to
traverse the entire 2,000 mile coverage zone. An onboard digital
switch ensures any connections in progress pass to the next cell
within the antenna coverage pattern. As the edge of the coverage
zone approaches the subscriber's handset, it establishes contact
with the next spacecraft coming over the horizon. Linking to the
terrestrial network is also complex. Each satellite has switching
systems on board to bundle all their digital traffic and downlink
it to one of about a dozen terrestrial 'gateways'. These will
provide access to the wired public switched telephone network
(PSTN) using conventional telephony switching gear.

When a spacecraft cannot access a gateway directly (if it is out
of range), it can use side-looking antenna to pass the traffic to
adjacent satellites. In this way traffic can be relayed across
several satellites until it can be downlinked to a gateway.

Iridium has not faced only technical hurdles. When it was
announced, it made enemies of terrestrial cellular operators -
many of them major customers of Motorola - which saw Iridium as a
major competitor. Motorola has now opted for a 'one world, one
phone' policy. The idea is that a dual standard phone or portable
computing device will always search out the nearest terrestrial
digital cellular network first, and make a connection through
that. It will only talk directly to a satellite if no other
network is available. The same applies when trying to contact a
subscriber.

This policy shift could cost Motorola a significant slice of its
Iridium revenues - but gives it a clear, long-term advantage.
Many cellular operators have now signed up as Iridium partners.
Teledesic is also taking a similar line.

                         GATES AND MCCAW

If Iridium is ambitious, the plan hatched by two former school
classmates in Seattle, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Craig McCaw of
McCaw Cellular, must rate as one of the potential wonders of the
world. In fact, analysts have compared their Teledesic project
with the building of the Pyramids.

Gates is said to have approached Craig McCaw, founder of the US's
largest cellular telephone operating company, with the idea of
the Teledesic system in 1992/3. He was attracted by the Iridium
idea, but wanted to focus more on high-bandwidth data
communications. This means more satellites.

In fact, Teledesic will require no less than 840 satellites to
provide instant multimedia communications for users of personal
broadband terminals. Senior Teledesic executives say people who
want to use this type of personal communicator should be able to
do so on a whim wherever they are.

Teledesic seems to be an attempt to build a global equivalent of
existing public telecommunications networks in the sky. The plan
is to operate the satellites in flocks of about 40, in 21 polar
orbits ranging from 695 to 705 kilometres above the Earth. Each
satellite will cover a circular footprint about 700 kilometres
across, each overlapping the next by about 30%. The US, for
example, will be covered by 18 satellites at any time.

The network will require special terminals, because Teledesic
will initially use a microwave band to provide digital
connections of between 16 kilobits per second (kbps) and 2
megabits per second (Mbps). Even by landline standards this is
high bandwidth, but it can go higher. Teledesic aims to provide a
'space gateway' for corporate and other users with a minimum
bandwidth equivalent to today's T-1 lines (1.54 Mbps), rising to
1.2 gigabits per second, says Connie Kantor, Teledesic's director
of finance and administration. This could simultaneously support
mixtures of voice, video, image and data. Each satellite will be
designed to support up to 100,000 16 kbps channels at a given
time. The channels can be aggregated in 16 kbps increments to
support higher data rates.

The proposed Teledesic infrastructure would use the asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) technology now widely implemented for
multimedia networking. Individual users with fixed or mobile
terminals will access the constellation directly; large, fixed
subscribers with heavy traffic will use landlines to access large
local uplink facilities.

Teledesic's business model, partners and funding are less clear
than Motorola's. According to Kantor, Teledesic will not sell or
directly support user terminals, hand-held or otherwise. It will
sell small Earth gateway terminals that feed a terrestrial signal
to the satellite network. The goal is not to market services
directly to subscribers, but to provide an open network which
local organisations, such as telephone companies, can offer to
their subscribers.

Teledesic is not due to start until 2001, so its managers are
relaxed about the development of its technology and business
model. Kantor says: 'I get a dozen calls a week offering
finance.' It is in talks with telecommunications suppliers across
the world.

                           FOUR OTHERS

Four other proposed networks have a lower profile than Iridium
and Teledesic, are less ambitious, but may have a more immediate
impact. These are proposed by Globalstar, Odyssey, Orbcomm, and
I-CO. Technically, they are more like Iridium than Teledesic.

Globalstar, devised by Loral Space Systems Inc, will use 56
satellites orbiting above Iridium at 1,400 kilometres. These will
use a simple radio transmission technique known as code division
multiple access (CDMA) to deliver low-cost, cellular-equivalent
global telephone services. CDMA allows several users to occupy
the same radio channels without interference. Each satellite can
handle 1,000 calls at a time.

Globalstar's operators expect to earn a large portion of their
initial revenues by providing essential telephone services in
remote areas and developing countries that have no
telecommunications infrastructure. They calculate that half the
world's population lives more than two hours away from a
telephone.

A significant part of Globalstar's plan is to develop free-
standing solar powered public telephone booths in remote places.
Initial services will include cellular-grade voice, fax, and
9600-baud data transport services. This will clearly not be
sufficient for more advanced data networking needs.

Of all the networks, the simplest service, and the one closest to
being operational, is Orbcomm. This is aimed at a gap in existing
markets. Developed by Orbital Sciences Corp of Dulles, Virginia,
and Teleglobe Inc of Montreal, it is a micro-satellite-based two-
way messaging system. The system is relatively inexpensive to
deploy because it uses Pegasus, a low-cost launch vehicle
developed by Orbital. This can be carried to a high altitude by a
conventional aircraft, then launched. It can place a 1,000 lb
payload into orbit for about $10 million.

The Orbcomm satellites are small, light and cheap. Each Pegasus
vehicle can carry eight into orbit at a time. That means three
launches will place a fully operational constellation of 24
satellites in space. Most populated portions of the Earth will be
in sight of one or two spacecraft. Orbital has eschewed
sophisticated microwave radio links in favour of VHF radio.
Within its 3,000 mile diameter footprint, six uplink channels
will carry digital data at 2,400 bits per second; a single 4,800
bits per second channel will handle downlink traffic.

The relatively low-rate bit streams will be used to carry short
packet messages to and from small, inexpensive mobile terminal
devices. These self-contained, hand-held units will have small
LCD screens, and keyboards for reading and writing messages. By
using inexpensive VHF radio technology and a low bit rate, the
cost of a terminal can be kept low. For machine-to-machine
communications, the terminals can be fitted with serial ports to
interface with computers. Orbcomm is behind schedule, but should
begin operating in mid 1996.

Fewer details are known about two other proposed satellite
networks. One of these is proposed by I-CO, a consortium
supported by several telecommunications companies and Inmarsat,
the UK-based organisation that supplies satellite-based
navigation and communication services to shipping. The I-CO
network aims to provide services to airlines and ships. This
network will be based on medium Earth orbit satellites, which
will slow response times but increase coverage and reduce costs.

Another network was recently announced by TRW in conjunction with
Teleglobe. Details are sketchy, but it will be an MEO system,
using 12 satellites. Because of delays, this will reduce its
appeal to voice subscribers. TRW, the US electronics giant, has
been awarded a $2.28 billion contract to build hand-held
terminals.

                       WILL THEY TAKE OFF?

On paper, each of the proposed networks is technologically
plausible. But politics come into play. Each of these latter-day
merchant adventurers sets out to transcend jealously guarded
national government prerogatives and controls. Details such as
the granting of licences to operate, the approval of equipment
and the allocation and administration of radio frequencies must
be ironed out. Delays are seen as inevitable.

The liberalisation of telecommunications operations is proceeding
at some pace in North America and parts of Western Europe, but
state monopolies still prevail in the greater portion of
territories that the 'LEOsat' operators say need their services.

Most of the consortia have tried to get the support of public
telephone companies, but these partnerships may prove fragile.

At the same time terrestrial telecommunications technology is
developing rapidly. Terrestrial radio systems that can bring
services to remote rural areas quickly and for a relatively low
one-time investment are available. And in the developed world,
developments in optical and broadband radio networks are ready to
be deployed widely, which could undermine Teledesic.

The companies and consortia involved say they have well-thought-
out commercial plans. It remains to be seen if these are
technically feasible. Next they must find customers, despite
improving and increasingly cheap terrestrial systems. Finally,
they must face the problems of regulation, political debate,
environmental arguments and inter-company disputes.

              DISARRAY IN THE DISK DRIVE BUSINESS

Demand for disk drives is growing rapidly but wafer thin margins
and fierce competition mean few suppliers are making money. The
operating pressures are leading to widespread consolidation and
restructuring.

In August this year, William Miller, chief executive of Quantum,
the worldwide unit leader in the hard disk drive industry, quit.
After three and a half years of the unrelenting pressure of
running a major disk drive company, he wanted out.

Two months later, he was followed by Robert Maeser, president and
general manager of Quantum's High Capacity Storage Group. For
Maeser, a 30-year stint in the industry which even other computer
executives view as 'excessively turbulent', had taken its toll on
his health.

But it is not only individuals that are dropping off the pace.
According to figures from Disk/Trend Inc, storage industry
analysts, at the beginning of the decade there were 57
manufacturers of rigid disk drives worldwide. Today, there are 24
and falling.

Even among the top tier suppliers, the pressures are immense.
During the past weeks, Seagate Technology, the number two
supplier, has announced the acquisition of Conner Peripherals,
and Maxtor, the number five supplier, has announced its takeover
by the Korean electronics group, Hyundai. All are re-evaluating
their business models in the pursuit of greater operating
efficiencies.

                         BOOMING DEMAND

Demand for disk drives has never been greater. According to
Disk/Trend, 87 million disk drives will ship this year, up from
70 million in 1994, an increase of 25%. Total shipments for 1996
will be over 100 million.

Driving that demand is the boom in the PC industry and
particularly in consumer PCs. "The single most important trend
[in the disk drive industry today] is the rapid growth of the
consumer PC market. Consumer systems are 40% of US PC sales and
today and 30% of worldwide sales but they are growing twice as
fast as the rest," says Marlin Miller, marketing director of
Quantum. Consumer sales are so important because home PC users
put heavy demands on storage. While the average corporate storage
entry point is 400 Mb (megabytes of storage per PC), says Claude
Barathon, president and managing director of Quantum Europe, the
average consumer entry point is 1 Gb (gigabyte). "Games and CD-
ROMS are incredibly storage intensive," he says.

But even in the corporate market, the storage opportunities are
immense. "There are 180 million PCs installed. Half of those are
386 processor-based machines or older and have less than 120 Mb
of storage. What a market," says Barathon. In addition, midrange
and high-end systems, such as IBM mainframes, are increasingly
using arrays of commodity disk drives, rather than specialist
high capacity drives.

Chuck Haggerty, CEO of Western Digital, is equally enthusiastic.
The desktop PC and mobile system market amounts to 81 million
drives today but will be up to 180 million by 1999, he says. "By
1999, we will ship two disk drives to every PC."

                       FINANCIAL PRESSURE

But few suppliers are managing to turn this escalating demand
into growing profit. The problem is that even though disk
capacities are being pushed up at rates of 60% per year as
manufacturers struggle to keep up with user demands, drive prices
are falling fast. The value of the worldwide disk industry in
terms of revenue rose by just over 10% to $25.7 billion in 1995,
according to Disk/Trend, but will fall to $25.3 billion in 1996.
"Over the past year and a half, the industry has seen a 50% price
decline, slicing 20% a quarter [off prices]," says Bob Patent, a
storage analyst with IDC and former operations manager for
Quantum.

This fall in profitability is a direct result of the collapse in
disk drive prices. As competition has intensified, margins on
single platter disk drive products have been declining year on
year and, according to some, are down to an unsustainable 10%
from the high-teens back in 1994.

The pursuit of capacity is pushing all suppliers towards the
delivery of 'multiplatter' drives. Few suppliers are still
investing in one-platter technology - most are concentrating on
two-platter and three-platter drives where the margins are closer
to 18% and 30% respectively. But even here, the overall trend is
downwards.

To add to supplier problems, the rate of technology change in the
disk drive industry, and hence the demands on research and
development, are increasing. "The world used to run on 18-month
technology cycles," says Patent. "We are still near that at the
high-end but in the massive desktop PC sector we are down to six
to nine months between upgrades. The PC vendors would like it to
be six months."

This shortening of product lifecycles has led to severe inventory
problems, with suppliers repeatedly getting caught with the wrong
capacity disk drives at the wrong time. The pressure to dump
obsolescent stock has contributed to the overall margin erosion.

Now, a fresh round of industry consolidation has many predicting
a levelling off period for the industry. "Over the last 10 to 15
years we have seen lots of high peaks and low valleys but," says
Haggerty, "market forces are stabilising. Five years ago there
were 13 to 14 players. Now there are four or five - that brings
stability."

Others are less optimistic. With the rate of technology change
increasing and prices still falling, "1996 will be a difficult
year," says Marlin Miller of Quantum. Success for the remaining
market contenders is far from guaranteed and further
consolidation looks likely.

                             SEAGATE

With 1995 revenues of $4.5 billion, Seagate is the number one
disk drive supplier in terms of revenue and the most profitable.
Its pending acquisition of the ailing Conner Peripherals for just
over $1 billion is set to completely alter the landscape of the
storage market, putting the company way out ahead with combined
revenues of over $7 billion and a 38% market share by units.
"Seagate is now the unchallenged market leader," says Patent.

Key to Seagate's future strategy is a move away from complete
dependence on disk drives, although the majority of revenues
($4.3 billion) are still derived from this sector. In 1993, Al
Schugart, founder of Seagate and an industry stalwart, hired
Steve Luczo, a high-flying investment banker, to spearhead
Seagate's diversification programme. Schugart's target was to add
$1 billion to revenues in new storage hardware, $1 billion in
components and $1 billion in software.

According to Luczo, initial discussions with Finis Conner,
founder of Conner and joint founder of Seagate with Schugart,
centred on Conner's software business but, says Luczo, "Over
three or four weeks conversations expanded to incorporate the
whole company. The more we talked about it, the more it fitted."

Conner was a company in desperate need of a lifeline. Despite
being the industry leader back in 1992, before a particularly
deep 'valley' period, by the beginning of 1995 Conner's market
share had been whittled down to 13% by volume. For the nine
months to October, Conner's net income, already low, fell from
$65.5 million to $36.4 million, despite a rise in revenues from
$1.77 billion to $1.94 billion.

"The company was resource constrained and had been losing money
for several quarters," says Jim Porter of Disk/Trend. "It [the
buyout] is a good deal for Conner shareholders. The opportunity
for growth at Conner had come to a halt. The executive management
has been a revolving door for the last two years."

The two companies appear well matched. Seagate has focused on the
high-performance enterprise end of the market while Conner
specialises in low cost drives and also brings a portfolio of
tape products. Seagate shipped eight to nine million disk drives
at the high-end last year, while Conner shipped 11 million on the
desktop. In components, Seagate is a major supplier of heads
while Conner is strong in media. Together, they have a strong
manufacturing base which will help both in the struggle to keep
up with product demand.

Competitors have been publicly supportive of the deal, saying it
will help to stabilise pricing across the industry. Conner has
been very aggressive on pricing over the last year, forcing other
vendors to cut prices accordingly. Under Seagate ownership,
prices are expected to float up, reducing the margin pressure on
all suppliers.

Haggerty of Western Digital also thinks that Seagate's 38% market
share will be quickly eroded as customers re-evaluate their
supplier relationships. "I believe the Seagate/Conner deal will
create an opportunity rather than a problem," says Haggerty.
"There are a lot of customers out there which do business with
either Seagate, Conner or both and a number of them have come to
us looking for an alternative supplier."

Luczo dismisses these arguments, saying the acquisition of Conner
will give Seagate unparalleled strengths. "Drives are getting
harder to make, so a strong financial base, broad product line
and ownership of technology and manufacturing processes is
increasingly important. We are the only company to have all
that."

But even with the advantage of size, Luczo doesn't expect market
conditions in the disk drive industry to get much easier. "With
OEM [supplying to manufacturers], you are not sitting next to
final demand so there is an inventory risk and, where there is an
inventory risk, there will always be tough pricing. Business
won't get easier."

He is confident, however, that Seagate will be able to continue
posting good results. "Our operating model shows good profit on a
20% to 22% margin and that is sustainable." For the first quarter
of 1996, Seagate announced record revenues up 55% to $1.45
billion, with net income up from $22.5 million to $108 million.

                             QUANTUM

The company most directly affected by the Seagate/Conner tie up
is Quantum, the clear leader in desktop PC drives. Quantum
shipped 16 million drives in 1994 and expects to ship a
staggering 20 million this year, but its financial performance
has been patchy. While revenues in its latest quarter were up
from $726 m to $1 billion, falling margins and problems at the
high-end, along with a $32 million 'faulty goods' rebate to an
unnamed PC maker, meant net income slipped from $48.6 million to
$22 million.

One of Quantum's weaknesses has been its dependence on the
fiercely competitive low-margin desktop drive business and, for
this reason, the company's focus over the past year and a half
has been to extend its business in the more lucrative high-end
sector. To this end, Quantum bought Digital Equipment's Avastor
storage business back in 1994 and has been working to integrate
it ever since. The pressure of doing so is believed to have been
one of the key factors behind the resignation of chief executive,
Bill Miller.

Miller's replacement, 37-year old Michael Brown, former head of
the desktop part of Quantum's business and an 11-year company
veteran, is clear about the importance of the high-end. "Although
maintaining our leadership position in the desktop market is
important, our future growth and success depends more on on our
ability to grow and strengthen other areas of our business," he
says.

Quantum now claims a 22% share of the high-end storage market, up
from 7% before the Avastor acquisition. But, according to
analysts, the impact on the bottom line has not yet been
positive. "Quantum had lots of problems with Avastor and is still
losing money on the disk side," says Porter. "It will be a year
before it is all straightened out."

In a bid to address the problem, Quantum has embarked on a
restructuring of its high-capacity business, including closing
the company's inherited manufacturing facility in Colorado
Springs. The vast majority of Quantum's manufacturing is carried
out by a third-party, the company's Japanese manufacturing
partner Matsushita-Kotobuki Electronics (MKE). Barathon claims
this gives Quantum greater flexibility and more efficiency than
can be achieved with an internal manufacturing set-up. "Disk
drive makers have always been dependent on merchant suppliers,"
he says.

Barathon believes the blip in Quantum's business performance will
be short-lived, blaming it on the product shortages affecting all
suppliers and a product transition back in May. The company's
goal going forward is to "get back to the number one spot". "We
are growing faster than the industry and prices are stabilising.
All the elements are in place," says Barathon.

Others believe the company has more hurdles to overcome.
Quantum's margins have gone from 18% to 13%, says Chris Brown,
director of distribution and retail channels at Maxtor.

But Marlin Miller of Quantum is confident that the company can
turn it around. "One of the key factors is to have a low expense
to sales ratio. Our desktop business operates at around 10%," he
says. With Michael Brown's continued focus on operating
efficiencies, says Porter, "They'll get it right in the end."

                               IBM

With Quantum struggling, the number two market spot behind
Seagate is potentially attainable and the man eager to fill the
gap is Dave Ernsberger, head of worldwide OEM sales for IBM's
storage systems division (SSD).

IBM only got into the OEM disk drive industry four years ago but
says it has already built up annual revenues of $2 billion,
growing at 50% a year, twice the pace of the rest of the
industry. "What other company could have done that?," says
Ernsberger. "Our technology is terrific. There is a huge demand
for our products. The only question is, how quickly can we
expand?"

IBM claims to have built four million drives in 1993, eight
million in 1994 and expects to do 10 to 11 million this year.
Next year, says Ernsberger, will see another significant jump.
"We started off doing $1 OEM business to $7 internal. Today, we
do $6 OEM for every $4 internal. Next year, 75% of output will go
to OEM customers."

However, some analysts suggest that the focus of Jim Vanderslice,
newly appointed head of SSD, is shifting away from the OEM
business. "Vanderslice is more interested in getting the
mainframe business back from EMC," said one, referring to IBM's
attempts to recover market share in high-end, integrated
mainframe disk systems. Ernsberger disagrees, "The OEM business
is not at all on a back burner. My aspiration is to be the number
one player".

To do that, however, IBM will need to pitch in to the fiercely
competitive desktop drive business. Today, IBM operates only in
the mobile and high-end markets, commanding a healthy share in
both. In the mobile sector, its 1995 market share is expected to
be close to 40%. "In the near-term, you will not see us at the
low capacity points on the desktop, it is not where our strengths
are. We do want to be big in that area but, today, rather than
try and compete across all segments, we have chosen to build at
the high-end sweet spot."

Despite the narrow focus of its products, Luczo rates IBM as
Seagate's "most important competitor". "They are vertically
integrated - the owners of technology. To date, we have been just
a little leaner and a little faster."

One problem for IBM is what Luczo of Seagate calls the "I won't
OEM from IBM" attitude from PC makers. But while he thinks it
will always be a factor, "If they are the only ones supplying
technology, people will buy it."

                         WESTERN DIGITAL

Four years ago, Western Digital was a company that many analysts
were predicting would go out of business. But, over the last two
years, it has grown revenues to $2.1 billion and has increased
its market share in the desktop segment from 12% to 22.5%. "From
1993 to 1995 we saw a significant turnaround. Of all the disk
drive companies out there, we now have the strongest balance
sheet," says Haggerty. Part of that, however, is due to the sale
of Western Digital's multimedia products unit to Philips.

Like Quantum, Western Digital is doing much to try and decrease
its dependence on the desktop disk drive segment. It is working
on a 2.5 inch disk for the mobile market and has snapped up a
number of ex-IBMers to develop a high-end product line with
drives of 2 Gb, 4 Gb and 8 Gb, a segment in which it believes it
can do well. "Some of the firmware of our competitors is very
aged. Ours is based on completely new code," says Haggerty.

But Western Digital is in a unique position. It is the only
company left in the industry that doesn't own its technology or
have an affiliation to a larger partner, a position which some
suggest is unsustainable. But Haggerty says the company is far
from vulnerable. "Our plan is to be the asset management leader.
We did $2.1 billion with 7,200 employees, Seagate did $4.6
billion with 65,000 employees. Over 70% of our disk drive
components are common which means we can turn assets very fast."
Certainly, Western Digital has garnered a reputation as a market
maker, being the first to ship at new capacity points.

Western Digital logged its highest ever quarter shipment in the
summer when it shipped 2.8 million drives and, like many others,
Haggerty believes the Seagate /Conner deal will create
opportunity for even bigger growth. He is also expecting a let-up
on margins. "The pricing pressure was created by Conner and
Maxtor so that will now stabilise," he says.

But despite his buoyant mood, Western Digital's recent results
were below expectation. The company reported revenues of $558
million, up from $464.5 million in 1994 but net income fell
markedly from $34.7 million to $8.3 million, a factor Haggerty
puts down to the slow take-off of its new 1.6 Gb drive and
"greater than anticipated competitive pricing".

Despite Haggerty's insistence, Western Digital may yet end up as
part of a larger concern. "There is room for the industry to
consolidate a little further, " says Brown of Maxtor. We could go
from five players to four and the only company without a
connection to a bigger one left is Western Digital." IBM, Quantum
and Samsung have all been rumoured as potential buyers.

                         MAXTOR/HYUNDAI

The most recent consolidation in the disk drive industry is that
of Maxtor and Hyundai. In November, Hyundai announced that it is
to buy the remaining 60% of Maxtor and turn it into a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Hyundai America.

According to Chris Brown of Maxtor, the effect on the management
and culture of the company will be negligible. "Hyundai took a
stake in the company in 1994 and has taken an active role since
then. The fact they now own 100% of the company wont be foreign
to us."

Maxtor is by far the weakest of the top tier storage players.
"The company has been losing money every quarter and would have
been out of business one and a half year's ago were it not for
Hyundai's cash injection of $150 million. The acquisition was
necessary to keep the company going," says Porter. Over the past
five years Maxtor has lost $326 million on sales of $5.5 billion.
In its most recent quarter, Maxtor announced a net loss of $44.5
million on revenues of $281 million.

Now, however, Maxtor is talking as though it is about to be
reborn. "Western Digital has had the best time to market and has
been the market maker but this quarter, we are shipping more 1.6
Gbs than they are," says Brown. "Next quarter we will be the
leader in 2 Gb drives." Importantly, the company has also just
won a new OEM contract to supply Hewlett-Packard with drives.

But Hyundai's aspirations for Maxtor are much greater. In a
statement, Hyundai said, "We have a plan to become the world's
second biggest hard disk drive producer by the year 2000 and the
largest by the year 2005." The company plans to invest up to $1
billion in Maxtor over the next few years in order to grow sales
to $5 billion by the year 2000.

It is a sizeable goal and some industry observers are worried
that Hyundai will adopt tactical pricing strategies to try and
steal market share in the short-term. Haggerty disagrees.
"Hyundai will not tolerate loss of money for a sustained period.
They will execute changes to stabilise pricing" he says.

Luczo says attempts to buy market share would be pointless. "You
can't buy market share in this industry, it is too expensive. Or
if you do take losses to buy market share, you only get it for a
couple of years. You win market share in the long-term by having
the best products."

Hyundai has a reasonable chance of turning the company around,
says Porter, "but they need to equip the company with an up to
date product line to do so."

                            OUTSIDERS

"The ongoing consolidation of the disk drive industry is going to
make it increasingly hard for new players to come in," says
Miller of Quantum. But many of the Eastern electronics
conglomerates have other ideas. Companies such as Toshiba,
Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC are all active in the market and all are
keen to extend their market share. But only Fujitsu is trying,
once again, to take on the US disk drive suppliers head on.

"The Japanese players pulled out of the OEM disk drive industry
three to four years ago because they didn't want to play down at
the 40 Mb range," says Adam Harris, director and general manager
of Fujitsu Europe. As are result, companies headquartered in the
US now control 85% of the OEM disk drive revenues.

Now, following a $100 million investment in magneto-resistive
head technology and 16 months of concerted effort getting its
technology and manufacturing right, Fujitsu says it is ready to
get back into the mainstream with products aimed at both the
desktop and the high-end. The company has production facilities
in Japan, Thailand and, next year, a factory is planned for the
Philippines.

Despite all this, even Harris is aware that Fujitsu will struggle
to make it as a top tier supplier. "Sure, we are not going to
have 20% of the market next year but we plan to be producing 1
million drives a month by the end of 1996 and 1.6 million by June
97." Harris says Fujitsu is currently in 10th position with a 3
to 4% share and is already taking business from Quantum and
Seagate.

While Fujitsu looks unlikely to seriously trouble the disk drive
industry leaders for many years, if ever, the Korean electronics
group Samsung has joined with its compatriot Hyundai in making
some bold statements about its chances in the market. It has said
that it wants to be in the top five OEM disk drive companies by
the end of the decade.

Samsung has set about its task by ramping up a research and
development facility in San Jose and it is now shipping around
two to three million disk drives a year. But realistically, say
analysts, Samsung's only chance of gaining a secure foothold in
the disk drive industry would be to team up with a US company.
Despite rumours that Samsung was in the bidding for Conner before
Seagate stepped in, and that it has also showed an interest in
Western Digital, the most likely target, say pundits, is the
California-based Micropolis.

As the Hyundai/Maxtor deal demonstrates, the preferred strategy
of Korean industrialists is to buy companies cheap when they are
weak and invest heavily to bring them back to health. Micropolis,
which has just announced third quarter net losses of $17.5
million on turnover down 26% at $58.8 million, is certainly weak.
It is also exploring alternatives for separating the operation
and management of its drive and value-added systems businesses, a
move which, analysts say, could suggest that it is ready to sell.

It is doubtful,however, that the combined force of Micropolis and
Samsung could actually have much of an impact on the top tier
disk drive suppliers, but Luczo of Seagate will not write the
Koreans off.

"The Koreans will be tough competitors," says Luczo. "If you
think back to the DRAM (memory chip) days, lots of people said
'no way'. Here we are, ten years later, and they are the dominant
suppliers. My guess is the Korean competitors will be significant
- Hyundai for sure and Samsung maybe.

                         CLOSING WINDOW?

But there may not be much of a long-term. Many vendors and
analysts believe the life of magnetic disk drive technology is
already into the twilight years. By the year 2000, they say, new
types of technology will start to emerge as magnetic disks reach
their physical limits.

"The life of magnetic disk drive technologies only has another 15
years," says IBM's Ernsberger. Like many others, IBM is already
working on a number of successor technologies, including
holographic storage.

Until then, day-to-day life in the disk drive industry is likely
to remain a roller-coaster ride, only for those with a strong
constitution. "We will definitely keep seeing those peaks and
troughs," says Porter of Disk/Trend. But the heavy financial and
technology players will certainly find it easier to flatten some
of the bumps.

            SUN SETS OUT TO BURN WORKSTATION RIVALS

Sun put on a good show to launch UltraSparc. But should the
technology behind the aggressive marketing message alarm its
workstation rivals?

When Sun Microsystems launched its new UltraSparc workstations
last month, it did so with all the razzmatazz of a Hollywood
spectacular. While thousands looked on via satellite link-ups,
hundreds of influential guests from around the world crammed into
the "Ultradome" big-top tent in the grounds of Sun's Menlo Park
facility in California. They were treated to fireworks, films,
live music, dry ice and "shoot-outs" between Sun's new systems
and rivals from Hewlett-Packard (HP), Digital Equipment and
Silicon Graphics.

Sun's desire to put on a show was understandable. In the $18
billion a year Unix workstation business, new product
announcements, usually featuring a significant advance in
computing power, are almost weekly events. But Sun needed the
UltraSparc message to stand out: Sun executives can now openly
confess that for several years its technology has been gradually
slipping behind rivals. But now, they say, the new UltraSparc
models, based on Sun's "revolutionary" 64-bit processor design,
are not just an incremental improvement over previous models and
those of rivals, but a major and ground-breaking advance that
will have a significant impact on the Unix server and workstation
market.

Apart from increasing the raw processing power of its systems,
Sun has introduced what it says are two groundbreaking
technologies: new on-chip graphics capabilities, which reduce the
cost of computer manufacturing and increase graphics processing
power; and Ultra Port Architecture (UPA), a cross-bar switching
method, adapted from supercomputer design, which increases the
internal bandwidth of a computer. This is important because it
cuts down latency - the time that components spend waiting for
instructions.

"This is truly a great day for Sun. This announcement is more
than about hot-boxes or leapfrogging ... this is a new paradigm,"
said Ed Zander, president of Sun Microsystems Computer Company
(SMCC).

Bill Joy, one of Sun's co-founders, concurred: "This is the
biggest announcement since the first Sparc [processor] five years
ago, and possibly even since the founding of Sun 15 years ago."
The technology, they add, will initially benefit all those
companies, such as HAL, ICL, Cray and Amdahl, that build systems
around Sparc processors.

Sun's executives were naturally circumspect about what the
UltraSparc processors and workstations might do for the company's
already impressive financial results and share price. But Sun
clearly expects to recapture some of the workstation market share
it has lost in recent years. Last year, according to market
analyst company Dataquest, Sun's share of the Unix workstation
business fell by 2% to 36%.

Sun now says it will inflict serious damage on its workstation
rivals. Zander said users of Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics
and IBM workstations will now consider switching to Sun machines.
And marketing director Anil Gadre claimed that Sun's improved
high-end graphics and floating point performance will take Sun
into the visualisation, high-end mechanical computer aided design
and "infotainment" markets for the first time.

Sun's claims were endorsed by more than 50 application vendors,
pages of testimonials from customers who had taken part in its
beta-testing programme and a glowing appraisal of its prospects
in Business Week magazine.

                            UPHEAVAL?

All of this points to a major upheaval in the workstation market
and problems ahead for rivals such as Silicon Graphics, Digital
and Hewlett-Packard. Moreover, Sun hopes that it has finally put
an end to analyst speculation that the Sparc processor family
will not ultimately survive the high-volume assault from rival
processor manufacturers such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard
(working together on a new design), and IBM and Motorola
(PowerPC).

Certainly, financial analysts like what they are hearing. Buoyed
by recent results (first quarter revenues up 17% to $1.49
billion, net income up from $38 million to $85 million), the
delivery of the UltraSparc technology and Sun's invention of the
Java programming language, which could become an Internet
standard, Sun's share price has doubled since July.

But is all the optimism for Sun justified? Assessing the claims
of rival processor and workstation suppliers, even with the aid
of sophisticated benchmarks, is always difficult. While some
analysts believe Sun has made some major technical advances,
others - especially its rivals - believe that Sun's achievement
is one of having successfully caught-up, rather than having
initiated a revolution. As one executive at Hewlett-Packard puts
it: "Sun's technology is good, but it is nothing like as good as
its public relations."

                      TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT

If Sun is merely playing catch-up with its technology, it would
still be important for the company and its major customers. A
year ago, analysts such as the Forrester Group were predicting
that, of the major processor families, the Sparc was the least
likely to survive.

But Sun is claiming that it has taken a leadership position in
three core areas: raw power; on-chip graphics; and UPA. If there
is to be a real change in the workstation market, it will be
because Sun's advances in this area are substantial and not just
incremental.

Unfortunately, the impact of the innovations is difficult to
assess. In terms of power, the 32-bit SuperSparc processor, which
Sun has been using for the past two years, clearly lagged behind
rival designs from Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics and Digital.
The new UltraSparc processors and workstations are, according to
the Specmark benchmark figures provided by Sun, marginally ahead
of rivals, are cheaper, and will be superseded next year by
faster models. And in the "shoot-outs" demonstrated by Sun, the
UltraSparc system outperformed rivals dramatically.

But Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics and Digital are crying
foul: they say that Sun is comparing its systems with older or
non-equivalent models from rivals; that Sun is using out-of-date
Spec92 benchmarks, rather than the Spec95 benchmarks introduced
this summer (Sun says the Spec95 benchmarks are not ready yet);
and, in any case, some of Sun's new models will not be available
until next year, by which time HP and Silicon Graphics will have
announced their new PA8000 and R10000 processors (respectively).

Even so, there is some grudging recognition that Sun is back in
the technology race. "I concede they are good products. But what
they have done is caught-up," says John Saw, a technology
marketing manager with Hewlett-Packard. And Andrew Cresci, a
marketing director with Silicon Graphics, says: "They are good
but not good enough."

What of Sun's other advances? A crucial part of its announcement
is the on-chip graphics - known as visual instruction set (VIS) -
which "greatly improves 2D and 3D graphics, image processing,
video handling and animation". According to Mark Tremblay,
computer architect for Sparc Technology Business, it is both
cheaper and more efficient to put the graphics processing into
the main processor. He says that performance for graphics
applications can be boosted dramatically - and disproportionately
to the Specmark rating of the system: "We see more and more
graphics going onto the CPU." Other chip makers will follow Sun's
lead, he says.

Although other processor makers such as Intel (with NSP) and
IBM/Motorola (on the PowerPC) are moving in this direction, the
industry leader in graphics - Silicon Graphics - is not
impressed. "In general, if you want to increase performance, you
do the graphics separately. If you want to reduce the cost, you
put it on the chip," says Cresci of Silicon Graphics. His
argument is that Sun's innovation has been well understood for
many years but that the leaders in graphics processing have
forsaken the cost advantages of on-chip graphics because of
performance trade-offs.

Jack Gold, an analyst with the Meta Group, agrees: "It's not the
same as having an accelerator card. I still think Silicon
Graphics will take the top spot at the high-end." But Sun claims
dramatic improvements in the price and performance of graphics
applications and analysts expect it to have some impact on
Silicon Graphics at the lower end of its product ranges.

Sun's third major innovation - UPA - falls more squarely in line
with developments in modern computer design. Most designers now
recognise that increasing the internal bandwidth of a system is
probably more important than raw processing power. Sun's
switching technology means that one bus, such as Intel's M-Bus,
is replaced by several.

An important advantage of the UPA is that several processors can
be linked far more effectively - making it easier to reap
performance advantages from multiprocessor systems. For this
reason, powerful new Sun servers, aimed at commercial
applications, can be expected next year.

Although rivals have expressed doubts about UPA - Silicon
Graphics in particular claims its multiple bus design is more
efficient - it seems likely that Sun's approach will be widely
followed, especially as it can lead to substantially improved
input/output and network performance.

                             VERDICT

Two years ago, Sun Microsystems was widely perceived to be in
long-term decline, especially because it had fallen behind on
core chip technology (CBR, October 1994). In fact, chief
executive Scott McNealy says people have always been negative on
the company. "It has been 13 years of people thinking we're
toast," he said recently.

In this context, Sun has made a dramatic recovery. "There has
been a good deal of speculation that Sparc is dead. Sun has
finally said, 'Yes, we'll be there at the 64-bit level'," says
Gold of the Meta Group.

Market analysts at IDC also believe Sun has regained credibility.
"The new Ultra workstations put Sun back in the high performance
game ... Sun is well positioned to maintain its number one place
for the next several years," says analyst Tom Copeland.

Few question that Sun should now maintain its leadership and that
the stated goal of HP's general manager Bernard Guidon, to
overtake Sun in workstation sales next year, now looks far harder
to achieve. But Sun's wider claims - that it has redrawn the map
of Unix computing - are more suspect. By the middle of next year,
all the leading processor/workstation suppliers, with the
exception of IBM, will have leapfrogged Sun in pure processing
power at least once. Although Sun may regain the lead again, it
will not necessarily hold it.

Gold of Meta says Sun's announcement has not completely killed
off long-term doubts over the future of Sparc, because its
volumes will always be smaller than those of the Intel/HP and the
IBM/Motorola combinations. But, he says, it will "give people a
nice, cosy feeling and keep them interested in the platform."

Sparc still accounts for 36% of the Unix workstation market, a
market share which Sun held in spite of a long period when it
lagged behind rivals in performance. While this is unlikely to
dramatically change in the short term, suppliers that do not
compete effectively with Sun's aggressive pricing and its
performance improvement are likely to fall behind. IBM, which has
no 64-bit processor, may be a more obvious victim than Silicon
Graphics.

Sun's high share price today probably owes more to its
positioning as the number one supplier of Internet systems, and
its emerging Java language, than the competitiveness of its
hardware. But the real significance of Sun's UltraSparc
technology may not be seen until late next year, when, alongside
its workstations, it starts pushing powerful new commercial
machines. In workstations, Sun is defending its lead; in
commercial systems, it has everything to gain.

                       REQUIRED READING

CBR casts a critical eye over the latest books on information
technology.

                       INSIDE THE TORNADO

For the past four years, Geoffrey Moore has been the unseen hand
guiding the strategies of many major computer companies.
Executives don't often like to boast that they are drawing
heavily on his consultancy or on his 1991 bestseller, Crossing
the Chasm, as they plot their companies' courses. But the leaders
at Sybase, PeopleSoft, Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), Unisys, Sun,
Lawson Software, Tektronix, Bay Networks, Tivoli, Cincom and
Documentum, and the two hundred others Moore has worked with,
have all incorporated his IT industry models into their thinking.

In Crossing the Chasm, Moore distilled the essence of why some IT
start-ups develop into major suppliers and others - many, many
more - crash and burn before they even have a shot at the
mainstream market. Putting the classic technology adoption
lifecycle bell shaped curve under the microscope, Moore noted
that there are distinct waves of purchasing in a technology
market: buying starts with 'innovators' who will try any
technology that gives them an edge, then the technology is picked
up by 'early adopters'. This is followed by a phase of early then
late mass market take-up that represents the hump of the bell
before conservative 'laggards' come round to buying and the cycle
tails off.

That picture fell short in its sophistication, in Moore's
opinion, because it implied a continuous progression. His
experience indicates that there are, in fact, distinct gaps
between the various stages of the technology lifecycle that
vendors have got to leap if they are to successfully ride the
technology curve.

Most importantly, the gap between early adoption and the early
mass market is so large that it warrants being seen as a 'chasm'.
Into that pit have dropped many promising technologies - CASE
(computer aided software engineering), artificial intelligence,
and pen-based computing, for example. Explaining the forces that
push some companies into the abyss and propel others on to the
mass market is what his first book was all about.

Influential as Chasm was, the analysis stopped at the far side,
leaving a yearning for a more complete picture of the market
beyond. What dynamics do companies encounter once they have
crossed the chasm? How do they cultivate and exploit a mass
market for their products? And how should their strategies and
structures change as their products climb up one side of the
lifecycle curve and slide down the other?

With the publication in October of Inside the Tornado - Marketing
Strategies from Silicon Valley's Cutting Edge, Moore completes
all the pieces of the picture, focusing on the mainstream market
stages "where all high-tech wealth is created".

Three phases of a technology's life exist in the mainstream: the
building up of market momentum, the 'Bowling Alley' in Moore
terminology; a hypergrowth phase, the 'Tornado'; and finally, a
phase of consolidation, Main Street, when the market shakes out
and the remaining players reap all the benefits of a strong,
stable market.

One of the most interesting sections in the book deals with the
build up to the Tornado. Moore is adamant that, in order for
companies to attain the momentum of sales that precedes the
Tornado, they have to adopt a Bowling Alley approach. Flying in
the face of many vendors' desire to scatter bomb the whole
market, Moore insists that the approach that is most likely to
lead to a product entering the Tornado involves companies
embracing a niche market focus in advance of the general
marketplace. Getting into vertical industry sectors, where their
products satisfy a compelling customer need, is a crucial build
up to Tornado sales, he believes. As one niche topples like a
skittle, its momentum makes knocking over adjacent ones easier.

That may all sound dry and theoretical. But each of Moore's
points, each high-level idea, is backed by multiple examples of
companies which have got it right and others that have faltered.

One illustration: PeopleSoft, the client/server business software
company, entered the market initially by attacking the wide-open
niche of human resources. The management team knew that the big
spend on client/server packages would come not from HR but from
more mainstream business applications like financial management
and manufacturing, but they saw that it would take time for the
market to feel comfortable entrusting such 'mission-critical'
systems to the new paradigm of client/server. An HR application,
on the other hand, represented a much less risky starting point
for customers. PeopleSoft staked out its turf in HR in the early
1990s and has been growing at 80%-150% ever since. True to
Moore's model, the company is now using that base as a
springboard to launch into financials and manufacturing
applications. Despite the formidable competition in client/server
applications from larger vendors such as SAP and Oracle,
Peoplesoft is strongly established in the market and well-poised
to go forward.

Applying the same Bowling Alley approach, Lotus did not initially
offer its Notes groupware software package to the broad
marketplace. Rather, it targetted niche markets - first
positioning the product as a global account management tool for
Big Six management consultancies, then as a customer services
aid, before eventually taking the product horizontal. The Notes
success story "is all traceable back to the cascade of niche
markets developing one on top of another," says Moore.

That process, certainly in Lotus' case with Notes, leads to the
Tornado. This is when a product switches from niche acceptance to
wide market take-up, as the mass of pragmatists follows the early
adopters. German software vendor SAP has been in that phase for
the past 18 months; inkjet printer makers had their Tornado in
1991 to 1993. But the rush of growth can sometimes de-stabilise a
company. Oracle in 1991 came close to bankruptcy, even though its
revenues had grown by 100% a year for over five years.

For companies that survive that period in the Tornado, there is
Main Street - a period when the sales of a given product reach
their peak, the shape of market settles down, a market leader is
clearly established and huge profits are made.

But these are just the dynamics: what Moore's book is all about
is how to survive and prosper in each phase. His thesis is that
the forces, the management style, the sales model all have to
change as companies enter the different stages of the market's
evolution. The forces that operate in the Bowling Alley argue for
a niche-based strategy that is highly customer-centric; those in
the Tornado push in the opposite direction towards a mass-market
strategy; then on Main Street market forces push back again
toward a customer-centric approach.

"The winning strategy does not just change as we move from stage
to stage of the lifecycle," says Moore, "it actually reverses the
prior strategy. The very behaviours that make a company
successful at the outset of the mainstream market cause failure
inside the Tornado and must be abandoned. And, similarly, what
makes companies successful in the Tornado cause failure and must
be abandoned once that phase of hypergrowth is past."

Notwithstanding its unmatched insightfulness, Moore's book is not
without its flaws. Its layers of mixed metaphor can be tedious,
and at times childish. Aside from the lifecycle categories of
Chasm, Tornado and Main Street, the book characterises competing
companies in a sector as gorillas, chimps and monkeys, while
illustrating their positions in the market as imperialists and
natives, explorers or 49ers, barbarians or citizens.

Four years on from its publication, Chasm continues to double its
sales every six months, with 3,000 new copies selling each week.
Tornado is a better book - more clearly written and more
comprehensively illustrated with real world examples. Tornado's
title is certainly a little crass, and for many shelf browsers it
may be taken for yet another vapid management pep talk. But, even
so, this is an important book which is likely to be in and out of
the desk drawer of technology company managers for the next half
decade.

                           THE HP WAY

Last month, Hewlett-Packard moved comfortably into third position
in the world systems vendor top 50. At current growth rates it
should overtake Fujitsu within two years and be chasing IBM for
the number one position around the turn of the decade.

Here is a company that has the midas touch in many of its chosen
markets - most notably in Unix servers and printers - and whose
growth is more akin to that of start-up. During fiscal 1995, HP
added $6 billion in product sales, bringing revenues to $31.5
billion.

This success is no accident. HP was the first mainstream systems
vendor to wholeheartedly embrace RISC and open systems, without
killing sales of its proprietary midrange server platform. It
built the laser and inkjet printer markets virtually
singlehandedly and, through clever production and price
management, has turned printers into its primary engine of
profitability. In doing so, it became one of the few American
companies to take on, and beat, the Japanese in a commodity
technology market.

Yet, while two or three books a year are published about IBM,
Microsoft, and Apple, and there is at least one text each
detailing the life and times of Wang, Data General, and Sun,
there is remarkably little inside information on life at HP. The
garage in Palo Alto, CA where the company was founded back in
1938, has been designated a California Historical Landmark and
labelled 'the birthplace of Silicon Valley', yet the day-to-day
events, characters, chance meetings and carefully manoeuvred
strategies that helped Bill Hewlett and David Packard build HP
are largely uncharted. Unfortunately, the memoirs of David
Packard, do little to change that.

The HP Way, rather than giving a detailed insight into the
momentous events that turned a small test and measurement
instrument company into a computing giant, reads like a gushing a
fairy tale. A young, fit, talented Stanford scholar, David
Packard, in love with technology and nature, meets a like-minded
spirit in the shape of Bill Hewlett. Encouraged by a benevolent
professor, the happy twosome unite to create a new technology
company with the goal to "make an important technical
contribution to the advancement of science, industry and human
welfare". Through hard work and endeavour, coupled with enduring
respect for employees and business partners, the company grows to
be one of the most successful in North America.

The end result is a worthy corporate bible for HP employees and
perfect inspirational reading for budding high school
entrepreneurs. But those who might hope to finally get an insight
into what makes HP tick will find Packard's book a disappointing
and frustrating read.

Many key events in HP history are only mentioned in passing and
the book offers tantalising facts without any discussion or
explanation. For example, Packard notes how, in the 1960s, HP
entered negotiations to buy Digital Equipment for around $25
million, but decided against it. There is no further explanation
and no comment on why the deal was rejected. Neither does Packard
discuss the repercussions of Steve Wozniak leaving HP after
Wozniak's blueprint for a personal computer was rejected. With
Steve Jobs, that blueprint built Apple Computer.

What Packard does major on is his philosophy of workforce
management. There is a detailed discussion of 'the HP Way', a
seven point mission statement drawn up by Hewlett and Packard
covering all aspects of company operation from profit and
customers to employees and citizenship. Packard explains why
policies such as 'management by walking around' and 'management
by objective - the antithesis of management by control' evolved
and how they are executed. "Success depends in large part on
giving responsibility to the level where it can be exercised
effectively, usually on the lowest possible level of the
organisation, the level nearest to the customer. Each person in
our company is important and every job is important."

What also comes across is the clear attempt to stifle management
egos, a factor that has certainly contributed to a corporate
personality marked by its humility and low profile. In a typical
anecdote, Packard recounts how he travelled with his financial
entourage to a meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on the day
of HP's initial public offering. Despite the momentous occasion,
Packard and his colleagues took the subway from their hotel,
ending up late for the stock launch due to a missed train
connection. "It never occurred to me to take a taxi," he says
proudly.

For sure, these company codes have been instrumental in shaping
HP's success. But where is the discussion of the brilliant
product breakthroughs and of the key management decisions and
figures that propelled the company into market leadership
positions?

This book is less of a company history and more an investigation
of the moral and social beliefs of Packard. While there are many
corporate guidelines in The HP Way that managers today may wish
to emulate, others are now thoroughly outmoded and simplistic.
Packard concludes by saying, "Everywhere I look I see potential
for growth, for discovery far greater than anything we have seen
in the twentieth century." This book does not really throw any
light on how the HP corporate machine will work to exploit those
opportunities.

                   I SING THE BODY ELECTRONIC

When Tracy Kidder's The Soul of the New Machine appeared in 1982,
it established a blueprint for a certain type of technology book.
A writer, usually a journalist and almost always non-technical,
would spend a year or so in the company of a team of people who
were developing a technology product. The books are the written
equivalent of a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary, recording the
trials, emotions and turmoil of a group of people working against
time to develop an innovative product.

Kidder's was a Pulitzer prize winning account of the epic effort
to design and build Data General's first 32-bit computer. In I
Sing the Body Electronic - A Year with Microsoft on the
Multimedia Frontier, Fred Moody comes close to Kidder's
achievement. While Moody does not aspire to the almost poetic
style of Kidder's original, his book is a rigorously honest and
fascinating account of a year in the life of a Microsoft
development team.

Moody had almost unchallenged access to the team that worked on
Microsoft's Explorapedia, and he faithfully chronicles the
thoughts, emotions, struggles and doubts that guided the
development of the juvenile follow-up to the hugely successful
Encarta.

On his journey, Moody throws some fascinating insights into life
within Microsoft and the hopes, fears and doubts of the company's
employees and its founder and chief executive, Bill Gates.

It is to Microsoft's credit that Moody was given open access to
the team and the surrounding management, including Gates. But the
result is no PR exercise.

True to the portraits in other books of software builders, the
mainly young Explorapedia team work extremely hard - sleeping
under their desks, living off pizza, eschewing normal social
contact.

But the real insight begins with Moody's discovery that with 20
years experience writing about Microsoft - he works for Seattle
Weekly - and some 15 years covering the software industry, he is
a Gulliver among the Lilliputians. The people he mixes with may
know how to design and build software, but they don't know how to
manage people or a project. They have no idea how to hold a
meeting that achieves anything, they know little about life,
their interpersonal skills are non-existent, their observations
are frequently selfish and childish and they live in awe of that
great God, Bill.

Moody's take on all of this confirms some of Douglas Coupland's
fictional observations in Microserfs.

In his 1995 novel, Coupland raked over the soul of Microsoft and
found a bleak, cold heart. While Coupland has been more defensive
in recent interviews - pointing out that the average Microsoft
employee has a much better than average chance of becoming a
millionaire - the picture he created was of a corporation that
would be an unpalatable workplace for anyone with a personal
life.

While Microserfs is not as satisfying as the real thing portrayed
in I Sing the Body Electronic - in this case truth is stranger,
or at least more interesting, than fiction - Coupland has the
better cover title (Moody, inexplicably, derives his title from
the 1971 album 'I Sing the Body Electric' by the jazz group
Weather Report). These Microsoft programmers are truly serfs.
They may become very rich serfs, but they are serfs nonetheless,
serving an all powerful Lord as feudal in his people management
and distribution of largesse as any from the Middle Ages.

The prospect of serfdom still attracts 150,000 resumes a year from
keen young students and graduates. Given Microsoft's reputation
and commercial success this is understandable, but the appalling
treatment meted out to those 'lucky' enough to be granted an
interview gives pause for thought.

When the unsympathetic chief programmer on Explorapedia, Kevin
Gammill, takes relish in intimidating and humiliating would-be
programmers, the book hits a genuinely sombre note.

Given the pool of enthusiastic applicants, it is surprising to
learn that much of the development work is, in fact, carried out
by on-site contractors, who do not see anything of the Microsoft
share options, health benefits, free soda or even the possibility
of a plastic 'Ship It' award. The contractors usually join
Microsoft in the hope of getting offered a full-time job at the
end, despite the existence of an edict that bars them from being
recruited as permanent staff. As Gates puts it: "Where's the
added value?"

While Moody provides a fascinating insight into life on the
Microsoft campus, he also exposes some of the deepest worries of
the top management. Gates knows that the multimedia market is
going to be very large and that Microsoft should be heavily
involved. The problem for Gates is that while his company has the
expertise to build the delivery vehicle for multimedia, it does
not (yet) have the catalogue of material, the 'content', required
to ensure that Microsoft will be a major player. The book shows
Gates as paranoid about Microsoft's lack of 'content'.

The original material for Explorapedia came from Dorling-
Kindersley, the London-based publisher, famous for its
sumptuously illustrated children's books and travel guides. Gates
is portrayed as worrying that, through their involvement with
Microsoft, Dorling-Kindersley will learn how to produce
multimedia products and then deliver their own titles based on an
extensive back catalogue. He was right to worry, because Dorling-
Kindersley have since done exactly that.

The book gives the impression that Gates is kept awake at night
by the thought that the megamedia content owners, such as Time-
Warner, Sony, Disney and News Corporation, will make a fortune at
his company's expense. After all, while many companies can learn
how to develop multimedia software platforms, the copyrighted
material that actually sells multimedia products is may not
necessarily be available to Gates at any price.

          EMULATION WINDOW IS STILL AJAR FOR INSIGNIA

Initial public offering succeeds, but how long before the
company's core business fizzles out?

As suppliers, investors and analysts scour the globe for hot new
technologies and companies, the niche business of software
'emulation' tools is unlikely to attract much attention. Yet
emulation is the business of Insignia Solutions, the British
company headquartered in Mountain View, California. In spite of
pessimism about its niche, and a fall in technology stocks, last
month Insignia successfully placed its first public offering of
shares on Nasdaq. The issue raised $42 million in the form of
American Depository Receipts, about $16 million of which is
available to the company.

Insignia, now ten years old, is well known in the Unix and PC
markets, partly because its emulation tools have at times assumed
great significance in the battle between the key operating system
environments. Insignia's main product, SoftWindows, enables users
to run Microsoft Windows applications on Unix and Apple Macintosh
computers. This appeals to users that mix Macs or Unix machines
with swathes of PCs, but want them all to run particular Windows-
based 'personal productivity' software such as Microsoft Office.

Perhaps more importantly, the availability of SoftWindows has
enabled suppliers such as Apple to boast that their computers
will run Windows applications. Until recently, this was so
crucial to Apple that it bundled SoftWindows with its
PowerMacintosh computers. Unix workstation vendors such as IBM
and Digital Equipment also resell SoftWindows.

But Apple's decision in March 1995 to cease bundling SoftWindows
may indicate how tight a niche the Windows emulation market is
becoming. Apple's decision was partly strategic - it did not want
to endorse Windows - and partly because it saw little demand.
Products such as Microsoft Office come in nearly identical
versions for both platforms.

More worrying for Insignia, as the PC and Windows standard
becomes increasingly dominant and as the market for hardware-
based PC emulators for the Macintosh matures, the role of
software emulators may be further marginalised. If Microsoft's NT
operating system - which includes 16-bit Windows emulation -
continues to break ground in the server and workstation market,
there may be even less demand. Analysts say the emulation market
will grow only slightly over the next few years.

                        BEYOND EMULATION

Insignia executives are aware of the difficulties they could face
- although they say the end of the emulation market is many years
away. Brian Fawkes, Insignia's vice president of marketing,
hinted at acquisitions and new development projects, admitting
that one reason for the public offering was to raise money to
'look at other technologies and compliment what we are doing
today'.

But this does not mean the emulation business will be run as a
'cash cow'. Operating system emulation will be a "function that
we will always be following," says Fawkes. SoftWindows, he adds,
will be developed as a "very different product in three years,
able to support whatever products are out there". This could
involve adding value to the Intel processor instruction set
emulation which is likely to be built into RISC processors.

The emulation niche is not necessarily as small or as static as
some think. David Sidwell, Insignia's vice president of European
sales and support, agrees that Insignia is operating in a niche,
but insists it is a good one. He says the expected homogenising
of the desktop has not happened. The continued strength of the
Macintosh has meant solid but unspectacular revenues from
Insignia's Mac product, which makes up 60% of its sales and is
considered to have no competition.

Fawkes points to several new products to show its growing
diversity. One is NTrigue, developed with Network Computing
Devices, which will give users access to Windows NT-based
programs from their Unix X-terminals and low-end Macs and PCs
from early next year. A new version of SoftWindows for Unix that
provides full 486 emulation is due any moment.

The Unix market still has potential. Unix workstations are
selling in huge numbers, and SoftWindows, developed with the
approval of Microsoft, supports more applications than rival tool
Wabi from SunSoft. "Corporate buyers are looking at our Unix
product and many are looking at standardising on NT in the
future, which will make our NTrigue product very successful,"
Fawkes says.

Insignia's recent revenue history has been impressive, but not as
dramatic as some other young software companies. Revenues of $7.8
million in 1991 grew to $39.4 million in 1994 with profits of
$4.8 million. In the first nine months of 1995, Insignia
generated revenues of $41 million with profits of $4.6 million.
Setting aside a loss of $6 million in 1993, the year it worked on
its PowerMac version of SoftWindows, its performance has been
consistent, a sign that the well-connected company is also well
managed.

But how long before the emulation market slows or fizzles out?
Deborah Hess, senior analyst at Datapro in the US, says the
market will see steady but undramatic growth for a few years.
"This market has a definite two to three years. Beyond that it is
uncertain."

To secure a long-term future, Insignia must put the money raised
by the IPO to good use. Armed with $20 million and strong sales,
it is likely to make at least one acquisition - perhaps several -
and to intensify investment in research and development. Its
product and corporate announcements over the next two years will
provide more of an indicator.

            COMPANY SNAPSHOT: INSIGNIA SOLUTIONS PLC

Founded: Incorporated in the UK in 1985.
Ownership/financing: Owned by six venture capital firms plus
individuals and directors. Their shareholdings stand at about 48
per cent following the recent public offering.
Headquarters: Mountain View, California (since 1993).
Revenues: $41 million for the first nine months of 1995; $39.4
million in 1994.
Main products: Windows emulation software for Apple Macintosh
desktops and Unix workstations.
Competitors: PC emulator cards for the Apple Mac (from several
suppliers); SunSoft's Wabi for Unix.

            PC PROCESSOR MARKET FALLS INTO DISORDER

Pentium Pro's limitations offer reprieve for rivals. Competing
manufacturers struggle to innovate.

Until recently, the Intel compatible processor market was
reasonably well ordered. Custom- ers could tell which processor
was which and knew that upgrading to a newer microprocessor meant
more power. And as Intel sought to manage its growth, its volumes
and margins, it was also possible to chart roughly how much power
would be delivered by a new processor, and when.

 But all this looks set to change. As the competing vendors
struggle to innovate, and as the iapx86 design begins to near its
limits, the steady flow of Intel processors - from 286 up to the
Pentium '586', looks set to give way to a confusing mishmash of
competing products. By Intel's own admission, its new Pentium Pro
(or 'P6') processor does not run most PC software at all well.

Tests show that there is no significant performance gain from
running Windows or DOS applications on a 150 MHz (megahertz) P6
compared with a 133 MHz Pentium processor. Intel is now advising
PC makers to stick with the Pentium - a move that could later
impact its market share and profitability.

Meanwhile Intel's most formidable rival, Advanced Micro Devices
(AMD), is to take over rival NexGen, and is reviewing its product
line to accommodate NexGen's technology with its own. It will
drop its future K6 development in favour of NexGen's
architecture.

AMD, like Cyrix, another major competitor, is also changing the
numbering of its microprocessors in what many see as an attempt
to dress up older technology as new.

AMD is renaming its high-end 486 microprocessor the X5, in a bid
to grab some cachet from being associated as a fifth generation
part (ie, equivalent to the Pentium). Cyrix is playing the same
game, calling its delayed M1 microprocessor, originally a fifth
generation product, the 686 to make it seem like a sixth
generation product.

                            UNWELCOME

If the Intel-compatible processor market is to become less
ordered, it is not at the bidding of Intel or its rivals.

The first year of Pentium sales went according to the usual plan.
Intel then withdrew from the 486 market and took most customers
with it to the Pentium processor. US market research firm
Computer Intelligence Infocorp (CII) says that 486
microprocessors had about 55% of the market early in 1995 - this
is now just 25%.

It is not only user demand for more power that has led to the
rapid upgrade. "Intel's pricing strategy has made it financially
unwise for vendors to continue manufacturing and marketing 486-
based products," says Stella Kelly, analyst at CII. The threat of
the rival IBM/Motorola PowerPC RISC processor - a threat which
has since proved to be less immediate than Intel feared -
encouraged Intel to make the switch to the Pentium faster than it
had planned.

Initially, the strategy did no harm to the Intel-compatible
vendors but Intel, helped by the push to the Pentium, has
gradually got stronger. With prices now low, Cyrix has concluded
it cannot manufacture its 486 parts cost effectively and has
pulled out of the market. It is now concentrating on getting its
686 microprocessor out on time, to avoid a revenue blip.

 Analysts think highly of the 686 design - although its
competitive positioning would have been a lot worse if the
Pentium Pro was more powerful. "Cyrix's timing is a lot better
with the M1[686] and it should have few software compatibility
issues," said Mike Griffith industry analyst with US market
research firm In-Stat.

AMD's K5 Pentium competitor has suffered repeated delays due to
technical problems and will not now be delivered until the second
half of 1996. It is partly for this reason that AMD is taking
over NexGen. NexGen has been selling its Nx586 for a year but
sales have been hampered by the fact that it does not have a
Pentium 'pin compatible' part.

AMD is still confident of selling five million K5 units in its
first year and says it is talking with several major PC
manufacturers looking for an alternative to Intel. But it still
faces big problems: Linley Gwennap of The Micro- processor Report
points out that Intel's continuing price cuts on the Pentium mean
that AMD will be forced to sell the K5 for about $100, about the
same price as its high-end 486 part. Yet AMD will have spent
hundreds of millions of dollars getting the K5 part out and
ramping up production. "It will have trouble keeping its head
above water," says Gwennap.

                           WINDOW OPEN

If Intel had been able to deliver a powerful upgrade to the
Pentium next year, it would probably have crippled AMD. But while
Intel has managed to dominate the fifth generation market so far,
it will now be forced to leave the market window open wider than
it would have liked.

The reason can be traced back to its big software partner,
Microsoft. Four years ago, when Intel began designing the Pentium
Pro, Microsoft promised that its main desktop operating system
would be largely a 32-bit system - as are Windows NT and Unix. In
fact, the dominant operating systems are Windows 3.1 and
Windows'95 - both 16 bit systems. The Pentium Pro is only
significantly faster running 32- bit applications.

Intel points to faster versions of the Pentium Pro, running in
excess of 200 MHz, that will be out next year. It also says that
there will be increasing amounts of 32-bit software in future
versions of Windows 95. But, sources say, Intel realises there is
a problem and is working on a new version of the Pentium Pro
optimised for 16- bit software that will be out in early 1997.

"The Pentium Pro's poor performance in running Windows software
will give some extra breathing room for companies like AMD and
Cyrix," says Nathan Brook-wood, semiconductor analyst at US
market research firm Dataquest. To plug the gaps, in mid-1996
Intel will introduce the P55C, which is optimised for multimedia
processing. But the introduction of the 55C, which may offer
higher performance than the new architecture Pentium Pro, will
further confuse customers

If Intel's competitors want to benefit from any hiccup in its
business strategy then they will have to move fast. In 1997,
Intel will break with the iapx86 architecture and introduce the
VLIW (very long instruction word) P7, developed with Hewlett-
Packard. Even if the AMD, Cyrix and others are able to build
similar processors, competing against both Hewlett-Packard and
Intel - and the PowerPC consortium - is not going to be easy.

             SNI BENEFITS FROM CULTURAL REVOLUTION

German systems vendor back in profit

Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI) chief executive Gerhard
Schulmeyer spent 14 years of his business career in the US, first
as a senior executive at Motorola and latterly as head of the
engineering company Asea Brown Boveri. Those influences have been
all to obvious in his 18 months at the top of Europe's largest
indigenous systems vendor. His preferred working language is
English and he repeatedly looks to the entrepreneurial culture of
Silicon Valley for inspiration.

Last month, he was able to deliver evidence that his formula is
working. For the first time since it was formed in 1990 through
the combination of Germany's two biggest computer makers, Siemens
Data and Information systems division and Nixdorf Computer, there
was no red ink on the headline financial statement. Although much
aided by a revived German economy, SNI has managed an astonishing
turnaround. Losses that totalled DM350 million ($248 million) in
1994, swung to a slim profit of DM23 million ($16 million) for
the latest financial year ending 30 Sept-ember. Equally
impressive, revenues, which had been flat or shrinking for all of
its five years, jumped 10% in fiscal 1995 to DM12.8 billion ($9.0
billion).

How Schulmeyer has achieved the transformation is a lesson in
business re-engineering practice. But it also raises the question
of how SNI can sustain its elevation from its financial sickbed.

Over the 18 months, Schulmeyer has split SNI into 10 lines of
autonomous business, each of which "has to hold its own in its
own field". He has sent scores of managers to the US on
'entrepreneur' courses and tried to instill a culture of
innovation and openness, quickly dismantling SNI's historically
civil service-like clubbiness. "You no longer have to have your
ear to the wall to find out what is going on," says Schulmeyer.
"We have become a learning organisation." One manifestation of
this is the series of 'Friday Forums', where all of SNI's 37,200
employees get together to pick over issues ranging from working
practices to company strategy.

Schulmeyer says the reorganisation is now "more or less
complete". It has included a massive board level re-organisation.
Only three of SNI's top board of nine insiders and nine outside
directors have been with the company for more than three years.

Schulmeyer is now bullish about SNI's prospects. "There is now no
question of whether we have a chance of survival," he says. He
claims that SNI has moved into leading positions in many of
Europe's hottest computer markets. From nowhere, it has become
Europe's number four PC vendor - it is even turning a profit in
that market of wafer thin margins, despite the high cost burden
of building all of its PCs in Germany. In Unix mid-range systems,
it holds the number three spot. It also dominates the region's
market for high-speed bulk printers and is the second largest
vendor of point-of-sale equipment. In Germany, Europe' largest
market, it controls the number one position in all of these
products.

However, as the small overall profit indicates, not all business
units have made it as successfully into the black. Four, at
present, are still making losses, says Schulmeyer. Two can be
moved into profit this fiscal year, he says, and the other two
will be out of the tunnel in 1996/97. "Our agenda assumes that by
1996/97, all business units will be in the black." While he
declines to identify the loss-makers, he does point out that
SNI's mainframe division continues to show declining revenues.
The picture is the same in related computer maintenance.

In those areas and elsewhere, SNI has been making staff
reductions, though at a slightly slower pace than in previous
years. During fiscal 1995, headcount fell 5% to 37,200. Another
1,000 redundancies are expected this year.

Meanwhile, SNI's strongest engines of growth have been in Unix
servers and in point-of-sale systems. But perhaps the greatest
success story has been at its PC division, where revenues grew by
over 40% last year to DM2.8 billion ($2.0 billion) and units
soared from 390,000 to 636,000. Since October 1992, all decision
making for the PC business has been devolved to the unit managers
at the SNI PC factory in Ausburg near Munich. They have
drastically reduced the variety of models while investing heavily
in automation that allows PC to be snapped, rather than screwed,
together. To pare costs further, SNI took a 10% stake in Europe's
second largest PC retailer Escom, earlier this year. Buying
components together, the companies can benefit from volume
discounts and preferential supply. But most importantly, the
autonomy of the unit allowed the PC division to become highly-
responsive to market swings, allowing it to switch to new
specifications within weeks rather than many months. Back in
1992, when the factory was producing 190,000 PCs a year, it
calculated the break even point would be 500,000 units. Ausburg
is now running at 80% capacity and plans to produce 800,000 PCs
this year. But Schulmeyer believes that, to be a lasting success,
it has to get closer to 2 million units. That has encouraged the
thinking that SNI may be looking for less expensive manufacturing
sites outside of Germany, where 60% of its PCs are sold.

The location of the bulk of its PC customers points to SNI's
Achilles heel - the company's dependency on its home market.
Despite concerted efforts, Schulmeyer has been unable to raise
the proportion of business that SNI derives from outside markets.
For the past five years, 65% of revenues have come from Germany,
and he admits that the company is still searching for a formula
that will make it more successful elsewhere.

"Our market share often drops by a factor of 10 when we cross the
German border," says Schulmeyer. "International growth is our top
priority."

The goal is for revenues to be split one third from Germany, a
third from the rest of Europe and a third from the rest of the
world. But Schulmeyer admits "We don't have a solution to this
yet but somehow we will figure it out." He does not even express
optimism that SNI can attain its ideal of a three way split by
the end of the decade.

Nevertheless, that momentum in Germany has made the company the
world's 11th largest IT systems supplier, ahead of AT&T GIS, Bull
and Olivetti. In Europe, only IBM and Hewlett-Packard generate
more IT revenue.

In the US, the picture is very different. Revenues are barely
$500 million, although its acquisition of loss-making Unix server
maker Pyramid Technology in mid-1995 has come good. With Pyramid
no longer under threat of terminal decline, orders have picked
up, and it is now back in the black. Profits of over $10 million
were accompanied by revenues that grew by over 30% to around $300
million in 1995. That international expansion could be spurred by
further acquisitions - in the area of business services rather
than systems or software, says Schulmeyer, but Europe is the
priority.

SNI has not managed the turnaround without considerable help -
and a lot of patience - from Siemens AG, its $63 billion
engineering parent. Siemens has bankrolled the company through
its worst losses, and lent it capital to restructure. How much of
SNI's business flows from contracts placed by Siemens is not
public knowledge, but Siemens described as SNI's "preference
partner" by Schulmeyer.

In fact, SNI's revenues are due for a boost over the coming year
as Siemens begins transfering all of its computer centre
activities to SNI's outsourcing arm. Schulmeyer identifies these
activities as turning over DM 1 billion ($707 million).

That captive contract should help raise profits above 1995's
negligible amount. And Schulmeyer is under no illusion that he
has to get the company more solidly in the black. "We have got to
get away from the zero line, and show double digit growth to
avoid restructuring in the future."

However, if the German economy which has shown signs of decline
in recent quarters should falter, Schulmeyer will need every
ounce of his entrepreneurial flair to keep SNI bouncing back.

            HP CATCHING UP WITH IBM ON SYSTEM SALES

'Printer company' jibe rings hollow

Jealous rivals in the computer industry used to dismiss Hewlett-
Packard as 'a great printer company'. The description was meant
to imply that the computer, electronics, and peripherals giant
deliberately over-stated its importance in the computer industry
and played down the vital contribution of its printer business to
its phenomenal revenue and profits growth of recent years.

It is doubtful whether the jibe ever lost HP a single sale but,
even if it did, it is unlikely to be heard again after fiscal
1995. By any standards, HP has had a sensational year,
outstripping all its main rivals in just about every sector in
which it operates. Although HP does not break down its sources of
revenues, its total computer business, which it includes
workstations, servers, PCs and printers, grew nearly 30% to $7
billion during the quarter.

If HP can sustain this rate of growth for another 12 months, then
its executives can expect some banner headlines in November 1996.
Then, for one quarter at least, HP will be able to announce that
it has achieved what many must have thought impossible: in its
quarter ending in October 1996, it will have sold more hardware
than IBM did in its quarter ending September 1996. In fact, HP
nearly overtook IBM in the equivalent periods this year, with its
$7 billion worth of equipment nudging up against IBM's $7.75
billion.

True, these comparisons are a little unfair - IBM's much larger
fourth quarter ending in December is a fairer comparison with
HP's fourth quarter. Even so, they are an indication of just how
fast HP is growing. HP has a real chance of being the world's
number one computer maker early next century.

A few years ago, that crown once looked to be within the grasp of
Digital Equipment and, in order to put the heat on IBM, Digital's
salesmen wore badges bearing 2007, the year when they would
overtake IBM. HP is never likely to fall victim to such hubris.
With its fourth quarter revenue up a staggering 29% from $7
billion to $9 billion, and net income up from $476 million to
$678 million, its chief executive Lew Platt merely commented that
he "is encouraged by many aspects of its fourth quarter results".

Both financial and computer industry analysts were a little more
enthusiastic. "Phenomen- nally good", said a Merrill Lynch
analyst. HP is "extremely well positioned in almost every growth
market", said a Gruntal & Co analyst. HP reported big increases
in every one of its divisions, including its test and measurement
business.

Perhaps the most impressive performance by HP is in personal
computers, where it has come from almost nowhere to take a top
five position, with about 5.4% of the world market, in less in
than two years. Dataquest praised HP's performance in the PC
market, as did IDC, which described its growth as
"extraordinary". Analysts attribute HP's success to its strong
brand name, its manufacturing excellence, and its ability to
exploit its existing laser and inkjet printer distribution
channels. The downside of this success, however, is that its
overall gross margins have fallen by 3% because of the low-
margins of home PCs.

There is no immediate sign of a let up in HP's growth. Along with
its results, HP announced that its order book is healthier than
ever. It has $7 billion worth of orders for its computer systems,
it says, up nearly a third from a year ago. Against this
background, analysts dismissed speculation that HP will buy
Apple, circulating at the Comdex show in November, as fanciful.
Why. they ask, would HP, already growing so fast, want to take on
a company that is clearly troubled by major organisational and
strategic problems?

             TALIGENT NEEDS TO DEFINE FUTURE ROLE

Kaleida closure puts pressure on

When IBM and Apple formed their historic, three-part alliance in
1991, their goals could not have been more grand. First, they
wanted to create a new standard in microprocessors to challenge
Intel; next, they wanted to introduce a powerful new operating
system which would oust Microsoft from its position as the
leading supplier of desktop software. And third, they wanted to
lead in the supply of what was then viewed as the most exciting
technology of the day, multimedia tools.

Four years on, IBM and Apple still retain some slim hopes of
achieving some of their goals, but the grand vision lies in
tatters. Last month, IBM and Apple killed of their multi-media
software joint venture Kaleida, ending the company's long agony
(company insiders have been predicting its demise since early
this year). The move means a $75 million write off for each
company.

Down the road in Silicon Valley, some 400 employees at Taligent,
the object-oriented software tools company in which Hewlett-
Packard also owns a stake, are anxiously awaiting news. They have
been told it is business as usual, but persistent rumours suggest
that the company may be folded into IBM. This is because the
success of Microsoft in the past two years, along with other new
developments such as the World Wide Web, has almost killed demand
for a revolutionary new software environment.

"Employee morale is low. The ball is up in the air and no-one
knows where it will land," said one. Like many at Taligent, he
was recruited from Apple and says he does not want to work for
IBM.

As if this were not bad enough, the most successful part of the
alliance is also beset by difficulties. A top end 64-bit version
of the PowerPC reduced instruction set (RISC) microprocessor
family, jointly designed by IBM, Apple and Motorola, has been
indefinitely delayed (CBR November 1995). And IBM's failure to
deliver a viable PowerPC desktop system, along with Apple's
manufacturing and supply problems, have dimmed the long-term
prospects of the microprocessor.

Are the problems with each initiative related? In theory, each of
these projects is entirely separate, and involves other partners
and different ways of working. Yet Michael Braun, who headed
Kaleida Labs, can see at least one common factor: they are all
joint ventures. "Companies should have a counselling session with
me if they are thinking of doing one," he told reporters. "You're
stupid if you try."

Braun's complaint is that IBM and Apple could not stop bickering,
that they held a right of veto over Kaleida's decisions, and that
they prevented the company from developing software tools which
might compete with their own independent efforts. Although the
main authoring tool, ScriptX, is considered to be a technical
success, these problems meant it entered the market too late,
says Braun.

The two parents have now agreed that Apple will take over most of
the development work, although both will use some of the software
in future products. But does the failure of Kaleida bode ill for
Taligent? As one rival software supplier pointed out, "If the
model did not work at Kaleida, you have to wonder about
Taligent."

The comments of Joe Guglielmi, the former chief executive of
Taligent, are ominous. When he left in Septem- ber to head the
Motorola Computer Group, he said the company had completed its
first phase of software development and was on a "home run". Now,
he says, IBM and Apple are "re-evaluating everything".

The problems at Taligent are similar to those of Kaleida. Both
companies had grand ambitions and developed powerful technology
over a long period. But in each case, the fast-changing demands
of the market forced them to continually change their goals. In
the case of Kaleida, it missed development deadlines and its
ScriptX product was beaten to the market by Macromedia, which now
dominates (CBR November 1995).

Taligent has not missed any development deadlines, its defenders
note. But its original plan, to develop a completely new object-
oriented operating system, was abandoned because it became clear
there was no demand. Its lesser goal, of delivering powerful
object oriented tools and object "frameworks" for users and
software suppliers, has not fallen behind schedule, but it is a
much smaller market. Although the Commonpoint toolset is to be
delivered this quarter, making it unlikely that IBM and Apple
will pull the plug just yet, a scaling down of development effort
is likely.

That, in effect, puts the future of Taligent in the hands of the
market. If there is sufficient interest and take-up of the
development kits in the first half of 1996, then it is likely to
remain independent. But if there is insufficient demand, it will
be integrated back into IBM. As Guglielmi points out, "It fits
well into IBM's strategy." HP has so far remained silent, but has
never made the kind of commitment to Taligent that IBM and Apple
have.

Although almost every developer who has seen Taligent is highly
impressed, one commonly cited concern is that it was developed
before the Internet and the World Wide Web had caught on.
Companies such as NeXT Computer, which has a rival object
development tool, and Sun, which has the Java language, have re-
oriented their object oriented development environments in this
direction. In comparison, Commonpoint may be seen as a worthy,
but less immediately attractive development. If Taligent is to
make an impact, IBM and Apple will have to restate their
commitment and the company itself will have to demonstrate how it
is responding to market demands.

             CMG MAKES CAUTIOUS STOCK MARKET ENTRY

IT services group seeks 'fame' not cash

From its outset in 1964, CMG Plc, the Anglo/Dutch IT services
group, has always fostered a culture of employee ownership. With
share options built into every staff contract, around 1,850
employees, ex-employees and their relatives, along with their
pension and trust funds, own equity amounting to 90% of the
company whose headcount stands at 2,650.

But the fact that CMG has been privately held all these years has
meant that there was no way of cashing in that stock, apart from
trading on the internal spot market that grew up within the
company. All that changed in early December as CMG launched a
dual flotation on the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges,
establishing its market capitalisation at around $180 million.
That valuation is a modest one times the company's projected
annual revenues for 1995 of #200 million ($310 million), a figure
that betrays an underlying nervousness about the listing.

In fact, the company says its principal reason for the flotation
is in order to raise its profile in the eyes of its corporate
clients and within the pan-European services market. "We did it
for name and fame," says Cor Stutterheim, CMG chairman. CMG has
certainly has not gone public in order to raise large amounts of
capital. The share offering only netted CMG $6.1 million ($9.5
million).

For a company growing at 36% and which has been profitable for
each of its 31 years, that caution borders on the paranoid. Its
jumpiness has been picked up from the London stock market which
is justifiably bearish about high-tech issues. Over most of this
year, the market for IT stock has been poisoned after a number of
newly-floated companies missed their earnings forecasts by a
mile. That meant that CMG's initial run up to a listing, back in
the Spring of this year, had to be cancelled at a cost of half a
million pounds.

Companies like MDIS, a rival to CMG in certain markets, are still
trying to right their financial reputations. Judging from its
prospectus, CMG has grounds to be more bullish. Revenues grew by
14% in 1994 and CMG indicates that the strong performance that
result-ed in 36% revenue growth during the first half of 1995 has
continued in the second half of the year. This paves the way for
a #200 million year end.

Profitability is also solid - at least in Holland. After a first
half when its net profit was #5.3 million ($8.2 million), the
company is projecting a second half net of #12.1 million ($18.8
million) before flotation costs and #10.4 million ($16.2 million)
after. That is 44% up on last year's figure.

About 90% of the company's profits come from the Netherlands,
which has now become the UK-founded company's principle operating
region. Two third of revenues are derived from Holland, 26% come
from the UK and the other 10% from Germany, where CMG
strengthened its position in February with the DM18 million ($7.9
million) acquisition of system development/services provider
Pecom.

Operating profit margins at 15% are strong in Holland and weak in
the UK at 4%. The German operation is just moving out of the red.

In all three markets, CMG is still very much focused on software
development. Around 72% of revenues still come from projects and
applications software, while 21% is sourced from payroll
processing and facilities management contracts and the remaining
7% comes from management consultancy.

Despite its financial track record and the strong employee
loyalty that comes from collective ownership, CMG still has some
issues to resolve.

The death earlier this year of founder Douglas Gorman, coupled
with the fact that the company's principal financial centre has
shifted to Holland, raises some questions of whether the UK
should have such a strong role in the company as it expands
throughout Europe.

Secondly, despite the flotation, the company is not cash rich. In
fact, during the first quarter, when it paid out for Pecom, its
reserves dwindled to #5.1 million, forcing it to sell an 8%
tranche of equity to ABN Amro Bank. Even after the flotation, its
balance will only stand at #16 million, which is low given the
30% plus growth rate CMG is experiencing.

PERFORMANCE MONITOR

This month's results in the information technology sector
continue the trend that has been seen all year, with business
good across the board. Although certain companies may be
struggling, even companies in the less fashionable sectors are
faring well.

This month, one set of figures stands out - computer systems
builder Hewlett- Packard announced its fourth quarter and annual
revenues and, once again, enjoyed dramatic growth (see page 47).
It is now almost half the size of IBM and is close on the heels
of Fujitsu, the second largest largest supplier of IT equipment
and computers.

In personal computers, even the weaker competitors have been
reporting acceptable results this year, as the boom continues.
But there are exceptions. AST Research, a long-term survivor in
the PC market, has been having a difficult time for the past 18
months, and is beset by manufacturing problems and product
delays. In its latest quarter, AST announced losses of $96
million, compared with $39 million for the same quarter last
year. Revenues fell 19%, as price cuts, a shortage of new models
and the closure of some divisions took their toll. AST's weakness
enabled the Korean giant Samsung to take a 40% stake in the
company early this year, for $378 million. To protect its
investment, Samsung has now agreed a a $50 million line loan to
AST, backing up another $100 million line of credit that AST has
negotiated with BankAmerica. None of the cash is going into the
hands of the management that got the company into this trouble.
Three top executives resigned in September, including the
president, and a fourth, the chief financial officer, has now
decided to go.

Advanced Logic Research, a long-standing rival in the second tier
of PC makers, tends to concentrate at the higher end of the PC
market, but it too is suffering from increasing competition. For
its fourth quarter, revenues increased 12% to $53.4 million, with
net profits of just $2 million. ALR's financial performance is
improving - but its market share is falling and it is
underperforming compared to the market.

One PC maker that is most definitely back on track is Dell
Computer, which announced revenues up 60%, to $1,415 million, and
net profits up 80%, to $75.4 million for its third quarter. Dell,
which suffered two years of problems between 1992 and 1994, now
has a slick product line and is concentrating on its
traditionally successful direct sales channel. Dell said 82% of
its sales are from its higher value Intel Pentium-based machines.

One sector that most definitely is booming is Online Services and
Internet Tools. As the Internet began to take off, some analysts
predicted that suppliers of 'proprietary' online services, such
as America Online (AOL) would suffer; AOL's Steve Case, its chief
executive, always argued that AOL, the world's most popular
online service, would thrive as it would be used as a gateway to
the Internet. So far, he is right. AOL is thriving, with first
quarter revenues up 248% to $57 million for the first quarter.
However, it made a loss of $10 million because of a $17 million
charge related to the acquisition of Ubique Inc. AOL, which has
recently launched in Europe, signed up 700,000 subscribers in the
last quarter, compared with 525,000 who signed up for the
Microsoft Network, a service which many believed would fatally
damage AOL.

Another Internet related supplier is Spyglass Inc, the supplier
of the original Mosaic browser software. Given the enormous
popularity of Netscape, Spyglass is considered by many to be
underrated. But it is still a small company and, in spite of
alliances with the likes of Oracle, it may never gain the
critical mass needed to make a global impact. Fourth quarter
revenues rose 61% to $3.3 million, bringing the 1995 total to
$10.4. Fourth quarter net profits were $1.2 million.

Quarterdeck Software, once known for its PC utility software, is
in the process of re-engineering itself as a supplier of Internet
utility software. For its fourth quarter, revenues increased
142%, to $20.3 million, while losses fell from $15.4 million to
$0.6 million. Quarterdeck CEO, Gaston Bastiaens, described the
improvement as "a remarkable turnaround". So far, the company
derives 10% of revenues from Internet products, but this is
likely to rise fast.

One company which has analysts worried is General Magic, one of
the more glamourous IPOs of 1993. The company, which makes
operating systems and agent-oriented software, is considered to
be vulnerable to the success of Sun's Internet language, Java. In
the third quarter, sales fell 28% to $3.2 million and losses rose
to $5.1 million.

                       COMPUTER MARKETS

The US IT industry grew faster than the world IT market for the
third year running, according to market analyst IDC. Total US IT
industry revenues rose 10.3% to $183.8 billion in 1994, compared
with world IT growth of 7.5%.

US growth has been powered by the PC market, but analysts predict
a sharp slowdown in PC sales over the next five years. IDC
estimates that 22.6 million PCs will ship in 1995, a rise of
20.9% on last year, pushing revenues up 20.0% to $46.4 billion.
But in 1999 the market will be worth $67.9 billion, indicating
revenue growth of only 6.6%, with 36.5 million units shipping
that year, up only 10.3% on 1998.

The US software market will rise from $35.2 billion in 1994 to
$71.1 billion in 1999 - a growth rate in the "low-to-mid teens".
The US LAN hardware and software market will grow by 11% a year,
to $15.4 billion by 1998, from $9.1 billion in 1993. US spending
on outsourcing was up 9.4% in 1994 to $63 billion. The overall US
services market is expected to grow to $102 billion by 1998, says
IDC.

* The worldwide market for all types of electronics products -
computers, mobile phones, video consumer goods, appliances, and
so on - will grow by 11.7% this year to $791 billion, predicts
market analyst Dataquest. With a compound growth rate of 9%, the
market will rise to $1,196 billion in the year 2000, "providing a
strong foundation for semiconductor market growth over the next
five years".

                        INTERNET USAGE

The Internet will become a major vehicle for business
transactions in the next few years, as confidence in secure
communications grows, according to a recent survey by market
watcher IDC. The survey of 189 corporate Internet sites shows
that only 14% of installations use the Internet for product
transactions. IDC says that will rise to 34% next year and to 44%
over the next three to five years.

The survey of Internet usage shows that, most commonly, corporate
sites use the Internet for emailing suppliers and partners (62%),
job advertising or seeking (60%), document publishing (56%) and
competitor research (56%). In five years time, these will still
be high priority, but they will be joined by the use of the
Internet for customer service/technical support (73%).

The North American book-to-bill ratio, the primary gauge of the
health of the semiconductor industry, showed a steep rise to 1.18
in October, as PC and other electronics product vendors ramped up
orders in preparation for the Christmas selling season. The
October figure, up from an amended 1.15 in September, took the
index to its highest point since August, according to the
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).

A ratio of 1.18 shows there were $118 of orders (bookings) in
October for every $100 of products shipped (billings). A book-to-
bill ratio of more than 1.0 indicates a positive market trend,
because orders are higher than sales. The figures are calculated
using a three-month moving average and are seasonally adjusted.

October bookings rose to $4.9 billion, up 4.4% on September, and
were up 55.7% on the same period last year. Billings increased to
an all time high of $4.15 billion, up 37% on October last year.
The SIA's forecast for 1995 is that the market will grow 40.2% to
$47.1 billion.

the period, according to market research group Dataquest.

The analyst group predicts that the fourth quarter will be the
hottest in the history of the personal computer industry as year-
long supercharged growth is capped by a Christmas buying frenzy.
About 17 million units should be sold in the three months to the
end of December, spurred by Europe's continued economic recovery
and strong growth in Japan and the US.

During the third quarter, Compaq continued its reign at the top
of the industry by shipping 1.5 million units, 265,000 or 21.6%
more machines than during the same period last year. This marks
its seventh consecutive quarter in the leadership position.

However, Compaq found Apple snapping at its heals. During the
three months, Apple's shipments were up 20.5% to 1.3 million
units, allowing the Macintosh PC supplier to regain the number 2
ranking from IBM. Aided by strong seasonal sales into the
educational sector, Apple ended the quarter with an improved
market share of 9.0%, up from 7.4% in the second quarter. With a
growth rate of 13.2%, IBM exhibited the slowest pace of the top
five vendors, although it still sells over a third more PCs than
its fast growing nearest challengers, Packard Bell and NEC, which
grew at 30.5% and 47.9% respectively.

* In Europe, Compaq, IBM, Apple, Vobis and Olivetti all suffered
market share erosion as relative newcomers to the market Escom,
Hewlett-Packard and Siemens-Nixdorf accelerated during the third
quarter.

Compaq's market share at 13.1% was down from 14.1% a year
earlier, and IBM saw a dip in its market share from 9.9% to 9.1%.
Germany's Escom pushed Apple into fourth place as its share of
the market grew from 3.9% to 5.4%. Over the year, Apple lost 1.3%
of the market, leaving it with a 5.2% share, while a newly-
aggressive Siemens-Nixdorf added 1.3% to reach 5.1% of the
Europe-wide market as it rose to take the number one position in
the German personal computer market.

Overall, European growth in the third quarter, at 24%, was again
much stronger than the 10% reported in the equivalent period last
year. However, the pace showed a slight slowing from the frenetic
29% and 28% growth recorded in the first and second quarters in
Europe.

                     OUTSOURCING IN EUROPE

The IT outsourcing market in Europe is expected to continue its
explosive growth over the next half decade, with demand highest
in the manufacturing, government and financial services sectors.

Market research analyst Input says that the outsourcing market in
the region will grow from $6.1 billion this year to $15.0 billion
in the year 2000.

The largest contributor and the fastest growing sector will be
the manufacturing industry. Here, outsourcing spend will more
than double from $2.2 billion to $4.6 billion. The government
sector will also be a source of huge growth, with revenues of
$1.4 billion in 1995 rising to $3.8 billion in the year 2000.
Those government sector numbers will be mirrored in the financial
services sector.

                   Second generation thoughts

Your article on Second Generation Tools in CBR November 1995 was
interesting and thought provoking. As you noted, the number of
players rushing to deliver client/server applications development
tools is growing at a rapid rate. As this market develops, I
believe the critical factors will be twofold: one, the
development tool's ability to deliver an enterprise-level
solution to companies with high-end mission critical
requirements; and two, the ability to deliver real business
benefits.

When organisations are selecting a client/server application
development tool, they should look for one that combines the ease
of use of a first generation tool with the power and robustness
of a second generation tool. This tool should enable developers
to build quickly and easily even the most complex enterprise-
level applications with sophisticated logic and data
requirements.

Experience is critical in this market, and it is a key reason why
I believe the market landscape is still to be determined. In
discussion with our customers, we have found that organisations
require certain key technologies in order to build enterprise-
level second generation applications, including object oriented,
team development and configuration management capabilities, as
well as a strong, widely known 4GL-based environment.

A second generation tool is clearly more sophisticated and should
offer developers not only the ability to quickly build enterprise
class client/server applications without the need to use a 3GL,
but also give the developers the choice of deployment platforms
without changing any code. The key differentiator that users
should look for is the flexibility to decide the deployment
platform at develop- ment or deployment.

The first generation and second generation application
development tools on the market today each meet specific user
needs. It is up to the user to determine their application
requirements and to choose a tool that best fits their
environment. The players in each generation are battling to be
the biggest and the best and, in most cases, claiming they can
offer an effective solution for both generations. At Progress
Software, we are delivering solutions now for enterprise-wide
second generation client/server development with all the
essential technologies.

                         Building blocks

I read your article on client/server application development
software, 'Second Generation Tools' (CBR November 1995), with
interest. While we see client/server as the driving force behind
computer technology in the future, 'second generation' is a
misleading term. I think the idea of 'componentware' is more
appropriate.

Componentware allows you to build applications by plugging
elements together. Thus, if I want to integrate 'Help' into an
application, I don't write the code, I just use what is already
available in Word or Excel. I don't commission 20 programmers to
write me a graphics engine over two years; Microsoft has already
done it. I just plug and go. Componentware is revolutionising the
way software is delivered.

What componentware means is very simple. Applications will be
delivered more quickly, more robustly, more flexibly and with
more functionality. It's simply about plugging discreet modules
together to create a system. If you get it right, you will be
able to plug in new technology as it arrives and unplug old
technology with minimum fuss.

For example, a recent experience [of ours] showed the power of
componentware. A customer wanted to plug into a database they
hadn't used before and it took less than one day. It also means
the user can drive the delivery of solutions far more than ever
before. [A supplier] cannot seriously consider asking users to
wait a year or two years for an all-important system. It's not
worth worrying about; they probably won't be around if you have
to wait two years anyway. Componentware is the smart way to build
systems for people who need systems to give them business
advantage.

                          Hard lessons?

I thought your article on Xerox (CBR November 1995) was a
thorough analysis of where the company has come from and where it
stands today. The portrait you paint is of a organisation that is
clearly highly successful but which has been complacent about
exploiting many of its technological innovations. What worries me
is that it is possibly about to repeat that mistake again.

Xerox's newly-launched all-digital photocopier, the Document
Centre, may make conventional photocopiers look crude, but where
is the real value for customers in knowing that the copying
process has involved digitising the resulting document. Unless
Xerox is also selling a complete digital office software
infrastructure that can exploit the digitisation of documents,
then there will be little perceived value in simply turning the
document into bits.

The document image processing industry knows this scenario only
too well. Its initial offerings could scan, OCR and store huge
quantities of documents. But it was only when the digitising
process of these document was encompassed in a workflow software
infrastructure that customers began to perceive that document
imaging was an enabling technology that could make their
businesses more efficient. Xerox needs to do a lot more than make
the copier a computer.

                          BOTTOM LINE

                    CLARIFICATIONS & UPDATES

In the article "Second Generation Tools" (CBR November 1995) Gene
Bedell, chief executive of Seer Technologies, was quoted several
times. Unfortunately, we misspelt his name as Bidell.

                       NETWORK THE DOGGED

Sun Microsystem's new corporate mascot, Network the Dog, a
greater Swiss mountain dog, has caused the company some cultural
difficulties. The idea of representing Sun's sometimes
complicated sales message in the form of a friendly dog was
dreamed up by an outside agency. Scott McNealey, Sun's chief
executive, overcame his misgivings and followed their advice.

But although Network the Dog's appeal to North Americans and
Europeans is obvious, he has not gone down well in China, where
dogs are considered dirty and low. And in the UK, the term "dog"
is often used to mean a "dud" or a poor performer (for example,
"This network runs like a dog").

There are further difficulties: Network the Dog has a crowded
schedule, appearing at exhibitions and the like. But some
countries have strict quarantine regulations, making
intercontinental visits difficult. To overcome this, Sun has been
using lookalike dogs. This means that if you are offered a photo-
opportunity with Network (a big part of Sun's campaign) outside
the western side of the US, the chances are that you will be
photographed with a Network emulator.

                           AGED JOKES

The old East Coast high-tech industries, typified by companies
such as IBM and Digital Equipment, are starting to become the
butt of some self-deprecating humour. First, there was Digital's
move out of its old headquarters, the Boston Mill. The building
was sold to an old people's home, it was said, so that they did
not have to move too many people out. Meanwhile, at Xerox's high
tech offices in Stamford, Connecticut, the environmentally
conscious company has installed lights that turn themselves off
when there is no movement. In the offices of certain senior
managers, it is said, the rooms frequently darken during the
afternoon.

                            HOMELESS

Digital Equipment has downsized so fast in some countries that
staff formed "DEC ex-employee" groups, partly to provide mutual
support and partly to reminisce about the days when Digital
expected to overtake IBM as the world's largest and most
profitable computer company. In France, Digital's ex-employee
group has a reported 1,700 members. Of these, two are now
officially homeless.

                         VIOLENT PIRATES

Software piracy is viewed as a harmless and relatively victimless
offence, in spite of the efforts of the Software Publishers
Association and the Business Software Alliance to portray it as a
practice that is crippling the industry. In fact, some analysts
even think that some suppliers approve of a certain level of
piracy because it draws in new users. But all this, it seems, may
be about to change.

According to recent reports, criminal gangs are moving into
software copying - perhaps encouraged by their success in
stealing and re-selling processor and memory chips. When police
recently raided the Los Angeles address of alleged pirate Thomas
Alefantes, they found $1 million of copied software, computers,
high speed disk copiers, label printers, shredders, a pair of
handcuffs (?) and two guns. Earlier this year police raided
another gang's premises, where they found 40,000 software
programs ready to ship, along with explosives and guns.
Discoveries of this kind are said to be delighting the SPA, which
is now able to publicise software piracy as a real crime.

                         SUPER-SURVIVORS

Shortly after our article on supercomputers (CBR, November 1995),
which outlined the recent success of IBM's RS/6000 SP
supercomputer and the problems being suffered by smaller
suppliers, market analysts IDC published a report outlining
European sales of the leading vendors. IDC echoes the view that
some of the smaller vendors will not survive, and pinpointed the
British owned company Meiko as particularly vulnerable.

Meiko's 1995 European sales, IDC notes, were about the same as
nCube's, the company owned by Oracle founder Larry Ellison's, at
just $8 million. NCube, as reported in CBR (August 1995), is also
thought to be suffering from a slowdown in sales. RS/6000 SP
sales are expected to be $75 million.

There was good news for one minor vendor last month: Thinking
Machines, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
earlier this year, has put together a rescue plan which involves
reselling software and designing systems based on the UltraSparc.
Sun Microsystems will recommend the systems to its customers, but
will not directly resell them. The plan brings into question
Sun's relationship with another troubled vendor, Cray Research,
whose system it currently resells.

                         EDUCATION BOOST

British educational software company SIR intends to float on the
new AIM (Alternative Investment Market) in the UK early in 1996,
say insiders at the company, rather than list on Nasdaq in the
US.

Although SIR is 30% held by the San Jose-based venture capital
company Berg & Berg, the UK market is favoured partly for
political reasons - both the Conservative and Labour parties want
to be seen to boost education in the run-up to a 1996/7 election,
and both are expected to announce grants or tax breaks for more
IT spending in schools. Both parties have been looking for co-
operative agreements like the recently announced BT/Labour party
plan. Under this agreement, BT has agreed to put public
organisations "onto the information superhighway" if it is
allowed to offer services. SIR, which is barely into profit, says
this is boosting the value of educational IT suppliers. Research
Machines, a leading supplier of computers to British schools, has
a remarkably healthy share price, in spite of poor results.

              UNDERSTANDING MIDDLEWARE ECONOMICS

In trying to understand the economics of client-server systems,
we can break them down into the client, the server, and
everything in between. This is the domain of 'middleware',
described as the dividing line in client-server, perhaps the most
difficult aspect to assess - both technically and financially.

Middleware is the software that no-one notices and nobody wants
to pay for. After all, middleware is not the client-server
software that end-users interact with every day on their desktop
screens.

It is unobtrusive, operating quietly behind the scenes. If
middleware is noticed at any time, it is usually because it has
failed in some way.

In a way, it is software infrastructure and, like the social
infrastructure of roads, bridges, water pipes, sewers and railway
tracks, it is unglamorous and too often neglected. Yet experts
from the likes of IBM and the Gartner Group insist that the
secret to client-server success is to plan ahead and build an
enterprise middleware infrastructure before launching into
individual projects.

If this is true, it should be possible to find some way of
articulating the benefits of middleware in conventional
accounting terms.

                  ACTIVITY-BASED COSTS ANALYSIS

A recent White Paper from specialists at the Chicago-based
middleware software firm of Covia Technologies links the
acquisition of middleware with the novel accounting technique
known as Activity-Based Costing, or ABC (see Computer Finance
April 1995).

Covia's argument starts with something so simple that everyone
can agree on it:

                    Revenue - Costs = Profits

Which can be broken down a little further, to arrive at:

  (Quantity of Sales x Market Price) - (Variable Costs + Fixed
                        Costs) = Profits

Covia contends that this provides a framework within which the
cost-benefit impact of a middleware solution could be determined.
It is an approach that is conceptually simple, but very difficult
to implement. The goal is to account for middleware investments
at a detailed business level and to leave no items unaccounted
for as 'unallocated overhead' or 'unallocated revenue'. This
means it is necessary to ask such questions as:

* Quantity of sales - how will the middleware solution affect the
company's ability to increase sales turnover?
* Market price - will the middleware solution cause customers to
increase their perception of the value of the company's products?
* Variable costs - is the net effect an overall decrease in
business operation costs?
* Fixed costs - does the middleware solution contribute to
reducing fixed costs (perhaps in the form of obsolete assets)?

Traditional cost accounting methods are prone to miss some of the
less tangible cost-reduction effects of distributed software
technology, while accurately identifying the upfront costs.

According to Covia, a full analysis must transcend the obvious
and extend the cost-benefit analysis as follows:

* Staff. A distributed computer system affects how people do
their work, the ways in which they cooperate, and the skills and
expertise they require. The best analysis of this impact views
people as company assets and capitalises the investment in them.
Amortising this investment over time recognises that investment
in staff has a finite lifetime.
* Resources. The client-server infrastructure, which includes
middleware, determines how easy or difficult it is to provide
applications and make them work together. These applications,
when properly utilised, can have significant impact on resources
such as capital, raw materials - and above all, intellectual
property.
* Methods and technology. Distributed systems can contribute to
improving the methods and technology used to create products, and
sell and deliver them to customers.
* Systems, processes, and policies. Distributed computing has the
potential to transform a company's communications, workflow and
management style. Appropriate middleware can automate the process
of carrying a document to all who must deal with it, prompting
those that handle it to do so within a specified time frame. This
is why BPR almost always employs IT (notably workflow and
groupware products) as a tool.
* Structure and organisation. Even the physical layout of an
organisation can be radically improved through the introduction
of distributed computing. There is no longer a pressing need for
staff to congregate in or around meeting rooms, filing cabinets
and managers' offices. Taken to the limit, this logic embraces
the possibility of teleworking or mobile computing.
* Facilities. The distributed computing infrastructure becomes
part of the facilities, i.e. the physical assets required to
house and support business operations.
* Product. All the ways in which the distributed system affects
product (and service) definition, costs and saleability need to
be examined.
* Marketplace. Distributed computing has obvious potential for
directly supporting innovative marketing techniques such as
database marketing and telesales.

But how can the finances of middleware be charted when the
beneficial effects of distributed computing is proving so
difficult to measure? Analysts cannot even agree whether client-
server computing is cheaper, or more expensive, than more
traditional computing approaches.

The trick is to find a way of accounting for all the costs and
all the benefits, not just the obvious ones. Covia suggests that
an Activity-Based Costing analysis of the acquisition of a
middleware infrastructure should help tease out the many costs,
benefits and savings hidden in client-server implementation.

                       ADDING UP THE BILL

A first step is to develop what is referred to as a 'bill of
materials', which leads on to a 'bill of activities'. The bill of
materials lists all the components needed for a finished product,
the quantity required and the cost of each component. By analogy,
the bill of activities is defined as a listing of all the
activities associated with some business task, and their cost.

In theory the total cost of any business process can be found by
adding up the total costs of the BoMs and BoAs of all its
constituent activities: simple examples of a BoM and a BoA are
given in Tables 1 and 2 - the specific currency is academic.

A similar listing to the one shown in Table 1 would need to be
built up in favour of middleware implementation. The influence of
developing a client-server architecture with - and without -
middleware could then be explored, constructing BoAs to determine
the extent of that influence on the cost of key business
operations.

This all sound fine. In practice, however, ABC involves a great
deal of spade work to extract the necessary financial and
business information. In particular, the source of much of the
detail need to raise BoAs may not be immediately apparent, though
Covia identifies numerous activities where the use of middleware
might be expected to contribute to improved business operations:

* Staff. People become more productive. Developers produce new
applications sooner, with fewer defects. End-users have better
access to data and enjoy better communications with remote co-
workers. Under the right circumstances, they can feel empowered,
which motivates them to take more responsibility and initiative.
* Methods and technology. Middleware decouples IT from direct
dependence on specific networking technology. It becomes quicker
and easier to take advantage of new technology.

For instance, an organisation employing DCE or MOM (more on this
later) would find it much easier to migrate from TCP/IP to ATM
than if TCP/IP dependencies were written into the code of all its
applications. In a typical case, the savings might amount to two
programmer-years of effort, which could add up to as much as
#100,000. However, the delay itself might cost the business far
more.

Good middleware helps to avoid pathological delays in processing
work items. Different parts of the organisation are enabled to
work together and share ideas - although this may meet with
determined resistance from those with a vested interest in the
traditional scheme of things.

Middleware can also lower the barriers which currently frustrate
the attempt to cut IT budgets by replacing older proprietary
computers with modern PCs and servers which are much cheaper in
terms of raw processing power. Many so-called downsizing attempts
have backfired badly for a number of reasons, including:

* Shortage of skilled programmers and operators.
* Lack of systems management software.
* The sheer difficulty of reliably connecting the heterogeneous
'open systems' machines together.
* Inability to make the 'open systems' machines communicate with
mainframes, AS/400s and VAXes.

Middleware addresses all four of these problem areas. It
alleviates the shortage of skilled networking programmers, and
its relevance to the last three areas is obvious.

* Systems, processes and policies. BPR usually requires the rapid
installation of distributed IT systems to support new processes.
Middleware cuts the cost of creating these new systems, as well
as reducing the time to delivery.

This cost reduction should be reflected in the ABC Bill of
Activities for the business process. As noted earlier, staff are
empowered to get things done rapidly, without waiting for
information or approval. Islands of automation can be united,
resulting in better information sharing. As a result, 'slack'
time can be cut out of business processes. (Anyone familiar with
project management methods will probably see a parallel with the
manipulation of task schedules in order to find the shortest
critical path.)

As an example of how a technical refinement can result in
distinct business benefits, consider the choice between
synchronous and asynchronous middleware. With the synchronous
model, a client computer invokes a server, and waits until it
gets a reply. Suppose the server, in turn, has to seek assistance
from another server. Serious delays may ensue, while a customer
service representative or the managing director's secretary
stares at a locked screen.

Asynchronous middleware, in contrast, sets the client machine
free to get on with other tasks while it waits for a reply. A
reduction in time to process each call of just 10% can make all
the difference between a customer service centre that is busy but
on top of its work, and one where phones ring endlessly, queues
get longer, and disgruntled customers hang up to seek a more
responsive supplier.

* Structure and organisation. There is a marked trend for
businesses to reorganise frequently, in order to remain flexible
and responsive to market conditions. This is often accompanied by
a reduction in staff numbers with each having to accomplish more.
Distributed IT systems are one of several prerequisites for
successful reorganisation.

To take an example from the banking industry, more and more
customers are enjoying the benefits of telephone banking. These
people perceive that they are getting a far higher level of
service than that delivered by the traditional bank branch. The
customer can ring up at any time - 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year - and is immediately able to query account and transaction
details, transfer funds, or to arrange to pay bills.

The contrast with a traditional branch office is overwhelming -
the customer must travel to a fixed place, within fairly limited
working hours, and must then queue for an audience with a busy
clerk who usually does not have access to all the necessary
information. Modern middleware is essential for building the IT
support that allows service representatives to handle customers
by doing whatever they want without delay.

Improvements in wide area network (WAN) technology are such that
within a few years geographically separated teams will be able to
work together as conveniently as colleagues using Windows for
Workgroups in the same office today. This will bring substantial
savings, in reduced travel costs and will allow the best
available people to be assigned to a project regardless of
physical location, which will often mean that the projects can
start sooner.

                      MAKING MIDDLEWARE PAY

Holiday Inns Worldwide recently used middleware from a small US
supplier, Mitem, to put together a new distributed worldwide
reservation system in six months. This application has already
delivered measurable business benefits. For instance:

* Confirmation rates up 5-10%.
* Revenue per agent hour up 15-20%.
* Average call handling time reduced by 10-20 seconds.
* Training time reduced by 60%.
* Lower operating costs.
* Greater flexibility and ease of modification.

Holiday Inns Worldwide, which is owned by Bass, operates more
than 1,800 hotels with 340,000 rooms in over 50 countries. Its 14
central reservation offices provide 30-40% of a franchised
hotel's occupancy, and handle over 23 million calls a year -
twice the call volume of any other reservation service. Herman
(Holiday Inn Expert Reservation Manager) supports 1,800
reservation sale agents worldwide, who use 765 Apple Power
Macintosh clients to log over 60,000 calls each day.

Annual cost savings are estimated to be in the tens of millions
of dollars, based on a 10-15% productivity improvement in a
business which turns over more than $1.3 billion a year.

Holiday Inns already had a very efficient reservations system
known as Holidex, which ran under IBM's Transaction Processing
Facility (TPF). Since the user interface was complex and non-
intuitive, it was decided to keep the mainframe and add a GUI
front end. However, a client and a server do not add up to a
client-server system: middleware was needed to bridge the gap
between the very different worlds of Macintosh and mainframe.

To write the connectivity layer in C++ would have required too
much programming. MitemView gave Holiday Inns the GUI to screen
mapping it needed through a message-passing approach and appeared
to have a much shorter time to implement.

In April 1994 Herman was tested with 100 clients at Holiday Inn's
Central Reservation Office in Amsterdam. Production use started
in June 1994. Power Macintosh clients retrieve data through
MitemView, both locally from Sybase database servers and remotely
from the Holidex mainframe. Effectively, Herman takes the
processing away from the mainframe and distributes both the
processing and the database locally.

This is distributed computing fully taking advantage of each
platform - the mainframe doing what it does best, and the desktop
computer taking full advantage of its capabilities. The aim is to
reduce the communications costs for the reservations application,
because the agent can be 40 seconds into a call before the first
entry goes back to the mainframe for inventory.

The productivity gains arise from the more intuitive nature of
the GUI, together with the system's ability to gather information
from different sources without end-user intervention. For
instance, agents no longer have to memorise the 12,000-plus
industry-standard command codes used to sell a room; instead,
they simply click on an icon and the required information appears
on screen.

                     LIFE WITHOUT MIDDLEWARE

In sharp contrast to the experiences of Holiday Inns, developing
distributed applications without middleware can be slow,
difficult and expensive. Most notably, it requires the services
of specialised network programmers. They have to work at a low
level of abstraction, coding to native protocol stack functions
or even at the 'wire' level. This is quite expensive. In Table 3,
a comparison is made between the cost of client-server
development with and without middleware. Figure 1 on page 6 shows
this graphically, as a summation of the annual costs over time.

The reason for the difference in staff expenses is quite simple.
In general, the greater the degree of skill, the fewer the people
who possess it. There are millions of 4GL and visual programmers,
competent to build standalone PC applications. There are hundreds
of thousands of capable 3GL programmers. However, there are very
few who are highly skilled in network programming, and they
naturally command high salaries. Some estimates indicate that
this group is less than 1% of the total pool of programmers.

Worse, any reasonably large and complicated system is likely to
undergo frequent changes, as computers are added and removed,
departments come and go, new applications are added, and so on.

Each of these changes will require modifications to the network
handling routines. Yet the more they are changed, the less likely
they are to work reliably and consistently. Writing network
software is a very complicated and specialised job, and only a
small minority of programmers have the training to do it.
Middleware automatically handles this, the hardest and most
error-prone part of building a client-server system.

In doing so middleware, which essentially consists of pre-written
and tested networking routines, makes the application
programmers' task much simpler, and allows them to concentrate on
solving business problems.

There are several different classes of middleware options
available:

* Remote procedure calls allow a routine running on one computer
to call a routine on another computer, exactly as if they were
both part of the same program.
* Remote data access software is a specialised form of middleware
which passes commands to remote databases. The commands usually
take the form of SQL, the relational database query language.
* OSF DCE, the Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing
Environment is a middleware suite which includes RPC, and adds
directory, time, and security services. It also includes a
'threads' package which allows applications to do several
different things at once - so that a server can handle more than
one request at a time, for instance.
* Message oriented middleware (MOM) makes it easy for an
application to cooperate with applications on remote computers,
even if it does not know where they are or even whether they are
running. If RPC and remote data access are like a telephone call,
MOM is like a fax or letter - the sender can 'fire and forget'.
* Object request brokers (ORBs) work at a still more abstract
level. Conceptually, an ORB is simply a means for one object to
send messages to other objects, without caring where they are. So
far, it sounds like MOM. The main practical difference is that
messages sent using MOM must be retrieved from a queue by the
recipient, whereas an ORB finds and activates appropriate objects
to carry out whatever tasks a client demands. This is a far more
flexible way of working.
* Distributed transaction processing monitors help to make sure
that the end-user gets good service, by delivering fast response
times to large numbers of users, and making sure that each
transaction is either completed or rolled back.

There are products which automatically generate some or all of
the middleware required for a given client-server system. These
tools, which include Template Software's SNAP, Open Environment
Corporation's Entera, Hitachi's Distributed Object IQ and
Intellicorp's Kappa, are relatively expensive, however. That
said, the cost of acquiring them is outweighed by the savings on
development and testing time. The resulting systems are usually
more efficient and reliable, too.

                      THE MIDDLEWARE APPEAL

So middleware is a way of reusing software, with all the benefits
reuse can bring if it is practised sensibly. But middleware is a
relatively new idea, and innovation - no matter how beneficial -
always encounters spirited resistance from those who are
uncomfortable with change. Consequently, it can be quite
difficult to sell the idea of middleware product acquisition.

Technically of course, middleware has several practical
advantages over native network programming:

* It takes care of all the network control internally, leaving
the application programmer to cope with relatively simple
interfaces. Message oriented middleware (MOM) is best in this
regard. One application 'posts' a message to a given mailbox
address, and another application collects it on arrival. The
middleware functions as a 'post office' in between; the
application programmer need not care whether the message was
transmitted over copper wire, microwave or wet string.
* It provides many extra services, such as guaranteed delivery
even if the receiving computer or part of the network should
fail. Some products offer sophisticated options such as 'deliver
once and once only', which is invaluable for transactions like
debiting a bank account, where it is essential that it be done,
but equally important that it should not be repeated.
* The middleware supplier takes responsibility for support and
maintenance, leaving the applications programmer free to
concentrate on solving the company's business problems. Some MOM
users have indicated that the use of middleware much increases
development productivity - it has been known to double. Testing
costs are also significantly less. Finally, fewer staff are
needed to complete a given project.
* Consequently the need for specialised networking programmers is
much reduced, or even completely eliminated. The salary bill and
training costs can be much reduced, and there is less need to
track developments in networking technology closely - that
becomes the job of the middleware vendor.
* Some forms of middleware are standardised, making it possible
to switch suppliers should the incumbent fail, or prove
unsatisfactory.

It is normal for vendors to claim that their products can deliver
huge benefits, often given spurious authenticity by citing
simplistic calculations, resulting in large cost savings. This
behaviour is part of the background noise of the marketplace, and
buyers usually tune it out without thinking. With middleware, the
admittedly increased IT costs are sometimes more than offset by
decreasing costs elsewhere. If this 'elsewhere' is at the
customer front line, where the company makes its profits, then
the incremental IT investment may well be justified.

             IBM MAINFRAME VALUES CONTINUE DECLINE

New models with better price-performance profiles have already
taken their toll on the value of used mainframes on the second-
user market. It is predicted that the future residual values of
all new and used machines will take quite a battering in the
coming two quarters.

Mainframe values continued to decline rapidly over the last six
months of 1995, both for new machines and for used ones. This is
mainly because of the effect of IBM's new 9672 CMOS mainframes,
which have been priced by IBM to give better price-performance
than the 9021s, and are at the same time cheaper to run.

The 9672s offer two principal economic benefits over their
bipolar predecessors that are helping to drive down the values of
the older machines.

The much improved environmentals of CMOS (lower cooling and less
heat dissipation) mean lower running costs, but also improved
reliability which leads to very much lower maintenance costs.

In addition, these systems attract lower software licensing costs
because of their ability to participate in PSLC (Parallel Sysplex
Licence Charging).

Together, these cost benefits have allowed IBM to claim that
users replacing their 3090s with a new 9672 can recoup the
purchase price within two years on the savings they make.

                     CHEAPER PROCESSOR POWER

The first generation 9672s, announced in September 1994, were
built from System 390 microprocessors, with the R11 uniprocessor
having a performance rating of around 14 MIPS. The maximum R61
system has six processors and is rated at around 60 MIPS.

IBM has not, of course, published a price list for these systems,
either here or in the US.

Reports from the field suggest that these Rx1 systems were
originally priced at a little under #14,000 per MIPS - say around
#13,750 - for a base configuration. One has to treat this figure
with caution, however, as very few systems are sold with the
basic configuration (which is just 128Mb of main memory and three
channels). So this may be an over-estimate.

However, that #13,750 figure was about 25% below the typical
selling price for an H5 bipolar mainframe at the time, which was
around #18,500 per MIPS.

Historically, this is the first time that IBM has priced a new
generation of mainframes at a lower price-performance than its
predecessor. Typically the pricing has been greater than on the
predecessor range, to allow the company to build up production
without being swamped by the demand.

The second generation 9672s were announced in June, with first
deliveries in the third quarter. They employ developed
microprocessors that are about 60% more powerful. The R21 entry-
level model is rated at around 21 MIPS, while the top Rx3 model,
with 10 processors, is at around 160 MIPS.

Market research company Xephon published its estimated prices for
these models in the August 1995 issue of its Insight IS magazine.
Its pricing suggests a range from $18,000 per MIPS at the bottom
end to $16,000 at the top, with an average across all models of
$16,800. Using a conversion rate of #1 to $1.40, this translates
to around #12,000 per MIPS.

If we accept the #13,750 figure as a typical initial selling
price for an Rx1, and the corresponding #12,000 figure for the
second generation models, then prices fell over the current
lifetime of the 9672-Rx1s at a rate of around 20% per year
compound.

This is significantly less than the general rate of improvement
in the price-performance of the technology, which most analysts
put at around 30%.

                   LOWER PRICING DRIVES COSTS

Surprisingly, IBM's pricing of H5 mainframes fell by a greater
amount over the same period, in fact by around that 30% rate.
This is surprising because the rate of improvement in the cost of
the basic bipolar technology is only supposed to be around 15% -
it is because it is so much less than CMOS that IBM (and every
other mainframe vendor other than Hitachi) has bet its mainframe
future on CMOS.

Another surprise is that the fall is even across the range - even
up to the most powerful models, which have as yet no CMOS
equivalent.

As a result, a typical H5 selling price in June 1995 had come
down to a little over #14,000 per MIPS. This reduced the
differential between the price-performance of new bipolar and new
CMOS mainframes to 15%.

Over the past six months, the differential has continued to fall,
though at a slightly slower rate: it now stands at around 13%.

Prices for new bipolar mainframes are still falling at around the
same 30% annual rate, and are currently only just over #12,000
per MIPS. CMOS prices have also fallen over this period, and
brokers at Econocom estimate that the current price is around
#10,000 per MIPS.

The inference is that H5 prices will continue to fall at a
greater rate than 9672 prices until the two are in line.

These falls in the new prices have naturally had their effect on
used prices. Reliable data on the going rates for used 9672s is
not yet available: few have come onto the market, and those that
have are configured with different memory and channel options.

According to Econocom, software and maintenance charges are often
bundled into the prices as well, which makes it difficult to tell
exactly what the pure hardware cost is.

This is likely to become increasingly the case with mainframes:
now that the hardware is so cheap, software necessarily accounts
for an increasingly large part of the running costs.

                   SOFTWARE LICENCE ECONOMIES

We have already seen this in the PC world, where licence costs
often come to more than the price of the hardware. The same was
true with used 3090s during the height of the recession.

An implication here is that software pricing should continue to
come down. IBM has already come under great pressure from its
customers to reduce software prices to the level of Unix-based
software, which means a reduction of around a half from the pre-
usage-based pricing level.

IBM executives have been consistently claiming since then that
its pricing is fair, while at the same time steadily reducing it.
Usage-based pricing, announced in April 1994, has been estimated
to cut a typical customer's bill by 5% to 10%.

That was a small step: the next one was much larger. Parallel
sysplex charging (PSLC-E) was introduced with the 9672-Rx1 in
September of that year, and IBM claims it can cut bills by as
much as 25%.

The latest development has been the announcement of the new
OS/390 operating system in October. OS/390 will not be delivered
until later in the current quarter, and the price list for the
new software had not at the time of writing been finalised, so no
definite information about the savings to be made here is yet
available. IBM has only promised officially that the price will
be less than the sum of the component parts.

It seems possible that it will be quite a bit less. The Annex
Bulletin has estimated that OS/390 will cost about 10% to 15%
less than the sum of the individual components. Senior IBM
executives are privately being even more bullish, quoting figures
in the 30% to 40% range. (For most users, who will not be running
all the 30 utilities included as standard in OS/390, the actual
saving will be less, but for the vast majority it is still going
to be significant.)

Whatever the saving is, customers can add it to the savings that
can be made by adopting MULC (usage-based pricing) and PSLC/E.
IBM has in fact delivered substantial software savings to its
mainframe users over the past couple of years, to the point where
Unix software no longer seems ridiculously cheap.

                      USED MARKET DYNAMICS

Reverting to the used market, H5s are now freely available three
years after the first deliveries (though they have been available
in reasonable quantity on the used market for less than a year).

Prices have fallen to around 20% of their original selling price,
and are now in the range #6,500 to #8,000 per MIPS (apart from
the 9x2, which is considerably more expensive).

For example, an entry-level 61 MIPS 9021-711 currently fetches
around #450,000, or #7,300 per MIPS. The three processor 169 MIPS
model 831 commands around #1.25 million, or #6,500 per MIPS.

These prices are considerably lower than they were in the summer.

At that time Econocom priced a 711 at #850,000 and an 831 at #2
million (see Table 1). So the 711 has lost half its residual
value in six months, the 831 40% of its value.

We noted in our last report (Computer Finance, August 1995 page
7) that used H5s then looked overpriced. H5s came onto the market
at the beginning of 1995 at a price of around #13,000 per MIPS -
not far below IBM's typical average selling price at the time.

They more or less held that value through into the summer, which
meant that lifetime depreciation was running at less than 40% a
year, compared to over 50% depreciation in new mainframe prices
generally over that period.

It also meant that they were priced at virtually the same as the
cost of a new model from IBM.

The current pricing is much more reasonable, at around 35% to 45%
off the pricing of new systems from IBM. This is about the same
discount as the second generation of the previous range, the
3090Es, offered at the same stage of their life cycle.

The top-of-the-range 9021-9X2 is substantially more expensive
than all the other models. As Table 2 shows, Econocom is quoting
a price of around #4.5 million, which works out at around #9,400
per MIPS, and is down by 35% since the summer.

                   CUT PRICE MAINFRAME MODELS

Used models of the predecessor H2 range (the first generation
Summit machines) are now down to below 10% of their initial
selling prices. Typical pricing is around #5,000 per MIPS,
offering a discount of well over half on the price of a new H5.

For example, the 47 MIPS entry-level 9021-520 now fetches around
#250,000, or #5,200 per MIPS. The top-of-the-range 248 MIPS model
900 has very similar price-performance at its current used price
of #1.3 million.

These prices too have fallen dramatically since the summer, even
more so than the H5s. At that point Econocom valued the 520 at
#550,000 and the 900 at #2.35 million. So the depreciation in
residual value has been 55% for the 520 and 45% for the 900.

The H0s (340-based) 9021s have now fallen well below #1,000 per
MIPS, and essentially have no value other than their frames and
environmentals. These systems can be upgraded to later 9021s, but
their 3090J-type logic circuitry is now worthless.

The only residual value left in the 3090Js themselves is in the
memory and channels, which can be used to upgrade other users'
machines.

If we assume that IBM reduces prices of large H5s by the
traditional 15% or so per year from now on (rather than the 30%
we have actually been seeing over the past six months), and also
that it passes on the 30% pricing improvement in its CMOS models
that the technology allows, then residual values of H2s and H5s
should develop in the manner shown in Tables 3 to 5.

                     RESIDUAL SLUMP FORECAST

The immediate conclusion to be drawn from these projections are
that prices will continue to fall at a much steeper rate than in
the past, both on traditional bipolar mainframes and even more so
on the CMOS systems.

Indeed, the tables may well over-estimate future residuals.
Sievers Consulting is forecasting that the H2 market 'is expected
to collapse' around now.

The consultancy argues that IBM could decide to clear its stocks
of H2s that it has accumulated as a result of H2 to H5 upgrades,
just as it did with 3090Js towards the end of 1994.

Prices are certainly falling rapidly, as we have noted, but there
is no sign of total collapse as yet. H2s are better placed than
3090Js, as they can be upgraded to H5s.

As far as the newer systems are concerned, the 30% annual fall in
the price per MIPS of CMOS systems should mean that today's 9672
pricing of #10,000 per MIPS should decline to #8,500 by the
middle of next year (roughly when we should expect the next
generation), to under #6,000 by mid-1997 and to around #4,000 by
mid-1998.

The effect on the residual values of used models is shown in the
tables.

The adoption of commodity technology in mainframes means PC-type
pricing considerations now apply to mainframes: lower initial
pricing, but faster depreciation and faster obsolescence. *

             DESKTOP COMPUTING: ASSET OR OVERHEAD?

The best asset management system will die on the vine without
securing the support of all concerned. The optimal way to gain
this support is by demonstrating productivity improvements, cost
and risk reductions, and generally making life easier for IS and
end-users.

Although there would appear to be a slow realisation that moves
are needed to improve control over distributed computing assets,
there seems to be a general sense of uncertainty about where to
start and how to proceed with desktop asset management.

There is a clear need to curb runaway desktop spending. Even
during recession capital investment on IT remained at 1% to 2% of
turnover, depending on sector. And nowadays, the value of desktop
assets is slowly nudging ahead of the installed base of
centralised assets, with up to 70% of all investments going on
distributed technology. Yet the very sites that have spent time,
effort and money putting together tight and sophisticated
mainframe asset management practices would be hard pressed to
show anything comparable for their PC-LAN and internetworking
investments.

                   ASSET MANAGEMENT HESITATION

In their defence, such organisations would claim that one of the
problems is that there is no single solution for enterprise-wide
asset management.

This starts to explain the general level of hesitancy towards
implementation of an asset management policy. The market is
actually very fragmented and offers a multitude of point-solution
products that address many different aspects of asset control.

In some senses there is a genuine need for point solutions: there
is said to be as many as 80,000 different desktop assets which
can be applied in different combinations across the enterprise on
departmental servers, across local area networks or standalone
desktops, so tracking them is going to be difficult with
specialist tools. In this light, there is perhaps no choice but
to adopt a broad spread of highly specific toolsets, taking in:

* Desktop utilities.
* PC audit packages.
* Licence management suites.
* Software metering software.
* Configuration management, software release and version control
routines.
* Network monitoring consoles and remote LAN management systems.
* Helpdesk suites.
* Chargeback schemes.

Asset management involves a whole lot more than counting PCs. A
physical inventory check and software asset audit is only the
beginning, and is viewed as just a small first step to
establishing best practice for hardware and software order
fulfilment, asset administration, licence tracking, technology
refresh and a range of other functions such as reconciliation of
book values, accounts consolidation and the like, that stretch
well into mainstream corporate financial management.

It also means tracing asset histories across highly distributed
systems, across disparate departments and end-user groups - often
with devolved budgets. The time-costs alone, can be quite
considerable. In fact, asset checks can lead to other, unexpected
costs, as well.

Some IT managers admit to having so far dodged the development of
an asset management strategy chiefly because of concerns about
just what they are likely to find once they start scrutinising
the composition of their desktop assets. It is an aspect which
could be described as the 'desktop legacy'. According to research
carried out by consultants KPMG, the vast proportion of corporate
PCs are incapable of running modern desktop applications: 50%
having less than 4Mb memory. This makes for a considerable latent
demand for capital expenditure before full advantage could be
made of memory-hungry 32-bit applications and latest operating
systems. Moreover, it is estimated that 40% of the corporate PCs
in the UK are still not connected to the central network.

To add to the anxiety, there are mounting concerns about the
escalating cost of ownership of desktop assets, particularly over
the 'hidden' or so-called 'soft costs' of PC operation and end-
user support. According to Gartner, PC administrative costs
nearly quadrupled in the five years between 1987 and 1993.

                     AN AUDIT STARTING POINT

In many ways there is a need to rationalise the existing asset
base before it is possible to begin to actively manage the
desktop computing complement.

There is a need to kick off with an audit. As Table 1 indicates,
that in itself does not run to a great expense. At around #30 per
PC it is no great cost, but this is only an initial down-payment.
Although it is a good starting point, put in to proper
perspective, an asset audit has to be thought of as a first move
in a logical progression towards a point where software
distribution is automated, software licences are actively managed
and asset use accurately charted. A full-blown asset management
strategy could set an organisation back as much as #100,000 just
in setting up a dedicated asset management database.

In this context, it starts to become necessary to map out and
quantify the benefits as well as the costs associated with asset
management. These centre on three principal areas:

* Reduced risk of software violations through improved licence
compliance.
* Reduced software licence costs by moving to metered software
use and the purchase of concurrent licences.
* Reduced cost of ownership through better management of the
asset base.

There is a history of poor licence management on two fronts.
Yorkshire & Humberside Training Services, GEC Alsthom Low Voltage
Equipment, London Borough of Tower Hamlets and Cow & Gate
Nutricia are just a few of the corporations to have been pursued
by FAST, the Federation Against Software Theft over improper use
of desktop software licences.

All the cases were settled out of court, though each firm must
have incurred at least some costs re-licensing all the illegal
versions that were found to be running.

An indication of the actual cost of licence violations comes from
the US Software Publishers Association, which reports that it
records roughly 250 cases a year of licence infringements leading
to costs of $100,000 on average, per violation.

In some cases, there is a history also, of overlicensing. When
one organisation upgraded 100 PCs with new desktop software it
negotiated for $200,000 worth of networked applications for
concurrent access by its 100 end-users.

However, when later it moved to meter the use of its new
applications it found that at peak use, one of the new programs
was used by only 65 end-users and another by no more than 30 or
so end-users at any one time.

In overlicensing, it had overspent by as much as $115,000.

                     ASSET MANAGEMENT APPEAL

In a White Paper being circulated by Canadian asset management
specialist Asset Software International on The Case for Asset
Management, the point is made that, as self-evident as this
sounds, the trick to developing an effective asset management
policy lies in achieving two goals: maximising the use of assets
to produce revenue while minimising overall costs.

It goes on to demonstrate ten ways to improve ROI with asset
management. Its suggestions include:

1. Server/licence consolidation and rationalisation.

ASI confirms that the biggest immediate return from IT asset
management is an analysis of software licensing in order to
rationalise on-going licence fees and software maintenance. This
is occurring on two levels: network operating systems and
application licensing.

Two major changes in the NOS environment have lead to
opportunities for significant cost reduction. First, the hardware
on which these servers operate have become increasingly powerful,
allowing fewer boxes to support more users. Secondly, the
licensing model has changed from fixed increment purchase (50
user, 100 user, 250 user and so on) to exact per-user pricing.
Both changes allow significant cost reductions, both in new
procurement and in ongoing maintenance and support costs.

Some of the issues are similar for application programs
(consolidating many licences onto fewer boxes) but applications
have some additional twists. Many programs (especially those
running on a large server environment) are still priced according
to a platform tiered model.

ASI cites one case where use of its AssetPRO asset management
database led to its client achieving a six-figure saving on RDBMS
licence maintenance fees by short-circuiting a common selling
tactic used by these vendors - that of negotiating a site licence
with the organisation and then aggressively promoting its use
with end users (after all it is free), thereby locking the client
into higher maintenance fees as instances of the database were
promulgated throughout the organisation.

By accurately identifying the number, type and use of
applications based on the RDBMS (many quite small and deployed on
inefficient workgroup servers) the supplier says it was able to
reduce the overall licences in use (and thereby maintenance fees)
by consolidating applications databases onto cost-efficient
servers with no effect on user operations. The maintenance
savings in the first year more than paid for the cost of adding a
few larger servers and the cost of moving the applications to the
consolidated servers. After nine months, net savings on licence
maintenance could be identified even before considering the
reduced indirect support costs of having fewer application
servers.

2. Lease termination.

One of the first problems that can arise in leasing is correctly
identifying which assets are owned outright and which are leased.
An ad hoc study done with one ASI client indicated that the
average PC on lease had a 28% cost base increase during its
lifecycle. Situations can arise where assets on leases that are
terminating are returned to the lessor with additional equipment
(such as network interface cards and other additional
peripherals), extra memory, software installed and so on. This
can be especially expensive with servers that have workgroup
licences installed and have had their performance augmented
through additional disk drives and memory.

3. The cost-effectiveness of training.

One of the largest components of total cost of ownership is
ongoing support and end-user costs and an intuitive answer is to
invest resources in training of end-users in order to attempt to
drive down both formal (helpdesk) support and informal (peer
support) costs.

While it would appear to be self-evident that support costs are
somehow correlated to training investment, it is difficult to
determine the exact correlation and thereby answer the questions
of: is training cost-effective, will training reduce support
costs, how efficient are various methods of training, and is a
lack of training a primary cause of ballooning support costs?

ASI says that AssetPRO assists in this analysis by tracking
support calls and costs and linking them to specific assets,
groups of assets (cost centres) and the end-users and their
function in the organisation, and then correlating this cost and
incident data against the level and specifics of training for
those users, groups of users and systems, thereby establishing
the crucial link between the two activities.

4. Software upgrade analysis.

The appearance of Windows 95 has focused the ongoing debate about
software upgrade cost-benefits, software licensing terms and
conditions and the overall productivity metrics of desktop
software.

By tracking the actual time spent using an application (not just
launched on the desktop and sitting in the background, but
actually in use) and then correlating this information to the
asset structures, it becomes possible with some asset tools to
determine what percentage of the installed base is being
productively used and therefore should be upgraded. This goes
beyond a software metering capability (that varies in capability
from simply detecting launches of software off a network server
to logging time used) because that metering information is viewed
in a vacuum if it is not correlated to the assets, groups, users
and organisational structures.

5. Improvements in procurement records.

Probably the single greatest oversight with enterprise asset
management is the exclusion of procurement activities and tools.
Many of the terms and conditions of procurement will have life-
long effects on the overall cost of an asset. This can be as
simple as continuing to buy makes and models with a proven record
of high support costs and unreliability, to locking in multi-year
maintenance costs based on list price and the vendors'
assumptions about continued price increases throughout the
lifetime of the software.

6. Loss prevention.

A very simple aspect is that asset management is a process for
loss prevention of assets, particularly where they are more
mobile, of higher value, more generally desirable and have
significant opportunities for component theft (memory,
peripherals and software).

7. Warranty cover improvements.

Almost every IT asset a corporation purchases falls under a
warranty of one type or another. The cost of supporting this
warranty is not wholly absorbed by the manufacturer but is
averaged into the cost of the product which, of course, is paid
by the corporate buyer.

Why is so much money being spent on third-party support when
warranties already exist? The answer lies mainly in the inability
to discover which assets are still covered under warranty and
which are not. A central asset management database can very
quickly ascertain which assets are covered by a warranty and
which are not.

8. Effective technology cascade.

Technology cascade involves taking a particular asset which no
longer serves a particular user effectively and transferring it
down to a user whose requirements are less intense. A nice theory
but in practice there are many issues that need to be addressed
before the technology cascade can be effective and not cost more
money than it saves.

9. Support and maintenance minimisation.

One of the biggest and most immediate benefits generated by
implementing enterprise-wide asset management is the savings from
reduced support and maintenance corporate-wide. A central asset
management repository can provide all sorts of useful feeds from
procurement, helpdesk, data collection, software usage metering
and leasing.

So when sourcing the cost of a new printer, say, procurement
traditionally would purchase the printer with the lowest price-
tag.

But by factoring in the cost to support various printers within
the corporation, it might be determined that the printer with the
lowest price-tag is actually 60% more expensive to run compared
with a printer with a higher purchase price.

10. Corporate standards.

Standardising on various technologies and software will reduce
the amount of support required enterprise-wide and ease the
process of software deployment.

So if the benefits of asset management extend from being able to
better orchestrate PC purchase across the enterprise, to slowing
down the escalating cost of end-user support, improving the speed
of deployment of new applications or reducing equipment loss, it
also sets the scene for outsourcing: first audit the asset base,
then optimise, rationalise or consolidate it to improve the
management of desktop assets, and finally look to get shot of the
whole problem by contracting out the job.

Whether such a move is financial astute or strategically naive is
another matter all together.

                      OUTSOURCNG IT ASSETS

In a White Paper on Gaining Control Over Distributed Assets,
Comdisco probes this very point. Organisations have had few
options when it comes to asset management, it contends. They can
try to address the problem using internal resources, but few if
any companies have the staff, expertise, or time to do this.
Alternatively, they can simply outsource the entire process,
typically for a fixed cost per desktop. But the distributed
computing environment is fraught with change. Turning over this
critical and dynamic function, sacrificing internal control and
flexibility, can be a very costly mistake.

It points to a survey carried out by consultants Deloitte &
Touche in which managers at 104 companies were surveyed on their
anticipated benefits of implementing an outsourced asset
management program, and then surveyed again in 1994 a year after
implementation to compare actual benefits to expected benefits.
The findings were interesting, as Table 2 shows.

On the back of such findings, Comdisco maintains that the
ultimate approach to effective IT asset management lies somewhere
between outsourcing and 'insourcing,' an alternative it calls
SelectSourcing .

Comdisco's SelectSourcing approach addresses the complete
lifecycle management of assets - from planning and procurement to
installation, inventory tracking, network design and management,
operational support, recovery and replacement.

Companies can select individual services, or leave it the
supplier to manage the complete fulfilment and administration of
all their desktop requirements.

The aim is to identify specific ways in which to reduce costs,
improve processes, gain control, reduce risks and increase
productivity across the enterprise. To do this, it breaks asset
management into four functional areas:

* Asset Management Planning Services: Key components of building
a plan include benchmarking current processes and costs;
analysing work flow; developing a functional and technical
design; developing a data repository of IT assets to facilitate
budgeting, forecasting, tracking, standards management, migration
management and technology planning.

The benchmark study consists of a complete inventory of all
hardware and software assets. The study reviews the total cost of
ownership, including acquisition, maintenance, and support costs.
A market and book-value analysis of all installed equipment is
also a critical element.

Undertaking a work-flow analysis is analogous to conducting a
benchmark study of current working practices. Studying work flow
is critical, as Comdisco reckons more than 80% of total asset
costs can result from non-hardware issues. There is a need to
examine current procedures used to order, track and manage
hardware and software, as well as identify potential areas for
improvements in productivity.

Frequently, simply understanding work flow better enables
companies to reduce costs by 5% to 10%.

After completing the inventory and work-flow analysis, it becomes
possible to create a functional and technical design that ensures
computing assets are deployed in the most efficient and cost-
effective manner.

An important piece of developing the functional and technical
design is creating a data repository of all IT assets. This
serves as a focal point for enterprise-wide asset information.
The repository will enable appropriate planning for scheduled
maintenance, as well as greatly improve the speed with which
helpdesks and on-site support can provide assistance and reduce
expense - both in terms of soft (lost productivity) and hard
costs (number of helpdesk or on-site support employees required).

As a result of developing an asset management plan, Comdisco
maintains that organisations will be able to:

* Redesign key business processes for greater efficiency.
* Determine the optimal asset acquisition and disposal timing
strategies.
* Develop budgeting and forecasting strategies.
* Track software and hardware information.
* Set and maintain technology standards.

* Life-Cycle Management Services: The strategic management of
hardware and software from acquisition through disposal is key to
reducing costs and improving efficiencies. Areas to assess in
this regard include technology evaluation; equipment leasing and
technology refresh; EDI-based leasing and procurement; order
processing and fulfilment; configuration management and
installation; integration of software management tools; asset
identification, tagging and tracking; financial management
reporting; equipment redeployment, trade-ins and disposal

Actual procurement is a frequently overlooked area for
improvement. Creating purchase orders, invoice handling,
reconciliation and reporting procedures often are time-consuming
and inefficient. The price of this inefficiency can be quite
high. Standardisation of procurement can drastically reduce the
procurement time and cost.

For example, one of Comdisco's customers purchases more than
2,000 PCs a year, with equipment orders originating from multiple
locations.

Prior to implementing an asset management program, the process
followed a fairly tortuous route:

1. Order is received.
2. The purchasing department is contacted to determine the cost.
3. A formal appropriation is requested.
4. Multiple managers approve request.

Each of these steps consumed 15 minutes to an hour. This company
determined its cost to produce each appropriations request was
$185. Multiply that figure by 2,000 requests, and the total
annual cost was $370,000 - just to process paperwork.

Standardising the procurement process and implementing EDI
technology reduced the average cost to $10 per request.

* Managing Technology with Leasing: not surprisingly Comdisco
takes the line that leasing is an important asset management tool
that can help improve the administration, tracking and lifecycle
management of distributed equipment. In addition, leasing's
traditional benefits are equally important. It says leasing helps
protect against obsolescence by structuring planned technology
upgrades. It aids in the planning for the future disposal of
outdated desktop equipment at the time of acquisition, by taking
advantage of automatic planning for removal and disposal of
obsolete equipment. And it reduces the overall asset cost by
treating assets as operating, not capital, expenses.

In addition, a strategic approach to asset disposal ensures
maximum return on investment. Carefully planned timing, coupled
with a knowledge of the secondary equipment market, enables
organisations to take a long-term view of asset disposal. This,
it says, in conjunction with overall lifecycle management, helps
companies to select the acquisition approach that best suits
short and long-term financial management needs.

It could also help ensure that assets are upgraded and deployed
optimally throughout the organisation.

* Productivity Enhancement Services: Ongoing support and
maintenance are two of the largest hidden aspects of technology
use. Complicating this is the haphazard nature with which assets
are often acquired and configured. Comdisco has identified seven
critical components that must be addressed as part of an asset
management program:

* Managing the network planning and administration.
* Providing essential maintenance.
* Offering helpdesk support and on-site assistance.
* Training users.
* Developing applications.
* Managing installs, moves, adds and changes.

Two people that perform similar functions in proximity may have
totally different versions of PCs, operating systems and
applications. This diversity vastly complicates network planning
and administration, helpdesk and on-site assistance.

While standardisation is a necessary and obvious step, building
an IT asset data repository is crucial to manage the maintenance
of thousands of disparate items and to provide quick and
effective helpdesk support.

A data repository would allow managers instant access to asset
portfolio data - database information inquiries by equipment
type, location, serial numbers, stop dates, leasing history and
more. A company could then tell exactly where every hard drive,
modem and printer is located, the cost of each item and if it was
leased or purchased.

Training, frequently considered a luxury by many organisations,
can radically reduce annual support costs. Comdisco says it has
found that organisations with aggressive training programs can
cut these costs to as little as $400 per annum per user.

Those without education programs can suffer costs as high as
$8,000 per user per year. In an organisation with 1,000 users,
the difference in annual support costs between the two
organisations can be as high as $7.6 million. *

              DATA WAREHOUSE PROJECT ECONOMICS: I

Given the record of fiscally irresponsible delivery of even well-
understood IT projects, what hope is there for doing any better
on these new, particularly difficult implementations? And given
the investment size of a data warehouse, can we afford to
continue with past estimating practices?

Data warehouses are clearly perceived as providing tremendous
value. Industry attention has focused on the technology to the
point where the status of data warehouse projects has
dramatically changed from low-visibility, research experiments to
mainstream, strategic corporate initiatives.

A recent Meta Group survey of 450 companies has shown that as
many as 44% out of those surveyed either have a data warehouse in
production or pilot status. The same number plan to begin a data
warehouse project within the next year. Survey responses also
yielded the information that an average data warehouse project
will cost $3 million - just in its implementation, not including
the full lifecycle costs.

                    A QUESTION OF INVESTMENT

As a result of this change of status, and of the growing
awareness of the investment magnitude associated with data
warehousing, management is starting to demand much more careful
and well-substantiated answers to the question, 'What is the
business value of this investment?'

Although informational and decision-support databases have been
fairly common for at least two decades, there is relatively
little experience in the projection of the costs and benefits
that will be associated with producing a data warehouse system.
And these projects differ from other, more conventional IT
projects for several reasons:

* They frequently utilise new and often (within any one
organisation) untried technologies. Most data warehouse projects
are breaking new ground for the development team members,
requiring significant training and often long learning curves.
* Because of the relatively immature state of data warehousing
technology, vendor offerings are scattered and poorly integrated.
This usually necessitates utilising a number of heterogeneous
products and attempting a custom integration of them. History has
shown that a great deal of the expense and the risk of software
projects is to be found in such integration.
* By definition, data warehouses involve the integration of data
from disparate sources, often supplied by many departments and/or
professional disciplines. There is a likelihood that there will
be problems involving lack of consistent keys, conflicting data
element definitions, and a considerable amount of confusion on
the part of all involved parties regarding the purpose,
reliability and relevance of the data contributed by others.
* A major goal of many warehouse projects is to make data
available in new and innovative ways to the end-user community.
Yet this very availability is almost certain to reveal major
problems in the cleanliness and usability of the data.
Unfortunately, the lack of access to legacy databases - the very
sources of the data used to populate the data warehouse - has
served to conceal flaws in the initial concept of those
databases, as well as the nearly inevitable deviations from their
design and the 'standard' procedures used to load data into them.

Because data warehouses are a relatively new phenomenon, IT
developers have had little practice in estimating the costs,
benefits and the risk of these projects. Indeed, most past
estimates of IT developments appear to have been widely
inaccurate.

A report released by the Standish Group in late 1994 reported the
results of an ambitious survey into the experiences of large and
small companies in developing and delivering information
technology projects (see Figure 1). It showed that nearly all IT
projects are delivered late and significantly exceed their
budgets. Nearly a third of the projects are cancelled before they
are completed at all. Moreover, despite the tardy, over-budget
performance, projects were found typically to deliver less than
half of their originally promised functionality.

                     DATA WAREHOUSING COSTS

This two-part article will illustrate a means for developing a
meaningful cost-estimation model for a data warehouse project.

Part I deals with the costs, benefits and risks inherent in a
data warehouse project, drawing on lessons from past projects -
including both data warehouses and other IT projects. Then next
month, the second part will include discussions of the costs,
benefits, and risk involved in a 'typical' data warehouse
project, and go on to present a methodology for assessing data
warehouse projects, including an example analysis using a
'typical' data warehouse case.

In an earlier issue of Computer Finance (October 1995, pages 1-6:
Cashing in on the Data Warehouse?), an analysis was made of data
presented at a Gartner-organised conference on Strategic Data
Management, showing that the average budget for a data warehouse
implementation breaks roughly into thirds between hardware,
software and labour (including staff costs, systems integration
and external consultancy charges).

These costs represent the initial development costs for a data
warehouse, not including the ongoing support and maintenance that
it will require over its useful life. Over the full lifecycle,
these costs are likely to shift dramatically, discounting the
software and hardware costs in favour of labour and fee-based
(i.e. maintenance contract) charges.

Figure 2 illustrates this shift. It is important to realise that,
similar to most IT projects, the development and implementation
phases will only comprise about one-third of the total costs to
be incurred over the full life of the project. Thus, the right-
hand pie chart is a much more realistic assessment of the costs
to be expected in a typical data warehouse project.

                   CHARTING A HISTORY OF COSTS

Despite the characteristics that make data warehouse projects
riskier and more expensive than many other types of IT project,
there is still a great deal to be learned from a review of past
project performance, not just at the overall level, but at the
detailed level - examining good and bad estimates of individual
cost and benefit factors.

A chart of cost factors to be considered is presented opposite as
Table 1, and some aspects of this listing are worth considering
in a little more detail.

                        COMPUTER HARDWARE

Because of the large disk requirements and specialised database
tuning required, many companies choose to implement new hardware
to support the server requirements of their data warehouse
projects. Periodic upgrades to the hardware capacity can also be
anticipated as the inventory of historical information grows.

In the past, these costs have often subjected to a higher level
of management and purchasing scrutiny than other IT investments.
In many cases, estimates for the initial (i.e. first year)
hardware costs are based on firm quotations. Poor estimates for
future year hardware costs have often been hidden by
geometrically improving price-performance ratios.

                 NETWORK AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

Most data warehouse projects are undertaken utilising a client-
server approach to supplying data to the end-user. These projects
are heavily dependent on a reliable, high-speed network
infrastructure.

In many companies, estimates for these costs have been fairly
well estimated in the past. In marked contrast to many other IT
areas, an enterprise approach has often been taken, providing a
single unified network infrastructure with an integrated design
viewpoint. As a result, costs for incremental capacity have been
fairly well understood. Similarly to computer hardware, poor
estimates have often been overshadowed by rapidly decreasing
costs for commodity network bandwidth supply.

                         VENDOR SOFTWARE

Most data warehouse projects today are based on integration of
numerous vendor software products. Although there often is a
component of internal software development, vendor-provided
software usually will supply most of the overall functionality of
the proposed system.

Vendor software licensing costs comprise a significant part of
overall data warehouse project budgets. Estimates of these costs,
however, tend to focus on the two 'ends' of the system (i.e. the
database management system on the back end, and the end-user
interface tool at the front end) and discount the costs to be
incurred in the 'middle' (i.e. metadata management tools, copy
and replication tools, data scrubbing tools, etc).

As a result of this oversight, overall licensing budgets can
often underestimate overall costs by 20% to 50%.

It is important to include estimates of the small, inexpensive
software products (such as database connectivity software,
communications protocol stacks, etc.) installed on each of the
end-users' workstations.

It is easy to overlook costs for software items that cost $50 to
$150 per copy when estimating a large project. However, if this
software must be installed on each of, say, 1,000 end-user
workstations, it can become significant to the overall project
economics.

Historically the costs involved in licensing a specific vendor
software product have been fairly well estimated, largely as a
result of their prominence in the minds of management.

Terms and conditions of licensing agreements are typically
scrutinised by both legal and management staffs. A huge exception
to this assertion is in the area of vendor software maintenance
costs, which have traditionally been underestimated to a great
degree.

Since most data warehouse projects are highly dependent on
vendor-supplied software, it is reasonable to assume that they
will incur vendor software maintenance charges throughout their
full lifecycle. Yet these charges are among the worst estimates
that have been made historically. Most software maintenance
contracts call for maintenance fees to be assessed as a
percentage (usually between 12% and 18%) of current list price
for the software product. So the project budgets that have
included maintenance costs (sadly, many have not even considered
maintenance costs) generally have projected that percentage of
the software costs for each year of the project life. However,
this approach ignores three facts:

* The maintenance fee is based on list price, rather than
purchase price. Since many large companies purchase their
software at a discounted price, the maintenance charge may be a
much higher percentage of the actual purchase price.
* The maintenance is based on the current list price. If the
vendor raises the list price of the software over the next
several years (a common practice, particularly when the market
for a then-obsolete product becomes saturated, and maintenance
becomes the main revenue producer), the maintenance fees will
likewise increase.
* New functionality is often offered by the vendor, not as
upgrades to the base product, but as add-on products, with their
own list prices and maintenance commitments.

For these reasons, historical estimates of software maintenance
costs have often been only 20 to 30% of what they should have
been. Large budget overruns have often been incurred when source
code for a software product is acquired and then modified to
adapt the product to specific company needs. Although there is
nothing wrong with this approach, numerous problems can occur,
mostly related to maintenance and upgrade of the software.

The cost of training installers and administrators of the new
software products also needs to be accounted for. This can be
counted in terms of both its monetary cost (e.g. tuition, travel
and so on) and also in terms of time required (i.e. impact on the
project schedule) before the new products can be effectively
used.

Data warehouse projects generally require configuration of
vendor-supplied software. This process can be straightforward,
involving only a few hours or days of work. However, significant
costs and delays can be incurred when the process does not go as
planned. Problems in this area often require that specialists
(vendor technicians or consultants) visit the site, adding travel
expenses to the already high hourly or daily rates charged by
these experts. So it is reasonable to have worst case costs in
this category that are an order of magnitude higher than the
planned case.

                  INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

Although most of the functionality of the data warehouse will
probably be provided by vendor software products, the fragmented
nature of most vendors' offerings requires a significant amount
of custom software development and systems integration effort in
nearly all data warehouse implementations.

Despite its low-visibility nature, the cost of developing,
testing and implementing this software may prove to be a major
component of the overall project economics.

Despite the unenviable reputation of software developers for
providing late, over-budget results, an examination of many
projects shows that those projects noted as the worst performers
in this regard are usually those for which there were poor
project goals and specifications, or those for which the
specifications changed dramatically during the process of
developing the product.

The truth of the matter is that the project costs were often
fairly well estimated, based on the scope and expectations set at
the time the project was started. However, by the time the
project had been subjected to massive scope change, architectural
adjustments, functionality modifications and target platform
revisions, it should have been no surprise that the original
budget was exceeded - often by several hundred percent.

The bottom line in the subject of internal software development
estimates is really an issue of project and enterprise
management, rather than project economics. Without disciplined
change control and scope management, no estimating methodology
can have a hope of 'guessing' what may happen to a project after
its approval.

It is important to recognise that as problems occur in software
development, they are seldom solved by adding staff. In nearly
all cases, software development problems result in schedule
delays with a fairly constant staffing level. Thus, worst-case
scenarios should recognise that the effect of problems will be to
delay the delivery date, and consequently the date that benefits
will begin to be received.

Many studies have shown that full lifecycle costs of internally
developed software can be more than three times the development
costs. Yet many project economics evaluations have assumed that
these costs will be minimal, or ignore them altogether.

The previously-cited Standish Group survey noted that the
'successful' projects (i.e. the 69% that were not cancelled
before completion) provided only 42% of the originally-promised
features and functions.

Much of the work of 'completing' these systems will be passed on
to the 'maintenance' staff. Many systems have been in production
for years, before they provide all of their originally specified
capabilities. But the project budgets, and therefore economics
calculations include no provision for this 'maintenance', let
alone the bug fixes and upgrades expected as part of normal
maintenance.

Data warehouse projects can be fully expected to be as
maintenance intensive as the 'average' IT project. A realistic
assessment of the cost of staffing this function will be critical
to economic assessment of the proposed project.

                         ACCESS TO DATA

The whole purpose of many data warehouses is to provide
enterprise-oriented access to data that has up until now been
secreted in departmental systems, defying any but the most
determined attempts to integrate these 'private' databases. There
are many obstacles, many of them non-technical, that must be
overcome to effect this integration.

The first obstacle is a clear lack of management appreciation for
the difficulty and expense of surmounting the problem.
Unfortunately, poor or non-existent documentation, changing data
field definitions, poorly defined editing rules, inconsistent
'common' keys, poorly trained data entry staff, and so on, have
all combined to make data integration a difficult, time-consuming
and very expensive undertaking.

Data conversion, including standardisation of multiple coding
schemes and joining of heterogeneous schemas from the existing
'legacy' databases into the data warehouse shows similar
characteristics. Conversion plans often assume that the data in
the old systems is well understood and documented, but experience
has shown that even if the documentation is comprehensive, it
often does not reflect the reality of the data in the old
systems. The worst-case estimate for data conversion can and
often should be several hundred percent (or more) of the planned
case estimate.

There are several software tools on the market using rule-based
and neural-net technologies that help automate the integration
and conversion processes. However, the tools themselves are
expensive, and they require a significant amount of effort to
implement. These tools may play a key role in the success of a
data warehouse, however they will also comprise a substantial
fraction of the overall project cost.

Data warehouses require extensive data administration. Aaron
Zornes of the Meta Group, has irreverently dubbed the data
warehouse the Database Administrators' Full Employment Act. In
most cases, the source databases will remain in place, and their
data collection processes will not undergo any dramatic changes.
As a result, all of the problems noted for integration and
conversion are likely to remain throughout the life of the
warehouse. Project budgets should reflect the likely high labour
cost needed to maintain and administer the data contained in the
proposed warehouse.

                         ONGOING SUPPORT

New applications, whether data warehouses or any others, must be
supported. Users must be trained, documentation prepared, updated
and distributed, and helpdesk services provided. This support
must be provided not just at project startup, but over the life
of the product.

Many projects are undertaken with the assumption that support for
the new system will be handled by the existing end-user support
staff. This can only be true if one of the following assumptions
is true:

* The existing user support staff is overstaffed, and needs more
work to keep them busy.
* Supporting the new data warehouse, in addition to the
previously existing software products, is no more work than
supporting the existing software alone.
* Support for some of the existing software products will be
dropped, thus allowing more time for the staff to support the new
data warehouse.

In most cases, none of these assumptions are true. Project
economics assessments need to include the cost of providing this
critical component of successful project delivery.

                   THE BENEFITS OF WAREHOUSING

Clearly, successful implementation of a data warehouse can
provide tremendous benefits and these can be segmented into
tangible and intangible categories, based on the ability to
measure and/or audit their results in a financial context.

Benefit factors that should be considered are shown over the page
in Table 2. Once again, the fine detail of these issues is worth
exploring.

                       PERSONNEL REDUCTION

Historically, personnel reduction has been one of the only
quantitative benefits considered in justifying IT projects. Many
of the projects undertaken during the past three decades have
been on-line transaction processing systems, which automated many
clerical tasks, and substantially reduced the staff required for
these functions.

Unfortunately, many past claims of this sort have been made, yet
audits conducted a year or two after project completion show
little or no reduction in staff. The only explanation for this
discrepancy is often a vague claim that staff have been
displaced.

In a data warehousing scenario, the number of people whose jobs
could potentially be replaced by the new system is considerably
lower. In fact, in most companies, the only group likely to be
affected in this way is the staff of the information centre,
whose job it has been to prepare custom or semi-custom reports of
company information to satisfy requests from the end-user
community. If the data warehouse truly empowers end-users to find
and process their own data, then the IT staff may be reduced.

Even if the warehouse is only a limited success, the more
powerful tools in the hands of the IT staff may enhance their
productivity to the point where the staff could well be reduced
to some extent.

No matter what assumptions are made regarding personnel
reduction, with this and all other 'tangible' benefits, it is
important at the outset to have a plan for measuring the
magnitude of the benefit that was in fact derived from the
implementation of the data warehouse.

                         COST AVOIDANCE

Since a strong case has been made for explicitly including all
costs associated with developing the data warehouse, including
all of the supporting infrastructure (computer hardware,
networking, software maintenance and so on), it is legitimate to
accept credit for avoiding costs that would have been incurred if
the project had not been undertaken.

For example, if implementation of the data warehouse will move
significant amounts of processing from a mainframe system to a
dedicated midrange computer, or result in the avoidance of
purchasing additional disk storage in the data centre, it would
be acceptable to claim those incremental positive changes as
benefits.

The important point is that the benefits claimed must truly be
incremental, and attributable directly to the effects of the
project. Given that many data warehouse projects involve
migration of processing and reporting to lower- cost platforms,
this may be an important component of the financial justification
of the project.

                      END-USER PRODUCTIVITY

Numerous studies have shown that professional employees spend
about 60% of their time looking for data, reformatting data, re-
keying data, transferring data files, etc. In other words, they
spend three days of every five-day week doing clerical activities
- all related to accessing data. They spend another 20% of their
time on vacation, holidays, training, etc. This leaves a final
20% - just one day per week to do the job that they are actually
employed to do.

The obvious inference here is that if a data warehouse can truly
empower end-users' access to data, it should be possible to
dramatically change the time allocations for professional
employees. If they can only spend two days per week, instead of
three, looking for data, they can spend the extra day on
professional work, effectively doubling the productivity of the
entire professional staff. This is a powerful incentive.

However, to assess data warehouse project economics based on this
benefit, it would be necessary to audit staff productivity after
the warehouse is delivered. Assuming an enterprise-wide doubling
of professional staff productivity is virtually guaranteed to
produce spectacular predicted economics for almost any proposed
project. But to invoke this benefit, there is a need to back it
up once the project is completed.

                   ON THE INTANGIBLE BENEFITS

Many of the benefits claimed for data warehouse projects are
intangible. They can be characterised as benefits to the
performance of the enterprise as a whole, and as such are nearly
impossible to measure. However, the following assertions can be
made and defended without too much trouble:

* IT is an integral part of success in most enterprises today.
* If an enterprise improves its performance, improved decision-
making based on good information was probably a contributing
factor.
* A data warehouse will provide better access to good
information.

Given each of these assertions, it is clear that improved
financial performance after the implementation of a data
warehouse can be at least partly attributed to the presence and
use of the warehouse to support the better decisions that led to
that improved performance. But how much?

No doubt, line management will dispute any claims of 100% of the
improvement being attributed to the data warehouse; after all, it
was the managers' decisions, not the presence of the data that
improved the business performance. Yet the assertions showed that
it must be some amount. How much? It is right to claim 5% of the
improvement as a benefit of the data warehouse? Or 50%? How can
it be estimated?

This is an important issue which will usually overshadow all of
the tangible benefits combined. In many cases, intangible as it
may be, benefits of this type are the reason the project was
begun in the first place.

Although it may not be possible to quantify them, it is still
important to be aware of several distinct categories of
intangible benefits that may apply to a particular data warehouse
project. (Two alternate methodologies for dealing with their
economic impact will be presented and discussed next month.)

                       REVENUE ENHANCEMENT

Data warehouses can contribute appreciably to the overall
financial performance of an enterprise. Many recent publications
have extolled the virtues of data warehouses in terms of
supporting improved decision-making, more efficient purchasing,
tighter inventory control, better targeted marketing, etc.

It is important to understand the project goals before starting
the project, so that project decision-makers can consider the
economic impact of the project proposal in the correct
perspective.

                    IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE

Access to a data warehouse can greatly improve customer service,
allowing employees to quickly check all of the company
information regarding a customer during the course of a single
contact, either face-to-face or over the telephone. This may
include previous orders, catalogue mailings, prior payment
history, account balances, outstanding loans, household
characteristics, demographic information, and many other
industry-specific data elements.

                IMPROVED PRODUCT/SERVICE QUALITY

In the manufacturing sector, product quality has taken on much
increased importance in the past two decades. Implementation of
quality information systems has produced enormous databases,
particularly in the computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM)
environment.

These databases are usually closely integrated with (and tuned
for) their data collection systems. Data warehouses can create a
viable access method for processing and statistically analysing
this data, without adversely impacting production line system
performance. The economic impacts of providing manufacturing
personnel with timely access to this data can have profound
impact on overall product quality.

                      COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Within each industry, there are specific characteristics that
provide companies with a competitive advantage over their
competitors. Data warehouse projects are not generic. They can
and should be targeted to provide functionality specific to a
particular company's needs.

Whether this is managing product inventory in manufacturing
plants, providing a rapid response to customer orders, developing
superior retail store layouts, or a host of other
differentiators, the results of effective utilisation of the data
warehouse may lead to spectacular business success.

                ENHANCED TECHNOLOGICAL REPUTATION

Some companies will be very interested in how a project or series
of projects affects the price of their stock. A high stock price
is particularly valuable to a company that is considering
acquisitions, especially if the purchase is to be acquired for
stock, rather than for cash.

Stock prices may reflect a high price/earnings (PE) ratio when a
company is considered to have a technology infrastructure that
exceeds those in the rest of its industry sector. This higher PE
is justified by the other intangibles mentioned earlier.

                        A QUALIFIED RISK?

The subject of risk is one which has been largely ignored in
planning IT projects in general. Because of their nature and the
immaturity of the concept, data warehouse projects are
considerably riskier than most 'conventional' IT projects.

The risks inherent in a data warehouse project can be categorised
into factor risk and lifecycle risk.

Factor risk is the risk associated with each of the cost and
benefit categories defined earlier. Costs may be greater than
estimated or less than estimated, as a result of either an
imperfect understanding of the problem or environmental changes
(e.g. price-performance improvements, vender pricing behaviour,
etc). Within reasonable limits, the individual factors are fairly
independent of each other, although taken to extremes it is
unlikely that massive cost overruns will result in greater than
expected benefits, or vice versa.

Lifecycle risks can be categorised into technical risk (e.g.
technological, cost and project management uncertainties),
management risk (e.g. staffing and budgeting) and client risk
(e.g. client goals, funding and support).

Put bluntly, technical risk is the risk that the project will be
never be completed. Management risk is the risk that the budget
or staff will be cut and the new system cannot be supported in
the new environment. Client risk is the risk that the product
works well, but the clients' business goals change so much that
the system is obsolete before its lifecycle is completed. As we
will see next month, each of these types of risk affects the
project as a whole - as well as the individual cost and benefit
factors. *

                         NEWS ANALYSIS

           SHIFT TO SINGLE EURO CURRENCY TO STRETCH IT

Emergence of the 'euro' and the subsequent shift to a single
European currency could cost larger UK banks up to #40 million in
development costs, a new discussion paper released by Hoskyns has
proposed.

A typical bank has dozens of separate systems in operation and
the move to EMU will require a rewrite or enhancement decision
for every system in a bank's portfolio, the report warns, adding
that the necessary changes could severely stretch already
depleted financial sector IT staff resources.

After the cuts of recent years, there is little spare capacity,
concludes the report on European Monetary Union: Some IT Supply
Side Issues.

UK banks are formidable employers of IT staff, spending an
estimated #1,850 million a year on internal staff costs.

The costs of the changes provoked by EMU is likely to add another
#124 a year for three years.

'Banks do not staff for peaks, a one-off effort of the sort
represented by EMU will be met largely by external resources',
Hoskyns contends in its analysis.

Whether the UK services industry could cope with the demand is
another matter, however.

The likely timetable for EMU gives a broad indication of
sequencing of software changes.

Wholesale banking and payments systems will need to be EMU-
capable before retail-oriented systems.

As the retail systems will involve the greatest change, effort is
likely to be concentrated towards the end of the EMU process
rather than spread evenly across three years.

If 70% of the total effort fell in the final year of a three-year
migration, that would represent almost 40% of the banking
industry's current expenditure on external IT resources.

An uplift of this scale would probably exceed supply-side
capabilities.

           TELEWORKER ECONOMIES FAIL TO ATTRACT FIRMS

Just one in 20 UK firms are said to employ staff that
'telecommute', or work remotely at home using modems and Internet
gateways to link into corporate databases, networks and
electronic messaging systems.

Despite reported cost savings and supposed productivity
improvements, the much expected breakthrough with teleworking is
surprisingly long overdue.

A study carried out by researchers at Warwick University for the
Economic and Social Research Council came to the conclusion that
the average saving being made by corporates who use teleworkers
runs at between #1,500 and #3,000 a year.

This is about the same as the initial cost of #3,500 or so needed
to set up each teleworker with all the necessary facilities. So
after the first year, the arrangement would start to offer a
return - namely reduced office costs.

On productivity, the suggestion has been made that teleworkers
work better and are more reliable than office-based staff. They
also save an average of 480 hours a year commuting.

              A NEW LEASE OF LIFE FOR THE DESKTOP?

Dubbed 'an IT finance scheme with built-in flexibility', Life
Cycle from the #264 million leasing and support group of P&P is a
new lease scheme aimed at arresting the escalating expense of
desktop assets.

The company maintains there is a desperate need for more flexible
approaches to computer leasing. Leasing frees capital but can
prove too restrictive where technology is changing fast, it says.
What is missing is the flexibility to upgrade desktop equipment
without having to budget for a large capital outlay. Its new
lease scheme offers flexibility on two counts, P&P claims.

Where there is a need to preserve capital expenditure, Life Cycle
can be scheduled to operate as an operating lease, with residual
investment so that payments are met from expenditure budgets.

Alternatively, where there is a budget shortfall, it can be
structured as a step-lease to preserve cash flow during the
initial months of a contract term. There is also a built-in
upgrade path to provide flexibility in the acquisition or new
systems or the upgrade of existing assets - there is, however, a
need to agree swap-outs in advance.

Additionally, there is an option for built-in support, so
allowing some of the on-going variable costs of installation,
maintenance, software distribution or training to be converted to
a fixed overhead.

Equally, P&P says certain asset control routines can be included
into the scheme, such as the production of desktop inventory
reports.

            LACK OF CONFIDENCE REVEALED IN COST DATA

A poll of US executives has shown as many as 26% do not have
confidence in the accuracy of the cost data in their systems.

According to the survey by Lawson, the financial software house,
the quality of financial information is poor because there is too
much reliance on systems that are based on ledger-based
accounting methods.

BORLAND SAYS CONGRESS
CHOSE TO PROTECT ONLY
CODE, NOT FUNCTIONALITY

     In enacting copyright protection for computer programs,
Congress sought to prohibit only the literal copying of code and
specifically allowed the creation of programs that perform the
same function, as long as the code of each program is original,
Borland International argued in its Dec. 8 brief to the U.S.
Supreme Court.  Lotus Development Corp. v. Borland International,
No. 94-2003 (U.S.); see Computer Industry Litigation Reporter,
Dec. 21, 1995.

     If Lotus's position is adopted as law, Borland contends,
there will be "potentially calamitous consequences for the
software industry in the United States" because the industry
depends on the ability of different programs to be compatible and
work "on top" of each other.

     Oral argument is scheduled for Monday, Jan. 8, at 1 p.m.

     Lotus Development Corp. sued Borland International over
Borland's use of the menu command tree of the Lotus 1-2-3
spreadsheet in its competing line of Quattro Pro spreadsheet
software.  Use of the menu tree was necessary for Lotus users to
import their data into Quattro Pro.  The district court in Boston
ruled in favor of Lotus, but the First Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals reversed, finding the command tree is an uncopyrightable
method of operation.  The Supreme Court agreed to review the
case, the first time it will rule on copyright protection for
software.

     Lotus's argument that the menu tree and the program are
indistinguishable must be rejected, Borland argues.

     "As a matter of economics," Borland says, "copyright
protection for source and object code blocks only one of a
virtually unlimited number of ways of achieving the same 'certain
results'; copyright protection for these 'certain results,' such
as a menu command hierarchy, potentially creates vast market
power likely to chill further innovation."

     When Congress decided that computer programs should be
copyrightable, its main concern was stopping the illegal
duplication of software on floppy disks, Borland argues.
Congress clearly chose to exclude things like the Lotus menu tree
from protection, but even if congressional intent was ambiguous,
protection of these "external features" would violate the chief
intent of the copyright law, which is to promote the public good,
Borland argues.

     "Lotus's menu command hierarchy may well constitute
patentable subject matter," Borland states.  "But Lotus bases its
claim on the law of copyright, not patent.  Lotus's argument
ignores the important policies and procedures of the patent law,
reads important limiting language out of the copyright statute,
and refuses even to acknowledge that its proposed extension of
the scope of copyright must 'ultimately serve the public good,'
as this Court has so often counseled."

     Borland is represented by Gary L. Reback, Michael Barclay,
Susan A. Creighton, Colleen Bal and Lisa A. Davis of Wilson,
Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, CA; by Peter E. Gelhaar
and Katherine L. Parks of Donnelly, Conroy & Gelhaar in Boston;
and by house counsel Robert H. Kohn.

LAW PROFESSORS URGE
AFFIRMANCE OF RULING

     In separate amicus briefs, numerous copyright law professors
are supporting Borland's arguments seeking affirmance of the
First Circuit's ruling.

     In one filing, 34 professors reiterate Borland's contention
that copyright law excludes protection for systems and methods of
operation.

     "Unlike conventional literary works, computer programs
contain many components that are potentially patentable," the
professors state.  "It is, thus, appropriate for courts to filter
out not only abstractions, but also constituent elements of
useful processes and methods of operation before making a
comparison of two computer programs for the purpose of
determining whether infringement has occurred."

     "If computer programs need more protection against
competitive imitation than copyright, supplemented by patent and
trade secrecy law, can provide, software developers should seek
additional legal protection for computer programs from Congress,"
the professors said.

     The professors' brief was filed by Pamela Samuelson of
Cornell Law School in Ithaca, NY.

     In a separate brief, copyright law professors Peter S.
Menell of the University of California at Berkeley and Dennis S.
Karjala of Arizona State University point out that the copyright
statute distinguishes between computer program instructions and
what results from the execution of the instructions.  The
copyright in the instructions themselves " the code " does not
extend to the program's output unless that output independently
qualifies as a copyrightable work, the professors argue.

     The menu command hierarchy does not qualify, the professors
state, because it is a method of operation that is excluded under
Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act.

     "[T]o extend copyright by protecting functional works
without explicit congressional authorization would undermine the
integrity of the entire intellectual property law system," they
said.

TWO MEN AGREE TO PAY
$600,000 TO SETTLE
INFRINGEMENT SUIT

     Two men who operated a computer bulletin board system agreed
in early December to pay Sega of America $600,000 to settle a
lawsuit alleging that users of the BBS were able to obtain
illegal copies of Sega video games.  Sega of America v. The
Ghetto, No. 93-CV-4261 (ND CA).

     Sega filed suit in December 1993 against The Ghetto, a BBS
run by two California men, Marqui Labatore and Kurtis Buckmaster.
The suit alleged that the men obtained copies of Sega video games
and then allowed BBS members to either pay a fee to download the
games, or provide copies of other games in exchange for download
rights.

     Among the games allegedly copied were Golden Axe, Jurassic
Park, Sonic Spinball and Shining Force.  The games were
originally produced for use with the Sega video game system and
were modified for use on personal computers.

     Sega learned of the infringing activity after receiving an
anonymous tip.  An investigator then logged onto The Ghetto and
recorded the activities taking place there.

     Sega was represented by Neal A. Smith and Jane Quale Keene
of Limbach & Limbach in San Francisco.  The defendants were
represented by James M. Braden of Arnelle Hastie McGee Willis &
Greene in San Francisco.

11TH CIR. FINDS JURY
INSTRUCTIONS IMPROPER,
REMANDS SOFTWARE CASE

     A federal judge erred when he told a jury it should filter
out only the copying of nonliteral elements of a computer program
in determining whether infringement occurred, a panel of the 11th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 22, remanding the suit
for a new trial.  Bateman et al. v. Mnemonics Inc. et al.,
No. 93-3234 (11th Cir.).

     The judge also failed to properly instruct the jury on the
law as it relates to copying necessitated by compatibility
requirements, the panel said.

     Plaintiffs Brian E. Bateman and Charles H. Fricker created
the single board computer operating system (SBCOS), hardware
logic diagrams for their circuit board, and certain programmable
array logic software.  The lawsuit " alleging copyright
infringement, unfair competition and theft of trade secrets "
resulted from a complicated series of licensing agreements
entitling the defendants to use the software and diagrams.  The
defendants are accused of developing similar software after
having access to the plaintiffs' technology.

     A jury awarded the plaintiffs a total of $525,000 on their
claims.  The defendants appealed the verdict, raising numerous
alleged errors.  The plaintiffs appealed the trial judge's
refusal to award exemplary damages.

     The panel first said the jury was improperly instructed to
filter out only the copying of nonliteral elements of the
plaintiffs' software, which could have left the jury with the
erroneous belief that any copying of literal elements was
copyright infringement as a matter of law.

     Although Computer Associates v. Altai, the case the Second
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals used to develop the "abstraction-
filtration-comparison" test, involved alleged copying of
nonliteral elements of a computer program, the panel said, a
similar analysis must be performed on alleged copying of literal
elements as well, in order to eliminate unprotectable expression
prior to comparison with an allegedly infringing work.  (For
Computer Associates, see Computer Industry Litigation Reporter,
July 2, 1992, P. 15,135.)

     The panel also found that the trial judge should have, but
did not, instruct the jury on the legal consequences of copying
that is necessitated by the need for a program to be compatible
with other programs, such as operating system software.  The
plaintiffs alleged copying of certain interface specifications
that allowed their software to work with other programs.  The
defendants countered that the copying was necessary in order to
achieve compatibility.

     The panel said that interface specifications could be
protectable under copyright law, but also said that external
considerations such as compatibility requirements could limit or
eliminate such protection.  The panel did not decide whether the
alleged copying constituted infringement, instead remanding the
case to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Florida for a new trial.

JUDGE APPROVES SETTLEMENT
IN SUIT OVER SONGS COPIED
FROM COMPUSERVE DATABASE

     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern District
of New York on Dec. 19 approved the settlement in Frank Music
Corp.'s class action alleging online music copyright infringement
by CompuServe Inc., due to subscribers' uploading and downloading
copyrighted songs without paying royalties.  Frank Music Corp. v.
CompuServe Inc., No. 93 Civ. 8153 JFK (SD NY); see Computer
Industry Litigation Reporter, Nov. 16, 1995.

     The Dec. 19 order calls for CompuServe to pay $568,000 to
the Harry Fox Agency (HFA) " most to be distributed to class
plaintiffs who are HFA principals " and the creation of a
licensing agreement for online "forum" managers to upload and
download recordings of copyrighted songs.  HFA provides music
licensing and royalty collection services to more than 12,000
music publisher-principals.  The class action was filed by a
class of 384 music publishers, alleging infringement of 941
musical compositions.

     CompuServe, a wholly owned subsidiary of H&R Block Group,
Inc., maintains a computer bulletin board system that includes
literary, graphic and musical databases.  CompuServe grants
access to its bulletin board to its paid subscribers, who use a
modem and their own personal computers to upload (put into the
bulletin board) literary, graphic and musical material chosen by
subscribers, and select and download these same materials.  Each
subscriber pays a monthly fee plus a charge for the amount of
time he or she is connected to the bulletin board.

     The complaint alleged that CompuServe allowed and encouraged
subscribers to upload copyrighted songs, stored the unauthorized
recordings, and allowed subscribers to download copies of the
recordings.  The complaint sought $100,000 for each of the more
than 690 alleged acts of infringement.

     A settlement agreement was announced Nov. 7, and individual
plaintiffs had until Dec. 12 to opt out.  Edward P. Murphy,
president of the National Music Publishers' Association,
financial supporter of the case, said the settlement would assure
just compensation for the use of musical works in new
technologies.

     The plaintiffs were represented by Alan L. Shulman of
Silverman & Shulman, P.C. in New York City.

GREENLEAF SEEKS RULING
THAT SOFTWARE DOES NOT
INFRINGE AMA'S RIGHTS

     Software that uses medical data to determine a patient's
degree of impairment does not infringe the American Medical
Association's copyrights in its Guides to Evaluation of Permanent
Impairment, plaintiff Greenleaf Medical Systems Inc. contends in
a declaratory judgment complaint filed Dec. 1 in federal court in
San Jose.  Greenleaf Medical Systems Inc. v. American Medical
Association, No. C-95 20820 (ND CA).

     Although Greenleaf used portions of the Guides, including
tables, charts and algorithms, in its software, the portions it
copied are not protectable by copyright, Greenleaf contends.

     The Guides, whose use is mandated in at least 30 states,
allow physicians to express patients' impairment ratings in a
standard way.  Greenleaf developed a system in which its products
can send data directly to a computer, which will use Greenleaf's
software to calculate an impairment rating.  Greenleaf used the
formulas, methods and algorithms contained in the Guides, and
Greenleaf expressly encourages customers to purchase copies of
the Guides to use in conjunction with the software, the complaint
states.

     According to the complaint, Greenleaf asked the AMA whether
a license was required for Greenleaf to use the information in
the Guides in its software, and was told no license was
necessary.  However, the complaint states, the AMA later
threatened to sue Greenleaf unless the company entered into a
license agreement and paid back royalties.

     Greenleaf contends that the AMA's copyright in the Guides is
invalid because the individual AMA members who authored the
various sections own the copyrights to their work.  Greenleaf
also asserts that the sections its used are uncopyrightable
because the expression is inseparable from the underlying idea,
and because the expression is standard in the medical community.
Greenleaf also raises affirmative defenses of fair use, waiver,
laches, estoppel and unclean hands.

     Greenleaf is represented by Ian N. Feinberg and Janet M.
Craycroft of Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich in Palo Alto, CA; and
by James R. Kyper and Stephen S. Wu of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart in
Pittsburgh.

MOTOROLA ALLEGES
COPYING OF TWO-WAY
RADIO SOFTWARE

     Software that runs two-way radio systems sold by Motorola
has been illegally modified by defendants who are selling the
modified programs to third parties who can then obtain
unauthorized access to emergency services' radio frequencies,
Motorola alleges in a suit filed Nov. 21 in Tulsa federal court.
Motorola Inc. v. Gass et al., No. 95 C 11560 (ND OK).

     Motorola sells a variety of two-way radio communications
systems, both "trunking" and "nontrunking" systems, which are
used by law enforcement and emergency services organizations.
"Trunking" systems automatically set the radios in use to an
available frequency and avoid the problem of "jamming," which
occurs when radios that are too near each other attempt to use
the same frequency at the same time.  The radio systems are
controlled by Motorola's proprietary software.

     According to the complaint, defendants Larry Nathan Gass,
John David Astacio, Tulsa Security Patrol and Action Helicopters
have illegally modified the Motorola software to allow
individuals other than legitimate Motorola customers to use the
radio systems.

     These third-party purchasers of the modified systems believe
they are purchasing genuine Motorola products, Motorola alleges,
resulting in damage to the company's reputation.  In addition,
according to the complaint, charges accrued through use of the
modified systems are wrongly billed to legitimate customers or
are simply absorbed by Motorola, the company alleges.  The
defendants' actions also risk overloading the airwaves in the

MICROSOFT OPPOSES AVI'S
APPEAL OF PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION DENIAL

     A federal court did not abuse its discretion or act
improperly when it refused to enter a preliminary injunction
against Microsoft in a trademark dispute over Microsoft's use of
the three-letter suffix "AVI" in file names in its Windows 95
software, Microsoft argued in a Dec. 13 brief to the Ninth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  AVI Systems Inc. v. Microsoft,
No. 95-16577 (9th Cir.); see Computer Industry Litigation
Reporter, Dec. 21, 1995.
               AVI Systems designs, develops and distributes computer
hardware and software products.  According to the complaint,
AVI's president and CEO, plaintiff Joseph Shamash, obtained
registration with the Patent and Trademark Office of the mark
"AVI" for use in connection with the company's products.  The
complaint alleges that Microsoft then contacted AVI and asked
permission to use the AVI mark for its Windows video software,
known as "Audio Video Interleaved."  Despite AVI's denying
permission, Microsoft proceeded to use the mark, the complaint
states.  AVI sought a preliminary injunction, which was denied by
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

     AVI claims the district court erred in holding that the
plaintiffs were not likely to establish likelihood of consumer
confusion and would therefore be unable to prevail, and that
Microsoft was likely to establish a "fair use" defense.

     "The essence of AVI Systems' argument is that it disagrees
with the weight that the district court gave to some of the
evidence, it disagrees with the district court's evaluation of
the credibility of its chief witness, and it disagrees with the
interpretation the district court gave the evidence it did find
believable," Microsoft states.  "These are the very matters that
are left to a trial court's discretion.  The district court did
not commit clear error or abuse its considerable discretion."

     Microsoft also contends the appeal is moot because Windows
95 has already been released, and there are no related products
anticipated to be released before the case is resolved on the
merits.

     Microsoft is represented by David T. McDonald of McDonald &
Quackenbush in Seattle; Rebecca A. Lenaburg of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown & Enersen in San Francisco; and by house counsel Thomas W.
Burt.

PATENT CLAIM CONSTRUCTION
IS A MATTER OF LAW,
WESTVIEW TELLS SUP. CT.

     The use of extrinsic evidence in the interpretation of
patent claims does not automatically transform the issue from one
of law to one of fact, Westview Instruments Inc. argued in its
Dec. 10 response brief to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Markman et al.
v. Westview Instruments Inc. et al., No. 95-26 (U.S.); see
Computer Industry Litigation Reporter, Oct. 19, 1995.

     The court has set oral arguments in the case for Jan. 8.

     Westview urged the Supreme Court to affirm the landmark en
banc ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(CAFC) that the construction of patent claims in a jury trial of
patent infringement litigation is a matter of law for judges to
decide and not an issue of fact for juries to determine.


     Herbert Markman, the inventor of a patented system for
controlling the inventory in dry cleaning stores, sued Westview
for patent infringement in U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania.  At trial, the central issue was
whether the word "inventory," which was not defined in the patent
claims, covered only a system for tracking garments or whether it
could be construed to include the tracking of monetary
transactions as well.

     The trial judge had instructed the jury to determine the
meaning of the disputed claim language.  However, after the jury
returned a verdict of infringement on two claims, he ruled that
claim construction is a matter of law for the court to decide and
he granted a j.m.o.l. of noninfringement.

     In April, the Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the
lower court ruling that the trial court has the power to
determine claim language even when extrinsic evidence is required
to clarify the meaning of a claim.  Markman sought review on the
grounds that the Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to have
juries determine the meaning of patent terms.

Seventh Amendment

     In its response brief, Westview contended that the
historical record supports the proposition that judges, not
juries, construe claim language.  The Seventh Amendment, the
petition said, was intended to protect the right to a jury trial
on issues of substance, not on matters of form and procedure.
The drafters of the Bill of Rights included the Seventh Amendment
to preserve the institution of the jury, not to define the roles
of judge and jury in cases where the right to jury trial is
preserved, Westview asserted.

     "Petitioners have confused the more common inquiry, whether
the jury trial right attaches to a particular cause of action,
with the less common inquiry involved here of whether a
particular issue in a jury trial is for the court or the jury,"
the brief stated.

     Westview also argued that the Supreme Court has consistently
held since 1825 that claim construction is a matter of law, even
when extrinsic evidence is used to aid in interpreting disputed
claims.  Citing Winans v. New York and Erie R.R. Co., 62 U.S.
(21 How.) 88 (1859), Westview noted that the Supreme Court held
then that a judge may seek information from expert witnesses to
explain terms of the art, but that the court itself is the final
authority on the meaning of a patent claim.

     Finally, Westview contended that the Federal Circuit's
ruling advances patent law policies by promoting specific and
clear claims and consistent interpretation while leaving to the
jury the traditional and central role of determining the
underlying facts.

     Westview's response brief was filed by Frank H. Griffin III,
Peter A. Vogt and Polly M. Shaffer of Gollatz, Griffin & Ewing,
Philadelphia.  Markman is represented by William B. Mallin,
Timothy P. Ryan and Timothy S. Coon of Eckert Seamans Cherin &
Mellot, Pittsburgh.

ATARI CLAIMS BREACH OF
CONTRACT IN DEVELOPMENT
OF 'BATMAN', OTHER GAMES

     Atari Corp. entered into several agreements with two
companies for development and licensing of video games, but the
companies have failed to perform all but one contract, Atari
alleges in a complaint filed Dec. 21 in California Superior Court
in San Jose.  Atari Corp. v. Probe Entertainment et al.,
No. CV754749 (CA Super. Ct., Santa Clara Cty.).

     The suit seeks a declaratory judgment as to Atari's rights
under the contracts, which were for the development, licensing
and/or distribution of Batman Forever, Mortal Kombat 3, Frank
Thomas "Big Hurt" Baseball, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, and
Ironman.

     The defendants are Probe Entertainment Ltd., a British
corporation, and Acclaim Entertainment Inc., a New York company.
According to the complaint, Atari entered into contracts with
Probe for development of Batman Forever and Mortal Kombat 3, and
contracted with Acclaim for licensing rights to Batman Forever
and distribution rights to the baseball, basketball and Ironman
games.  Atari and Acclaim also entered into a payment agreement,
the complaint states.

     "Under those agreements," the complaint states, "Atari has
paid Probe $420,000 and Acclaim $500,000 for a total of $920,000.
However, only Basketball has been completed, while Batman has
been canceled, Baseball has been stalled, and Probe has
effectively stopped work on MK3.  Given Atari's poor experience
with Probe and Acclaim, Atari can no longer continue development
of these products."

     The complaint contains counts for breach of contract,
rescission, interference with contract, and declaratory relief.
In addition to the declaration of the parties' rights, the
complaint seeks damages, pre- and post-judgment interest at 10%
annually, and attorneys' fees.

     Atari is represented by Ardon W. Beene of San Jose.

DEFENDANTS SEEK SUMMARY
JUDGMENT, STAY OF FOIA
SUIT OVER CRYPTOGRAPHY

     Defendants in a suit over disclosure of information on
export controls on cryptography on Dec. 1 asked a federal judge
in San Jose to stay the litigation while they attempt to process
the plaintiff's requests under the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA).  Gilmore v. State Department et al., No. C-95-1098 FMS
(ND CA); see Computer Industry Litigation Reporter, Aug. 3, 1995.

     The motion also seeks dismissal of certain defendants who
argue they do not have any records responsive to the plaintiff's
FOIA requests.

     Cryptography is a branch of mathematics used to scramble
electronic communications so that they cannot be understood by
anyone who does not have the correct "key" to decode them.
Plaintiff John Gilmore, a member of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation's board of directors, claims that numerous government
agencies have unlawfully denied or delayed responding to his
requests under the FOIA for information about export controls on
cryptography.

     Named as defendants are the State Department, the Justice
Department, the Commerce Department, the National Security
Council, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Office of Legal Counsel, Office of Information
and Privacy, Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, Interpol,
Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, Bureau of Export
Administration and Office of Defense Trade Controls.

     According to the defendants, the Office of Intelligence and
Policy Review, INTERPOL-U.S. National Central Bureau and
Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys all conducted "reasonable
searches" for documents in response to Gilmore's request, and
found none.  Therefore, according to the defendants, the court
lacks jurisdiction over these defendants and claims against them
must be dismissed.

     "Other defendants " [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and
[Office of Legal Counsel] " have completed the processing of
documents that they found responsive to plaintiff's FOIA
request," the defendants assert.  "State [Department] and
[National Security Agency], however, have been faced with
enormous and unforeseeable strains on their information
processing resources, and due to the increasing difficulty of
processing information requests, and the limited resources
available to them, these defendants have not been able to
complete the processing of plaintiff's requests within the 10-day
statutory time frame.  Because these defendants are faced with
'extraordinary circumstances' and are 'exercising due diligence'
in processing the requests, they seek a stay of proceedings
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Section 552(a)(6)(C) to complete their
processing of plaintiff's requests."

     "Similarly, while the [National Security Council] is not an
agency subject to the FOIA, it too is deluged with requests for
information which likewise strain its ability to respond to them
pursuant to its discretionary disclosure policy," the defendants
contend.

     Gilmore is represented by Lee Tien of Berkeley, CA.  The
government is represented by  Frank W. Hunger, Assistant Attorney
General; Michael J. Yamaguchi, U.S. Attorney; Mary Beth Uitti,
Chief of the Justice Department's Civil Division; and Elizabeth
A. Pugh and Felicia L. Chambers, Justice Department attorneys.

JUDGE FINDS CONTINUED PILL
USE NO BREACH WHERE PROXY
TO OUST BOARD NOT BARRED

     The board of Wallace Computer Service, Inc. did not breach
its duty by refusing to defuse its poison pill defense against
hostile suitor Moore Corp. Ltd., because it is nondiscriminatory
and will have no effect on the success of Moore's pending proxy
contest against the board, a federal judge in Wilmington held
Dec. 4.  Moore Corp. Ltd. et al. v. Wallace Computer Services,
Inc. et al., No. 95-472 (D DE).

     Senior U.S. District Judge Murray Schwartz declined Moore's
request to enjoin the use of the pill, but he also turned down
Wallace's counterclaim bid for a preliminary injunction based on
the assertion that an acquisition by Moore would violate federal
antitrust laws.

     The litigation arose from an attempt by Moore and its wholly
owned subsidiary, FRDK, Inc., to launch a tender offer for
Wallace.  Moore, filing suit less than 24 hours after it
announced the offer, sought to prevent the application of
Wallace's anti-takeover measures, such as a poison pill, the
Delaware Business Combination Act (which impedes certain mergers
without the affirmative vote of 80% of the outstanding shares),
and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (which
delays the consummation of a merger that is not approved by the
incumbent board).

     Moore sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the
defendant directors from implementing their anti-takeover devices
" mainly a poison pill that presented the most serious obstacle
to the consummation of its tender offer.  Wallace counterclaimed
that Moore's offer, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of
the Clayton Act.

     Judge Schwartz noted that since the preliminary injunction
hearing during Nov. 7 to 9, he had been "carpet bombed" with a
"salmagundi" of documents.
               The court found first that although the board's adoption of
a golden parachute and the amendment of the company bylaws to
require a longer advance notice period for shareholder proposals
were not defensive measures, the failure to redeem the poison
pill must be judged under the enhanced scrutiny test of Unocal
(Unocal v. Mesa Petroleum Co., DE Sup. Ct. 493 A.2d 946 [1985]).
Even under that more demanding test, however, the use of the pill
to fend off what the board in good faith believed to be an
inadequate offer was reasonable and proportionate, the court
held.

     The use of the pill is not coercive or preclusive because,
"[f]irst, retention of the pill will have no discriminatory
effect on shareholders, as is generally the result in any
situation involving a coercive offer," the court wrote.  "Second,
and more important, retention of the pill will have no effect on
the success of the proxy contest."

     Plaintiffs are represented by Jesse Finkelstein and Daniel
Driesbach of Richards, Layton & Finger in Wilmington; and by
Donald Strauber, Thomas McCormack, William D'Amico, Eric Welsh
and Robert Schwinger of Chadbourne & Park L.L.P. in New York
City.

     Defendants are represented by Michael Goldman, Stephen
Norman and Michael Pottenger of Potter, Anderson & Corroon in
Wilmington; and by Walter Carlson, Richard Kapnick, William
Baumgartner Jr. and Brandon Lawniczak of Sidley & Austin in
Chicago.

SOFTWARE SYSTEM SOLVES E-MAIL INCOMPATABILITY

Corporate America's growing dependence on E-mail to facilitate
high speed communication in the workplace, and the use of
different platforms to perform different tasks has given rise
to a new problem: Multiple, incompatible E-mail systems that
cannot communicate with each other. With fast, reliable and
cost-effective communication being essential to maintaining a
competitive edge in today's global marketplace, the inability
to communicate with clients, vendors, distributors, and other
employees can hinder growth and stifle profits.

With increasing frequency, companies are finding that they
have a mix of E-mail programs that don't communicate with each
other installed on PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations and
legacy mainframes. When E-mail systems can't communicate with
each other, savings gained by effective communications cannot
be realized.

At some point, senior management wakes up to the fact that in
the "paperless office", corporate-wide E-mail is essential.
The task of integration is usually assigned to the corporate
Information Systems (IS) group who are faced with the
challenge of integrating the various existing departmental
E-mail systems.

This is a complicated task that involves making systems
interoperate, share directory information and documents across
different platforms.

This does not mean, however, that a standardized,
corporate-wide E-mail system needs to be purchased. Mail
integration technology is widely used to connect disparate
systems. The numerous benefits of integrating existing systems
make the concept a sensible alternative.

First, businesses preserve their initial investment. This
investment is not limited to the cost of the original E-mail
system packages, but includes the cost of servers needed to
run the system and the training of users.

These users often have limited computer experience and are
reluctant to give up their favorite E-mail system after
spending hours getting accustomed to its features and
capabilities. By switching E-mail systems in an effort to
standardize, users are taken out of their friendly computer
environment and placed into an unknown one.

Mail integration software solves this problem by allowing
users to seamlessly communicate with a variety of other mail
systems in a "friendly" manner. The address and message is
"switched" to make it appear as if users are communicating
with a computer on their very same E-mail system!

Second, mail integration can buy a company time to implement
an enterprise-wide migration strategy to wean users off older
legacy based mainframe systems and prepare them for a
standard-based information system. Additional benefits depend
on the particular features offered by the mail integration
software they select.

The technological demands of integration are extensive.
Choosing a mail integrator requires a careful examination of
features, benefits and reputation. Integration vendors
approach the issue differently and the results differ. Alisa
Systems has long been an industry leader in mail systems
integration. They have a reputation for being the best in the
business according to high tech computer publications and
other independent sources whose job it was to compare
integration systems.

Alisa offers a complete mail integration package called
AlisaMail. AlisaMail is a full-featured E-mail switch that
interconnects the most popular LAN-based electronic mail
systems. It provides seamless and transparent exchange of
electronic messages, fully editable documents and binary files
between WordPerfect GroupWise, Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail,
CE Software QuickMail, X.400, SMTP and Digital VMSmail,
ALL-IN-1 and Message Router. This includes spread sheets, word
processing documents, graphic and binary files. Most
importantly, AlisaMail is built on a relational database,
Sybase, that makes the system extremely flexible. "The really
strong point of the system is it's easy to customize how
information is presented." said Don Cole, president of Alisa
Systems.

The OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory Synchronization and
Message Switch are the strengths of the system and separate
AlisaMail from the competition.

The OpenDirectory is implemented using a Sybase SQL relational
database and can be used as a corporate directory service.
OpenDirectory, a unique AlisaMail feature, eliminates
complicated addressing schemes by maintaining a common address
book synchronized with each mail system.

This "master" directory can include an address book of
customers, employees and vendors that contains information
such as their title, organization, department name, E-mail and
postal address, telephone and FAX number, as well as a
photograph. The OpenDirectory provides a centralized address
book for all the E-mail users in their company. It is accessed
by either the user's E-mail client or an Alisa client/server
application called PeopleFinder.

PeopleFinder supports quick and easy on-line searching of the
AlisaMail Open Directory. Users may search specific fields in
the database such as Name, Title, Organization and Location.
Available for Windows, Macintosh and DEC VMS, PeopleFinder
allows users to browse the OpenDirectory and its contents to
display information not accessable in the user's address book.

Existing desktop client/server development tools and
applications can also be used to access the OpenDirectory.
With Sybases's openserver technology you can even connect to
other corporate databases.

Auto Directory Synchronization works hand in hand with the
OpenDirectory and is the key to mail systems integration.
Without Auto Directory Synchronization, the Open Directory
would be useless. Open Directory creates and maintains a
master directory of all E-mail users in by requesting
directory updates from each separate mail system. When changes
are made in one E-mail system such as adding, modifying or
deleting an E-mail address, the information is then
transferred to the master directory and then used to update
all the other directories.

In medium to large companies where there can be many changes,
AlisaMail allows the updating to be performed automatically.
The superior performance of our Auto Directory Synchronization
is made possible by the flexibility of the SQL database. "In
essence, AlisaMail makes each mail system's directory an
aggregate of all the users. It represents the entire
population and there is no distinction in where these people
live." said Cole.

AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects the
different E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.

The gateway and Message Switch act as a store-and-forward
message hub and also handle the conversion of message formats
as required by the E-mail systems. The Message Switch
preserves the functionality of each mail system because it
stores the message in its unaltered format. The format of the
message is then converted only if the recipient mail system
requires conversion. If the receiving mail system does not
support all the functionality of the sender's, the Message
Switch will preserve as much functionality as possible.

Alisa Systems takes full responsibility for the success of
your E-mail integration. Alisa Systems will conduct on-site
surveys to determine your specific mail integration needs and
provide a customized solution. They will even install
AlisaMail on site for you, train you and help you fine-tune
the system to maximize performance in your environment.

"There's lots of bits and places for information to be stored
in a corporation and people need access to it," says Cole,
"There is a technology out there that can help you run your
business and save money."

The New Face Of Client/Server -- Vendors, integrators see intranets
as key to short-term profits

By:
TOM SMITH

New York-The Internet has gained major strategic importance
among top client/server players, but the short-term profit
potential remains murky, according to executives attending
CRN 's annual Client/Server Summit.

In the short run, much of the industry's focus will be on intranets
internal corporate communications based on the Internet. Systems
integrators said intranets are one clear money maker, and database
vendors said those intranets present a major opportunity to
sell their relational databases as back ends to World Wide
Web home pages.

"The biggest market for all of this [Internet activity] is going
to be inside companies," said Phil White, chairman, president
and chief executive of Informix Software Inc., Menlo Park,
Calif. "That's going to drive a lot of business in '96 and
'97."

Informix sent a clear message about its view of the Internet's
strategic importance shortly after the roundtable. The database
provider disclosed an agreement to acquire Illustra Information
Technologies Inc., Oakland, Calif., in a stock transaction
valued at nearly $400 million, to strengthen its Web capabilities.

Informix, which until recently has held a steadfast line against
growth through acquisition, will pay more than 10 times the
estimated revenue of Illustra. Informix said the deal will
enable it to integrate Illustra technology for managing complex
data, such as Web data, into its core database.

Other roundtable participants, including channel executives,
said intranets have emerged as a hot button among customers.
"We think that's going to be a pretty big extension to what's
happening in the Internet," said Jim Sims, president and chief
executive of Cambridge Technology Partners Inc., Cambridge,
Mass.

Several participants cited the Web's potential to loosen Microsoft
Corp.'s long-standing stranglehold on the desktop and the client,
given the Web's ease of use and increasing presence. This is
good news for all software vendors, they said, because it means
a more open market.

"It is obviously an opportunity to change the industry paradigm
which, at least at the client end, is quickly becoming a monopoly,"
said Ray Lane, president of worldwide operations and a board
member at Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif.

"Obviously, if you are a large software company you want to
see that remain open," Lane added.

Mitchell Kertzman, executive vice president of Sybase Inc.,
Emeryville, Calif., characterized the World Wide Web interface
as "probably the best, easiest, most intuitive user interface
that's been developed. I think the real breakthrough is the
user interface breakthrough."

But another industry hot button, the low-cost computer with
built-in Internet access, dubbed the Internet computer or network
computer (NC), was given less upbeat assessments. Internet
computers have been touted aggressively by Oracle Corp., Sun
Microsystems Inc., IBM Corp. and others, though none have actually
shipped.

"In my view, the NC stands for no chance," White said.

Kertzman predicted such devices will find the greatest applicability
in mobile and home devices, rather than in corporate America.

With two exceptions, most participants found it difficult to
identify specific revenue and profit figures related to Internet
offerings. They noted that since Internet functions are being
added to so many products, it is becoming more difficult to
distinguish between revenue from Internet and other offerings.

"I'd like anybody to be able to sit down and calculate Internet
revenue. Certainly I'd ask, along with that, about profit,"
said Bob McDowell, vice president for enterprise customers
at Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.

Informix's White did offer a bullish forecast, saying Internet
related revenue could increase from the single digits in 1995
to as much as 30 percent to 50 percent of revenue in 1996.

Mark Tebbe, president of Chicago-based Lante Corp., meanwhile,
predicted his Internet-related business will increase from
15 percent to 20 percent in 1995 to 33 percent in 1996.

Greg Jacobsen, executive vice president of outsourcing services
at Ottawa, Ontario-based SHL Systemhouse-which recently was
acquired by MCI Telecommunications Corp.-said his new parent
company is reaping rich rewards from the Internet by virtue
of its being a major provider of Internet access and bandwidth.
However, he did not provide specifics.

Although precise revenue data may be difficult to obtain, participants
agreed their customers will benefit handsomely from Internet
use.

The New Face Of Client/Server -- Channel conflict looms, but
so does opportunity

By:
Craig Zarley

New York-The accelerated pace of business process re-engineering
and the lack of qualified service people to meet the growing
opportunity emerged as dominant issues for both vendor and
channel executives attending the CRN Client/Server Summit.

"There is a giant gap between the [opportunity] for building
applications that are going to be mission-critical and having
people who are truly capable of designing and implementing
these systems," said Bob McDowell, Microsoft Corp.'s vice president
for enterprise customers.

Vendors and resellers are jockeying to find qualified service
people and form strategic alliances with each other to capitalize
on the burgeoning opportunity for services. So frenetic is
the pace of change, and so understaffed are both the channel
and vendors, that plugging this service gap will be the top
priority in the client/server arena for the coming year.

"Last year we went from 500 to almost 1,200 [employees], and
this year we'll add another 700 to 800," said Jim Sims, president
and chief executive of Cambridge Technology Partners Inc.,
a Cambridge, Mass.-based systems integrator.

For their part, vendors, too, are focusing on the widening services
gap and are in the process of beefing up their own direct-service
offerings while trying to avoid conflicts with their channel
partners.

While the consensus among roundtable participants was that channel
vendor conflicts over services have been kept at a minimum,
all of that could change should client/server sales slow down.

"There is more demand than supply, so all ships rise with the
tide," said Ray Lane, Oracle Corp.'s president of worldwide
operations. "No one minds conflict in a market that is growing
as fast as this one is. If the market slows down, then you'll
see a much different attitude by vendors that want to build
a services business working with the systems integrator channel."

But of immediate concern to systems integrators is the potential
for vendors to make incursions into the channel's service domain.
Integrators maintain that conflicts will arise because vendors
advocate selling their specific products while integrators
sell complete solutions.

"You should choose how you're going to solve the problem, then
choose the appropriate technology," said Cambridge Technology's
Sims. "We come from the viewpoint that we're far more independent
to do that than a product company. But I think where you get
into conflict is when product companies try to get into that
space. There's conflict, and the more the product company gets
into that space, the less we want to work with that company."

But Oracle's Lane countered that market conditions may well
force resellers to more closely align themselves with specific
vendors.

"I believe it's going to be extremely difficult for a consulting
business in this kind of . . . market to remain an independent,
objective consultant," he said. Rather, Oracle's channel focus
in the near term will be on smaller integrators willing to
devote resources to the Oracle product line.

"I've got to take the conflict out, and I'd much prefer [to
work with] the largest integrators, and we could subcontract
a team to every one of them," Lane said. "But our consulting
business is big enough and they'd think twice about it, and
they want to control the customer. I prefer working with smaller
integrators that want to build a business out of Oracle."

Greg Jacobsen, executive vice president of SHL Systemhouse Inc.,
said the speed at which corporations are re-engineering their
business processes is forcing integrators to deploy packaged,
rather than customized, solutions. That phenomenon may, in
fact, force integrators to more closely align with specific
vendors.

"While we recognize the need to be able to continue to provide
custom solutions, we really think that the marketplace more
and more is getting away from that," he said. "They're going
to be very comfortable with a prepackaged model architecture
based on a selected set of partners where you can really add
the deepest value."

Microsoft, like Oracle, is building a consulting business, which
is expected to grow to about 1,000 consultants this year.

McDowell said Microsoft is aware it must move into service and
consulting to push products, while being careful not to create
conflict with the channel.

Valuation in excess of $400M; Nynex to sell stake -- Vanstar
IPO to chip away at $359M debt

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

New York-Vanstar Corp.'s recently filed prospectus reveals a
highly leveraged corporate reseller that is seeking a premium
on Wall Street, compared with its major competitors, with a
valuation as high as $492 million.

As part of the offering, Nynex Worldwide Services Group Inc.
is selling off its 22 percent stake in the company-6.8 million
shares. The company is issuing 8 million shares to the public
with the goal of attracting as much as $12.50 a share. Most
of the $84.6 million in net proceeds that Vanstar hopes to
raise would be used to pay off debt.

Vanstar Chairman and Chief Executive William Tauscher does not
plan to sell any of his more than 2.2 million shares in the
company, making him an instant multimillionaire. However, Tauscher's
7.1 percent interest in the company will fall to 5.6 percent
following the offering. Warburg, Pincus Capital Co. L.P., Vanstar's
largest stockholder, plans to retain its nearly 14 million
shares and will remain the largest single shareholder, with
a 35.3 percent stake following the public offering.

After the IPO, Vanstar will have more than 39 million shares
outstanding, resulting in a market capitalization of between
$413 million and $492 million. That would be greater than the
market caps of CompuCom Systems Inc. ($349 million), Inacom
Corp. ($136 million) and MicroAge Inc. ($120 million), based
on last week's closing stock prices.

Analysts said those numbers make Vanstar appear relatively expensive,
especially given the company's balance sheet, which shows $10.7
million in cash on July 31, up from $7.8 million on April 30.
Inventories also rose over the same period to $325.4 million
from $298.7 million.

Vanstar lists $359.4 million in long-term debt, most of which
consists of $357.8 million in indebtedness to IBM Credit Corp.
Vanstar has a $425 million line of credit under a financing
agreement with ICC. Stockholders' equity is $25.7 million.

"The balance sheet is pretty weak. They are very leveraged,"
said Benny Lorenzo, portfolio manager at PAW Partners L.P.,
Greenwich, Conn. "They are pricing this towards the high end
of the comparable companies, and they would have to show any
potential investors why we should pay such a high value for
a new company when you can get an existing company for a cheaper
valuation."

Vanstar has spent much of the past several years in the red.

After its 1993 fiscal year, Vanstar changed its fiscal calendar
to end April 30 from ending Sept. 30. For the 1992 fiscal year,
ended Sept. 30, the company lost nearly $52 million, and in
1993, Vanstar lost an additional $4.2 million.

For the seven months ended April 30, 1994, the company recorded
a $45 million gain resulting in $44.5 million in net income,
but it still reported an operating loss. But for its most recent
fiscal year, ended April 30, Vanstar earned $1.3 million and
reported operating income of $26.8 million.

Sales during the past fiscal year reached $1.39 billion.

Vanstar does appear to have turned the corner recently, reporting
$427 million in sales and $3.5 million in net income for the
quarter ended July 31.

Lorenzo said one key message the company will have to get across
during its upcoming road show is future projections as services
become an integral part of the business.

In its July quarter, Vanstar's product sales accounted for 40
percent of overall operating revenue, while support services
represented nearly 38 percent. Networking sales accounted for
12.1 percent, while other services accounted for the remaining
9.8 percent.

Still, Vanstar hopes to transform into a more service-oriented
integration company and is going to experience growing pains
in that arena. Vanstar's support-services business posted a
$900,000 operating loss for the period, while product sales
resulted in an operating income of $8.3 million.

In addition, the prospectus shows Tauscher earned $550,008 plus
a $30,000 bonus for the 1995 fiscal year, ended April 30. Jay
Amato, Vanstar's president and chief operating officer, earned
$256,254 plus a $25,000 bonus.

The prospectus also provided insight into Vanstar's relationship
with Merisel Inc.'s FAB division, formed in January 1994 after
Vanstar sold ComputerLand Corp. to the distributor. The product
distribution agreement between the two companies, expiring
this month, called for Vanstar to keep one-half of its inventory
to maintain its obligations under the Merisel distribution
services agreement. Vanstar's assets include a $19.4 million
receivable from Merisel that matures this month, the prospectus
states.

Preferred allocation emerges as strategic weapon

By:
JACK SWEENEY

London-Priority allocation is emerging as the weapon of choice
among major PC vendors with IBM Corp. and Toshiba Corp. leading
the charge in the battle to enlist channel allies as part of
their aggressive global reselling programs.

During the past year, virtually all major PC vendors have launched
global reselling strategies to address the needs of large accounts
seeking a central point of PC procurement for their worldwide
operations. Missing from the equation, however, is preferred
allocation, a perk long enjoyed by corporations participating
in vendors' national large-account programs.

IBM and Toshiba are among the first to make preferred product
allocation a bona fide component of their global strategies,
and they are working with their resellers to reserve inventory
for specific global customers. "We have been working with the
management in each of our countries to help [accent] the needs
of global customers," said Neils Rokkebal, IBM Europe's chief
operating officer.

Close behind, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp.
now also are addressing customer allocation demands on a project
by-project basis. However, formalized global allocation programs
currently are under consideration by the two PC manufacturers,
reseller executives said.

"Global customers have made it clear to the manufacturers that
the failure of their subsidiaries to allocate needed product
has put the rollouts of global computer projects in jeopardy,"
said Anne Renders, director of marketing for International
Computer Group, a consortium of international dealers that
work together on global contracts.

"In the past, allocation had been fragmented for global customers,
and we're now eradicating that by recognizing them as truly
global accounts and rolling out a type of allocation red-carpet
treatment," said Chris Tripp, Toshiba's U.K. corporate accounts
sales manager and one of the architects of the vendor's newly
minted global allocation plan.

Accelerating the move toward global allocation strategies is
the fact that the large global accounts already receive priority
allocation for their U.S. operations.

"It's important to global clients that what they get in the
U.S. is similar to what they get outside the U.S.," said Jeffrey
Frankel, vice president of MicroAge Inc.'s international operations.

Steve Caskey, director of international sales for Inacom Corp.,
said priority supply has become a common request among Inacom's
global customers. "There is no question IBM and Toshiba, in
particular, are now responding to what our global customers
have been asking for," Caskey said.

By working closer with global customers and resellers, vendors
are hoping to curtail shortages through better product forecasting.

"When you get approached by a large customer with special needs
in terms of product and delivery expectation, you've got to
be able to feel fairly confident that you can meet those needs
to keep the customer happy," said David Howarth, international
marketing manager at Entex Information Services Inc., Rye Brook,
N.Y.

"We don't look at customers on a country-by-country basis. What
we do is look at the customers' overall requirements," said
Daniel Paul, a corporate accounts manager for HP's European
operation.

In Development: InfoPad -- Natioanl Dives Into Nework Computing

By:
CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

Santa Clara, Calif.-National Semiconductor Corp. is entering
the network-computing-device race.

The chip maker is developing its own device, code-named InfoPad,
to pull information from an intelligent network, said Ellen
Hancock, the company's executive vice president and chief operating
officer.

The move is part of the company's push toward network-centric
computing, a computing model that will provide VARs with opportunities
to sell network-based solutions rather than plug-and-play boxes.
But the challenge to VARs will be integrating the network devices
with the appropriate network and database schemes.

The primary focus of a $6 million research and development laboratory
established last month by National is to develop new types
of semiconductors-including those with mixed-signal capabilities
to convert analog to digital communications-to support a network
device, Hancock said.

"The view that there's going to be much more use of intelligent
agent-type of technology is becoming much more interesting,"
Hancock said. "You'll see National focusing on the total system's
architecture, at least so it will do a better job of responding
to the parts of the architecture [for which] it's responsible."

Oracle Corp. and IBM Corp. have outlined plans to scale down
the PC's intelligence, memory and cost, as well as launch information
and software from the network. Both Oracle and IBM are working
on network computers priced in the $500 range.

National's plan is to create flexibility in its hardware and
semiconductor lines. Hancock said she is keen on offering devices
that come in different styles, levels of sophistication and
price points.

In addition, National is looking into partnerships with companies
that focus on storing and retrieving data from a network.

"We are getting more database-aware," Hancock said. "With everything
happening with the network, we have now engaged [in discussions]
with companies that deal with files, databases and object technology."

Digital to unveil faster Newton chip to power network computers
-- Vendor develops 100MHz, low-voltage processor for delivery
in February

By:
JEFF BLISS

Hudson, Mass.-Digital Equipment Corp. next month will unveil
a new version of Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton RISC processor,
which is eight times faster yet runs at less than half the
voltage of the current Newton chip.

The processor could play a pivotal role in the emerging $500
Internet computer market. Oracle Corp. of Redwood Shores, Calif.,
is considering the new Digital StrongARM processor as the basis
for its $500 Internet device, sources said.

StrongARM, based on the Newton processor designed by Advance
RISC Machines Ltd., Cambridge, England, initially will run
as fast as 200MHz at 2 volts vs. the Newton chip, which currently
runs at 33MHz at 5 volts.

"[The StrongARM] has good power management on a screaming chip,"
said Tim Schmidt, a principal at Encore Consulting Group, Orlando,
Fla.

Digital, which licensed the Newton chip and is working with
Advance RISC Machines, also will introduce 100MHz and 160MHz
versions of the chip, with prices starting at $30 for shipments
of 10,000 per year for the 100MHz version.

Samples of the new StrongARM processor, the SA-110, will be
available in February, with volume shipments scheduled for
the spring.

The processor, which Digital will manufacture in its Hudson,
Mass., facility, could be key in making Internet devices a
reality and the Apple Computer Inc. Newton MessagePad-long
the target of criticism for poor performance-a success, analysts
said.

Jim Turley, senior editor at the Microprocessor Report, predicted
that Apple will use Digital's chips in its MessagePads by the
end of this year.

"The StrongARM will make the Newton a very useful item," Turley
said. He estimates the StrongARM is eight to 10 times faster
than the ARM 610 in current Newton models.

The new processor could give the Newton voice-recognition capabilities,
a source said. "People would be able to dictate a message that
they want to fax out," said one source familiar with Digital's
plans.

Officials at Oracle and Apple could not be reached for comment.

The source said the 100MHz version of the StrongARM will perform
at 115 million instructions per second at 1.5 volts. The 160MHz
chip will run at 185 MIPS at 1.5 volts, and the 200MHz processor
will run at 230 MIPS at 2 volts.

The chip also may prove attractive to the handheld and set-top
box market, analysts said.

One major obstacle Digital faces in making the chip a staple
in the Internet device market may be out of its control: the
lack of low-price network bandwidth to speed up browsing on
the Internet.

Other industry realities pose problems as well. "The handheld
market has been stymied by the lack of synergy between the
handheld systems and the desktop systems," said Andy Seybold,
editor-in-chief of Outlook on Communications and Computing.

The lukewarm response to ARM technology also is troublesome,
analysts said. Apple is the only major company that has bought
into the ARM technology, Schmidt said. "[Digital] has to make
sure that they have a buy-in from the other operating system
companies."

Pact Builds On Current Relationship -- Network Integrity, Entex
to partner on LANtegrity sales

By:
MONICA YOUNG

Marlborough, Mass.-Network Integrity Inc. is expected today
to disclose a reseller partnership agreement with Entex Information
Services Inc., Rye Brook, N.Y.

Under the terms of the agreement, Entex will resell and support
Network Integrity's LANtegrity for NetWare, which provides
instant recovery for failed servers. Entex also will preconfigure
customers' servers with the software to simplify the installation
process for the reseller.

"Entex is one of the largest national resellers of network services
with good technical abilities and configuration abilities,"
said John Butler, vice president of Network Integrity, based
in Marlborough.

Butler said this agreement is the result of Network Integrity's
satisfaction with its current relationship with Entex and a
desire to expand that partnership.

"Entex gets a product that opens the door to large accounts,"
Butler said, because LANtegrity is not intended for small businesses.
"It gives us sales and technical support in many cities," he
said.

"This product is one which you put in if a customer has many
servers. If [a customer] has hundreds of employees, it attracts
those large employers that Entex likes to add to their customer
base," Butler said.

With LANtegrity, Entex will be able to help customers reduce
network downtime and lost productivity and eliminate the need
for multiple servers at a single site, all of which would decrease
costs for their customers.

Brad Curtis, software business manager at Entex, said the reseller
will configure LANtegrity servers for customers at its ISO
9000 certified Integration and Distribution Center in Kentucky.

Curtis said that the partnership with Network Integrity allows
Entex to distribute the servers as turnkey solutions to its
customers. "Computer crashes are a fact of life," Curtis said.
"We're working to create a seamless delivery to customers,"
he said.

Several Entex customers-including AT&T Corp., NordicTrack Inc.
and Sherwin Williams Co.-now use LANtegrity.

LANtegrity is suited for large corporations since one LANtegrity
server can back up multiple servers, unlike other backup solutions
where a backup is necessary for each network server, Butler
said. When LANtegrity is used for a server cluster, if any
of the servers in the group fail, LANtegrity instantaneously
steps in, he said.

A LANtegrity server can support up to 1,000 users on multiple
NetWare servers and protects current and historical files within
15 seconds of failure. Butler said other backup products use
a "mirroring" method in which servers perform the same tasks
at the same time and only protect against hardware failures.
If the failure is in the software, the most current uncorrupted
files are not protected.

One LANtegrity server can back up from five to 10 servers, depending
on the number of supported users and activity level, Butler
said.

Initiatives: Improve reseller's communication and IT infrastructure
-- GTSI Turns Back To Young To Lead Turnaround Charge

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

New York-Government Technology Services Inc.'s board is turning
back to Dendy Young to bail out the struggling reseller, naming
him president and chief executive less than 18 months after
he sold Falcon Microsystems Inc. to GTSI.

The move came as no surprise to those who follow the government
market. Experts said Young is the best choice to turn around
a company which, despite being in the best position in the
federal market, has struggled in its most recent quarters.

For its third quarter ended Sept. 30, 1995, the busiest buying
season in the federal market, GTSI's sales dropped 22 percent
to $175.7 million. Its net income plummeted over 70 percent,
to $1.7 million, compared to the same quarter a year before.

"He is the best-qualified person to bail-out the current GTSI
situation," said Thomas Hewitt, president of Federal Sources
Inc., McLean, Va. "It is fundamentally a good company, and
I think Dendy will be able to achieve the full potential of
that company. Everybody wins on this."

For his part, Young cautioned that the turnaround may take some
time, saying it could be two years before all his initiatives
take hold. The financial community, which has been hard on
the company of late, reacted well. GTSI's stock inched up 47
cents, to $4.13 per share, the day of the news and reached
$4.38 in the ensuing days.

Young said the two major long-term areas of focus for GTSI will
be on communication and the IT infrastructure.

On the communication side, Young said improvements must be made
with GTSI's customer base, the vendor community and the reseller's
own employees.

As for using new technology, Young said, "This business demands
we be efficient. We will be on the leading edge of the technology
curve."

In addition to hiring Young, GTSI also named Peter Janke executive
vice president. Prior to assuming their new positions, Janke
and Young were co-founders of The Exeter Group, which specialized
in strategic transition management for IT companies in the
Washington area.

Ingram shows multivendor service menus -- TSS pact gets jump
on distribution rivals

By:
JOHN LONGWELL

Santa Ana, Calif.-Ingram Micro Inc. is pulling the wraps off
its multivendor services offerings for VARs and dealers, staking
an early claim on what is expected to be a strategic battlefield
for distributors in the year ahead.

Working with third-party service organizations, Ingram quietly
has built its service program over the past year and now boasts
about 80 service SKUs in its Support Advantage arsenal.

Doug Antone, president of the Ingram Alliance and who recently
took charge of Ingram's value-added services, said the program
was designed to help VARs and independent dealers compete with
the full-service offerings of large corporate resellers.

"If we can partner with them, then we have a much better chance
of retaining their business," Antone said.

While corporate resellers look toward a big upside in services,
distributors also expect a piece of the action. Merisel Inc.,
El Segundo, Calif., and Tech Data Corp., Clearwater, Fla.,
have been negotiating with third-party services providers to
provide similar offerings.

Ingram, however, entered into an alliance with its primary service
provider, Technology Service Solutions, Wayne, Pa., a little
over a year ago.

Since then, Ingram has worked with TSS and some of its Premier
VARs on packaging multivendor services and bringing them into
two-tiered distribution, said Franz Roosen, senior manager
of field services for Ingram.

Service sales have begun to ramp exponentially in past months,
and now about 1,000 of the Premier VARs buy service through
Ingram, Roosen said.

Dan Wasser, vice president of marketing for National Guest Systems
Corp., Rockville, Md., which provides vertical solutions for
hotels and restaurants, said, "We've been looking for this
solution for a long time. I need firm [seven-day, 24-hour]
support because my clients are hotels. I need someone out there
to fix it if it breaks."

Wasser said because many of the accounts are small, one- and
two-site hotels, large providers do not contract directly for
the business.

Corporate Micro Systems Inc., Rolling Meadows, Ill., increased
service contracts from 15 to 50 since starting Ingram's program
six months ago. The company's costs are down, business is up,
and it has been able to go after national accounts for the
first time, said Sam Shaw, Corporate Micro's vice president.

Sneak Preview: Clear Process Clears Way For Automated Work Flow Analysis

By:
Eddie Correia

New York-Clear Software's Clear Process is a Windows-compatible
software tool that simplifies the complex task of analyzing
business procedures and finding ways to improve them. This
is accomplished by analyzing alternative workflow paths. Even
such sophisticated processes as manufacturing can be tamed
by Clear Process.

Engineers from the CRN Test Center found that the program creates,
with minimal effort, flow charts based on manual input or batch
import of text-based procedures. Once the work flow is built,
which can sometimes be done in minutes through the selection
of a menu choice, all possible work-flow paths are followed.

The critical paths and all others are identified, and corresponding
data are extracted and exported for analysis in a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet.

Resellers should like the product's automated features, which
include automatic geometry and arrow drawing for perfect alignment,
and automatically corrected printer page breaks and connectors.
These features assure that no process boxes are amputated by
the edge of a page.

The opportunity for resellers is to sell to auditors, production
managers, project managers, company controllers, and profit
and-loss analysts. Resellers with expertise in process automation
should have no difficulty becoming a consultant to issues in
that particular industrial-engineering discipline.

Clear Process tightly integrates the previously released allClear
III product into a complete process analysis solution. Clear
Software's allClear III offers the ability to create graphical
flowcharts from a company's existing set of ASCII text-based
procedures, dBASE files, Lotus 1-2-3 or Excel spreadsheets,
without having to rekey the data. It was a simple matter to
follow a simple set of punctuation rules; the charts flowed
forth like water.

Both text and chart are active and visible side by side; text
editing can be done from either side, and chart additions made
by using drag-and-drop templates.

Changes made to charts in the left-hand window are reflected
in the text in the right. Charts are automatically redrawn,
re-routed and re-sized after each edit, and page connectors
are drawn automatically. This module also offers self-documentation,
diagram rotation, support for multiple open diagrams, advanced
editing features, a runtime viewer and network support; also,
it is an OLE server.

The Clear Process interface is based on a straightforward, five
step procedure for the entire process. Standout analysis tools
include the abilities to identify the critical and optimal
paths of a process; to analyze alternatives easily; to assign
probabilities to workflow paths based on company statistics
or other probability data; and to perform and see animated
"what-if" scenarios based on factors such as time and cost.
The product also offers the ability to rapidly create workflow
prototypes with instant feedback and presentation graphics.

Examination of the product, done in the confines of the CRN
Test Center on a Pentium-based PC, yielded snappy performance.
Clear Process, however, is perfectly at home on a 486-based
unit. System requirements include 8 Mbytes of available RAM
and 8 Mbytes of hard-drive space.

IBM seeks to raise up to $1.75B in cash

By:
BARBARA DARROW & STEVEN BURKE

Boston-IBM Corp. is looking to raise $1.75- billion in cold,
hard cash, according to recent filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

In an S-3 document filed just before Christmas, IBM registered
to issue up that amount of stock, debt or warrants. That, in
addition to the nearly $7 billion IBM already has in its coffer,
comprises a prodigious war chest for future acquisitions or
to solidify the computer giant's balance sheet.

Even without this newest infusion, analysts said IBM easily
could do a long-rumored deal to buy Novell Inc. or even Apple
Computer Inc.

When IBM completed its $3.52 billion buyout of Lotus Development
Corp. last June, then-Chief Financial Officer Jerome York maintained
that this was not the "King Kong" acquisition IBM hinted at
earlier.

Some were puzzled by the filing. "Why do they need all that
money? They already have $7 billion left after the Lotus deal.
Novell? Pocket change-especially after jettisoning WordPerfect,"
said Karl Wong a Santa Clara, Calif.-based consultant, noting
IBM might be shooting for a telecommunications company. "They
always wanted to be a service company," he said.

Others said IBM is more likely to initiate a stock buyback or
otherwise firm up its bottom line than gird for another shopping
spree. "I think, if anything, they want to help their balance
sheet," said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y., consultant.

VARs agreed IBM must stay true to its network focus. A smaller
networking acquisition is more likely than a big Novell or
Apple deal, said Mike Conroy, technical director at Island
Computer Products, New York.

Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of IBM's new Internet
Division, said an Internet or network-centric acquisition was
possible. "If it is necessary and looks right, we may form
a stronger alliance or may do some investment, including perhaps
outright buying something," he said.

Quarterdeck leads industry stocks with 800% rise in '95 -- Spyglass,
U.S. Robotics round out top three issues

By:
EDWARD F. MOLTZEN

New York-Things were looking bleak at Quarterdeck Corp. early
last year, with a share price that was near an all-time low
and dropping, and a market that seemed to be passing it by.

Then the company's new chief executive, Gaston Bastiaens, hitched
Quarterdeck's wagon to the Internet. The biggest comeback of
the year followed.

Out of almost 100 high-tech stocks tracked by Computer Reseller
News throughout the year-a year in which high-tech companies
fueled the biggest bull run in Wall Street history-Quarterdeck
shares increased in value the most.

At the opening bell of 1995, Quarterdeck shares were trading
at $3.13. By the close of business Dec. 28, the company's shares
were at $28.13-an increase of about 800 percent on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.

During the year, Santa Monica, Calif.-based Quarterdeck went
from a company that produced mainly utility software to one
that unveiled a line of World Wide Web products such as browsers
and servers, in addition to RAM-maximizing software that became
popular when Microsoft Corp. began selling Windows 95.

After Quarterdeck, the four other high-tech stocks to post the
largest increases in value this past year included Spyglass
Inc., Naperville, Ill., which went public on June 27 and closed
that day at $13.56 per share, and finished the Dec. 28 trading
day at $56.50, a gain of 317 percent; modem maker U.S. Robotics
Corp., Skokie, Ill., which started the year with its shares
going for $21.63, but which climbed to $85.75, a gain of nearly
300 percent; Macromedia Inc., San Francisco, whose stock went
to $51 from $12.75, growth of 300 percent; and United Stationers
Inc., formerly known as Micro United, whose shares grew in
price to $26.63 from $6.63, a gain of 302 percent.

But not all high-tech companies were able to rejoice in the
1995 technology bull run on Wall Street.

Radius Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., a maker of PC monitors and peripherals,
saw its share price tumble to a meager $2 from $8.50 on the
Nasdaq-a drop of 76 percent during the year. That made it the
worst performing stock followed by CRN.

Following Radius, AmeriQuest Technologies Inc., an Irvine, Calif.
based distributor holding company that underwent change in
its executive ranks and organization during 1995, was hit the
hardest, with shares dropping by about 71 percent to less than
$1.00 from $3.25.

Corporate reseller Dataflex Corp., Edison, N.J., saw its shares
trail off by about 63 percent to $3.25 from $8.88, while Government
Technology Services Inc., a Chantilly, Va.-based government
reseller, witnessed its stock plummet to $4.32 from $10.75,
a drop of 60 percent.

Rounding out the worst five performers is software developer
Gupta Corp., Menlo Park., Calif., which dropped to $5.25 from
$11.25 per share, a falloff of about 53 percent year-over-year.

Apple's Plan: Pippin information appliance -- Macworld To Focus
On Riding Net Wave, Copland

By:
DIANA HWANG & MICHAEL KANNELLOS

Boston-The Macworld trade show in San Francisco next week will
kick off the new year as vendors, including Apple Computer
Inc. and other third parties, display resources for riding
the Internet wave and for supporting Apple's future Copland
operating system.

Apple is positioning its forthcoming Pippin low-cost device
as an "information appliance" functioning as an Internet browser,
said David Nagel, senior vice president of worldwide research
and development at Apple, Cupertino, Calif. The Pippin operating
system is a derivative of the existing Macintosh operating
system, he said.

Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., however, is positioning Office
for the Macintosh as a front end to the Web. Microsoft will
show a companion product to its Internet Explorer browser that
will be familiar to Office 95 users, said Product Manager Dave
Meltzer.

Third-party vendor DeltaPoint Inc., Monterey, Calif., will push
the Internet in its product lineup with the launch of WebVision
Animator, a multimedia authoring tool for animating Web pages
and other multimedia presentations. The product consists of
two components: the multimedia authoring tool and a Netscape
Navigator plug-in for viewing purposes. The plug-in also provides
the ability to see animations without needing to run WebVision
Animator.

Expected for release this half of the year, the $295 product
creates animation and distributes it via the Internet and other
channels. DeltaPoint will further expand the WebVision product
line later this month.

Now Software Inc., Portland, Ore., will unveil support for OpenDoc
and Copland for its flagship line of software Now Utilities,
said Henry Carstens, business development manager. At the show,
the company will unveil shipment plans of Now Synchronize version
2.0, an updated release that includes support for AppleTalk
and Newton 2.0. List price for Now Synchronize 2.0 is $29.95.

Apple recently shipped 50 copies of a release of Copland to
select developers, Nagel said.

On the PDA front, Digital Ocean, Lenexa, Kan., will unveil Seahorse,
a ruggedized PDA based on the new Newton 2.0 operating system.
The handheld is aimed at applications such as wireless Internet
access to global-positioning-system uses. Without communications
options, the product lists for under $1,500; inclusion of a
modem or module options costs under $2,000. Seahorse, with
cellular digital packet data capabilities, will be released
next quarter.

On the multimedia side, MetaTools Inc., Carpenteria, Calif.,
will unveil KPT Power Photos 3 and support for a new API in
Adobe Illustrator 6.0 for Macintosh, and demonstrate its new
KPT 3 application.

Cable vs. Telecommunications Companies -- TCI to roll out flat
rate, high-speed Net access

By:
CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

Englewood, Colo. -Cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. is taking
on the telecommunications industry with an aggressive rollout
this week of high-speed access to the Internet at a flat rate
of $29.95 per month.

Resellers welcome infrastructures that increase bandwidth to
the Internet-in this case by as much as 1,000 times the speed
of a 9600-baud modem-but remain skeptical over the guarantee
of quality service provided by an industry not known for superior
customer support.

"The reputation for service between cable and phone companies
is much different," said Tom Henderson, vice president of engineering
for Unitel Inc., Indianapolis. "Phone companies are used to
having no excuse for downtime. VARs don't typically touch the
consumer marketplace, but we're watching it closely to see
if the cable companies will provide adequate service to the
commercial entities, which is where we live."

In addition to Internet access, TCI, based in Englewood, will
provide links to the Microsoft Network, America Online Inc.
and CompuServe Inc. for additional fees, company officials
said.

TCI, whose cable infrastructure currently spans 25 percent of
the country, expects to have the online service available to
all its subscribers by 1997, said Brian Hayashi, creative director
of TCI's interactive media group, a subsidiary of the Technology
Ventures Group.

The cable titan has set its sights on becoming a major player
in the online and Internet arenas after a spending spree by
Technology Ventures Group of over $300 million, invested in
ventures with the computer community. These included $125 million
on Microsoft Corp.'s online services. It also has invested
in Netscape Communications Corp. and @Home Network.

Still, wrinkles will likely need smoothing as the new service
unfolds. For example, the 10-Mbps access to the home TCI promises
sounds like an enormous pipe, but it is shared access. It grows
much smaller if many other users are accessing the Internet
at the same time, VARs said.

VARs also expressed concern over selling competing services.

IBM, Ameritech service partnership could bolster vendor's channel
ties

By:
KEVIN MERRILL

New York-IBM Corp.'s new service alliance with Ameritech Corp.
is expected to become an early testing ground for the vendor's
strategy to ease conflicts with the channel in the service
arena.

IBM's Integrated Systems Solutions Corp. (ISSC) and Ameritech
inked a pact last month to manage and integrate PC, fax and
phone services. The companies also will rely on each other
for internal desktop and voice-management services in a shared
outsourcing deal valued at an estimated $400 million over seven
years.

The alliance is expected to generate returns for the channel
starting this month, as Ameritech begins transferring more
work to ISSC and as ISSC, in turn, begins subcontracting work
to VARs.

Omaha, Neb.-based Inacom Corp. has been providing product fulfillment
and configuration services to Ameritech on behalf of ISSC,
which already had a working relationship with Ameritech. Ameritech
officials said the ISSC-Inacom fulfillment deal replaces an
almost identical one with The Future Now Inc., an Intelligent
Electronics Inc. subsidiary.

ISSC and IE officials were unavailable for comment.

Desktop services covered by the alliance include telephones,
printers, PCs, software, wiring, LANs, services, videoconferencing
equipment, fax equipment, voice mail, paging, wireless equipment,
and technical and consulting support.

Ameritech has used ISSC internally the past year for some desktop
management services. The work has been limited to the network
services unit, one of about a dozen business units within Ameritech.

ISSC has subcontracted with Inacom to provide PC ordering and
configuration, but not advanced services such as help desk
or network management. Those additional services are covered
by the new agreement between ISSC and Ameritech.

Mike Steffan, president of Inacom's reseller and distribution
divisions, said the fulfillment and configuration work started
in earnest this past spring.

Inacom, IE and other resellers have embraced and invested in
voice-data convergence in recent years to keep affiliates in
step with the market and computer telephony opportunities in
general.

"I think IBM is anxious to get into desktop management in a
big way," said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant.
"I think this is something that both companies need."

Proxy reveals former AST execs' compensation deals

By:
EDWARD F. MOLTZEN

New York-AST Research Inc. made about $3 million in lump-sum
payments to executives to whom it showed the door last year,
with its former president reaping the most, according to a
proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Jim Schraith, the company's former president, was paid a lump
sum of $1.5-million after leaving the company, in connection
with his employment agreement, AST disclosed.

Scott Smith, AST's vice president and general manager of desktop
products, was paid $477,500. James Wittry, who left the company
as senior vice president of the Americas, was paid $461,600.
And Richard Ottaviano, senior vice president of administration,
was paid $720,100 to leave the company.

The exodus of top executives at AST climaxed with the Nov. 2,
1995, hiring of former Apple Computer Inc. executive Ian Diery
to be the Irvine, Calif.-based PC maker's chief executive.

AST will pay Diery a base salary of $700,000 per year, plus
stock options worth at least $10 million over the next seven
years.

Should AST's share price rise to $40 in the next nine months
a long shot with the company's stock now trading at about $8.50
per share-Diery would reap $40-million.

From Diery's hiring to mid-December, AST's share price dropped
from $9.38, even as South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Corp.
continued on its track to take over majority ownership of the
company and provide AST with much needed financing.

Last month, Samsung signed another deal with AST to offer a
bank line or line of credit of up to $200 million through Dec.
31, 1997, and a vendor line of credit from Samsung to AST of
$100 million through Nov. 30, 1997, for purchases of components.

In exchange, AST will give Samsung an option to buy 4.4 million
additional shares of the company at an exercise price of 1
cent per share, which can be exercised after June 30, 1996.
The option expires on June 30, 2001.

According to the company, a $100 investment in AST stock on
June 30, 1990, was worth $130 on July 1, 1995.

In addition to the options, AST gave Diery a "relocation allowance"
of $500,000 for moving expenses.

Qureshey Stays On

The company also revealed in its proxy statement that AST co
founder Safi Qureshey, who stepped aside as chief executive
to make room for Diery, is staying on as an employee and chairman
of the board at AST-but not without a personal cost.

The company said Qureshey agreed to cut his $650,000 annual
salary to $325,000 "until the company returns to profitability."

The company also said Qureshey "agreed not to currently enforce
the terms of the existing [employment] agreement with respect
to termination for 'good reason.' "

However, if new corporate leadership from Samsung decides to
fire Qureshey without cause, Qureshey would be eligible for
a "golden parachute" severance clause of approximately $2 million.

The executive shuffling at AST came while the company continued
experiencing losses. Analysts generally applauded the moves,
especially the hiring of Diery.

FTC probes need for antitrust-enforcement changes

By:
DARRYL K. TAFT

Washington-The Software Publishers Association is calling for
stricter antitrust scrutiny in the computer software industry.

In recent testimony before the Federal Trade Commission, the
SPA called for greater antitrust enforcement for the kinds
of practices that competitors have claimed against Microsoft
Corp.

The SPA conducted a survey of its membership, which includes
companies such as Microsoft, Borland International Inc., Novell
Inc., Symantec Corp., IBM Corp., Netscape Communications Inc.,
America Online Inc. and CompuServe Inc.

The survey results "suggest our membership supports a continued
and indeed in some respects heightened-government antitrust
enforcement presence in the software industry," said Ken Wasch,
president of the SPA.

The FTC held a series of hearings, which ended late last month,
on competitiveness in the IT industry. Though the hearings
have ended, the record remains open until the end of January
for additional comments.

Also, though the FTC is not involved in the ongoing U.S. Department
of Justice investigation of Microsoft, the agency is expected
to share its findings with the Justice Department, sources
said.

Among the organizations that testified before the FTC were the
SPA, Borland, Sun Microsystems Inc., IBM, the Computer and
Communications Industry Association and the Alliance to Promote
Software Innovation (APSI)

The SPA hired Public Opinion Strategies, Alexandria, Va., to
draft the 13 questions for the survey and send them to its
membership. Sources said Microsoft, which sits on the SPA board,
did not agree with some of the questions and that 11 of the
13 questions were changed at least once to accommodate Microsoft.
Microsoft could not be reached for comment.

Most survey respondents said they see greater anticompetitive
practices in the industry compared to 10 years ago. Eight in
10 respondents said "concerns about unlawful, anticompetitive,
or monopolistic activity in the software industry are greater
than they were 10 years ago." However, smaller firms-with revenue
under $10 million a year-said they see greater anticompetitive
activity than do larger firms: 82 percent vs. 71 percent.

"Over-concentration of market power in the hands of one company"
was the top item, mentioned by 56 percent of respondents. In
second place was "control of a computing platform with dominant
market share," with 29 percent of the mentions.

Also, most respondents said they see the emergence of dominant
players as increasing entry barriers for new companies; are
concerned that a company with dominance in computing platforms
may parlay that dominance to control other segments of the
market; and also believe the emergence of a dominant software
company would make it more difficult to introduce new and innovative
products and to allow other companies to compete on a fair
and even basis.

Three quarters of the SPA members that responded to the survey
said "the emergence of dominant players in key segments of
the software industry increases barriers to entry for new software
companies."

For The Record: The Books Are Finally Open

By:
Robert Faletra

For as long as I've been covering the channel, everyone has
been dying to see some real numbers on two companies, Chip
Lacy's Ingram Micro and Bill Tauscher's Vanstar.

In the next few months, both of those wishes will come true
as the two companies make public offerings.

Vanstar's filing with the SEC is on the street now showing some
interesting tidbits.

While Ingram's filing is still a few weeks off, one thing that
the Vanstar and Ingram offering once again will prove is that
the channel's margins are razor thin. This is another reason
why I'm always shaking my head when manufacturers decide that
the best way to get to market is via a direct approach when
the channel is so efficient.

But let's take a look at the Vanstar offering: Nynex, which
owns 6.7 million shares as a result of selling the Nynex Business
Centers to Vanstar several years ago, is selling all of its
shares in the company. If the estimated $12.50 offering holds,
the telephone company stands to walk away with $84.6 million.

Tauscher, the sixth-largest shareholder, will hold nearly $28
million in Vanstar stock (at least on paper) after the public
offering if the $12.50 per share holds.

Interestingly, Nynex is the only major stockholder cashing out.

According to the initial public offering documents, the company
plans to use the proceeds from the offering for one purpose
reducing debt. That includes payment of a $2.4 million note
owed to Nynex .

Vanstar holds a $425 million line of credit with IBM Credit
Corp. Vanstar intends to use proceeds of the offering to repay
amounts outstanding under the ICC financing program agreement.
That agreement, according to the papers, is used to finance
working capital, approximately $358 million of which was outstanding
as of July 31, 1995.

The filing points out that Vanstar has a "Limited History of
Profitability," experiencing losses in fiscal years 1991, 1992
and 1993, as well as during the seven months ending April 30,
1994.

The papers also show, however, that Vanstar recently increased
its business focus on network services and expects to increase
its percentage of operating income from its service business.

That's where the potential investor gain lies and why Vanstar
might just be a good bet for the future despite its past problems.

ROBERT FALETRA can be reached via telephone at (516) 733-8612;

Plugged In: Wait, Lotus Notes Has A Competitor?

By:
Mark Cuban

OK, it's time for Mark to put an end to some unbelievable stupidity
in the marketplace.

The Web is not a competitor to Lotus Notes. It may be at some
point in the future, depending on what Netscape does with Collabra
Share, but as of today, there is nothing about the Web that
can compete with Notes.

Before I explain, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that
the Web owes its very existence to Lotus Notes. How? Very simple.
If Jim Manzi had any marketing skills whatsoever, there would
be no Web. Instead, we would have a global Notes network. It's
a shame Manzi never worked for Microsoft or even for Netscape,
had it existed. He would have learned about building markets
and pre-empting competitors. (The punchline is if Lotus had
been selling Windows, it would cost $795 per copy, until IBM
bought it. . . . But I digress.)

Why is the Web not a competitor to Notes? Take the test. With
Notes I can replicate to my PC any data I have access to. Now
try this at home. Go to any Web page, try to download it, then
look at it on your PC and use it. It's impossible without going
through each document and individually downloading the graphics
and redefining the links. Now just think, you want to download
the sales plan. . . . Yeah, right.

Next, try creating a threaded discussion database on the Web.
Sure, you could use IRC Chat, but without threads. Sure, you
could create a List Serv that could be threaded, but how do
you distribute it?

Next try this: Distribute information among multiple Web servers
and synchronize it. It isn't going to be pretty, if it happens
at all.

All of these people out there who say the Web is a competitor
to Notes probably have not used either. Notes has been misunderstood
by the press. Exchange, Perfect Office and all these Notes
wanna-be's never have amounted to anything more than giveaway
mail clients that the press has declared Notes competitors.

This is not to say that IBM doesn't have challenges with Notes.
It definitely does. They have made a smart move in reducing
the price of the Notes client. They probably should do everything
possible to have it bundled with every business computer sold,
even if it means paying the Compaqs and HPs of the world to
put it on their computers. They probably should do everything
possible to create "Notes-Enabled" Web sites or "Powered-by
Notes" Web sites that highlight the capabilities Notes has
to publish data on the Web, even if it means seeding leading
sites with free software.

So IBM, contrary to what they think, you are still in the driver's
seat. And you are in a race-but at least it's a race you still
can win.

Tell me what you think. E-mail me at mcuban@audionet.com.

MARK CUBAN is president of AudioNet (www.audionet.com), the
largest audio site on the Internet and an Internet Systems
Integration Company.

Letters to the Editor: AT&T comments on Notes and Group Wise



To The Editor:

We would like to comment on your Dec. 11 article regarding AT&T
Corp.'s NetWare Connect Services and Network Notes.

AT&T remains committed to AT&T Network Notes. While we look
to the market to determine applications, our commitment to
AT&T Network Notes and its customers remains firm. AT&T has
not announced any plans to offer GroupWise XTD on its collaborative
messaging platform or on AT&T NetWare Connect Service (ANCS)

The article implies AT&T is setting up a rivalry between AT&T
Network Notes and a planned competitive GroupWise XTD service.
We are not planning a rivalry. That's not our role. The ANCS
platform will provide easy access to many applications in the
future.

AT&T has no plans to "fold both of the services (AT&T Network
Notes and AT&T NetWare Connect Service) together into one infrastructure,"
as your article stated. AT&T NetWare Connect Service will provide
one type of access to AT&T Network Notes. The two will remain
as separate services that leverage each other's technical advantages.

The quote from Rose Klimovich, AT&T ANCS product line director,
was taken out of context. The article quoted Rose stating that
"Network Notes will 'partially share' the same infrastructure
and that users could access Network Notes through ANCS." Again,
ANCS will provide access to AT&T Network Notes.

Gary Hickox, VP,

AT&T Collaboration & Imaging Services

Erik Grimmelman, VP,

AT&T NetWare Connect Service

Editor's Note: CRN stands behind its story, which reported that
AT&T and Novell plan to offer an alternative to AT&T Network
Notes in the form of a version of GroupWise XTD running on
AT&T NetWare Connect Services.

To The Editor:

Your article in the Dec. 11 issue ("The Biggest Stories of 1995")
is far-fetched, and too general.

 "NT's rampage caused Novell to regroup, . . . "

What rampage? Novell, for fiscal year 1995, shipped more NetWare
than at any other time in our history. Our company revenue
grew based primarily on the strength of NetWare 4.1. We shipped
more than 700,000 NetWare server licenses in fiscal year '95,
and NetWare 4.1 accounted for 40 [percent] of those shipments,
driving a year-over-year increase in [NetWare] 4.1 server license
sales of more than 300 [percent] and sales of upgrades to [NetWare]
4.1 from previous versions of NetWare grew nearly 400 [percent]

[Robert] Frankenberg's message since taking [the] helm has been,
and continues to be, "Novell is the leading network software
provider. Novell software provides the infrastructure for a
networked world, enabling our customers to connect with other
people and the information they need, anytime and anyplace."

Novell is a networking company. The Applications Division did
not make sense in this core strategy, though Novell will support
and have an interest in the new owners of the Apps Division.
Remember, the purchase of [WordPerfect] happened before Frankenberg
assumed control.

As for our influence, we are king. We are open to standards
and to working with as many companies as we can so that we
can network the world. Do the companies Oracle, Apple, AT&T,
IBM, SCO, Hewlett-Packard [and] Intel ring a bell? The noninfluence
comes from the press, [which insists] on following the clouded
and ever-diverse strategy of Microsoft. What is their strategy
 . . . desktop, applications, Internet, satellites, Mac, Windows?
If the press would educate themselves with Novell, put our
strategy and our products to test vs. [Microsoft's], someone
could be a hero.

To The Editor:

I enjoyed your article in the Computer Reseller News, about
"what would make Comdex better?" (CRN, Nov. 27, 1995)

I had one additional idea, but first I wanted to disclose that
I am tied to this industry that I thought had a better idea.

Upstairs in the Sands, there was a group of vendors all providing
voice recognition systems all together in one area. I found
that an excellent idea to provide head-to-head competition
between vendors. This allows the person attending to get a
quick comparison of vendors of a particular technology.

I would enjoy seeing more of this type of cooperation between
opposing vendors in setting up their booths within the same
area to provide "comparison shopping."

Again, I am a vendor for voice recognition products, so this
is in effect a slap on our own backs.

This fits in with your own ideas/problems, where it is incredibly
difficult to find a particular booth, or to ensure that you
hit all of the vendors you wish to see.

Random Access: Client/Server's Big Opportunity

By:
Robert C. DeMarzo

There is a certain air that only people in the client/server
community possess. An air of confidence. They walk with a certain
attitude. They fly at a different altitude than the rest of
the market, see through issues that most take for granted or
cannot comprehend. Their adeptness at complex technical issues
and entrenchment in databases, Unix and enterprise networks
have always set this group apart.

This year's annual CRN Client/Server Roundtable, bringing together
the best and brightest in the client/server world, once again
gives our readers the inside edge on the hottest and most exciting
market.

Client/server computing has grown up more than any of us could
imagine. It has taken a quantum leap in only the last 12 months.
Much of this has been driven by the Internet, the rise of service
and support, shorter business process re-engineering cycles
and the promise of Windows NT. Supporting all this is the appearance
of shrink-wrap-like client/server applications, such as a sales
force automation package that runs on top of Oracle, Informix
or Sybase databases. Any reseller out there that does not know
those companies better get with the program.

No longer is anyone consumed with finding some all-encompassing
definition of client/server computing. It simply exists and
has manifested itself in just about every large corporation
in the United States and growing numbers of small and medium
size businesses, as well.

The first part of the CRN Client/Server Roundtable appears in
this week's issue beginning on page 1 with the news stories
and a transcript of what the executives had to say about business
opportunities on the Internet. The client/server bunch is salivating
over the sudden rise of the Internet. They've got the powerful
databases, the tools, the services, the expertise and the ability
to get businesses up and running on the Net. But they believe
the real money to be made today lies in the Intranet, corporate
networks with gateways and access to the Net. Informix Chairman
Phil White states rather plainly, "The biggest market for all
of this is going to be inside companies. They're spending the
money, they've got the need for sales-force automation, customer
service, customer support. That's going to drive a lot of business
big time in '96 and '97."

Resellers looking for business and service models to emulate
would be wise to listen to the players at this year's Client
Server Roundtable. This is where the rubber meets the road,
where resellers are evaluating, quickly delivering business
solutions and recommending products that bring competitive
advantages. This is where the VAR/systems integrator model
has evolved into its most powerful, influential and customer
driven form.

The Industry Speaks Out



"A rental model is not attractive to most corporations."

- Bill Gates, Microsoft Corp. chief executive, on the viability
of downloading and using applets off the Internet.

"The only [positive sales] effect the Internet is having now
is in modems. People are buying [upgrades] every six months."

- Ken Krich, ComputerWare Inc. president, on the Internet.

"I'm not so quick to [predict the] demise [of] Notes.

We have customers who are still deploying Notes . . . who are
not ready to trash what they started and move to the Internet."

- Mark Tebbe, Lante Corp. president

"The best way to offer replication capabilities over the Internet,
which I absolutely agree is a critical function, is to integrate
Notes with the Internet, which we are doing."

- Irving Wladawsky-Berger, head of IBM Corp.'s Internet Division,
on whether IBM would break out the replication capability from
Notes and provide it for the Internet.

Data General boosts reseller efforts for midrange units

By:
JEANETTE BROWN

Westboro, Mass.-Data General Corp. is renewing its focus on
VARs and ISVs by "getting back to its roots, or core strengths,
which have always been in midrange to high-end RISC systems
and the channel," said John Anderson, vice president of Data
General's U.S. Channels Division. "The company was founded
on OEM and channel relationships."

To that end, the Westboro-based company recently restructured
its channel organization under Anderson and boosted reseller
support in several areas.

Data General also is in the throes of a major product transition,
pitching its new Intel-based servers to resellers.

Last quarter, Data General expanded its AViiON family of Unix
based systems with Pentium-based models that run either the
Data General/UX enterprise operating system or Windows NT Server.
They support 15,000 existing AViiON applications, according
to the company.

But the channel is at the core of its aim at the midrange market.
"We're putting a lot more resources and investment into partnerships,"
Anderson said. "Clearly, we have a support problem. We're aggressively
trying to educate our partners."

The company is launching efforts to smooth things over with
resellers, he said. For one, it added more account managers
to enable the company to better understand the resellers' business
and how they integrate its products and services, he added.

Each account manager oversees between two and four accounts,
unlike previously, when they managed about 25 each, Anderson
said. A dedicated technical support manager will oversee resellers'
presales and technical support.

Data General also placed people within its distributors-Gates
FA Distributing Inc. and Western Micro Technology Inc.-to oversee
the Data General line. The company expects to add a third distributor
in the next six months.

In other areas, Data General revamped its reseller contract,
reducing the number of product categories and the dollar value
levels resellers must commit to purchase. Other efforts include
lead generation and consultation on the use of co-op dollars.

"We've allocated a pool of equipment and technical people to
help move products over," he said. "All the major database
products are running on our platform. That's key to getting
channel partners to move over."

Data General wants to focus on training more, as well, Anderson
said. Free seminars will be offered to partners each quarter.
"If we bring the level of expertise up in the VAR community,
it'll help alleviate the support problem," he said.

And to make it easier for resellers to do business with Data
General, the company is beta-testing a configuration and order
entry software product called Trilogy that it expects to roll
out to the channel by April.

While the ratio of direct vs. channel sales fluctuates now between
70-30 and 60-40, Data General hopes to move as much as 55 percent
through the channel in the next year, Anderson said.

Some Data General partners, while acknowledging that the company
may gain more support with its Intel-based line, said Data
General may lose what distinguishes it from the rest of the
pack.

"I'm wondering whether it will cause a glitch for them," said
Leonard LaFrance, executive vice president of ISV Century Analysis
Inc., Pacheco, Calif. "Does it become a commodity because it's
Intel?"

Platinum teams with Digital, Wyle

By:
JOHN LONGWELL

Irvine, Calif.-Platinum Software Corp. is turning to the hardware
distribution channel to reach more VARs with its SQL NT financial
accounting package.

The Irvine, Calif.-based software vendor entered into a joint
marketing agreement with Digital Equipment Corp. and one of
its distributors, Wyle Electronics Inc., to deliver accounting
solutions on the Alpha NT platform to VARs.

Platinum, which dropped an unsuccessful direct-sales effort
in October, has been building a VAR channel for its midrange
SQL accounting package over the past year and said it now has
about 70 VARs.

Under the marketing agreement, Wyle, Irvine, will be providing
Platinum's VARs moving to the Alpha NT platform with market
development funds, technical support, and hardware installation
and fulfillment services. Wyle will not be providing fulfillment
for Platinum software, however.

"What's great about Wyle is they're really making it a plug
and play for our VARs, so even if our VARs haven't traditionally
been involved in selling hardware, they're making it easy for
them to get involved with Alpha equipment," said Kevin Regelsberg,
vice president of sales, Platinum.

Regelsberg said Platinum is marketing its product to Wyle's
VARs, while Wyle expects to pick up customers among Platinum's
VARs. VARs that sign up with Wyle will get $1,500 in marketing
funds to jump-start their efforts, he said.

Digital and Platinum plan to kick off a 20-city tour in February
to promote the Alpha NT and Platinum SQL NT solution to end
users and generate leads for VARs, said Lynn Annecston, business
manager for Digital's Software Partners Group.

Annecston said Digital has worked with Platinum since last spring
and has 18 to 20 North American reference sites.

Fore, Alantec to merge; may boost migration to ATM

By:
Monica Young

Pittsburgh -Fore Systems Inc. and Alantec Corp. said they intend
to merge the two companies to accelerate migration from LAN
to asynchronous-transfer-mode (ATM) networks.

Under terms of the deal, each of 12 million outstanding shares
of Alantec stock will be converted to one share of Fore stock,
and Alantec will become a wholly owned LAN-switching subsidiary
of Fore.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, Fore's revenue was
$75.6 million. For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 1994, Alantec's
revenue was $25.8 million.

Alantec, San Jose, Calif., granted Fore an option to purchase
up to 12 percent of its outstanding shares. George Archuleta,
chairman and chief executive of Alantec, will become a member
of Fore's board of directors once the merger is completed.
Eric Cooper will remain chairman and chief executive of Fore.

Fore acquired Applied Network Technology Inc. in May, which
was the first time Fore became involved in indirect-sales channels.
According to a Fore spokesperson, the company's distribution
models are complementary and no changes are expected in Alantec's
reseller channels.

"I would expect Fore to take advantage of Alantec's high-end
resellers," said Steve Munroe, president of Triumph Technologies
Inc., a Burlington, Mass.-based Alantec integrator. He said
most of Alantec's high-end channel partners have the skill
set to sell Fore's ATM line, so Alantec's channels would be
a good match for Fore.

Munroe said the merger will not likely accelerate ATM migration
for customers that are otherwise not ready to make that leap;
however, it simplifies the process for resellers because they
now can work with a single vendor.

In addition, he said Alantec's ATM migration strategy was based
on Fore's ATM products. "This is a good growth strategy for
Alantec's customers," Munroe said.

Maylex Prepares To Buy BusLogic

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

New York-Mylex Corp. said it has agreed to acquire BusLogic
Inc., a privately held company, in a stock deal worth about
$50 million.

Santa Clara, Calif.-based BusLogic is a supplier of high-performance
SCSI I/O solutions used in network file servers, personal computers
and workstations.

The deal is expected to be completed this month. Once it is
completed, BusLogic said it will continue to operate under
its name and at its present locations as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Fremont, Calif.-based Mylex.

Access To New Technologies

Al Montross, the president of Mylex, said the deal will enable
both companies to access new technologies and capabilities,
to extend market reach and to better capitalize on the strong
growth forecasted for the RAID and controller adapter markets.

Montross said BusLogic specifically adds key SCSI technology
and ASIC development to Mylex's technology base.

Mylex, which produces RAID technology and network management
products, reported $62.5 million in sales during its 1994 fiscal
year and earned $7.5 million.

Vanstar-Ingram partnering pact emphasizes services

By:
Jack Sweeney

London-At first glance, it may resemble a clever shortcut in
the race to support global customers, but when Vanstar Corp.
officially announces Ingram Micro Inc. as its global-fulfillment
partner this month, few channel executives will likely dismiss
the gravity behind one of the industry's top corporate resellers'
outsourcing its core competency.

Besides endorsing the success of Ingram's overseas distribution
model, Vanstar's fulfillment pact seems to underscore that
the business of managing and fulfilling inventory is no longer
the center of the wheel when it comes to reseller business
models. Instead, services are becoming the hub around which
customers are orbiting.

By partnering with Ingram, Vanstar executives said they will
soon match the more uniform fulfillment strategies of services
giants such as EDS Corp. and distance itself from the less
seamless fulfillment schemes of its reseller rivals such as
Entex Information Services Inc. and Inacom Corp., which now
support global customers through overseas affiliates.

"We have a list of about 25 different resellers right now that
are Europe- as well as U.S.-based; and of those, we expect
a fair number to become [fulfillment] partners of ours in 1996,"
said John Winkelhaus, senior vice president of Ingram Micro
Europe. "We are helping them leapfrog certain U.S. competitors
because even though we are charging them for fulfillment, it
will be less costly than if they tried to do it themselves
and we already have it in place, allowing them to focus on
supplying IT services."

Richard Simms, chairman and chief executive of Software Spectrum
Inc., a Dallas-based software reseller that today allows Ingram
to supply product fulfillment services to its European customers,
said, "It is almost inconceivable to me that Software Spectrum
would ever start operating distribution centers in Europe or
anywhere else in the world."

Christine Ferrusi Ross, an analyst with Dataquest Corp., Framingham,
Mass., said growth in the number of offshore fulfillment pacts
reflects a growing urgency among national resellers to provide
global solutions. "I think you can either be a global player
today or you can be a local regional player, but you can't
really compete on a national level anymore unless you're willing
to compete globally," said Ferrusi Ross.

Vanstar's rivals praised the reseller's initiative and the speed
with which it hoped to link up with Ingram, but said it was
too early to determine the model's effectiveness.

Peter Alexander, the former head of Vanstar's Global subsidiary
ComputerLand International, said the model might resemble the
one now being built by Ameridata Corp., which last June hired
Alexander to run its global operations.

"I think, generally, Vanstar's direction is the same one we've
been following and the question that has to be raised is what
exactly will the new Vanstar model entail? Will it be one organization
'umbrella-ing' its franchisees, or is it a hybrid between the
Vanstar and its franchisees?" said Alexander.

Last month, Vanstar Chairman William Tauscher said Vanstar's
model would try to leverage the different skill sets of ComputerLand
International's franchisees.

"The product supply network that we are putting together on
a worldwide basis will be available to our franchisees for
Pan-European arrangements and, in addition to that, we will
be enlisting our franchisees as high-end providers in conjunction
with our own high-end network operations that we are now opening
up in multiple countries," said Tauscher.

Channel sets sights on a more prosperous 1996 -- Putting problem
plagued 1995 behind the industry

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second part of a look at business
issues facing the industry.

New York-If 1996 is any different than 1995 for the industry's
leading channel players, it has to be an improvement.

After suffering through a year of slow systems conversions,
open sourcing, intense pricing pressures and numerous quarterly
losses, channel companies are looking forward to putting 1995
behind them in hopes of a better 1996. Indications are things
will improve.

Vanstar Corp., Pleasanton, Calif., has already filed for an
initial public offering. And many channel observers feel that
move, combined with the expected IPO of Ingram Micro Inc.,
Santa Ana, Calif., in the coming months, will help the entire
sector. Entex Information Services Inc., Rye Brook, N.Y., may
also enter the public market this year.

In addition, recent results from Tech Data Corp., Clearwater,
Fla., indicate the company is back on track. CompuCom Systems
Inc., Dallas, is projected to continue to benefit from its
emphasis on integration and services. Meanwhile, other channel
players hope to return to profitability with service offerings
of their own.

"1996 is the year for service and support," said Benny Lorenzo,
portfolio manager at PAW Partners L.P., based in Greenwich,
Conn.

Other signs also point to an improved year. Jim Daniel, chief
financial officer at MicroAge Inc., Tempe, Ariz., said an emerging
upgrade cycle coupled with IBM Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.'s
plans to re-embrace the channel, are positive signs.

"It's clearly going to be a better year than 1995," Daniel said.

However, not all analysts are convinced the channel's struggles
are a thing of the past.

Robert Anastasi, senior vice president at The Robinson-Humphrey
Co. Inc., Atlanta, said the corporate resellers seem to be
best-positioned for the upcoming year.

"It will be a good year for them from a financial standpoint
and a market receptivity standpoint," Anastasi said.

However, Anastasi said he believes questions remain about the
rest of the sector.

"For the wholesalers, I think you will have a year of haves
and have-nots," Anastasi said, explaining that Ingram and Tech
Data will enjoy success, but Merisel Inc., El Segundo, Calif.,
still needs to improve on its execution.

In addition, Anastasi said that he was still unsure when the
master resellers would be able to complete their new business
models now that open sourcing has become a reality.

"I think '96 is still a bit of a transitional year for the master
resellers," said Anastasi.

HIGHEST IN SOFTWARE, TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- New Year to bring
wave of mergers, acquistions

By:
ERIC HAUSMAN

New York-By the time 1996 comes to a close, industry insiders
may be referring to it as the year of the merger, if a recent
report by Broadview Associates Inc. turns out to be correct.

The Fort Lee, N.J.-based merger and acquisition advisor said
64 percent of information technology companies are "very likely"
to pursue mergers or acquisitions over the next 12 months.

Broadview said several trends in the industry are creating the
need or desire to merge, including the rush to the Internet,
client/server technologies being fully deployed, the convergence
of media and technology and the accelerating pace of technological
change.

The strong pace of acquisitions will be a continuation of what
took place during 1995. Broadview recorded 684 transactions
in the IT industry during the first half of 1995 alone, compared
with 760 total transactions in all of 1994.

The study predicts the highest rates of merger and acquisition
activity will occur in the software products and services,
and telecommunications sectors. In that area, nearly one-third
of the companies reported they are "more likely" to pursue
such a transaction during the upcoming year than in the previous
year.

The media and content services sector, which includes print,
digital and online media, is also expected to show a high rate
of merger activity.

The most popular reason cited for seeking a merger or acquisition
was to "increase earnings"; to "increase revenue" also was
often selected. Other reasons given included "attainment of
leadership in an existing market" and "presence in a converging
market."

Broadview's study also found the largest IT companies are the
most likely to pursue acquisitions, with 78 percent of those
companies with at least $500 million in annual sales saying
they are "very likely" to pursue acquisitions this year.

Stock appears to be an increasingly preferred method for transactions.
One-quarter of the companies in the study said they will fund
their deals solely with stock, up from just 11 percent that
said they completed transactions this way in the past.

BASED ON INTERNAL MODEL -- CTP creates tool for knowledge sharing
on Net

By:
KEVIN MERRILL

Cambridge, Mass.-Cambridge Technology Partners is bundling consulting
and training on a new Internet application.

The application is designed to let corporations harness internal
knowledge, from software to human resource policies, and allow
employees access across the World Wide Web.

The first customers started receiving five-day training on KnowledgeShare,
as the Internet solution is called, within the past two weeks.
CTP, a systems integrator, consultancy and custom application
developer, built the service based on its own similar internal
tool.

"[KnowledgeShare] is a starting point for a strategic direction
we're taking to deploy Internet-based technology as a legitimate
platform for building business applications for our clients,"
said Bob Gett, president of CTP North America.

CTP has set fixed prices, but may bill for additional consulting
time, based on how much assistance the company needs in capturing
and storing its data. The KnowledgeShare service prices range
from $150,000 to $200,000. The amounts do not include the hardware
to store the data, or the browsers that employees would need
to access the system.

The service, a combination of software, training and consulting,
differs from a traditional corporate home page in three ways,
Gett said: the consultancy work that is built around it; the
five-day training and reduced development time, compared with
Web pages; and the document-creating software engines.

Gett said CTP has built firewalls and other security measures
to protect the data repository, adding KnowledgeShare can be
used for limited or open internal access or as a public Web
site.

The company plans to add enhanced document-search and imaging
scanning capabilities in future versions. KnowledgeShare uses
CTP's document-management software as the back-end data storage
and search engine.

"What a KnowledgeShare user sees is not a static list of HTML
pages," said Bruce Rosen, a senior technical consultant for
CTP and development manager for KnowledgeShare. "Running in
the back is a document-management engine. We've written an
interface between the Web and the back-end engine."

Among the possible data storage uses are company practices and
policies, sales presentations and reusable software components.

The five-day training is structured as a hands-on seminar. CTP
consults with companies to help them through the process of
identifying knowledge, processing it and then merging it into
KnowledgeShare.

"We're not teaching clients how to write HTML code," Rosen said.
"We're teaching them how to use knowledge within their company."

The type of employees sent to training represent three categories
 someone from within the IS department who knows the corporate
server configuration and network aspects; a person who can
identify the resources within a company to assist in the knowledge
gathering process; and a trainer who is expected to coordinate
post-training within the corporation.

CTP also is developing a video for companies to use to train
other employees.

Memorex-Telex targets integrators with service -- Resources
diverted from network management

By:
KEVIN MERRILL

Irving, Texas-A services reselling program from Memorex-Telex
Corp. is allowing integrators and VARs to divert resources
away from routine network management and maintenance.

Companies like Sun Data Inc., an Atlanta-based integrator, instead
are building internal expertise in systems consulting and project
management and implementation, and outsourcing service pieces
to Memorex-Telex, Irving.

"It doesn't make sense to fly our people all over the country
to do a LAN setup," said Robert Spessard Jr., vice president,
marketing and professional services at Sun Data.

Memorex-Telex launched its Gold Services Partner Program earlier
this year, after starting a beta cycle about a year ago and
receiving input from a group representing customers, including
resellers. The program is an offshoot of its 18-month-old Advanced
Services program, which was itself a push by Memorex-Telex
into services.

"When our resellers look at us, they don't say, 'Can you fix
a computer in Bangor, Maine?' Instead, they're asking us to
help design and monitor and keep systems up and running," said
Preston Lawhorne, director of channel sales and development.

Resellers get 5 percent to 15 percent off list price when reselling
services, broken into four categories: strategic services,
network integration, performance control and education.

"The deals that we're winning are ones we would not have won
direct," Lawhorne said.

Sun Data's decision to use Memorex-Telex services is coupled
with its own internal strategy of strengthening its integrated
solution-selling business through building competencies in
the open systems world. To do that, they placed an emphasis
on recruiting and placing senior-level service personnel to
provide the higher-level consulting and project design work
for customers, as well as some limited service work.

"You have to have those people on board," Spessard said. "You
can't outsource that." The company expects to double the size
of its professional service staff this year.

The decision to focus on building a senior-level service staff
as opposed to a service army, when coupled with the move to
outsource some service engagements to Memorex-Telex, has allowed
it to speed its consulting and project management.

It also gave Sun Data broader geographic coverage and additional
system expertise. Those resources give its budding consulting
and project management work greater appeal, Spessard said.
The reasons to contract with Memorex-Telex are similar with
other integrators.

"For me to hire [Certified Novell Engineers] and [Enterprise
CNEs] would have been a nightmare," said Robert Bova, director
of network integration at Oliver Allen Corp., Larkspur, Calif.
"Instead of reinventing the wheel, why bother?"

Oliver Allen brings Memorex-Telex into the bidding process,
and has it provide quotes on services before a final package
is submitted to the customer.

Bova said Oliver Allen started its Memorex-Telex relationship
first by selling some of its products, and then transitioned
into reselling service packages. "By throwing services into
the mix, it makes us an even better customer," he said.

Memorex-Telex, which established a service and support partnership
with Novell Inc., expects to establish a similar relationship
with Microsoft Corp. for Windows NT support, Lawhorne said.

SOFTWARE ARTISTRY PLANS CHANNEL PUSH -- Tool For Asset Management

By:
Kevin Merrill

Software Artistry Inc. is planning a channel push to coincide
with the release of its asset management tool, Expert Foundation
Manager.

The Indianapolis-based developer of service and support solutions
is using its Expert Partners Program to identify and work with
companies that provide complementary hardware, software or
service solutions.

At its annual sales meeting this week, current and potential
Expert Partners will explain their products and services to
Software Artistry's direct sales force. That sales force will
then make referrals to partners based on areas of expertise,
from asset inventory services to hardware procurement and help
desk outsourcing.

"We're providing a very strong tool for them to be successful
in managing that outsourcing engagement," said Rich Cunningham,
Expert Partners program manager. "Through these alliances,
we're able to sell a lot of our product."

Infolink Corp., an asset-management services firm based in Denver,
started to resell Foundation Manager to complement the information
collecting tools and services it provides.

"We think our services fit hand-in-glove," said Joe Castro,
Infolink's president and chief executive.

Asset management is becoming a potential value-added service
of integrators and VARs who help corporations identify and
manage IT assets, and then build on those services by providing
hardware, software or support.

CompuCom Systems Inc., the Dallas-based integrator and corporate
reseller, started reselling SA-Expert Advisor-a support center
tool-several years ago to deploy it in help-desk operations
it provided for corporate customers. CompuCom is expanding
its SA relationship to include SA-Expert Foundation Manager.

"Anywhere they have a customer, we see a great fit," said Brian
O'Connell, vice president of support center services.

It was Software Artistry's relationship with companies like
CompuCom that helped to shape and give momentum to the creation
of the Expert Partners Program.

"Asset management is definitely a concept that's here," O'Connell
said.

"If I'm going to build a call center, I want to do it with a
forward-looking view. But to get the benefit, companies will
have to establish a process by which they compile the information,"
O'Connell added.

The Expert Partners Program started forming in August.

The certification categories include Certified Product Provider,
Services Provider and Outsourcing Services Provider.

Training covers technical and sales and marketing subjects,
Cunningham said. "The whole area of asset management is growing.

"Just putting a tool out there is not enough for companies to
put an asset management program in place," he added.

Partners get access to early releases and co-op marketing calendars,
Cunningham said.

Help Desk



CRN's "Help Desk" forum provides Service & Support-related answers
to industry issues. This week's answer is provided by Dave
Fletcher, vice president at Science Applications International
Corp., Albuquerque, N.M.

Q: What are the issues to consider when marketing service and
support offerings?

A: Market to gain support for new services, and to increase
participation in and clarify your service offerings, and developing
relationships. The basis of marketing has to be relationships.
Anything that furthers a relationship, not just sells a product,
is where they need to focus.

The first thing you have to do is differentiate all your service
and support offerings. And most organizations don't. They do
a blanket marketing, whether it's a brochure, flier or poster.

One of the first things to do is understand the industry and
understand the industry benchmarks. You need to be competitive
and be able to present someone a case that you can not only
provide the expertise, because I think that's a given. When
people start to look outside to outsource, they've already
agreed that you are the expert. In addition, you have to prove
that you're cost-effective.

If it's outsourcing just the help desk, then you want to market
to someone that's looking to outsource to you.

You have to be able to identify how the help desk will provide
value to the other parts of the organization.

DEAL ECHOES INTEL-CNN -- Realtime news spans Internet

By:
CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

Redmond, Wash.-Microsoft Corp. and NBC have a strategy to make
PCs more interactive and informative with live and continuous
news, but they are not the first.

Intel Corp. and Turner Broadecasting Inc.'s Cable News Network
first brought news to the PC about a year ago. CNN at Work,
which was rolled out last June, brings CNN headline news, features
and stock reports to corporate PCs across the local-area network.
Corporate servers receive the broadcast feed through cable
or a satellite hookup.

Atlanta-based CNN then rolled out the project's newest feature,
a new financial network called CNN FN (financial news). The
new network was added to Intel's CNN at Work.

And just last month, Intel enhanced the service with the ability
to conduct personal profiles so the software automatically
grabs information of importance to a particular user for his
review later. For example, if a user is interested in videoconferencing,
the service will download every story with that key word included
in the text and save it for the individual.

CNN at Work subscriptions are priced at an individual subscription
rate of $12.50 per month. The Multimedia specialized gateway
that transforms the analog signal to CNN at Work's digital
format is priced at $4,995. But unlike Microsoft, Intel has
not discussed plans to move across the Internet.

Microsoft, based here, is looking to make significant strides
after much industry criticism for being late to enter the Internet
market. With broadcast giant NBC, the two will launch a 24
hour news and information channel for the television, and an
online news service distributed on The Microsoft Network for
PCs.

The cable service, MS-NBC Cable, will roll out within six months,
aiming for 35 million subscribers by the year 2000. Microsoft
will pay $220 million over five years with a 50 percent interest
in MS-NBC Cable. NBC will invest $200 million over the next
five years. NBC is in charge of the news content.

"We're bringing the interactive world into integration with
broadcast-by interactivity, we mean the Internet," said Bill
Gates, chief executive of Microsoft. "Over time, video will
be an important data type, as well as audio and text already
available there [on the Internet]."

He added that this type of technology will make the news "far
more attractive.''

Grappling for Net share -- Microsoft, Spyglass expand licensing
agreement

By:
CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

Naperville, Ill.-As competition heats up, companies continue
to jockey for positioning in the ever-expanding marketplace
of the Internet.

Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., and Spyglass Inc., based here,
have expanded their licensing agreement established earlier
this year-a move that signals a further separation between
Microsoft and Internet rival Netscape Communications Corp.

Microsoft reportedly is planning to adopt the programming technology
of Sun Microsystems Inc., called Java, yet the company continues
to steer clear of Netscape's technology.

Microsoft and Netscape have taken opposite stands on technology
surrounding the Internet. For example, the companies are working
in two different camps on a security standard that would ensure
secure credit-card transactions over the Internet.

Browser technology by Spyglass, called Mosaic, is already at
the core of Microsoft's Explorer browser software, used within
The Microsoft Network. This month's agreement names Spyglass
as Microsoft's primary technology supplier for World Wide Web
technologies, officials said.

"We are focused on providing the client and server technology
that is incorporated into their products," said Marc Miller,
executive vice president of Spyglass.

The joint development efforts include Visual Basic Scripting,
OLE Controls, SSL/PCT, STT and Blackbird viewing technologies
integrated with HTML.

Spyglass also will create a Microsoft-compatible Unix and Windows
NT Web server to be sold through Microsoft's distribution channel,
Spyglass said.

Web Sites: DataQuest, O'Reilly, Word

By:
KEN YAMADA

This week, CRN reviews three Web sites that contain useful information
for resellers about computer industry news and trends, and
an unusual site developed by a VAR.

The first site reviewed was developed by Dataquest Inc., a San
Jose, Calif., market-research firm whose research analysts
are often quoted in the media.

The second site reviewed was developed by O'Reilly & Associates
Inc., Sebastapol, Calif., a publisher of technical books and
software. The third site is an online magazine created by New
York systems integrator ICon CMT Corp.

Dataquest Inc.

The Dataquest home page lacks the impressive graphics and design
features of other Web sites, and, instead, simply serves up
what it does best-computer industry information.

Dataquest researches information about trends related to various
aspects of the computer industry, such as tracking sales of
CD-ROM drives, PC systems, software and other products. In
report form, this type of information is of great value. On
the Web site however, highlights from the reports, which contain
snippets of analysis and statistics, are accessible for free.
The site also contains useful information from past Dataquest
newsletters.

O'Reilly & Associates Inc.

Initially born as a publisher of books for the computer industry,
O'Reilly has aggressively embraced the Web by developing its
own Web browser, and now, this Web site.

At this in-house-created site, O'Reilly offers an online magazine,
"ora.com," which contains articles related to programming,
networking, Web publishing and other technical subjects written
by company editors and authors, and by guest experts. But some
links with promising names, such as "sales channels" and "online
market research," appear as marketing vehicles to sell O'Reilly
reports.

Word

This quirky site demonstrates how the Internet can bring out
the creative side of a systems integrator.

Developed by ICon CMT Corp., formerly known as ICon International,
New York, this site functions as an online magazine a la Wired.
While focusing more on lifestyles and trendy, youth-oriented
topics than does Wired, it follows Wired's lead in creative
use of graphics, sassy attitude and offbeat stories.

With no publishing experience, but a lot of technical expertise,
ICon dived into the world of digital publishing with this site.
Word, with its fancy graphics, sound and other multimedia features,
eats up valuable bandwidth and processing power while at the
same time offering an interesting experience-provided you are
willing to wait for it.

Broadcast video to hit Internet -- Technology will create new
opportunities for resellers to enhance clients' Web Sites

By:
CHARLOTTE DUNLAP

San Mateo, Calif.-Video broadcasting over the Internet is expected
to become prevalent as early as 1996, and VARs that want to
spice up their Internet portfolios are now able to get their
hands on the technology.

Such advanced multimedia technologies have had a hard time flying
in the traditional enterprise network arena.

The idea of viewing video over a PC is largely considered a
luxury item and certainly a low priority to corporate heads
when products come with high price tags. But the Internet's
World Wide Web not only encourages slick graphics, interaction
and sophisticated realtime applications, but it also distributes
content at affordable prices-if the data is compressed enough.

"Streaming audio hit the Net in '95, and '96 will be the year
for streaming video," said Jeff Pulver, publisher of Netwatch,
an online electronic newsletter on new technologies, based
in Great Neck, N.Y. "This is truly a step forward; such technologies
introduced on the Net are leading-edge, providing increasing
value to everyone from pure technologists to end users."

"Streaming" means video is being downloaded and viewed simultaneously.
To date, video is typically viewed over the Internet through
a store-and-forward method, which takes a long time to transmit
before it can be viewed. A three-minute video clip can take
about a half-hour to download before it is seen.

Video over the Internet will give VARs and systems integrators
the ability to enhance clients' Web sites with very sophisticated
next-generation realtime applications.

By running the technology over either the Internet or private
TCP/IP networks, radio stations can send live radio broadcasts,
and news services can send full-motion video feeds of financial
programs to financial traders.

Pioneers of the technology include entertainment companies,
broadcasters and advertisers; however, experts anticipate more
widespread use of the technology beginning next year due to
some early products by vendors such as Xing Technology Corp.
and VDOnet Corp.

At the core of Santa Clara, Calif.-based VDOnet's desktop video
broadcasting flagship product, called VDOLive, is a scalable
compression algorithm that compresses video small enough to
run over the small bandwidth portions of the Internet, as well
as increase the quality of video with expanded bandwidth.

A communications protocol within the technology maintains the
integrity of the video as it weaves through the complex network
of the Internet, officials said.

VDOLive video can run in realtime at 15 frames per second over
analog with a 28.8-Kbit-per-second modem, but this is when
the Internet is not in its rush hour, noted Asaf Mohr, president
and chief executive of VDOnet. The technology is currently
in beta-testing, slated for availability in early 1996.

Arroyo Grande, Calif.-based Xing is a leading supplier of MPEG
player software to video board and video software companies.
It unveiled a product called StreamWorks, which, like VDOLive,
works with existing Web servers and browsers, and runs over
analog and ISDN or greater infrastructures.

StreamWorks is based on software-based MPEG (Motion Picture
Experts Group) video and audio compression.

The cost of the technology is about $3,500 for the server software,
and the client software is downloaded free by the user via
a company's home page.

Recently, Netscape Communications Corp. allowed for plug-in
capabilities to be built to its Netscape Navigator 2.0. Because
VDOLive and StreamWorks support the popular browser, VARs can
more easily build the video features into clients' Web sites.

Two-way video-not to be confused with one-way broadcast video
is also slowly unfolding over the Net.

Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., decided the best way
to make its mark in the highly competitive videoconferencing
arena is to make its product Internet-ready.

Officials claim that since the availability of its QuickTime
Conferencing kit last month, it has seen a rush of orders not
only from business interests, but consumers as well.

Now the company plans to extend the technology into wider markets
and infrastructures.

A source close to the company said creating a version of QTC
for regular analog is "squarely on the road map for 1996."
Apple officials have also said they will likely offer a Windows
based version of the product.

CU-SeeMe is another desktop videoconferencing applications that
runs over the Internet. The application was developed at Cornell
University and is licensed to White Pine Software, Nashua,
N.H.

Var Has Religious Experience -- Husky Labs broadcast live video
Pope over Internet

By:
Charlotte Dunlap

Without a doubt, David Levine's biggest integration project
to date has to be broadcasting live video coverage over the
Internet of Pope John Paul II during his U.S. visit this fall.

After all, the VAR estimates about 10,000 Net users viewed the
live video broadcast, which was accomplished using technology
very new to the Internet.

Levine, president of Husky Labs, Shepards, W.Va., achieved the
amazing feat of piping streaming video over the Internet via
the technology of Xing Technology Corp. Its flagship product,
called StreamWorks, accomplishes a level of compression that
allowed Levine to deliver the Pope across the Internet at three
high-quality frames of video per second and continuous audio.

"Video is like icing on the cake, once you have your Web server.
Anyone can become a broadcaster and compete with CBS and NBC,"
Levine said, referring to the technique as "datacasting."

Levine used the downlink feed from the broadcast satellite in
New Jersey through a hardware encoder. Internet users could
tap the video via the Web server of Levine's client, the Catholic
Information Center, using popular Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator.

MODULAR LINES CAN REPRESENT STRONG INCREMENTAL REVENUE -- Groupware
on a smaller scale

By:
BARBARA DARROW

Waltham, Mass-There is a bevy of new products VARs can offer
accounts that need to facilitate collaboration but do not want
to go to a full-blown groupware package.

Many accounts have departments that need some workflow, some
discussion threads or other facets of groupware without needing
to go the full nine yards, analysts said. And modular products
that go into existing accounts, where the VAR has sold networking
infrastructure or mail, can represent profitable incremental
revenue.

Hyperdesk Corp., Westborough, Mass., is now beta-testing a new
version of its GroupWorks project-management software with
support for Windows 95 and NT and the ability to send OLE objects,
sound bites and other attachments. GroupWorks 2.0 lets teams
schedule people and tasks, using existing E-mail as its backbone.
The product can now utilize an address book complying with
the Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) or Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI), said Tom Rose, director of product
marketing.

Internet integration is also a new perk. Users can link World
Wide Web addresses with task assignments, contact pages or
discussion topics. The recipient then clicks on the icon to
launch the browser and open the linked Web page.

"With the ability to be customized, it can be implemented in
vertical markets. . . . [VARs could do] a custom accounting
version or a legal version with ticklers for the courts," said
Bryan Quibell, president of MCC Electronic Publishing Group,
a Spring Grove, Pa.-based VAR specializing in legal- and electronic
publishing verticals. "We weren't looking for a product to
resell, more for an internal implementation, but I was so impressed
we will resell it," Quibell said.

GroupWorks addresses a different niche than Collabra Software
Inc.'s Collabra Share, which provides threaded discussions,
said Jim Garden, an analyst with Workgroup Technologies Inc.,
Hampton, N.H. "This is more a project orientation for team
management. Typically when you work with a team you need to
gather their status, find out where they are." GroupWorks provides
dispersed teams with an asynchronous way to meet and share
information, he said.

Of course, the definition of groupware is always an issue in
discussing such projects. No two definitions of the term seem
the same. Eric Brown, a senior analyst at Forrester Research
Inc., Cambridge, Mass., defines groupware as "a passive, infrastructural
activity." Into that category, he would put phones, LANs and
other pipelines that help people communicate across departments,
time and geography. Applications like GroupWorks are "more
structured. These are nice project-management tools, and GroupWorks
is unique in that it pulls together documents, people, and
calendaring and scheduling in one topic-oriented presentation,"
he said.

GroupWorks had gone mostly direct, but the company has lined
up 16 reseller partners and is looking for more, Rose said.

Future plans call for tighter integration with existing project
management applications, such as Microsoft Project, analysts
said. In addition, more integration with the Internet will
be added, so teams connected only by the public network can
link up and share project data.

New pricing for the product, due out this month, is $199 for
the first license and $99 for each additional license. Volume
discounts are available. VARs can download a trial copy from
the Web for free at http://www.hyperdesk.com. That copy can
be used for 30 days.

Also in groupware, Teamaker Corp., Beaverton, Ore., is offering
scheduling and time-tracking software for the office. Office
Hours gives users access to four programs: an In/Out Board
to note location status; an Employee Browser showing location
and phone/pager information for personnel; a TimeCard Module
to analyze productivity and track billable hours; and a Company
Events calendar to boost employee awareness of events and functions.
A 16-bit Windows 3.X version is available now, and a Windows
95 version is due next year. One copy running on the server
will support up to 50 users. The 16-bit version lists for $149.95
per server.

Commence Corp., formerly Jensen-Jones Inc., Red Bank, N.J.,
offers group-enabled information-management software that also
helps groups keep on track with projects. Commence 3.0 Workgroup
Information management software offers project management,
agent-based task automation, contact management, and calendaring
and scheduling. Suggested retail price is $295 for the personal
version and $395 for client and server components.

McAfee Revs Its Network Management Product Line

By:
SHAWN WILLETT

Santa Clara, Calif.-McAfee Associates Inc. revved three of its
network management products and shipped the first of its new
universal management consoles.

The company's SiteInventory 4.0 is based on technology acquired
from BrightWork Development Inc., which McAfee bought last
year. The product gathers information about the hardware and
software on PC networks and servers and puts them into reports.

Version 4.0 includes the new McAfee Systems Management Console,
which will eventually be the console for all of McAfee's products.

"Eventually you will be able to drill down into the console
and get several views of the network using information gathered
from all the McAfee products," said Tracey Mustacchio, product
manager for SiteInventory. The console is Windows-based and
is OLE (object linking and embedding)-enabled, she added.

Version 4.0 also allows for reporting of several servers at
a time. "Before, you had to take an extra step and consolidate
reports," said Mustacchio.

Support for Novell Inc.'s NetWare Directory Services (NDS),
TCP/IP and IPX and additional hardware recognition capabilities
are all part of the new release. Pricing has not yet been determined.

McAfee also unveiled SiteMeter 5.1, a new version of its software
metering and compliance software. Version 5.1 supports SNMP
(standard network management protocol), meaning it sends software
usage information up to enterprise consoles such as Hewlett
Packard Co.'s OpenView or IBM Corp.'s NetView.

Reports on software usage can be captured in an XBase format,
allowing FoxPro, dBase and other databases to import data.
The new version also meters applications stored on users' local
drives. Pricing starts at $20 a node for a two-year subscription
fee.

McAfee introduced version 5.5 of its Saber LAN Workstation product,
which it acquired from Saber Software Inc.

"This is the first McAfee integrated product. We also wanted
to prepare the installed base for our Windows 95 product,"
said Liz Bross, product manager for the Saber LAN Workstation
line. The version that will manage Windows 95 desktops is due
in the first quarter of next year, said McAfee officials. Bross
said the new version includes several modules from the McAfee
side of the house. Saber LAN Workstation is sold on a two-year
subscription basis at a price of $47 per node.

Microsoft Teams With Wall Data

By:
Shawn Willett

San Mateo, Calif.-Microsoft Corp. and Wall Data Inc. joined
forces to offer a host connectivity bundle. The bundle includes
Microsoft's SNA Server, which provides a server connection
to an IBM mainframe, and Wall Data's Rumba, client emulation
software that allows PCs to access mainframe applications.
Dubbed the Rumba-SNA Server Solution Pack, it will sell for
$1,484 for a server and a five-user license of Rumba Office.

"What the channel will get is a single SKU, with two boxes and
all the appropriate licenses," said York Baur, Wall Data's
vice president of product marketing.

The bundle will be sold exclusively through distributor Tech
Data Corp.

The bundle will be tested, and both support staffs will be trained
to deal with the other company's products. "For the reseller
channel, there is going to be a much higher degree of success
and lower level of support to deal with," said Baur.

Monitors: The Squeeze Is On

By:
William Terdoslavich

The monitor is a commodity product, which by nature is going
to carry a low margin. Unfortunately, no PC can go out the
door without one.

The worst-case scenario for a VAR is to try to get as close
to break-even on the monitor portion of the contract, or find
something else to make up for the margin. Other VARs have found
better ways to prop up their monitor margins.

One problem VARs have is unwanted retail competition. The VAR
runs the risk of seeing its monitor offering undercut by a
lower price at a nearby retail outlet, said H.B. Peters, owner
of Matrix Enterprises, Shelton, Wash. "It's hard to compete
like that," he said.

Even the gap between the reseller's price and the SRP is too
close for comfort. It is not unusual to purchase a high-end
monitor for $675 and sell it at the SRP for $699, a gap of
$24 that also has to cover shipping costs, Peters noted.

"It would be nice to make a couple of dollars on the side as
they [the monitors] go by instead of paying the freight," Peters
said.

At Entre Computer Center, Albuquerque, N.M., monitor margins
are just fine, thank you. But that is because Entre has a different
approach to carrying monitors.

"Most monitors we are using are our own private label," said
Pat Bachechi, manager. Entre gets its monitors from Intelligent
Electronics Inc., Exton, Pa., which in turn OEMs the units
from a manufacturer. The monitors come in without labels, allowing
Entre to stamp its own name on them, Bachechi explained. The
unit even comes with a three-year warranty.

Monitor margins are just fine for Mega Micro Computer, though
being located in Great Falls, Mont., may have something to
do with it. Owner David Rasmussen said he is enjoying margins
of 15 percent to 18 percent on 14-inch monitors, and 20 percent
to 25 percent on 17-inch monitors and above.

Exploiting demand is the key to this technique. Rasmussen carries
a very limited inventory of the larger monitors. "I only keep
one on hand," he said, "usually something I know I can move."
For larger monitors, Rasmussen said he handles either Viewsonic
Corp. or NEC Technologies Inc. As for the smaller monitors,
margin is maintained through "good salesmanship," he added.

The Future Now, based in Cincinnati, is in the same boat as
other VARs. Monitor margins are ranging only from three to
seven points, said Linda Newsome, executive assistant to the
director of sales. "We sell them based on what the market will
carry."

Margins are above the seven-point mark when handling larger
monitors "because it is a limited field," Newsome said. After
that, The Future Now, acquired by Intelligent Electronics,
leans on its relationship with its new owner. "With Intelligent
Electronics, the wheels are greased by its distribution system.
The freight is passed on to the customer," she said.

Among vendors, providing the VAR channel with an incentive to
carry a monitor can take on a number of different forms. Some
vendors will rely on promotional features to send some dollars
back to the VAR. Still other vendors will find a way of crafting
price and availability to keep margins higher without reliance
on promotional tools.

Spiffs are one tool used by NEC, Wood Dale, Ill. A recent promotion
for the MultiSynch XV17 monitor offers the VAR $25 for every
monitor sold, said Pam Himmel, marketing manager.

Still another technique NEC has used is to pick up the freight
charges for monitor shipment. This may sound modest, but Himmel
pointed out that a 21-inch monitor can weigh around 80 pounds,
so freight becomes a significant cost of handling.

While spiffs and freight deals are some ways NEC can place or
leave cash in a reseller's pocket, the monitor's sticker price
can also play a role. By pitching a quality unit to the market,
"we frequently charge a premium for our product," Himmel said.
The higher price tag in turn translates into more margin dollars
for the VAR.

MAG InnoVision Inc. launched an improved version of its reseller
program. Called the Ultimate Reseller Program, MAG will be
providing immediate phone assistance to its authorized resellers
on a priority basis, and forwarding corporate and end-user
calls to authorized resellers. A corporate development program
will provide assistance to resellers in closing corporate sales.

Samsung Electronics America Inc., Ridgefield, N.J., is running
two national promotions, said John Grundy, senior national
marketing manager. One uses the monitor invoice as a raffle
ticket for a free BMW, with one car a month being given away
over five months. The second promotion is "a trade-up program
aimed at corporate accounts" to upgrade to a 17-inch monitor,
Grundy said. Any color 14-inch or 15-inch monitor bearing the
IBM, Compaq, Sony or NEC brand names can be traded in to qualify
for a $75 or $100 check when purchasing a 17-inch monitor.
"It's a sales tool for the VAR" to stir the installed base,
he added.

Without promotions, Samsung costs about 10 percent to 15 percent
less than its competitors, Grundy contended. "[But] it is not
necessary to pass on the cost savings to a corporate account,"
he said. "Most VARs get double-digit margins with Samsung monitors."

At ADI Systems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., resellers get a
break on demo units as a channel promotion. Up to two units
per model per year can be purchased at a discount to be used
as demo models, said Michelle Maldonado, channel marketing
manager.

Sony Electronics Inc., San Jose, Calif., has developed promotions
awarding redeemable points to resellers handling Sony monitors
that can be exchanged for other Sony-brand consumer goods,
said Chris Stocker, director of channel marketing.

But the real purpose is to build up a list of individual resellers,
rather than their companies, that Sony can contact directly
via their home addresses, Stocker pointed out. With a list
of 3,800 names, Sony can craft promotions for its monitors
that will reach only the resellers it needs.

At Sampo Technology Inc., Norcross, Ga., distribution is limited
to Ingram, Merisel, Tech Data and Gates-Arrow, according to
Norman Dybowski, director of marketing. This leaves distributors
getting by on a less margin, "opening up better opportunities
at higher margins for the VAR," he said. VARs can expect monitor
margins in the 10 to 12 percent range at the low end, while
high-end margins will run from 12 to 18 percent, he said.

Smile adds to monitor line at high end, midrange

By:
WILLIAM TERDOSLAVICH

Costa Mesa, Calif.-Smile International Inc. expanded its product
line with the addition of 20-inch and 21-inch monitors for
its high-end Rev 7 line, as well as new 15-inch and 17-inch
monitors for its more midrange Rev 5 line.

Smile is reaching the monitor market with four product lines.
In addition to Rev 7, with LCD status indicators, and Rev 5,
which has on-screen display, Smile puts out its Rev 3 line,
fully digital with LED, and its low-end Rev 1 analog monitors.
Among the four lines there are 12 monitors coming to market,
said Michael LaMar, marketing manager.

In the Rev 7 line, the CA2111 is priced at $1,780, and the CA2011
has a price tag of $1,345. Both monitors have .28mm dot pitch
and refresh rates of 100 hertz; 1600-x-1200 resolution; and
adapters for the Macintosh.

"We're putting these in the CAD and heavy graphics arena," LaMar
said. The monitors also feature "convergence adjustment," which
allows focused adjustment of just one line of pixels. This
feature will allow the elimination of blue shadows at the corners,
LaMar said.

While Smile had produced 20-inch and 21-inch monitors for other
vendors, this is the first time it has turned out the monitors
for its own nameplate, LaMar said.

Meanwhile, the CA1516SL and CA1716SL provide the foundation
for the Rev 5 line, which features OSD to distinguish it from
the lower-end lines. The 15-inch CA1516SL is priced at $420,
while the 17-inch CA1716SL carries a $720 price tag.

Viewsonic Adds New Monitor



Walnut, Calif.-Viewsonic Corp. added a 17-inch monitor to its
value-oriented Optiquest product line, sporting a 0.26mm dot
pitch and a price of $895. It begins shipping today.

The Optiquest V775 can deliver a resolution of 1600 x 1280 at
66 hertz, or 1024 x 768 at 90 hertz. This performance puts
the V775 squarely between two other Viewsonic monitors in terms
of performance-the high-end 17ps and 17gs.

The upgrade market for 17-inch monitors is split between high
end CAD and high-quality general purpose, said David Ball,
vice president of sales and marketing. Viewsonic did concede
several features to bring the V775 to less than $900. The three
year warranty only carries one year's worth of labor. No BNC
connectors are included, and while MPR-II compliant, it does
not meet TCO standards, he said.

Sampo Touts Pricing Of AlphaScan

By:
WILLIAM TERDOSLAVICH

Norcross, Ga.-Adding to its product line, Sampo Technology Inc.
launched a new 17-inch monitor at an aggressive price point
for units in its class.

Called the AlphaScan 760, the monitor is priced at $949, with
a street price that is expected to be about $100 lower, according
to Norman Dybowski, director of marketing. The monitor has
a 0.26mm dot pitch, a flat Diamondtron CRT, pushing 1280 x
1024 resolution at 80 hertz. Maximum resolution is 1600 x1200.

Sampo is looking to the VAR channel to push the new monitor.
"It is best-suited for really picky uses, like CAD graphics.
It's the ultimate clean screen," Dybowski said.

Sampo is deliberately following a limited distribution strategy
to keep its monitor margins up. Using only four national distributors
keeps the product line from being overdistributed, which in
turn can cut into prices and margins, Dybowski noted.

The AlphaScan 760 brings to three the number of 17-inch monitors
Sampo has in the market. The AlphaScan 17gx is similar, with
a 0.26mm dot pitch, but lower refresh rates at higher resolutions.
The 17mx offers a 0.28mm dot pitch, again lower refresh rates,
and a maximum resolution of only 1280 x 1024.

Other high-end monitor offerings include the AlphaScan GL, a
20-inch monitor with a .31mm dot pitch and 1280 x 1024 resolution.
Also part of the line is the AlphaScan GLX, a more richly-featured
20-inch monitor with a .28mm dot pitch and a resolution of
1600 x 1200.

Nanao brings B&W monitor to market

By:
William Terdoslavich

Torrance, Calif.-To Nanao USA Corp., the world of 21-inch monitors
is one that is seen in black-and-white, not color. Such is
the story behind the FlexScan 6600, a 21-inch grayscale monitor.

"It is specifically designed for document imaging," said Craig
Sloss, national sales and product marketing manager. "The advantage
over color is that we have a solid phosphor coating to give
you a tighter image."

The FlexScan 6600 offers 1600 x 1200 resolution at a flicker
free 85 hertz with 1,024 shades of gray. "With 1600 x 1200,
you can get the full document in 1-to-1 scale and see text
in 8-point and 10-point type without having to zoom in," Sloss
said. "That is impossible at lower resolutions."

Sticker price for the FlexScan 6600 is $1,277. The product is
an improvement over its predecessor, the FlexScan 6500, similarly
priced but offering the same resolution at a lower 66 hertz.

Panasonic revamps monitor line with new models

By:
William Terdoslavich

Secaucus, N.J.-Panasonic Systems & Communications Co. rounded
out its product line in a broad fashion by launching three
new monitors at Comdex/Fall, with plans to launch more new
models next year.

Launched were the S17, a $799 replacement for the 17-inch Model
1791; the P17, which is an $800 upgrade of the older 1792P;
and the P15, a $429 15-inch upgrade of the Model 1591.

All three models feature higher refresh rates and Windows 95
Plug and Play compatibility. The two 17-inch models are $50
to $100 less expensive than their predecessors, while the 15
inch model is $30 more expensive than its predecessor due to
the shortage of 15-inch CRTs.

"The S [series] is for standard, general-purpose business uses,"
said Mike Marusic, marketing manager for Secaucus-based Panasonic,
while the PS series is the pro line.

A new 15-inch monitor will be added in the spring to supplement
the P15, while the S17 will be the basis for two new multimedia
17-inch monitors due next year. Also expected in the spring
is a 21-inch model, either for the S or PS series, Marusic
said.

"All segments are becoming a commodity. People are looking for
feature sets," he said.

Panasonic also launched its PanaFlat PF17, a flat-screen monitor
with a .24mm dot pitch and 1600 x 1280 resolution. It is priced
at $1,199.

PL/1 now in phase-out stage? -- Opportunities abound for VARs,
integrators to aid in maigration to other languages

By:
DARRYL K. TAFT

Washington-Despite all the attention being given to modern programming
languages like Java, C and C++, there remains plenty of opportunity
for VARs, integrators and consultants in older programming
languages such as PL/1 and COBOL, particularly in migrating
to newer environments, according to a recent study.

A study released by Ernst & Young showed a majority of corporate
sites using PL/1 intend to phase out their PL/1 applications
through replacement or migration to COBOL or other languages.
Many of the sites will begin their conversions within the next
year, the study showed.

Fifty-nine percent of the 1,700 companies surveyed said they
are looking to move away from their PL/1 applications. Most
respondents said they viewed PL/1 as outdated and inappropriate
for today's computing environments, which are heavily geared
toward client/server architectures. The study showed COBOL
to be the language of choice for organizations moving away
from PL/1, with C and C++ coming in as second and third choices,
respectively. A solid 31 percent of the respondents said they
intend to convert to or rewrite their applications in COBOL,
with 10 percent planning to move to C and 7 percent moving
to C++

Ernst & Young conducted its study in August 1995 and included
companies in Europe and the United States. Results of the survey
reflect the purchasing plans of IT directors within some of
the world's largest corporations including AT&T Corp., Eastman
Kodak Co., Raytheon, South Western Bell, State Farm Insurance
and the U.S. Department of Energy.

Among some of the other factors against retaining PL/1-based
systems, survey respondents said it is difficult to find programmers
to work in the PL/1 language. In addition, they said PL/1 lacks
the multiplatform support of more modern and widely accepted
languages such as COBOL and C++

Citing the potential for VARs and integrators in this environment,
Hans-Peter Evers, managing director of Ernst & Young RE Products
in Utrecht, Netherlands, said: "This survey confirms the massive
flight from PL/1 and strong interest in COBOL, as well as a
critical need for an easy and painless solution for PL/1 migration."

Only 18 percent of the survey respondents said they had already
moved away from PL/1. Yet, 23 percent said they were satisfied
with PL/1 and believe it is the only language suitable for
their requirements. However, of those committed to migrating,
27 percent said they would convert their applications to another
environment, while 46 percent said they would totally rewrite
or replace the applications.

Moreover, 44 percent of the sites planning a migration from
PL/1 said they are changing platforms due to a move to client
server and downsizing efforts. An additional 28 percent said
they plan to move from PL/1 to standardize their environments.

"The year 2000 date change is also a compelling reason for companies
to migrate from PL/1 to COBOL," said Bill Ulrich, president
of Tactical Strategy Group Inc., an Aptos, Calif., VAR/integrator
that specializes in legacy system transitions. "While excellent
tool support exists for languages such as COBOL, the tool support
for PL/1 tends to be inadequate."

As many companies look to move to more modern development environments,
software suppliers such as IBM Corp. are delivering tools to
meet their needs. IBM has modernized the COBOL language with
object-oriented extensions. IBM's Visual Age for COBOL for
OS/2, COBOL Set for AIX and COBOL for MVS feature object-oriented
extensions that enable programmers to use a popular, long-lived
programming language to create advanced client/server applications
on the desktop and deploy objects across various platforms
and applications.

The Spin: Making Microsoft Blink ... Or, Who Were They Kidding?

By:
Jodi Mardesich

After Microsoft's big Internet strategy briefing in early December,
I was talking to a Microserf. In typical Microserf fashion,
he asked me what I thought about the day, so I told him I was
floored that they had actually decided to license Java from
Sun. "I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop," I told him.

"What do you mean?" he asked. I said, maybe you've signed a
letter of intent, but it won't be finalized, or you'll license
it, but won't really fully support it. . . . You get the drift.
He replied, "I'm hurt. I've worked for Microsoft for years
and we've always been open. I don't understand why people say
this about us. . . ."

Until that day, not many people expected Microsoft to actually
license Java. I started reporting for the story days before.
One IBM executive told me, "The Internet is all about standards.
It's all about being open. That's what we're going to focus
on, things that are open and cross platform. We're not going
to tell you if you want to take advantage of our interpretive
language, you have to use our browser, or if you want to use
our object technology, you have to use our platform." Meaning,
he thought Microsoft would tell us the opposite.

Instead, Microsoft said it would license Java. Officials painted
a lovely picture of an open landscape. You can use whatever
tools you want. We'll make runtimes for VB Script free on the
Internet. We'll support stuff across platforms. We'll give
away our browser and server for free.

Wait a minute. What happened? Six months ago, the story of the
year was Windows 95. Now everyone is focused on browsers and
the Web. Just months ago, Microsoft was the winner of the OS
wars. Developers were fleeing from other platforms to Windows
in droves. Novell gave up on its Appware cross platform development
and seemed to lose its focus, which was to deliver network
connectivity to users of all kinds of computers running whatever
operating system. Suddenly, all significant client work was
being done for Windows. The game was over. Or was it?

Why, if Windows is the development platform of choice, would
Microsoft start using the "cross-platform" word? A few years
ago when Microsoft was doing its dog-and-pony show with Windows
for Workgroups, I asked whether they'd do some sort of module
that would let Mac users share files and printers with Windows
users. They looked at me like I was insane. Windows was their
mantra. Let's all say it in unison. Windows! Windows! Windows!

Then Netscape came along. Who would have thought a small company
distributing free software on the Web would make Microsoft
blink? Well, after achieving a billion-dollar market capitalization,
Microsoft had to take notice. Not to mention the fact that
Netscape produces cool software that runs on other platforms
besides Windows 95 and updates it frequently. Say bye-bye to
three-year development cycles.

Also, with Java, Sun came up with an exciting idea and new tools
that change the way most people have thought about personal
computing. Even so, how could Microsoft possibly admit someone
else had done something cooler than they? And actually license
it?

It didn't take too long for the other shoe to drop. The next
week, Microsoft execs were telling us how great Microsoft tools
are, and that they'll be available sooner than Java. Microsoft
knows that he who controls the developers wins. Microsoft is
hurriedly crafting a plan to leverage OLE so all the thousands
of OLE developers can stay on the Microsoft bandwagon.

I can't wait to see how this progresses. Cast your votes for
Netscape et al or Microsoft at jmardesi@cmp.com.

No Messing with Texas in mobile PCs -- Steve Lair's flare for
being a strong vendor begins to pay off for TI in the notebook
arena

By:
Steven Burke & Kelley Damore

Texas Instruments Inc. is on the rise in the explosive mobile
market.

TI jumped to the No. 5 position in U.S. mobile-unit market share
in the third quarter of 1995, up from No. 7 in 1994, according
to International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market-research
firm. The company sold 53,000 notebooks in the United States
in the quarter, a jump of more than 100 percent from the same
period last year, according to IDC.

"TI has ramped up [its] marketing efforts and [its] channel
efforts, and it is starting to pay off," said Randy Giusto,
an analyst for IDC. "They have expanded the number of distributors,
resellers and retailers. TI always had innovative technology.
But in the past they were known as a great engineering company.
The problem was with marketing."

Analysts said much of the credit for TI's rise up the charts
goes to Steve Lair, who headed up marketing for mobile market
leader Toshiba before joining TI as vice president of personal
productivity products in April.

"TI has made some big jumps [in notebooks]," said Mike McGuire,
analyst for Dataquest Inc., San Jose, Calif. "The marketing
plans that Steve Lair has put in place are really kicking in."

Lair completely restructured the marketing organization at TI
and added more than 100 people in U.S. sales and marketing.
"We're making a big-time move to get mobile market share,"
said Lair. And new technology coming out soon, such as on-board
telephone capability, and additional multimedia and wireless
functionality, will further propel TI, according to Lair.

The company is also poised to revamp its Extensa value notebook
line in the first quarter. An aggressive push into Pentium
is also expected. Pentium accounted for about 58 percent of
mobile sales for TI in the fourth quarter, said Lair, but by
midyear it will be ubiquitous. The 120MHz-based TravelMate
5200, launched in October, starts at about $5,000. The 6.7
pound product features 8 Mbytes of RAM, a 1.2-Gbyte hard drive,
a built-in 16-bit sound card, an internal speaker and microphone,
interfaces for audio in/out and realtime video with a 10.4
inch active-matrix SVGA color screen.

Lair said VARs will play an important role in pushing TI into
small, medium-size and large businesses in 1996. "It's going
to be a hell of a year," he said.

By The Numbers: The Great 1995 Sell-Through: Seeking Answers

By:
Vadim Zlotnikov

During the past couple of months, there has been extensive discussion
of the PC sell-through during this year's fourth quarter.

This is a particularly important question given the relatively
large inventory position that resellers have taken in anticipation
of strong, Windows 95-driven PC demand. The inclinations to
date have been far from conclusive, but several trends are
beginning to emerge.

The CRN/Sanford Bernstein Survey suggests overall PC availability
remains relatively good, with modest shortages at the high
end of the product line. The levels of excess inventory have
edged up slightly. Roughly two-thirds of resellers expect PC
unit growth during the next three months will be up at least
5 percent when compared with the previous three months.

The key issue here is the relative balance between supply and
demand. Our estimates suggest to clear channel inventory during
the fourth quarter, PC unit growth would need to be in the
20 percent to 22 percent range at the corporate level and 35
percent to 37 percent at the retail level. Through November,
these target levels were close to being met but at the expense
of margins because of promotions.

But we expect U.S. PC growth in 1996 will moderate to the 17
percent to 19 percent range, compared with 23 percent to 24
percent this year. Expectations of slower growth are being
driven primarily by high penetration rates among corporations
and high-income households. While Windows 95 has not been a
failure, it is being sold mainly to high-income households
and small businesses upgrading their PCs. As we look into 1996,
there are few compelling new applications that would induce
a new segment of the market to purchase a PC. Furthermore,
the much touted $500 box that is needed to address the lower
end of the market is unlikely to generate significant volumes
until late 1997 or 1998.

IFOMERCIALS: Spotlights to air on CNBC -- Elek-Tek Using TV
TO Build Corporate REseller Image

By:
TIM GRACE

Skokie, Ill.-Traditional retail and catalog reseller Elek-Tek
Inc., in a continued effort to expand into the realm of corporate
reseller, initiated a series of 30-minute infomercials on CNBC
spotlighting how its products and services address corporate,
government, home and educational user needs.

Airing Saturdays at noon EST on the cable-television network,
the company's Computer Wonderland program features real-life
scenarios on how Elek-Tek products and services can solve problems
or create business opportunities. The program focuses on three
to five computer products per week; it is cosponsored by such
manufacturers as IBM Corp., Apple Computer Inc., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and U.S. Robotics Inc.

"We're in the process of evaluating what for us is a new medium
before committing to more than three programs. We chose CNBC
because it gives us access to 80 million U.S. homes which include
a lot of influential corporate employees, including [chief
information officers]," said Elek-Tek President Cameron Estes.
"Our objective is to stress the benefits and time saving value
of computers and more importantly to feature and sell products."

To that end, viewers of Computer Wonderland during the course
of the program are encouraged to call for a free Elek-Tek catalog
and coupon book or to place an order. The show itself has presented
vignettes on how the HP Deskjet helped a child find a lost
dog and how a grandmother used a Macintosh Performa as a babysitting
tool. The reseller's corporate thrust was underscored by a
profile of how an employee achieved higher productivity and
a promotion through the use of an IBM ThinkPad.

The 17-year-old, multimillion-dollar reseller, which in addition
to its Skokie headquarters and four Chicago retail outlets
has operations in Denver, Indianapolis and Kansas City, Mo.,
retained Chicago-based KRT Productions Inc. to produce the
series. Once the initial three programs run their course, Elek
Tek will evaluate their success before deciding whether to
continue the Computer Wonderland series, Estes said.

$10,000 Home Page Cracking

By:
MICHAEL KANELLOS

Seattle-ichael Koidahl, president of Seattle's Westwind Computing
Inc., has enough faith in the 8150 Apple Internet server that
he will give $10,000 to anyone who can hack into his.

"What is Netscape [Communications Corp.] offering? A T-shirt?"
he asked.

The $10,000 Macintosh Security Challenge is co-sponsored with
Redmond, Wash.-based integrator ComVista Inc., Bellevue, Wash.
based Internet service provider Digital Forest, and four ISVs.

The challenge has been the three companies' answer to customer
questions about security on the Internet since Oct. 15. At
the same time, it has been a live advertisement for the three
companies.

"In October and [early] November, we had about 4,000 to 5,000
hits. We're probably getting 200 to 250 a day now," said John
Wiederspan, the director of technical services at ComVista.

"We have had four people write us and tell us how they could
break in. We told them, 'Fine,' [but] they haven't yet," he
added.

Koidahl said the idea for the Internet Challenge came about
because customers wanted tangible proof of Internet security.

The three companies also wanted a way to demonstrate their own
skills and products, which complement each other.

Westwind is a high-end Apple reseller specializing in sales,
testing and configuration of hardware and software. ComVista,
on the other hand, acts as a consultant, providing white papers
and hourly consulting to companies interested in mapping out
communications strategies. Digital Forest designs and maintains
home-page sites for those wanting to outsource that function.

Wiederspan added that as much as possible the three use the
same software vendors, including Maxum and StarNine Technologies
Inc.

While working as a consortium divides revenue, it increases
each company's individual flexibility and keeps each concentrated
on its core competency, said Koidahl. Overall, "our philosophy
is to get customers to provide information," he added. Their
joint projects include Internet sites for Alaska Airlines and
Northwest Nickel, a local classified publication.

Naturally, the challenge also has become a testimonial to the
Apple server line, which, Koidahl and Wiederspan pointed out,
remains one of the dominant and most hearty Internet hardware
platforms. Apple is not participating in the test or providing
financial assistance, added Koidahl.

The Macintosh challenge essentially mimics an actual home page,
said Wiederspan. Users can examine on the home page everything
but data contained on one line. Access to that area is permitted
only by password: Break it, and you win $10,000.

So far, the test, which ran until the end of the year, has been
satisfactory on all counts. Sales of Apple Internet servers
at Westwind have been increasing throughout the year, said
Koidahl. Also, 400 local businesspeople attended a recent Internet
seminar sponsored by Westwind.

"For $2,500 you can get an Apple-based server with all the necessary
software," Koidahl said. Although slightly more costly than
some Windows-based servers, the Apple servers have another
selling point: They only require two to three hours to install,
while it might take "40 hours to set up an NT server," he added.

Wiederspan believes the test has shown Apple's equipment can
withstand industrial use. The key, he said, lies in the fact
that the Apple server refuses to accept commands outside the
protocol.

He also hopes the challenge may contribute to the business world's
general acclimation to Internet commerce. "The security aspect
is more of a mind set," he said. "If you wanted 5,000 credit
card numbers, you could go outside of a department store on
trash day."

Visionary forms new group

By:
TIM GRACE

Sunnyvale, Calif.-Visionary Design Systems Inc. formed a separate
systems- and network-integration group to help its core CAD
engineer clientele work with a variety of platforms and applications.

The new group will primarily design custom networks and build
network-management solutions with Hewlett-Packard Co.'s OpenView
product suite, as well as provide system- and network-management
services on an outsourcing basis, said Director Steven Kling.

The $35 million, Sunnyvale-based CAD VAR opted to form a separate
integration group after implementing a successful product-oriented
sideline business in the Bay area, Kling said. "CAD engineers
at our client companies are largely isolated from MIS managers
and departments. They also have a separate set of needs in
terms of network performance and throughput.

"They continually ask us for help because their area of expertise
is design, not network and computer management," he said.

Kling, who joined Visionary Design after a stint as the head
of HP's consulting delivery business in the Western United
States, expects to increase his current seven-member integration
team to between 25 and 30 members by the end of 1996. "Until
then, the logical things for us will be to target our integration
services at our existing mechanical-design environment before
pursuing opportunities in other industries," he said, adding
that the VAR also will leverage its Internet-based ConnectVDS
engineering design transfer system to impart technical information
to users.

Visionary Design launched ConnectVDS in November as a vehicle
through which CAD engineers can exchange files and documents,
conduct research on mechanical engineering and access the World
Wide Web to communicate with vendors and suppliers (CRN, Nov.
6)

"They've already begun communicating with us for information
on how their workstations are networked together and to obtain
such information as how to pass drawing files at faster speeds,"
Kling said.

ConnectVDS, as well as the new systems- and network-integration
group, are key elements to the VAR's Vision 2000 philosophy
of helping customers improve business processes and streamline
information.

"A common challenge for our customers is how to cope with a
mix of different platforms and applications," Kling said. "We
will now be better able to provide subcontractors to implement,
manage and provide ongoing network-performance assessment."

Disc takes its computer-supplies business very personally ...

By:
Pedro Pereira

In an industry where finding a niche has become a necessity
for most distributors, Disc Distributing Corp. executives have
taken pains to have their company appear as anything but conventional.
The distributor's World Wide Web site includes a games zone,
and product promotions often involve food.

The fun does not stop there. Disc's executive vice president,
Carrie Pollare, is compiling data on the company's customers
in an exhaustive research project that includes information
on birthdays and preferred pastimes.

The company's penchant for the unorthodox permeates the way
it does business and the products it sells. Disc, based here,
went into business 10 years ago to distribute computer supplies
and accessories, such as surge protectors, printer toners and
ink cartridges and disks, and has started to branch out into
other types of products.

"We have our niche here and that's supplies and accessories.
I don't want to deal in commodity items. I don't want to make
2 [percent] and 3 percent margins on expensive products," said
Dan Hoffman, Disc founder and president.

The strategy seems to have worked. Hoffman said the privately
held company has grown at rates of 45 percent to 65 percent
yearly and has annual sales of more than $50 million.

Disc employs 70 people and plans to open a second warehouse
to serve the Midwest and East Coast. Sites in Louisville, Ky.,
and Columbus, Ohio, are being considered.

Despite Disc's focus on consumables, Hoffman has plans for the
company to start carrying products it has not traditionally
sold, such as peripherals. So far, the distributor has picked
up Panasonic Corp.'s Power Drive optical disk and CD-ROM drive
as a pilot product for its line-card expansion.

"I don't want to sell hard drives; I want to sell more niche
oriented products," Hoffman said.

Disc sells to resellers, retailers, office-products stores,
mail-order companies and supermarkets; most of its business
goes through the computer channel, Hoffman said.

Pollare, who is Hoffman's sister, said collecting personal information
on customers should help Disc become more attentive to its
resellers. Possible outcomes may include sending customers
birthday cards or arranging a golf weekend, she said.

GBC focuses on Novell's high end

By:
JOHN LONGWELL

Berlin, N.J.-Clarifying an earlier statement that GBC Technologies
Inc. was "easing out of the NetWare business," company President
Norman Some said the distributor is committed to Novell Inc.'s
line.

Some said Novell products will remain a critical line for the
distributor. However, he said GBC is concentrating on selling
Novell's higher-value products that complement its focus on
enterprise connectivity as opposed to commodity-priced NetWare
operating systems.

The networking distributor, which has built its business around
Novell's line, expects Novell's datacommunications products,
GroupWise software and upgrade SKUs to benefit from GBC's technical
support and services. "The VAR's willing to pay for that value
add," Some said.

He said GBC shared Novell's vision of developing NetWare Connect
Services that enable all sorts of devices to connect to a network.
"They have the most robust directory services available, and
that's the key to interconnectivity," according to Some.

Distributors said pricing on NetWare has become aggressive over
the past few quarters because of unauthorized OEM sales into
the channel.

MARKET GROWTH: Projected at more than 100% -- Multimedia Solution
Formula

By:
PEDRO PEREIRA

Boulder, Colo.-Access Graphics Inc. teamed up with InSoft Inc.
to deliver desktop multimedia solutions to VARs in an effort
to take advantage of a market projected to grow at more than
100 percent in coming years.

Access, based here, does not have InSoft products in its line
card, despite its partnership to introduce the collaborative
multimedia vendor's products to the reseller community.

But the products, including videoconferencing and document-sharing
solutions, are compatible with the Sun Microsystems Inc. platform,
from which the distributor derives more than 60 percent of
its revenue.

"The goal is to build the reseller channel for Insoft and Access,"
said Kristen Peterson, manager of Access' TeamWork program,
which oversees the relationship with Insoft, Mechanicsburg,
Pa. Peterson said she will seek to sign up 200 resellers for
the program.

InSoft, which as a reseller of Sun products already has a customer
relationship with the distributor, paid Access a onetime fee
for a six-month contract as a TeamWork participant.

UPS vendors stress network protection role

By:
FRED GARDNER

Boston-As networks and RAID systems expand and make greater
demands on uninterruptible power supplies (UPSes), vendors
have been increasing the versatility of their UPS systems to
allow greater communications capability for IS and other system
managers.

Among the latest of companies to announce greater communications
capability is Liebert Inc., Columbus, Ohio. Liebert's most
recent UPS is the SiteNet MultiPort, a multiplexor module designed
to be integrated with the company's SiteNet family of control
and monitoring software for networkable UPS devices.

"The MultiPort product provides an economical communications
avenue of up to eight computer stations," said Edward K. Feeney,
Liebert's president of North American operations. "This new
level of flexibility gives network administrators that much
more systemwide control through the UPS."

The MultiPort allows multiple ports, represented by computers,
servers or workstations, access to critical information pertinent
to shutdown, including battery condition as well as utility
status. Company officials said any number of MultiPorts can
be daisy chained.

The price of the MultiPort is $675.

A new UPS from Antec Inc., Fremont, Calif., the N+1 line, includes
three series of reliable, redundant supplies that provide automatic,
active fault-tolerant backup power.

The N+1 RPT and RPP series feature hot-swappable capabilities
for multiple DC voltages including +/- 5-volt, 12-volt and
3.3-volt outputs, as well as optional Power Factor Correction.
The lines are intended to solve power-deficiency problems in
mainframes, network and application servers, multiple-processor
workstations and telecom systems, Antec officials said.

The RPT series includes the RPT-100, a standard AT-sized redundant
power supply, configures as a 300 + 300 watts that can be used
as a 600-watt output power supply, and fits directly into any
AT chassis.

The RPP series has hot-swappable capabilities in its 3001 and
3003 modules, which use the RPP-300 + 300 module in their designs.
The 3002 includes a hot-pluggable housing and backplane.

Prices average 20 cents to $1 per watt.

DAX Systems Inc., Pine Brook, N.J., unveiled its first rack
mounted UPS with N+1 redundancy and true load sharing. With
the RSP-500, "the four hot-swappable [500-watt] power modules
can be configured to meet the most demanding integrated voice
response and telephony needs," said Anthony F. Shay, national
sales manager at DAX.

If a module fails, the system's alarms are initiated while the
three remaining modules support the entire electrical load.
The unit also features an integral board that monitors the
fans and data-flow and power-supply performance. It also has
options for auditory, visual and printout alarms.

A fully populated RPS-500 system is priced at $6,135.

Several new UPS models are available from Exide Electronics,
Raleigh, N.C. The latest is the Powerware Prestige 3000VA (voltage
amperes) UPS for medium-size computer networks running from
a standard 120-volt input.

Features include Exide's CellSaver technology which allows the
UPS to accommodate a greater range of power fluctuation without
having to resort to battery-backup power, extending the unit's
battery life significantly, according to officials.

"What this means for network managers, as well as MIS and telecom
professionals, is that they can have all the benefits of true
online technology for only slightly more than they would pay
for lower-performance products," said Doug Milner, director
of product and partner marketing for Exide.

The system is available in plug-and-play and hard-wired configurations.

Its price is $2,299.

MPC 486 slave board unveiled



New York -Technological Artisans Inc. is shipping its MPC 486,
a low-cost, PC-compatible I/O slave board for debugging purposes.

The board, which interfaces to the host motherboard processor
through a large 128-Kbyte block of dual-ported bidirectional
shared memory, can be used with any tool that generates a PC
executable file. Then, by connecting a monitor and keyboard
to the MPC 486, users can run debuggers natively on the board,
company officials said.

The board can also be used to build databases, image recognition,
seismology and medical imaging. "We designed the MPC 486 PC
after an extensive search of the marketplace revealed that
no other board combined the essential elements necessary for
a truly effective I/O slave board," said Daniel Cohm, president
of the New York-based company.

Features include six on-board 12-bit DACs, on-board 2.5-Mbyte
solid-state disk, a 486 25MHz processor (33MHz optional), parallel
I/O and external interrupt support, COM1 and COM2 serial ports,
LPT printer port, realtime clock, floppy and IDE controllers,
and keyboard support. The price is $1,495.

Internet Fever Strikes Client/Server Providers



EDITOR'S NOTE: CRN recently gathered top executives from the
client/server industry for the Second Annual Client/Server
Summit in New York. This is the first installment of excerpts.
Next week: discussion on growth opportunities and vendor strategies.

ONLINE OPPORTUNITIES

LANE: We're very bullish on the Internet. One reason is no one
controls it, and it seems that its growth, its popularity in
what is a very arcane delivery vehicle today and a user interface
could only be made better. It is obviously an opportunity to
change the industry paradigm, which, at least at the client
end, is quickly becoming a monopoly. Obviously, if you are
a large software company you want to see that remain open.

Second, there are a lot of technicians and users coming into
the business now that are more Internet-skilled than anything
else.

MCDOWELL: An area that I think is very interesting is in the
impact this is going to have on small businesses. I think this
somewhat levels the playing field. I was talking to a small
business person the other day who basically sells analyst reports.
It's a very small operation, and they were flabbergasted at
the demand for their service they got by going out to the Internet
and describing in some way what they're doing. Suddenly, the
size of the firm didn't matter; it was how they positioned
it.

KERTZMAN: The Web interface, or what we will eventually extend
the Web interface to be, is probably the best, easiest, most
intuitive user interface that's been developed, and that will
drive the inevitability of these technologies.

WHITE: The biggest market for all of this is going to be inside
companies. They're spending the money, they've got the need
for sales-force automation, customer service, customer support.
That's going to drive a lot of business, big time, in '96 and
'97.

PAPERMASTER: The Internet has become, ultimately, an environment.
It's not a tool. It's like air. Everybody breathes it. The
ultimate winner, who is going to make money on the Internet,
is the customer, because it completely changes the paradigm
of offering new services and new ways to market companies.
I think the real message for the whole technology industry
and certainly for any of the channels or the intermediaries
in the product marketplace-is that it turns the value chain
on its end, and that can either be a tremendous opportunity
or it can be dangerous.

SIMS: We've found in the past few months an enormous [interest
in] the whole area of intranet, so we think that's going to
be a pretty big extension to what's happening in the Internet.
I would say 10 percent to 15 percent of our clients are already
talking about or looking at that.

RAMSEY: If I were an unemployed entrepreneur looking for a new
opportunity in the Internet area, I'd look at providing consulting
services. It's a great opportunity for the reselling community
to add value.

REVENUE PROJECTIONS

TEBBE: There's multiple dimensions: Internet and intranet. That
combination is probably 15 percent to 20 percent of our business.
I think it'll grow another 50 percent next year, to 30 percent
to 33 percent of our business.

MCDOWELL: I'd like anybody to be able to sit down and calculate
Internet revenue. Certainly I'd ask, along with that, about
profit.

RAMSEY: We've probably spent more developing our Internet site
than we made in profit in selling Internet products to date,
but that's OK. I finally, in my own mind, concluded what the
Internet means to us as a service provider and a seller of
products. Certainly it's a way to interface with our customers.
As a supplier of product, we're principally selling servers.

JACOBSEN: We certainly are making a lot of revenue and a lot
of profit off it today by virtue of MCI being a major provider
of backbone, as well as an access provider. We're making money
on the Internet today hand over fist. The Internet gives us
what we've all been looking for, data dial tone, but for us
it's also an enabler. We look at IP as another transport option
with a series of telecommunications products and services.

WHITE: I think [our Internet revenue is in the] single digits
today. Internet-related revenue will be pretty high next year
30 percent to 50 percent. The three [relational database suppliers]
are going to do a lot of database business.

KERTZMAN: If somebody is using the client/server architecture
on a TCP/IP network that's the core backbone network, then
you can say that's an Internet platform. So I think it will
be hard to differentiate what's Internet-related revenue and
what's not. And, in a sense, everything will have some components
to that.

SIMS: I would say it's nominal business for us today. It could
represent 4 [percent] or 5 percent of our business next year
in the intranet.

LANE: Even though it's been reported that we are investing a
lot of money-relative to what we invest in R&D and database
and applications-this is a relatively small investment. But
it can be tremendously leveraged, and so the opportunity is
huge.

NETWORK COMPUTERS

KERTZMAN: I don't think that in corporate desktops

you will see a movement to these Internet computers or Internet
terminals until every application that every user needs to
run is runnable in that metaphor. And nobody wants two devices
on their desktops. I think the market, however, for mobile
and home devices is probably where these very light Internet
terminals will find a future.

MCDOWELL: We don't see the PC as we know it today-that is, a
good deal of horsepower and maybe more on the desktop-going
away in the near term. While we believe that the debate over
how big or small the desktop will be is probably still a bit
of an open debate, if there are smaller devices, Microsoft
will want to hopefully develop products that add value in that
arena. But we see a major opportunity to leverage the existing
and continuing growth in PC-based systems today.

LANE: We feel there will be a low-cost Internet or network-access
device that does not require all of the hardware and software
that a PC [has] today. There is a large gap between the telephone
and the PC in terms of economics. If Intel and Compaq are the
first ones to build NCs, it probably is going to happen sooner.
Oracle is not going to build NCs. But we do have an interest
in seeing a lot of different client devices out there. We want
everybody to have multiple client devices because that will
generate server revenue.

WHITE: [Regarding] the network computer, or the NC, as [Oracle
Chairman] Larry [Ellison] called it, . . . in my view, the
'NC' stands for 'no chance.' I think the real opportunity is
going to be driven by the combination of a network computer
and a phone and probably will be deployed by the telephony
based companies. It's driving a lot of new partners, a lot
of business opportunities, a lot of hype like the NC, but I
think it will cause a lot of anxious moments and sell none
on the business side.

PAPERMASTER: The Internet computer violates a fundamental premise
of personal computing and even client/server computing, which
is having ownership, if you will, of the resources it takes
to control your own destiny.

SIMS: The discussion now is: How slim is the client going to
be? You know it's not going to go to nothing. I think we've
been saying that for 25 years. We all thought that if we could
cut $200 off the cost of a terminal, we were going to have
this big market. I think the client might potentially slim
up a little bit, but I don't think that is permanent.

MICROSOFT'S INTERNET ROLE

PAPERMASTER: I think you can look at the hits Microsoft is taking
in the marketplace, at least from a perception standpoint.
That's because of time compression. The thought there is: How
can they react fast enough? Now for that statement to be even
made at this point is pretty phenomenal.

LANE: The Internet opens up the issue of the client. And that's
why I think there's so much focus on this debate. But some
of these broad-sweeping statements [that] Microsoft has lost
this debate . . . are ridiculous. I don't believe it will be
leaderless, though. There will be leaders that basically build
execution ability, have good products, mass distribution, get
the application builders. Microsoft has the best chance to
win that game.

WHITE: I don't think Microsoft lost the lead. They didn't have
it. Nobody had the lead.

Top 25 Executives -- Steve Ballmer: The Net is growing... How can a 
VAR benefit?



EDITOR'S NOTE: Steve Ballmer, executive vice president of Microsoft
Corp., Redmond, Wash., was among CRN's Top 25 Executives in
1995. His column is part of an ongoing series from those executives.

The Internet is no longer a possibility, it's a reality. What
is still open to question is how fast and how far the Internet
will grow-and how VARs can benefit from that growth.

In our business model for the Internet, a diverse and densely
populated world of Solution Providers, resellers, distributors,
content publishers and other third-party providers must bring
the pieces of the Internet together-including systems integration,
support and training-in order to support corporate Internet
users.

There is room here both for major providers-such as Digital,
EDS and Andersen Consulting-as well as for the 10,000 other
Solution Providers that design, install and service computer
networks and software. Many of these companies correctly see
the corporate Internet market as the greatest opportunity they
have and are eager to help their customers build the infrastructure
to exploit it.

The time for these independent providers to act is now, because
the Internet finally has a critical mass of users. The Internet
also has some limitations and weaknesses-but that critical
mass of users actually mitigates the weaknesses in a very important
way.

The thousands of independent providers in the technology community
now have a powerful financial incentive to jump in and address
whatever limits they perceive because the Internet finally
represents an extraordinary commercial opportunity, as well
as a technological one.

A tremendous opportunity lies in equipping and supporting corporate
customers with the hardware and software they need to do business
in the new Internet marketplace-business that includes communicating,
selling, order handling, invoicing and financial processing,
distribution, fulfillment and customer service.

But opportunity is not limited to the corporations already on
the Internet, because many more will join them. The Internet
will change the economics of doing business, lowering the overall
cost of business entry and raising the potential return on
investment as companies gain access to larger markets at little
or no additional cost. That will bring more players to the
field-and more potential customers for a VAR's products and
services.

New types of providers will appear to service these corporate
customers, and resellers will be among them. We expect that
corporations and consumers alike will be attracted to a single
source for most or all of their Internet-service needs.

In addition to Internet online services, Solution Providers
and other resellers, many companies will have to work together
to make this model a reality. Network operators are one example.
Systems manufacturers are another. They must provide the multiprocessors
and the fault-tolerant systems, and, in many cases, they must
integrate the software.

Software vendors are also crucial. There is tremendous opportunity
for third-party software developers. Web servers need new applications
for databases, commerce, workgroups and so on.

On the client side, third-party development will enhance and
extend the basic operating system and integrated browser. On
the bandwidth side of the model, expect to see success for
both of today's midband technologies, ISDN and PC-cable modem.
Growth on one side will spur competition and innovation on
the other. But do not count on a revolution in broadband technologies
anytime soon.

The development of the Internet may well prove to be analogous
to the evolution of the original IBM PC. When it appeared in
1981, there was a lot about it that was arbitrary, limited
and problematic.

Yet for the past two decades, the evolution of that architecture
has driven most of our industry. The Internet is likely to
be the same way. Parts are still missing, but clearly it will
evolve into the ultimate wide-area communications network-and
into a wonderful opportunity for as many resellers and third
parties as have benefited from the PC revolution.

ShadowRAM



Dino is dead. The news hit hard for every person deluded enough
to consider him/herself an honorary Rat Packer. My early Comdex
years were spent trying to act like one of Robin's Seven Hoods.
Dean sang, he danced, he cracked me up. Repeatedly. And he
made it look so easy.

There's not really a Rat Pack in our biz. You could stretch
it to say the Redmond boys-Gates, Ballmer, Higgins, Maritz,
et al., have a shot. But only one of them (guess which) looks
like he's having much fun. . . . But with all of Bill's new
Hollywood pals-Katzenberg, Spielberg, et al.-maybe they could
at least pretend to have a sense of humor.

Gates must not have enjoyed The Paper of Record's critique of
his recent book, described by The New York Times reviewer Joseph
Nocera as "bland and tepid." And billion-dollar Bill must be
getting tired of having his literary works compared with Howard
Stern's.

"Ostensibly offering readers Mr. Gates' upbeat views on the
coming "information highway," . . . 'The Road Ahead' is in
fact little more than a positioning document sold in book form
with accompanying CD-ROM and designed mainly to advance the
interests of Microsoft Corp.," Nocera wrote. Gates promoting
Microsoft and charging people for it? That's what makes America
great!

Okay, already. So I got the Mannheim Steamroller guy's name
wrong. . . . It's Chip Davis, not Chip Douglas. So you've never
had a "My Three Sons" flashback?

Some Lotus types-mostly old-timers who have left the nest-finally
gave former CEO Jim Manzi a send-off during the holiday week
at a tony Cambridge restaurant. Highlights included a Top 10
list of what Manzi should do now. No. 1 was spend his full
time on trying to get into The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
That's "The" Country Club, not "A" country club. It ain't easy
getting into that swank establishment, even with the gazillions
Manzi has stashed. The Club is allegedly the first such establishment
in the United States and Manzi certainly will be in the minority.

Entex found a way to cut year-end costs and, in the process,
make Mr. Potter from Bedford Falls look downright jolly. Entex
sent out holiday cards with postage due. Nice work boys.

A Novell reseller informs us, in an E-mail dripping with sarcasm,
that he was shocked! Shocked! to encounter snags putting NetWare
4.1 on a Windows 95 workstation. The customer opted for MS
Office 95, which the VAR dutifully put on the server and then
tried to do a node install at the workstations. This went well
until the install process started to create icons for the files
copied down to the workstation. At that point, a dialog box
popped up with the message: "Setup Error 991 Object 2742."
The VAR called Redmond and was told to switch to the Microsoft
client for NetWare, install the software and switch back. Said
the VAR, "I know Microsoft wouldn't detect the NetWare client
and generate a bogus error message, but it sure does seem odd."

Recently, the following undocumented Windows 95 error-codes
were posted on the Net. (Note to Microsoft: It's a joke!)

WinErr: 001 Windows loaded-System in danger; WinErr: 002 No
error-Yet; WinErr: 003 Dynamic linking error-Your mistake is
now in every file; WinErr: 004 Erroneous error-Nothing is wrong;
WinErr: 005 Multitasking attempted-System confused.

Well, as Dino said, everybody loves somebody sometime, but we
love hot tips all the time. . . . Go ahead all you Rat Packer
wanna-bes-send your hot items to shadowram@mcimail.com; fax
to (617) 487-7599; or call (800) 521-DIME.

P-166s top hardware hits

By:
MARK HARRINGTON & GREGORY QUICK

LAS VEGAS-Intel will aim its most powerful Pentium processors
at the consumer market this week with the introduction of the
P-150 and 166MHz chips. And Intel vendors from Compaq, IBM,
AST, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment are expected to
show units-publicly or privately-sporting the new processors
at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show here.

The Pentium 150 and 166MHz chips will find their way into the
latest consumer systems at lower price points than any other
new Pentium processor because of more efficient manufacturing
processes, said Frank Spindler, marketing manager for Pentium
at Intel. The company had begun building inventory and shipping
production quantities to OEMs in December, allowing retailers
to have quantities of the units to ship at time of introduction.

New desktop systems are just the start of a broad roster of
CES introductions planned this week.

Compaq, whose chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer is keynoting
the show, is expected this week to introduce its first products
from a joint venture with toymaker Fisher-Price earlier this
year. Compaq is also expected to make several other breakthrough
computer-product announcements, some publicly, others privately.
Among the more noteworthy, it will show off a new system that
incorporates a scanner into its keyboard. Desktop model 7232
uses PaperPort software and can scan items from business cards
to standard-sized paper. The system carries a $2,199 MAP, but
Compaq is also expected to sell the unit as a separate accessory.

Compaq will also introduce a minitower with Panasonic's PD read
write optical drive built in. Model 9240 is a Pentium 133MHz
with the PD drive and a $2,499 MAP. Compaq is also showing
units with a six-speed CD-ROM drive, one of many companies
upgrading to that technology beginning this year. The company
is also expected to make hardware MPEG a "modular" option on
most systems. Only two high-end systems have hardware MPEG
standard, though most now feature software MPEG. Compaq is
also expected to tell retailers of an effort to reduce returns
to 5 percent this year from 8 percent, and to launch a 900
number for software service, charging $2 a minute.

IBM is expected to show new Pentium 150MHz and 166MHz units
here at CES, while also moving to six-speed CD-ROM drives,
and will become one of the first systems makers to show a four
speed, four-disc CD-ROM changer. Pricing and availability on
the units weren't available at press time, but IBM reportedly
has told retailers to expect few new SKUs during the first
quarter.

Canon Computer Systems has been telling retailers to expect
a rejuvenated PC effort, with a new line that includes six
speed CD-ROMs, a four-disc changer and a removable hard drive
that allows users to store 850M bytes of data on a removable
card.

Another company sporting higher-level Intel processors will
be NEC Technologies, which has the Ready 9552, a 150MHz multimedia
machine. Among its features are full-screen, full-motion video
playback, 3-D stereo surround sound, a hand-held remote and
an answering machine with speakerphone and voice mail. It includes
16M bytes of RAM, a 1.6G-byte hard drive, a 28.8K-bps DSVD
fax modem and 2M-bytes VRAM. The system, which has an expected
street price of $3,099, features 20 software titles.

Hewlett-Packard will use the show to relaunch its OmniGo 100
palmtop organizer; the company has fixed a battery problem
that caused memory problems. HP is also expected to show the
OmniGo 700, an integrated cellular communications and organizer.
It will not be officially launched in the United States due
to regulatory problems regarding the frequency used by the
device; however, the company is hopeful that it will clear
that hurdle and be able to ship it sometime this year.

Toshiba will be showing behind closed doors a sub-$2,000 personal
computer optimized for the SoHo market that will be powered
by the 75MHz Pentium processor. It is expected to ship in February.

Rise of 0% deals distorts margin -- Retail Reliance On No-Interest
Financing Terms Spurs Scrutiny

By:
MICHAEL WALD

EDEN PRAIRIE, MINN.-As no-payment, no-interest deals spiraled
to new heights during last year's fourth quarter, Wall Street
analysts, consumer advocates and even some retailers began
voicing heightened concern about the longer-term expense of
such generosity.

Amid cut-throat pricing and shriveling product life cycles,
liberal financing terms, while driving sales, are cutting into
retail profit margins at a time when retailers are straining
to bulk up earnings. Perhaps more damaging is that some retailers'
terms, which require that all back interest be paid if a consumer
doesn't settle his or her bill in full at the end of the specified
no-interest period, are raising red flags among state regulators.
Last year, Oregon-based Smith's Home Furnishings was hit with
a $450,000 fine by the Washington State attorney general for
failing to adequately inform consumers about the terms of its
no-interest offer. Smith's has since gone out of business.

Later last year, while investigating a Montgomery Ward policy
that punishes sales associates for including zero-percent financing
in a sale, CRW learned that several state attorneys general
have formed a task force looking into the broader topic of
no-interest financing deals.

While attorneys on the task force declined to comment on the
nature of their investigation, they did indicate a high level
of interest in the Montgomery Ward policy.

Heightened concern about such financing offers comes as retailers
are raising the stakes to new heights. Best Buy last fall upped
the ante to 15 months.

Consumer electronics vendors, some of which sponsor the offers,
are said to be considering extending the terms to 18 to 24
months. And while little information is available about the
delinquency rate on the longer-term deals, there is a lingering
suspicion that it may increase with the generosity of the terms,
particularly for computer sales.

"It's particularly risky in computers because of the depreciation,
obsolescence problem," said Chuck Cebuhar, divisional vice
president and general manager for home electronics and home
office products at Sears. "What are consumers going to do when
the bill comes due a year from now if the product is, in their
minds, worth half the value?"

But like many retailers, Sears is compelled to offer long-term,
no-interest, deferred-payment financing to keep up with competitors,
Cebuhar said.

"We have to offer our customers competitive [no-interest, deferred
payment] financing, but we are not nearly as aggressive as
other retailers," he said. "We're in a reactive, defensive
mode, rather than in a proactive mode."

Offering no-interest, deferred-payment financing reduces already
thin margins among all retailers that offer such terms.

But while players such as Sears and Circuit City offer financing
options through their own banks, others such as Best Buy must
go outside their companies to provide such deals, shaving profits
even further.

David Childe, a specialty retail analyst at Wall Street brokerage
firm Salomon Brothers in New York, said Best Buy may have attracted
customers by selling computers on 15-month no-interest, deferred
payment terms, but at a cost.

"They're not making money doing it, because they're eating up
almost the entire gross margin in the category," Childe said.
"By my estimate, it probably costs Best Buy 8 to 9 points"
of margin to offer such financing.

Mark Mandel, an analyst at Chicago Corp., a New York brokerage,
agreed.

"Best Buy's promotional financing moves have generated huge
increases in sales, but at the expense of gross margins," Mandel
said. "They're paying through the bigger [fees] they pay to
third-party [financing] providers, which hurts their gross
margin, and aggressive pricing, which also hurts gross margins
in the obvious way. I think it's self-defeating-they're generating
15 percent comp-store increases, but their stock is hitting
new 52-week lows since people are cutting their [earnings]
estimates because their margins are deteriorating. I think
they've gone too far."

Best Buy executives were unavailable to discuss the retailer's
financing plans.

Some retailers, such as Chicago-based Montgomery Ward, are attempting
to recoup some costs of offering no-interest, deferred-payments
financing by cutting sales commissions.

Late in October, Montgomery Ward cut commissions up to 9 percent
on purchases that involve deferred-payment, no-interest financing
running from 90 days to 12 months unless a sales associate
simultaneously sells a three- or five-year extended warranty
(CRW, Dec. 4/11, 1995)

Montgomery Ward and other retailers routinely make fat margins
on sales of extended warranties.

The company said it enacted the policy because of widespread
abuses by sales associates, whom it accused of using no-interest,
deferred-payment plans to induce customers to buy merchandise
that was ineligible for such financing.

Montgomery Ward sales associates said the company's cash registers
are programmed to prevent such abuses. A company spokeswoman
agreed, but said many sales associates have discovered ways
to foil the registers and complete such sales.

The company's attempt to recoup some of the costs of offering
no-interest, deferred-payment financing apparently is not without
its own risks, however.

When CRW contacted consumer advocates at the Illinois and California
attorneys general offices, officials in both agencies vowed
to scrutinize Montgomery Ward's advertising of no-interest,
deferred-payment financing.

Sources said a multistate task force is currently examining
tactics that retailers use to advertise no-interest, deferred
payment financing.

In July 1995, Smith's Home Furnishings, which went out of business
last year, agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a lawsuit brought
by the Washington State attorney general's office in 1993 on
a variety of deceptive advertising and sales practices.

Among the charges in the lawsuit were allegations that claimed
the retailer was offering "zero down payment, zero interest
for one full year" without disclosing that if the full purchase
price was not paid within that year, the buyer would be charged
interest, compounded monthly, from the date of purchase.

Registering Disappointment -- Microsoft's Bob celebrates lonely
first birthday

By:
YARDENA ARAR

LAS VEGAS-So, what about Bob?

A year after a Microsoft team led by Melinda Gates unveiled
its ultra-user-friendly social interface in an all-out media
blitz surpassed only by Windows 95, Bob's cheery happy-face
package has largely disappeared from shelves in smaller stores;
in larger outlets, he's a little yellow Frisbee in a sea of
Windows 95 products. His name appears in a few OEM bundles,
but for the most part, Bob's a pretty lonely guy.

While Microsoft would not comment on industry estimates of sales
(excluding OEM units) of less than 300,000, the company in
September quietly lowered its price from $99.95 to $54.95 and
announced a free Bob "plus pack," obtainable by dialing a toll
free number.

Product manager Jennifer Stewart termed Bob "a 1.0 product that
we're doing a lot of learning with...We'll be taking all the
feedback we're getting and improving the product."

Asked if Microsoft was disappointed with sales, she replied
 "I think you always have high expectations for your new product.
Certainly at launch, we were at levels that were similar to
established home products, like Encarta or Works. Post-launch
sales have dipped a bit, but they're steady, and the thing
that's very encouraging and exciting is the customer reaction
to the product."

However, outside Microsoft, Bob is generally viewed as a rare
Redmond ne'er-do-well.

"Because it is Microsoft and it didn't sell tens of millions
of copies, it's viewed as a failure," said Karl Wong, a software
analyst at Dataquest, San Jose, Calif.

But Microsoft itself generated those high expectations by hyping
the product beyond what it could deliver, he said.

"Whether it's a good product or a bad product per se, Microsoft
oversold the expectations of what the product actually was
and could be," said Wong.

From a broader perspective, he said, "This whole idea of a social
interface that was going to bring tens of thousands of people
into computing was false. Some people are technophobes, and
no matter what kind of paradigm you use, it's still a computer."

Wong and others also said that Bob's appearance-and especially
its use of animated characters as personal "guides"-was all
wrong for the target audience.

"The whole cartoon-like atmosphere of the product seemed aimed
at the younger set, but younger kids are ready to adapt to
technology and don't need the cutesy interface. Whereas, for
the older ones, it's already embarrassing enough that they
feel intimidated by technology, let alone to have some animated
character talk to them on screen," Wong said. "If that paradigm
were true, we'd have little animation characters doing taxes
and programming the VCR."

Lisa Farrell, senior buyer at the Eden Prairie, Minn.-based
Best Buy chain, said Best Buy never stocked Bob in quantity.

"We didn't grasp what the draw was going to be for the consumer,"
she said. "It was not what it was hyped up to be."

While Microsoft said that those who do use Bob love it (the
company reports that 83 percent of registered users surveyed
found their PCs more useful with Bob) Farrell said she sees
no indication that the word is getting out to the marketplace.

"People purchase a lot of software based on word of mouth,"
she said. "The sales [of Bob] have been steady...They really
need to reposition the product."

Consultant Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies, San Jose, Calif.,
who, when Bob was first announced, predicted that it would
find a warm reception from computer neophytes, said he still
believes Microsoft's market research was correct in determining
that computers needed to be demystified in order to attract
new users.

"But while novices have been coming in, surprisingly they've
been showing a lot of acumen in learning the PC, and they've
looked at Bob and decided they didn't need it," Bajarin said.

He theorized that some new users already had their own personal
guides-a computer-literate friend or family member. Others
were really first-time buyers, already familiar with PCs from
work or school, as opposed to computer novices.

Bajarin noted that the learning curve Bob was supposed to help
surmount is addressed in easy-to-read documentation supplied
with many popular applications, particularly those intended
for home use.

Some of these applications duplicate Bob's features, and Microsoft's
Stewart believes that the Microsoft marketing machine's principal
failure was in educating consumers about the household tasks
the program could handle.

"One of the mistakes that we made is that you can't lead only
with selling an approach to computing," she said. "People didn't
know how useful Bob is for home management-writing letters,
tracking schedules...We need to address the issue of what people
are using it for as well as how easy it is to use."

Bajarin agreed that consumers didn't see past Bob's interface.
But he questioned whether even new users would be satisfied
with Bob as, say, a word processor or a household finance manager,
when they've seen what can be done with more sophisticated
products such as Word or Quicken.

"The bottom line is, people wanted these robust applications,"
Bajarin said.

Walter Miao, a software specialist at IDC/Link Resources, New
York, voiced similar criticisms.

"It's certainly a cute program and interesting to a neophyte.
It's a convenient home-oriented all-in-one package. But once
the novelty wears off, it's a very boring package," Miao said.
"I can't do enough with it."

Some of these criticisms may be addressed in the next release
of Bob. Stewart said the product was on an 18- to 24-month
upgrade cycle, which means that Bob 2.0 would not roll out
much before Q4 of 1996.

She declined to comment on changes under consideration, but
they're said to include everything from the addition of telephony
features and less cartoon-like personal guides to the integration
of modules from other Microsoft productivity packages.

Bajarin believes Bob may be a product that came before its time.
He pointed out that the vast majority of first-time PC buyers
right now are in households with income of $42,000 or more
a group that would tend to either be PC-literate to begin with
or have friends and family members who are.

Top 100 surpass $23B

By:
ROGER C. LANCTOT

NEW YORK-For the second year in a row, the retail computer industry
hit the jackpot in 1995, posting a 38.3 percent gain in sales,
according to Computer Retail Week's annual survey of the top
100 computer retailers.

The retail portion of sales was up a robust 45 percent, to $19.3
billion, with total sales, including non-retail sales, surpassing
$23.1 billion.

The sales data in the CRW report is based on estimates derived
from public and private data sources. The data reflects estimates
of sales for calendar year 1995.

Five stores finished with more than $1 billion in sales of computer
related merchandise, two more than last year. CompUSA, Best
Buy and Computer City SuperCenters were joined in the billion
dollar club by Office Depot and Circuit City Stores.

Hardware drove market gains with a hefty 45 percent increase
compared to 1994, according to the CRW report. Software sales
swelled by 26 percent, propelled by gains in the office superstore,
electronics superstore, mass merchant and warehouse club channels.

Software specialists' sales were flat compared to '94 as this
mall-skewed channel continued to take a pounding from superstore
retailers and a dramatic broadening of the software marketplace
to include book, toy and media retailers as well as supermarkets.

As a group, software specialists Electronics Boutique, NeoStar,
Egghead and Software City saw their collective share of retail
computer merchandise sales drop from 8.9 percent in '94 to
6.5 percent in '95.

The number of stores selling computer-related products jumped
by 13.3 percent in '95, based solely on a review of the top
100 computer retailers. New members of CRW's Top 100 list include
Toys R Us with 650 stores selling software, and media retailer
Virgin Megastore with five locations.

Circuit City jumped into fifth place with a 101.4 percent increase
in computer-related sales in '95 compared with '94. The company
jumped ahead of Micro Center, which moved ahead of Egghead
Software.

All three major office superstores made the top-10 list this
year and were among with biggest gainers. Staples had a 225
percent gain to finish in eighth place; OfficeMax was up 49
percent in ninth place; and Office Depot notched a 66 percent
gain to finish fourth for the second year in a row behind Computer
City. Best Buy rang up $2.5 billion in computer sales, a 47
percent increase.

Computer City opened 26 stores in the United States in '95 to
help stimulate its 62 percent sales gain, putting the chain
in third place in overall sales behind CompUSA and Best Buy.
CompUSA remained the dominant hardware retailer, with more
than $2 billion in hardware sales in '95. And Egghead held
onto its crown as the leading software retailer, despite flat
sales.

Computer superstores accounted for 36.1 percent of all retail
computer sales in '95, the largest share overall. Electronics
superstores captured 18.8 percent of all computer-related retail
sales, and office superstores increased their share of retail
computer merchandise sales from 10.1 percent in '94 to 13.2
percent in '95.

TV tube vendors picture hybrid PCs -- Most Focusing On 27-,
35-Inch Monitors Made For PC/TV Units



NEW YORK-Amid growing talk of personal computers and other consumer
electronics converging, television tube manufacturers are venturing
into the uncharted territory of PC/TVs.

The exact size of the market for a product that conceivably
would combine the processing power of a PC with the ability
of a TV tube to deliver bright, clear pictures remains ill
defined. But despite this lack of parameters, interest among
tube manufacturers is surging, with some projecting a 300,000
 to 400,000-unit market in 1996, with most PC/TVs carrying
a $1,000 suggested retail price.

Most of this interest has centered on big-screen tubes in the
27- to 35-inch range, which currently have a standard-grade
0.55 dot pitch. The market activity will eventually move into
the high-resolution 0.28 dot pitch range, the hallmark of PC
monitors.

"All we know is we've had a lot of inquiries and a lot of interest
in doing a large-format display, with the applications being
presentations and interactive TV," said an executive with a
Japanese electronics giant. "We're all wondering where this
is going, and I think a lot of these guys who are jumping on
the bandwagon are doing so because they've heard somebody else
is."

Indeed, when Apple introduced a full-function Macintosh PC with
a 14-inch monitor and a TV tuner in 1993, it was alone with
a product that survived only a short time on retail shelves.
Toshiba followed with the 20-inch Toshiba Integrated Multimedia
Monitor (TIMM) in 1994 and has had limited success selling
the concept to such retail powers as Circuit City.

But now Hitachi has said it will introduce a 27-inch model this
year, while Thomson Consumer Electronics will use the Winter
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week to gauge interest
in finer-pitch 19-, 27- and 35-inch multimedia monitors. Even
Proton, which builds conventional PC monitors on an OEM basis,
said it will introduce 15- and 17-inch PC/TVs in 1996, even
though it concedes a large market won't emerge until 1997.

Where these initial product offerings will lead and who will
buy them is open for debate. Many industry officials argue
that corporate presentations are likely to be the first target,
and they point to Toshiba's TIMM, which has sold less than
100,000 units during its first year on the market at $799 retail.

"It's really for industrial presentations at this point, and
we may not bring the product to market until 1997," said William
Tovatt, sales and marketing vice president at Proton. "I think
the learning curve in the education for consumers has to start."

Stephen Nickerson, vice president of marketing for TVs and VCRs
at Toshiba, said the company plans to move to larger sizes
and is studying a 27-inch tube currently available in Japan.
While TIMM's 0.55 dot pitch has slowed sales, perceptions change
"once people understand what the product is and what the differences
are," Nickerson said. "We believe there is definitely a market
for this and it's just a matter of when we introduce other
products."

Whether there will be a consumer market for PC/TVs will be determined
at the retail level, where dealers have yet to fully embrace
the concept. If the product uses a standard-grade TV monitor,
some dealers said, it may get caught up in the dot pitch "numbers
game" that governs conventional PC monitors.

The goal of most potential entrants in the PC/TV race is a 0.28
dot pitch monitor, but that would require a design to compensate
for the brightness that is lost in moving to a finer dot pitch.
While 0.55 monitors serve well for presentations and NTSC video,
a fine pitch is needed for a "hard-core work machine" used
for spreadsheets and other forms of number crunching, manufacturers
said.

One option could be to use a technology like Toshiba's high
contrast "Microfilter" tube, which raises brightness while
electronically increasing contrast by placing a color filter
in front of each phosphor dot.

"TV/PCs don't spec out with some of the better monitors right
now," L.A.Tronics video buyer Robert Becker said. "So a lot
of people dismiss them as not a serious piece of computer equipment.
But as the market matures, there will be a need for cross-compatibility,
so these companies are doing the right thing in getting involved."

Yet despite the focus on fine-pitch tubes, a medium-resolution
product may be the best option for a device designed for mixed
applications, said Edward Egert, vice president of sales and
marketing for Philips Display Products.

Egert concedes the company is looking for the "right combination
of performance characteristics," but hasn't decided on the
final specifications.

"Multimedia says the consumers will use these products for the
alphanumerics as well as with picture graphics," said Egert.
"Commercial products have been a way of shaking out a technology
and getting a better margin while you're doing it, but I'm
seeing this coming from both sides, because there is a lot
of interest from the consumer producers as well."

One thing that does remain certain, however, is that the market
will be dominated by conventional tubes. Thomson showed a 26
inch wide-screen monitor at Comdex in April, but couldn't sell
customers on the concept. Thomson has since switched development
efforts to conventional 4 x 3 aspect ratio tubes.

Packard Bell firms up its software company

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CALIF.-Capitalizing on its retail brand presence,
Packard Bell is expected to announce at the Winter Consumer
Electronics Show that it has renamed its computer software
subsidiary Packard Bell Interactive, hired two additional sales
executives and launched a remerchandising program.

The year-old company, which has been using the name Active Imagination,
launched a line of budget-priced children's storybook CD-ROM
titles early last year. But despite Packard Bell's mighty PC
presence in the industry, retailers were only stocking limited
selections of the products. "We didn't have the large distribution
that the top titles have," said Glen Uslan, vice president
of marketing for the software company.

Thus, Packard Bell elected to change the company name to a brand
that is immediately recognizable to consumers. The company
also hired John Rutter, formerly a channel marketing manager
with Microsoft, as senior vice president of sales and marketing.
Working under Rutter will be Steve Boehm, vice president of
worldwide sales, who was previously North American sales manager
at Medio Multimedia.

In addition, the software firm has priced all its products at
$24.99 to $29.99 with the intent of increasing perceived value.
Uslan said the titles, previously priced at $19.99, were intended
to be merchandised as a budget shipper display. However, Uslan
said retailers generally purchased a few SKUs from the line
and displayed the titles with other CD-ROMs in the edutainment
section, where customers would expect to see higher-priced
products.

"An impulse purchase only works if merchandised as an impulse
buy, and retailers were not prepared to do that," Uslan explained.

CA may tailor software bundles -- Publisher's Consumer Division
Looks To Gain Market Share For Its Titles

By:
Kathleen Richards

ISLANDIA, N.Y.-This week at the Consumer Electronics Show, Computer
Associates' consumer division, 4Home Productions, will discuss
with retailers and potential OEM partners customized CD-ROM
disc compilations.

The move is an effort by the company to gain market share from
division titles, which to date have shown lackluster retail
sales. Last fall, the company decided not to offer SimplyTax
through the retail channel due to unacceptably low stocking
levels.

"SimplyKids and SimplyHouse are not going to make a fortune
at retail," said Steve Gersten, 4Home Productions' director
of sales. "The alternate channel program provides good products
at a very good price-around $5 or $6, with little risk to the
retailer.

"4Home Productions has more than 30 [OEM] agreements in the
process," said Gersten.

All shipping consumer division titles are available for the
compilation program, excluding SimplyAccounting.

Huge Headaches Or Huge Profits? -- Megastores: Looking at the
bigger picture



NEW YORK-As consumer electronics and home-office retail chains
rush to open ever-larger stores, it remains to be seen whether
there will be profits at the end of the expansion.

The growth of the so-called megastores has occurred across the
country at an unending pace. Mammoth Incredible Universe stores
sprout in suburbia, Best Buy brings a 58,000-square-foot Concept
III format to Los Angeles and even Roberd's tries its hand
with a 250,000-square-foot outlet in Ohio. Circuit City, once
known for its cautious approach to expansion, is including
larger, 42,000-square-foot outlets as only a small portion
of the 60 to 65 stores it will open in 1996. Office Depot is
opening its first megastores, while The Good Guys! is scouting
turf for new 60,000-square-foot WOW! stores.

But while the number of megastores is growing rapidly, profits
are not. Incredible Universe began the year looking for a profit,
but will end it with an $11 million loss, analysts said.

Best Buy had planned to open 30 to 40 stores in 1996, but it
has come under intense pressure from investors to scale back
and restore profitability.

The issue has become whether the larger stores can generate
enough sales to overcome the increases in overhead that megastores
incur. Analysts point out that megastores should save retailers
money in the long run, since bigger outlets eliminate the need
for adding several smaller ones in a given market. But that
theory remains open for debate.

"There is a basic idea at retail that bigger is better, and
to a point, that is correct," said Ursula Moran, a research
analyst at Sanford P. Bernstein & Co., New York. "But the problem
is, sometimes retailers don't know when enough is enough. Having
done well with 32,000 square feet, better with 45,000, Best
Buy goes to 58,000, and 58,000 is too big."

Indeed, while megastores supply lower prices and larger product
selection, they haven't quite defined themselves for consumers.
While Incredible Universe tries to provide an entertaining
shopping environment, its merchandising of housewares and exercise
equipment with PCs and consumer electronics hasn't produced
profits.

Others have tried to offset a price-driven image with ventures
into high-end audio and have met mixed results.

Even office superstores that were once easy to define are branching
out to open 50,000-square-foot stores that offer copy centers
and office furniture along with PCs and printers.

The need to provide a defining characteristic has become even
more critical in an era where consumers may look at ads from
five stores but, on average, shop at fewer than two, analysts
said. Shopping demographics like these have led some analysts
to project that half of all retail stores will be gone by the
year 2000, and that only those with a niche will survive.

Consumer electronics and office superstores are still relative
newcomers to the megastore game, and without a niche they may
have limited life spans, said analysts.

"In every big box there is a point where you go beyond being
impressive to a point where you're too confusing," said Britt
Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, Charleston, S.C.
"And that's why I think some of Best Buy's newer stores aren't
meeting their expectations. And if you look at some of these
Incredible Universe stores, they've gone over the edge."

But despite such shortcomings, the megastores have their supporters,
who argue that the format is in its infancy when it comes to
consumer electronics and that many markets remain open for
expansion.

"The buyers at Home Depot and Ikea, which are well accepted,
all buy consumer electronics. It's the same customer just making
a different purchase," Channel Marketing president David Goldstein
said.

But where consumers buy products is becoming increasingly critical
in determining the livelihoods of regional retailers. The growth
of megastores may also mean the end for some regional chains.

And while megastore supporters claim that the bigger outlets
increase overall sales in a given market, the question becomes
whether the sales are new revenues or taken from a competitor.

The past year has seen an unusually large number of retailers
close their doors at the same time others are opening theirs.
Smith's Home Furnishings liquidated this fall, a little over
a year after The Good Guys! and Incredible Universe arrived
in the Pacific Northwest. And Swallen's closed its stores in
Cincinnati after 46 years, citing, among other things, increased
competition from consumer electronics retailers like Sun TV,
which entered the market with its larger, 50,000-square-foot
Super Savings Centers.

"It's a zero-sum game at this point, because the projected growth
rate of the big retailers is well in excess of the market growth
rate. They grow by taking share from somebody else," Moran
said.

Sega now on the MAP

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

REDWOOD CITY, CALIF.-Sega of America this year plans to speed
release of new game titles to market, work to solidify retail
relationships and firm up its new ventures into the distribution
and software businesses, president and chief executive Tom
Kalinske said in an interview with CRW last month.

Among more notable changes at Sega as the year drew to a close,
the company implemented a minimum advertised pricing (MAP)
strategy on its products. Retailers "seemed to be OK with it.
Almost everyone thinks it is a cool idea," Kalinske said.

But the game maker is still struggling with retailer backlash
over its surprise decision last year to launch its Saturn system
exclusively to three retailers.

While some retailers are still privately expressing dismay over
Sega's announcement last May that it would ship Saturn systems
early to NeoStar stores, Electronics Boutique and Toys 'R'
Us, Kalinske said Sega's position to retailers will be very
clear during the coming year.

"We launched Saturn early because of significant consumer demand
and to get a jump on the competition," he said. "The impact
that had on our retail relationships was a difficult lesson
to learn. I believe we have a very good read on the situation
and are working to make relationships with our retailers much
stronger than before, with specific POP, demonstrator and information
campaigns that are helping our retailers in the entire category."

In addition to stitching together some torn retailer relationships,
Sega is pushing forward with Sega Soft, a joint venture announced
in November by Japanese software developer CSK Group.

Although Kalinske would not discuss specific projects already
under way at the company, he said titles from the venture will
begin to ship sometime in summer or fall. One such project,
he said, marries film graphics and computer animation with
multiplayer capabilities; another is a multiplayer sports game
that lets users make changes in the game that aren't currently
possible.

While Sega Soft will focus primarily on PC and Saturn games,
developers will also be designing games for the Internet in
the future, said Kalinske.

Combined with the titles that are also in development at Sega
of America, Kalinske said there are about 30 software titles
in development for this year, with an additional 25 titles
in production in Japan that could also be marketed in the United
States. Add to that other titles in development from third
party developers and the market will see about 180 titles this
year for the Saturn system, Kalinske said.

"It always comes down to who has the best software," he said.
"What we do [in the United States] is create software. We happen
to have hardware platforms too, but largely we make software.
We think that gives us a leg up over the competition, but we
will see."

The company will focus on its core hardware products: the Pico
for 3- to 7-year-olds, the Genesis for 8- to 13-year-olds,
and the Saturn, intended for those 14 and older.

Despite the increased number of titles coming to market from
Sega this year, the company's distribution facility will still
not reach maximum capacity. Thus, Sega teamed with the giant
Softbank conglomerate, in a deal announced late last year,
to provide distribution services for publishers and peripherals
manufacturers. At press time, Sega still had not chosen a name
for the company, which has been operating under the code name
Game Express. Sega expects to announce a name for the company
and its first vendors at the end of this month.

The new company differs from a traditional distributor in that
it does not seek to help vendors sell products to retail. What
it will provide instead is efficient distribution and fulfillment.

The distribution company's strong suit, according to Kalinske,
is a highly effective computer system that can deliver product
direct to stores in as little as 24 hours, but usually between
38 and 48 hours.

The system can link directly with retailers using EDI. But for
those retailers that don't rely on such capabilities, the new
company will have reps in the field that can place EDI from
the retail site using a notebook computer, a feature Sega of
America currently offers its retail customers.

SPA head testifies in FTC probe

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

SAN MATEO, CALIF.-The Software Publishers Association, through
testimony to the Federal Trade Commission on Dec. 20, made
public its position on a variety of competitive issues that
face the computer industry, including controversial exclusive
distribution models that have sparked debate recently.

Ken Wasch, president of the SPA, told Computer Retail Week that
the FTC has been conducting broad public hearings to examine
how antitrust principles, written and enforced in the industrial
age, will apply to companies as the United States moves into
the information age. The hearings are unrelated to an informal
inquiry launched by the FTC late last year into some software
publishers' refusal to supply titles to publisher/distributor
NewMedia Express.

About 30 companies have testified at the broader industry hearings,
Wasch said, including the Computer and Communications Industry
Association, IBM and Borland. Microsoft, NewMedia Express and
GoodTimes Interactive have not testified in the hearings, said
an FTC spokeswoman.

The spokeswoman said the three-month-long hearings, which have
been extended until Jan. 23, will be used to determine if changes
are necessary in "policy or other areas" in high-tech competition.

The SPA hopes the hearings will result in new guidelines on
how the FTC deals with what the SPA terms "abusive practices
by dominant firms."

Wasch's testimony to the FTC was centered on discriminatory
access to information from the developer of a market-dominating
operating system or platform, exclusionary restraints in technology
licensing agreements and control over retail distribution channels.

Regarding exclusive distribution agreements, Wasch said in his
testimony: "Many of our members depend on the major mass-merchandising
retail chains for the distribution and sale of their software
products to the ultimate consumer.

"Effective market access rests on meaningful shelf space and
other merchandising treatment of their products at the retail
level. Yet, increasingly, these retail chains have been persuaded
to transfer to dominant competitors the control over shelf
space and other critical merchandising functions for entire
product categories within their stores. As a result, our smaller
members must work through and depend entirely upon their major
competitors for their placements in these stores. It is unrealistic
to expect fair treatment or anything approaching a level playing
field in this situation.

"In short, dominant firms have incentives to misuse their power
over retail channels as a means of maintaining and enhancing
their dominance by impairing the ability of smaller rivals
to develop satisfactory distribution arrangements. Again, we
would invite consideration of whether and how government antitrust
enforcement policy could appropriately address this problem."

As part of his testimony, Wasch also said the SPA conducted
a survey of its 1,200 members regarding anti-competitive issues.
Wasch reported that respondents of the survey are "greatly
concerned that increased distribution control by software companies
raises barriers to entry for new software companies."

According to the testimony, eight in 10 respondents said, "The
increased control of distribution channels by software publishers
has raised barriers to entry for new software companies or
threatened the existence of existing software companies."

Retail Digest


The Home Computing Supershow kicked off its third event in San
Francisco last week with approximately 34,000 attendees. Like
its rival ComputerMania, launched by Softbank earlier last
year, the expo houses software, hardware and online vendors,
as well as a number of computer stations where children and
adults can test new software or try their hand at the Internet.
Circuit City and the regional CompuTown were selling hardware
and software at booths as well. Managers from both stores said
that while sales were good by the second day of the show, consumer
awareness and name recognition were the priority. By far, the
most popular demonstrations at the show were the children's
demo stations, where parents and kids could test-drive the
latest edutainment titles.

Service Merchandise's former assistant vice president and computer
buyer, Mike Malone, is launching his own computer and telephone
store, called W2F2, in Nashville. At press time, he was planning
a soft opening on the Friday before Christmas. The 3,256-square
foot unit will position itself as a "convergence" store, doing
build-to-order PCs but also carrying Packard Bell. "I'm trying
to put the personal back into the PC," Malone said last month.

RadioShack president Leonard Roberts (pictured below) took on
the additional role of president of Tandy last month, according
to the companies. Roberts is credited with turning the RadioShack
chain into one of the gems of the Tandy fold. Roberts reports
to Tandy chairman and chief executive John Roach, who last
held the title of president.

Montgomery Ward said George Antoon has been named divisional
merchandise manager for all home and office categories. He
was previously senior buyer for computers and machines. Also
at Ward, Laura Soosloff has been named buyer for business machines.
She reports to Antoon.

Apex Department Stores, Pawtucket, R.I., named Malcolm Ballinger
electronics group merchandise manager. He had been general
merchandise manager for Campo in New Orleans, and did stints
with Mrs. B's and helped found defunct World Radio.

Office Depot said Todd Daer, who had recently joined the company
as senior software buyer after working with distributor Tech
Data, has left the company and was replaced by an inside staffer.

Syncronys, amid FTC inquiry, recalls SoftRAM95

By:
Kathleen Richards

NEW YORK-After months of controversy, Syncronys, on Dec. 18,
recalled SoftRAM95, its best-selling memory enhancement product,
as the Federal Trade Commission investigates whether the product
worked as advertised by the company.

SoftRAM95 was shipped in August and quickly became the leading
Windows 95 utility at retail. The software, which carried a
$29.99 suggested retail price, was the first Windows 95 memory
utility to reach the market, and promised to "Double Your Memory,"
providing consumers with an inexpensive software solution to
the RAM-intensive Windows 95 operating system.

By November, Vancouver, British Columbia-based Syncronys had
sold 400,000 units of SoftRAM95 through retail, and the product
had remained the leading utility at retail since it was first
shipped in August, according to market researcher PC Data,
Reston, Va.

Although most customers apparently could not tell the difference
as evidenced by few returns-SoftRAM95 provided no memory improvements
to Windows 95 users, according to a National Software Testing
Laboratories test commissioned by competing publisher Connectix.

Syncronys notified channel partners in an Oct. 25 letter that
for the Windows 95 version of the product, which was shipped
in the same box as the Windows 3.1 version, "RAM compression
is not being delivered to the operating system on a consistent
basis." The letter stated that Syncronys would sticker boxes,
and would offer Windows 95 users a Windows 95 upgrade release
free of charge when it was shipped, or a full refund if desired.

Egghead and PriceCostco removed the leading utility immediately
from their stores. CompUSA has reduced the price on the product
to $9.95.

"The recall was to end the consumer confusion and to make a
clean break," said Syncronys president Rainer Poertner. "We
will resubmit upgrades of the Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 versions
of SoftRAM to Microsoft and Veritest, an independent testing
firm, within the next few days."

In fact, SoftRAM95 had not qualified for the "Designed for Windows
95" logo, although the logo appeared on the box, according
to Russ Stockdale, Windows 95 marketing manager at Microsoft.
"They did not qualify and were never authorized to display
it on their packaging," he said.

As the market-leading Windows 95 memory utility is recalled
from retail, competing publishers are left the task of convincing
consumers that the category is still viable.

Quarterdeck Office Systems, a supplier of DOS memory management
products, shipped MagnaRAM 2 in September, and the same technology
is incorporated in the company's higher-end QEMM 8 memory management
software. Both titles are native Windows 95 applications.

Connectix is entering the Windows 95 category after achieving
phenomenal success with its RAM Doubler software for the Macintosh
and limited success with a Windows 3.1 title. A native Windows
95 version of RAM Doubler is slated to ship early this year.

"I think that [SoftRAM95] has probably caused some confusion
among consumers in Q4 and will in Q1," said Roy MacDonald,
chief executive officer of Connectix. "The established companies
have to educate consumers that there are good solutions in
this category. In the long term, it won't have a lasting impact."

Many retailers increased direct business in '95

By:
MICHAEL WALD

NEW YORK-Many personal-computer retailers reported strong growth
in their direct-channel business during 1995, amid new and
expanded mail-order initiatives and corporate sales opportunities
sparked by Windows 95.

Others expanded their direct operations onto the Internet or
simply mailed more catalogs.

The arrival of Windows 95 last August boosted corporate sales
as businesses replaced or upgraded older machines to run the
new operating system, retailers said.

"We've seen a tremendous increase in our corporate sales as
companies replaced old systems with Pentium machines, and bought
more storage and memory for existing machines," said Larry
Adler, vice president of marketing at NCA Computer Products,
Sunnyvale, Calif.

CDW Computer Center president Greg Zeman said his company's
mail-order business grew more CPU-intensive as major systems
vendors gave the channel more attention in 1995. The company
won authorization to sell the full Apple Computer line through
mail order, and also participated in a Compaq pilot mail-order
program.

Some computer retailers that had previously avoided direct channels
jumped in last year. Computer City Super-Centers announced
its entry into the direct-marketing channel last June and sent
catalogs to more than 1 million customers last October. Prices
in those catalogs appeared to match those in its stores.

Other mail-order marketers, including Creative Computers, Micro
Warehouse, Programmer's Paradise, CDW and Insight Enterprises,
issued public offerings in 1995 to fuel expansion efforts focused
mainly on increasing catalog mailings.

Mail-order market leader Micro Warehouse moved aggressively
to increase the frequency of catalog mailings, the number of
people and businesses that received them and the breadth of
product offerings. Others, such as CDW and Insight Enterprises,
also stepped up catalog mailings and said they planned to further
expand such efforts in 1996.

Insight Direct, a division of Tempe, Ariz.-based Insight Enterprises,
mailed 7.4 million catalogs in fiscal year 1995, which ended
June 30. In fiscal 1996, the company projects it will mail
20 million to 30 million catalogs.

NCA increased catalog mailings from 10,000 units in 1994 to
400,000 last year, Adler said. Other smaller outfits, such
as Computer Town in Salem, N.H., and State Street Discount
in Portsmouth, N.H., also stepped up catalog mailings this
year, targeting customers beyond the local market for the first
time.

Even retailers that planned to expand catalog mailings more
slowly, such as Elek-Tek, which plans to go from three mailings
in 1995 to seven in 1996, are following Micro Warehouse's lead
in developing specialty catalogs for subsets of customers within
their databases.

Innovation wasn't limited solely to catalog mailings. Several
retailers and mail-order computer resellers unveiled Internet
sites in 1995. Some of these sites permitted point-and-click
credit-card purchases, while others were limited to displaying
products and a toll-free number for placing orders.

The Internet Shopping Network (ISN), Palo Alto, Calif., sold
more than

$1 million in personal-computer hardware and software in October
1995, vice president of marketing Bill Rollinson said.

Traffic Report: A Glance Back And A Look Ahead -- Best-dressed stories of '95
and '96

By:
KEVIN FERGUSON

OK, let's waste no time: Here are my top stories of 1995 and
1996.

 Best Slugfest: Undoubtedly no secret to anyone in the industry,
the controversy over used parts was a great shocker to the
rest of the world.

The finger-pointing between Compaq and Packard Bell, which is
far from over, quickly escalated to wild mud-slinging.

 Most Humorous Explanation:Packard Bell's retort to Compaq's
allegations that it was including used parts in its computers.
Packard Bell explained that it was just trying to be environmentally
conscious.

It's good to know our landfills will only overflow with disposable
diapers rather than hard drives, although hard drives break
down a lot faster.

 Most Successful Product Launch: Windows 95.

 Most Annoying Product Launch: Windows 95.

 Most Impressive Come-back: CompUSA, which improved margins
and sales, and still continued to expand.

 Toughest Strategy to Defend: The New-Media Express software
distribution model. Face it, the idea of working with your
chief competitor in hopes of beating your competitor is never
going to be all that popular.

 Most Familiar Story: Product shortages. While desktop sales
were still as strong in 1995 as they were in 1994, they could
have been that much stronger if supplies of the most popular
items had been available (typically those employing higher
end Pentiums). Look for a repeat in 1996.

 One Of The More Interesting Retail Stories In Progress: The
comeuppance due computer and electronics retailers whose zero
percent financing deals are no deals at all.

 Even Better Than That: The introduction of Internet boxes,
$500 PCs or whatever you want to call them.

Additionally, the growth of online, interactive gaming and computing
through cable companies and the Telcos.

 Mergers I'd Like To See In 1996: Micro Center and Elek-Tek;
Packard Bell and NEC; and me and the ski lift at Vail.

Editorial: PC retail market deserves your attention

By:
KEITH NEWMAN

For the third straight year, you have in front of you our Top
100/CES issue-the most exciting way we can think of to start
off the new year. And, once again, we have gone beyond our
existing standard by offering more data and analysis with the
goal of keeping you ahead of the sharp PC retail power curve.

It may seem odd to consider, but PCs are the most exciting high
growth category in the retail market today. Still, those who
try and drive it too hard are just as reckless as those who
fail to devote the necessary resources and commitment to it.
And, right now, the PC retail market deserves significant focus.

Consumer computing is booming, thanks to repeat home buyers
and work-at-home and small-business customers who overwhelmingly
shop at retail. Together, this represents a large and growing
percentage of the entire PC market. It may seem hard to fathom,
given the precarious profit picture most are faced with, but
the fact is, PCs remain the savior of technology retailers
and PC makers. According to research firm ARS, its survey of
50 retail computer superstore locations this past week revealed
that 58 percent of retailers believe that PC sales are better
than expected. Contrast this with everything else being written
about holiday retail sales or the overall outlook of retail
and it's easy to see the importance that computers hold for
these merchants.

But what remains difficult is trying to package this broad group
of retailers under one banner like the CRW Top 100. There are
high-service and self-service, destination and mall stores;
virtual stores and catalog showrooms; software-only chains;
media malls and cyberstores. And the list only continues to
broaden as retailers look to reach more customers and offer
more value. However, we feel this makes this comprehensive
and exhaustive project, which is spearheaded by our editorial
research director Roger Lanctot, more valuable than ever.

Just consider some of the findings: Overall store count among
the Top 100 has surpassed 20,000 locations, and total sales
are $23 billion, compared with $16 billion last year. Another
finding, to paraphrase an executive of one of our Top 10 companies
 "Leaders lead or get moved out of the way."

A case in point, CompUSA, the No. 1 retailer on our list, is
once again taking a leadership position, marketing to kids,
moms, power users, corporate buyers and selling more service
than ever before. Similarly, Tandy's three major retail chains
all deserve congratulations for driving store counts and sales
while pushing the envelope and testing new categories and new
marketing efforts.

Yet, the powerful regional computer superstores are giving no
quarter, while the office superstore and consumer electronics
chains are promoting the PC category like never before.

There are numerous other key market indicators throughout this

3D Learning -- Kids get more CD morphing

By:
KAREN BANNAN

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, look out. Grandma Ollie is on
the way.

Harber Brothers Productions, an upstart children's software
company based in New York, this year will release two series
of children's CD-ROMs: KinderActive Musicals and KinderActive
Minds. The series feature 3-D rendering and morphing technology
targeted at children ages 3 through 8.

The first title from the KinderActive Minds series, Grandma's
Morphabet Soup, features a 3-D rendered kitchen in which children
can move and explore.

The title is designed to teach children early reading and learning
skills. Children are guided through the product by Grandma
Ollie. Sections include a 3-D spelling wheel that takes advantage
of both morphing and 3-D technology.

Grandma asks children to find a letter on the spinning wheel.
Once the correct letter is chosen, it morphs into an animal
or item that begins with the letter.

"We think kids are going to want to use the morphing over and
over. And as they play, they will be reinforcing the learning,"
said Jonathan Harber, the company president.

When he sat down to plan the software lines, he recruited several
veterans of the children's education and edutainment business
to sit on the company's board of advisors. They include a former
executive producer and head writer for "Sesame Street" and
"3-2-1 Contact," the producer of "Captain Kangaroo" and an
associate in education at the American Museum of Natural History
in New York.

In addition to the new technology, most of the titles employ
techniques similar to those that made the PBS children's television
programming so popular: music and character development. Jonathan
Harber feels both elements are missing from many of today's
software titles.

The company plans to release children's music tapes and CDs
in conjunction with the software launch. Harber says he hopes
to capture a healthy percentage of the children's music market,
which is now dominated by one company.

"The children's music market is 90 percent owned by Disney.
Kids really respond to music," said Harber.

He said that with the release of the KinderActive series the
company hopes to change the face of education, bringing it
into the home.

"Every industry has been updated from 100 years ago. If you
put doctors from 1896 in today's hospital, they would be lost
and unable to do their job. But if you brought teachers forward
in time, they would feel right at home. The change in children's
education is overdue, and it's starting in the home," said
Harber.

Business Deals Flourish -- Spinning a Web of infinite opportunities

By:
BRADLEY J. FIKES

Microsoft's belated but dramatic embrace of the WorldWide Web
early last month proved it: The Web's growth has become self
sustaining. As its ease of use and versatility increases, more
businesses find the Web impossible to ignore.

Just a few months ago, Microsoft appeared to be a near-monopoly,
able to set industry standards virtually at will. But during
the week of Dec. 4, it licensed Sun Microsystems' Java programming
technology for the Web and took other steps aimed at making
its software, including Windows 95, more Web-compatible.

Meanwhile, companies such as IBM, Netscape Communica-tions,
America Online and Intuit made their own Java-related deals
with Sun to create an easy-to-use Web programming language
rivaling Microsoft's own Visual Basic Script.

The story goes far beyond Microsoft's struggle to maintain its
dominant position in software, industry observers say. The
Web has created its own market, as well as opportunities that
the business community is now beginning to exploit seriously.

Trends include:

 A growing parallel retail market, especially for software and
other technology goods.

 Synergies between the Web and traditional advertising vehicles.

 Use of the Web as an "Intranet," allowing nearly platform-independent
communication between distant units of a business.

As for retail opportunities, retail outlets on the Web such
as eShop and Internet Shopping Network have so proliferated
they are no longer a novelty in the industry.

Salida, Colo.-based consultant Woody Liswood said the Web has
become an important supplementary market for retailing technology.
However, the average consumer will have little use for Web
shopping for now.

"I see it as being useful for people who already know what they
want," Liswood said. "When you reach that level of sophistication,
you can say 'OK, I wonder what's available' and do a Yahoo
search for modems."

As an example, Liswood pointed to one company, modems.com, that
sells its products exclusively through the Web.

"It used to be retail, they pulled it off the market and now
they're selling their modem-I think it's one of the best on
the market-strictly through the Web."

The canonical example of doing business via the Web is Netscape.
The company is known for essentially giving away its popular
Web browser to individual users so as to increase demand for
its server software. However, its Netscape General Store has
become increasingly more important to the company, said Hugh
Hempel, director of electronic marketing.

In February, Netscape put up a basic online order form, Hempel
said. In August, Netscape installed a full-fledged online store
where browsers could buy software, books, and even clothing
items such as boxer shorts embroidered with Netscape's mascot,
Mozilla.

"The Netscape store showcases our technology, but it's also
responsible for transacting at least 5-percent-plus, maybe
10 percent, of our business from a software point of view,"
Hempel said. "It's a non-trivial part of our story."

Hempel pointed to Internet Shopping Network, which advertises
"quite liberally" on Netscape's Web site, as another success
story.

"I know for a fact they're doing good business in both hardware
and software retailing on the 'net," Hempel said. "There are
certainly some people who otherwise would have gotten in their
car and driven down to CompUSA or wherever, but didn't do it.
I think it's a phenomenon that is not a flash in the pan by
any stretch of the imagination."

Liswood and Hempel agreed that the problem of data security,
while it exists, has been exaggerated.

"I think it's something the Eastern press likes to yell about
because it makes good headlines, but they're not computer users,
and I don't think they understand the problem," Liswood said.

According to Hempel, "The people who ultimately take the risk
are not the end users anyway," because credit card companies
don't make customers pay for fraudulent bills. "If you called
up Visa today and asked how they ranked the risk, the lowest
risk transaction for them is over the Internet. It doesn't
jibe with what the media says."

Concern will subside as Internet shopping becomes more familiar
to the public, Hempel said. The Web has also given new life
to the venerable software tradition of shareware. A Web site
eliminates the need to convince online services and bulletin
board systems to offer a software application.

Software author Kenn Nesbitt sells his WebEdit HTML Editor for
Windows exclusively via his Web site (http://nesbitt.com/).
Web consultant Larry M. Edwards said Nesbitt's selling strategy
is ideal, because it targets only potential customers.

"Anybody working on the Web would want to use his product; people
who aren't working on the Web have absolutely no use for his
product," said San Diego-based Edwards, who helped bring the
America's Cup to the Internet as part of America's Cup Online.

However, Netscape's Hempel and Charles Gillespie, vice president
for publishing of San Diego-based Web content designer Bien
Logic, said companies with a substantial retail store presence
must be alert for potential conflicts if they set up shop on
the Web.

"There is a bit of a conflict of interest in cases of software
developers and others who have very strong relationships with
dealers and VAR resellers," Gillespie said. "They don't want
to jeopardize their points of sale by going online and undercutting
the price."

Retail Net: DONKEY BUSINESS



Two million preorders for Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong
Quest, combined with a production schedule that slipped slightly,
means serious shortages for Nintendo. The title shipped last
month, but Nintendo said it has only about 1 million copies
of the SNES game to ship to retailers.

Nintendo officials were evaluating which retailers would receive
orders. At the top of the list were those with advertising
commitments and consumer pre-orders. But deciding on allocation
"is not a pleasant task," said one Nintendo official. Meanwhile,
Toys R Us said it would give away a 128-page "Nintendo Official
Donkey Kong 2 Player's Guide," a $10 value that is full of
tips and techniques on clever ways to beat the game. With the
book, consumers will also receive a Feb. 1 game delivery guarantee
from Toys R Us.

In software, six out of seven Toys R Us shoppers did not know
the stores carried software, according to a survey commissioned
by the retailer. Nonetheless, one analyst said sales so far
could place Toys R Us among the top 10 retailers for educational
titles.

Edutainment titles at CES to feature 3-D technology

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

With 3-D the talk of the industry for entertainment games, it's
no surprise that edutainment titles being announced this year
at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show also showcase the technology.
Learning programs from such publishers as Davidson & Associates
and The Learning Company also take advantage of 3-D worlds
to put more "entertainment" into edutainment. On the entertainment
front, watch for live-action video titles from PowerHouse Entertainment
as well as simulations and more game packs.

WizardWorks is capitalizing on the 3-D craze with a bundle of
three game titles popular at retail for their 360 degrees of
entertainment. The new 3-D Action Pack includes Terminal Velocity,
Rise of the Triad: The Hunt Begins and WarCraft. Suggested
retail price is $19.99.

PowerHouse Entertainment, which recently signed a deal to develop
two of its Moviegame live-action video titles for IBM Multimedia,
is launching its first game based on that same technology,
but with a twist.

At CES, the company will be announcing Collision, an arcade
style game with a live-action video component. However, unlike
some live-action entertainment titles in which movie clips
serve predominantly as a backdrop, Moviegame titles allow users
to interact with video in real time. The technology lets players
navigate through a live-action car demolition video while they
travel through the universe and attempt to destroy Spine, the
enemy leader, and his band of drones.

In order to live long enough to dispose of Spine, players must
use basic driving skills and radar to seek out and smash all
enemy cars while avoiding collisions with deadly opponents.
Along the way, they also must find weapons and equipment that
help them blast into the inner circle to do battle with Spine.

Meanwhile, The Jungle Book, PowerHouse's first title for IBM,
will ship this month. Picking up where the Disney movie left
off, players travel through the jungle and learn the language
of the monkeys in order to find and return the prized crown
of the Monkey King.

A proprietary technology developed by PowerHouse lets users
in these titles move from one video sequence to another without
an interruption in the action. The technology is intended to
let players feel a cause-and-effect relationship between the
action they take and the subsequent video they see on the screen.
The user interface-which can be an icon, a moving hot spot
or any object on the screen-is constantly responding to the
player's actions. For instance, the moving hot spots peppered
throughout the video create instant branching, making the flow
of action unpredictable.

In addition to deals with IBM, Power-House officials said they
are negotiating with several studios to create other Movie
Games for a holiday release this year.

The Learning Company is expected to show four new titles for
kids, including Logic Quest, a 3-D medieval learning adventure
for children ages 8 to 14.

The title develops essential thinking skills, requiring children
to navigate through 12 levels of challenging mazes, puzzles
and construction activities.

The Learning Company said the game provides a realistic 3-D,
first-person perspective of the medieval world as well as animated
3-D construction adventures.

Also showing is the Interactive Math Journey, the first product
in the Math Explorers Series, which will help develop basic
math skills and confidence for kids ages 6 to 9. It combines
exploration activities and traditional skill-building games.

Other titles include the Ultimate Writing and Creative Writing
Center and Reader Rabbit's Reading Development Library 3.

The Writing and Creativity Center is a full-featured word processor
that enables children ages 6 to 10 to create reports, storybooks,
newsletters, journals and signs. The Reader Rabbit Library
is the latest addition to the Learning Company's multilevel
series of interactive books. For kids ages 5 to 8, the titles
include The Princess and the Pea and The Goose That Laid the
Golden Egg.

Pricing for the titles is expected to range from $45 to $99.

Sanctuary Woods will be showing two entertainment titles as
well as a number of edutainment titles.

One of the titles aimed at the entertainment market is Lion,
a wildlife simulation in which players assume the role of a
lion in the African Serengeti. Users can choose to play as
a nomad or control an entire pride, selecting from among 20
lion characters, each with individual strengths and weaknesses.

Orion Burger, first announced at E3 last year, will also be
demonstrated. An outlandish, animated adventure game, Orion
Burger mixes an irreverent, humorous story line-involving alien
representatives scouring the universe for "unintelligent life"
to harvest for their "Orion Burger" chain of intergalactic
fast food joints-with a bizarre cast of characters.

Corbis, a software developer founded by Bill Gates to build
a comprehensive archive of high-quality imagery and multimedia
content, will be demonstrating three titles: Critical Mass
 America's Race to Build the Atomic Bomb; Paul Cezanne: Portrait
of My World; and Volcanoes: Life on the Edge.

A Productive, Though Crowded, 12 Months

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

Like a teenager shaking off the awkward stages of childhood,
entertainment software struggled a step closer to maturity
in 1995.

And, just as children must adjust to the responsibilities of
adulthood, new technology in 1995 helped publishers improve
product quality, the retail channel learned to better manage
shelf space and product ordering, and mass merchandising techniques
and expanded channels brought software into the mainstream.

But these advances are also attracting more players into an
already saturated market, increasing dramatically the number
of products in the channel this year. Retailers are expected
to take mix management and analysis to the next level to counteract
that glut. And publishers, in turn, will be launching expanded
marketing programs and promotions.

While mergers, such as SoftKey's acquisition of the Learning
Company and MECC, or Sierra On-Line's buying binge that most
recently included Papyrus Software, topped the industry's most
talked-about list, many retailers said they expected the shakeout
to be more widespread. As a result, even more titles will be
competing for retail attention this year. More mergers are
guaranteed, as companies either make it in retail or align
themselves with the more powerful group of Master Publishers.
Nowhere will this trend be more evident than in edutainment,
where titles are more brand oriented and where some analysts
believe there is room for only a handful of players.

On a more positive note, perhaps one of the most significant
events this year for PC entertainment software was the launch
of Windows 95. In addition to improving the quality of PC games,
the auto-install feature in Microsoft's new operating system
simplified game loading significantly. Where users once had
to spend hours configuring a game to recognize sound boards
and other multimedia enhancements, the auto-install feature
transformed installation into a simple point and click procedure,
in most cases. Reducing that installation time was a definitive
milestone toward PC plug and play for the home user.

Already, leading developers are showing support for Windows
95. Electronic Arts, Activision and Acclaim, for example, have
announced that game titles this year will be Windows-95-native.

"Between better performance of video and audio, and Plug and
Play, Windows 95 is very appealing," said Eric Johnson, vice
president of marketing at Activision. "Computer [games] were
just kind of limited with Windows 3.1, and with DOS there are
still all these configuration problems. With Windows 95 you
just put the disk in and it boots up. On installation that
means the customer is happy and we have [fewer] technical support
calls."

Also improving the look and feel of games was the emergence
of the Pentium PC as the dominant system last year, as well
as the increased amount of RAM shipped in entry-level systems
and 3-D boards. With the low end becoming a Pentium 75 with
8M bytes of RAM, developers can write more sophisticated programs
that will take full advantage of the Pentium processing might.

Sega, for example, released its first games for the PC last
year but designed the titles specifically for the Pentium processor.
At launch time, Sega said only the power of the Pentium would
allow developers to create a game that would rival play on
its console systems. Its first three titles were Tomcat Alley,
Ecco The Dolphin and Comix Zone, all based on popular Sega
console games already in the market.

Software with 3-D environments topped the PC Data charts as
a host of boards shipped that make playing 3-D games faster
and better. Although the retail market has yet to see a significant
installed base in 3-D boards, publishers expect the boards
to be standard in PCs shipping for Christmas 1996. As such,
most are developing games that will at least perform better
when the card is present.

Enthusiasm for PC games did not put a damper on the next-generation
console platforms that were launched this year by Sony and
Sega. Although Sony has sold twice as many game systems in
the United States than Sega, analysts agree the ultimate test
will be the quality and number of console games available in
the market.

At press time, Sony PlayStation had sold about 500,000 units
in the United States, while Sega, which launched earlier, had
sold about 200,000 units.

The popularity of both platforms and a desire to capitalize
on development dollars will result in increased cross-platform
releases next year. Major developers, such as Sega and Acclaim
Entertainment, have said cross-platform will be a more important
strategic decision this year.

"When you are developing games with million dollar budgets for
a single title...it makes sense to amortize costs," said Domark
chief executive officer Dominic Wheatley.

While gamers were picking through a new breed of software, the
power of the child was recognized in brisk sales of edutainment
titles this past year. Special children's sections sprouted
in retail outlets, such as CompUSA and Computer City, and educational
retailers began to offer a variety of software applications.

Bringing new PC titles to the toy stores and other mass markets
is increasingly becoming the job of a new breed of distributors
that relied on exclusive contracts with retail outlets in order
to provide effective fulfillment and merchandising to those
accounts. This year New Media Express-a joint venture between
publisher Davidson & Associates and Mattel, the giant toy manufacturer
joined Good Times Interactive and Electronic Arts in providing
such services to mass merchants. Together with EA, NMX brought
a healthy mix of edutainment and entertainment software to
the giant Toys R Us chain, but also fueled an industry debate
about the propriety of such deals.

This year as the FTC continues an informal investigation into
some issues surrounding NMX, the controversy over this issue
will likely continue until traditional computer distributors
can offer the kind of fulfillment services and merchandising
needed to fuel entertainment software sales in the mass merchant
channel.

Another company that could play a role is Sega's new distribution
arm, which at press time still did not have an official name.
For retailers that don't have established EDI ordering systems,
Sega has sales teams equipped with special notebooks that can
place EDI orders directly from the retail store. Fulfillment
will be between 38 and 48 hours, said Tom Kalinske, president
of Sega of America.

Along with improving information systems, distributors and retailers
alike will continue a careful analysis of the product mix,
along with more powerful marketing and promotions aimed at
the mass market. With all parties wanting to reduce returns,
publishers and distributors are expected to assist retailers
even more with detailed product analysis.

"There is a ton of product looking for retail shelf space and
a lot of this stuff is undifferentiated from what came before,"
said John Taylor, president of Arcadia Investments. "If [retailers]
don't have strong marketing support, the product is going to
sit there and is not going to move."

Along with assisting each retailer with the appropriate product
mix on a per-store basis, publishers will also begin launching
more intense marketing efforts to help move products off the
shelves. Retailers will see more in-store promotions from publishers
as well as consumer advertising on a national level more commonplace
this year. Cross licensing will play an important role in marketing,
with many products piggybacking on campaigns for high-profile
films and television programs. Other publishers will seek to
license their titles and characters to media organizations
to build product recognition.

As important as the marketing plan this year is the training
of store managers and sales reps, publishers said. Recognizing
that these employees are the gateway to a consumer purchase,
many publishers are pledging to spend more time in the store
with training and promotions for store personnel. Publishers
said they recognize an informed employee will help ensure that
when products do hit the shelves, they won't stay there long
enough to ensure a premature death at retail.

Big Gain in '95 Means Profit in '96 -- Double-digit growth in
PC sales has retailers expecting better margins this year

By:
Roger C. Lanctot

If there is one lesson retailers learned in 1995, it was that
demand was strong enough that established players could begin
to experiment with higher prices. With a 45 percent gain in
retail sales and with overall sales up 38.3 percent, it was
clear to all market participants that computer merchandise
had moved squarely into the mass market.

In spite of the overall positive outlook, though, the final
quarter of the year left a cloud over 1996 prospects. Soft
sales for several computer retailers in November and December
gave pause to many.

The sales gains of 1995 were somewhat more modest than the wild
increases seen in the previous two years, but it was satisfaction
enough for most channel participants to top a terrific year
in 1994. It wasn't easy.

Best Buy took a comp-store sales beating in the first half of
1995, while it avoided taking a down-and-dirty position on
advertised prices. Eventually, the company was forced to take
the gloves off and go toe-to-toe with Circuit City Stores in
the crucial fourth quarter.

Having suffered that battle, though, Best Buy is now in a position
to notch impressive comp-store gains in 1996 without the shadow
of Windows 95 hanging over hardware systems and productivity
software sales. Look for a somewhat less aggressive Best Buy
in '96, and look for other retailers, such as Incredible Universe,
to follow suit.

After failing to achieve profitability in its third year of
operation and showing poor comp-store gains, Incredible Universe
found a new vice president, general manager in Henry Chiarelli.
Currently conducting a chainwide review of operations, Chiarelli
said changes are in store at Incredible Universe, including
a lower profile on price-matching.

"We don't want to be the most expensive guy on the block, but
we won't be the least expensive, either," he said. That is
a change from the division's original lowest-price-in-town
approach.

Computer City SuperCenters, another Tandy division, continues
to hold its ground on pricing, which contributed to negative
comp-store sales comparisons at the end of '95.

By now, it is clear that retailers have figured out how to create
a market in computer products. The challenge in '96 is to start
making money.

Hardware sales were up by 43.7 percent in 1995 vs. 1994, and
accounted for 70.6 percent of all computer-related merchandise
sales. Margins have always been narrow in hardware, but with
several vendors shifting printer and systems offerings into
minimum advertised price programs, and with Compaq cutting
its three-year warranty back, retailers are prepared to start
making money with hardware.

Similarly, in the software category, retailers and suppliers
turned to MAP programs and new captive distribution models.
The past year has demonstrated that demand is strong. Software
sales were up 26 percent in the retail market compared with
1994, with several distribution channels showing huge sales
gains in spite of plummeting prices.

The Big Keep Getting Bigger -- Strong sales in all categories
propel retail computer hardware and software sales above $23
billion

By:
MARIA V. GEORGIANIS

Heading into the fourth quarter last year, computer retailers
expressed cautious optimism about the strength of PC-related
sales. With such high expectations set in 1994, they wondered
if that year's multimedia PC boom would be repeated. What title
would emerge as the Myst of 1995? How far could Windows 95
Pentium PCs drive the market?

By all indications, there was nothing to worry about after all.
In the fourth quarter alone, combined sales from CompUSA, Computer
City SuperCenters, Circuit City Stores, Best Buy and Office
Depot were projected to increase to $3 billion-a 50 percent
jump over last year's period-according to market research firm
International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. These retailers
were anticipated to account for 40 percent of PCs sold through
consumer outlets and 20 percent of PCs sold in the United States.

CRW's list of 1995's Top 100 Computer Retailers found that the
market grew by 38.3 percent, coming off a 50 percent jump in
1994. In addition, the billion-dollar players' club grew to
five, and Best Buy surpassed $2 billion in computer merchandise
sales for the first time.

Micro Center nudged closer to the billion-dollar mark with sales
estimated at $930 million, generated by only 11 stores, while
Egghead Software backed off somewhat, to $890 million.

Micro Center had high- profile openings in Boston and Dallas,
launched its first stand-alone training center and introduced
the latest version of its WinBook private-label notebook, among
the top 10 selling notebooks overall in the United States,
according to IDC.

CRW's tally of the Top 10 computer retailers showed a few surprises,
particularly the substantial gains by the office superstores
all of which made the Top 10. CompUSA once again topped the
list with sales of $3.2 billion. Computer City spent the year
catching up to chief rival CompUSA. Last year, Computer City
entered 11 new markets, increased its promotional activity
with weekly four-color newspaper flyers and launched a direct
mail catalog. Computer City rounded out the year with 88 U.S.
stores, only seven shy of CompUSA's 95 store mark.

Best Buy predicted PC products would account for 38 percent
of fiscal 1996 sales, projected to surpass $7 billion. But
given the category's brutal margins and Best Buy's low-cost
operating model, the retailer said in the future it intended
to rein in the category to between 33 percent and 35 percent
of its sales. A 47 percent gain for Best Buy propelled the
company well above the $2.5 billion mark in computer-related
sales.

Top 10 competitor Circuit City more than doubled its sales of
computer-related merchandise and surprised the industry when
Hewlett-Packard selected it as the first retail chain to roll
out its Pavillion desktops. But with its commission-based model
more reliant on higher gross margins than that of noncommissioned
Best Buy, Circuit City saw fit to restrict the PC category
to the mid-20 percent range of its overall revenue.

Among the office-product superstores, only Office Depot once
again could claim to keep company with the likes of CompUSA
and Best Buy in the upper tier of the Top 10. As the largest
office-superstore operator, Office Depot was expected to post
revenue greater than $5 billion in its fiscal year ended last
December. Its impressive overall computer sales of $1.6 billion
ranked the retailer fourth among the Top 100 for the second
year in a row.

Last year, Office Depot pushed the envelope on its store format
with the debut of 50,000-square-foot mega-stores-double its
typical square footage-in Las Vegas and New York (its first
entry in that market). Historically, Office Depot's space allocation
to PC products has been about 2.5 times that of its competitors
OfficeMax and Staples, corresponding with PC sales 2.5 times
that of its rivals, noted Merrin Information Services, Palo
Alto, Calif.

Computer superstores, consumer electronics chains and office
products superstores are expected to post the greatest growth
rates in computer product revenue over the next three years,
according to Merrin. During that same period, the share of
PC-related sales is projected to decline among the department
stores/mass merchants, software stores and warehouse membership
clubs.

Nevertheless, participants in the latter three categories-Egghead
and Sears-made the Top 10 cut. Sam's did well, with a gain
of about 10 percent, but fell behind CDW Computer Warehouse,
Sears, OfficeMax and Staples. Wal-Mart had a 67 percent gain
in computer merchandise sales, but managed to drop a notch,
to 13th place on the list.

With its focus on productivity software, Egghead was a major
beneficiary of the launch of Windows 95. Although short of
management's expectations, comparable- store sales increased
20 percent following Windows 95's launch. Preliminary results
from Egghead's new retail format-anticipated to make the chain
more competitive with superstores-were also positive. Sales
in the first new-format store, opened in Beaverton, Ore., last
July, increased 61 percent during its second quarter, ended
Sept. 30, over 1994's same period. The 6,600-square- foot-store
was expanded from 2,600 square feet and put Egghead in the
PC hardware category for the first time. It also introduced
a more browser-friendly environment, with computer demo stations
and software merchandised by categories, similar to the merchandising
approach found in a bookstore.

On the downside, Egghead's corporate division, accounting for
about half of the company's overall sales, lost money in its
first two quarters. It was also expected to be unprofitable
in the third. Efforts to turn around the division were adversely
affected by the company's consolidation of its regional call
centers to its new Spokane, Wash., headquarters. Positioned
as an expense reducer, the relocation spoke volumes to the
industry. Its message? Only the nimble, low-cost operators
will survive.

While Egghead continued to close stores in its fiscal first,
second and fourth quarters, the company was expected to end
its current fiscal year with 10 new stores, most of which would
be of the new superstore variety. The company also said it
is moving rapidly to renovate existing stores. An overall sales
increase of 5 percent is expected for the fiscal fourth quarter
ending April 1996, according to a source close to the company.

The outlook for software specialists NeoStar and Electronics
Boutique remained bleak at year's end, although both chains
continue to open new stores both in and outside of malls. NeoStar
was expected to put the brakes on its downturn by year's end.

Media retailers MediaPlay, Virgin Megastore and Hastings continued
to improve in 1995, but greater gains are anticipated for 1996.

Bookstores Barnes & Noble and Borders failed to make the top
100 list in 1995, but '96 looks promising for these retailers
as well. However, vendors reported that Borders was finding
more success with software than Barnes & Noble, and NeoStar's
aggressive store-within-a-store strategy at B&N was not thought
to be finding success.

Toy stores flexed their muscles in '95, giving every indication
that they would be a force to be reckoned with in '96. And
educational toy retailers such as Imaginarium, Learningsmith
and Zany Brainy were seen as the true "sleepers" of 1995.

'Net Result: Hardware Boom -- Sales still grow despite chronic
product shortages and an uphill battle against eroding margins

By:
Gregory Quick

As surfing the 'net to get on the World Wide Web became the
raison d' tre for consumer PC purchases, multimedia was displaced
as the driving force behind soaring PC sales in 1995.

Overall, hardware sales soared at retail, growing 43.7 percent,
to $16.3- billion from $11.4 billion in 1994. The sales increase
includes strong growth across product categories such as memory,
monitors, hard drives, video and audio upgrades, scanners and
printers.

Hardware was the driving force behind most sales gains in '95,
with four retailers surpassing $1 billion in sales. CompUSA,
meanwhile, topped $2 billion in hardware sales.

These retailers succeeded despite vendors placing obstacles
in the path of growth, with select products in short supply
once again this year. Compaq, Apple and AST Research, among
others, were short on some popular products during the year.
And everybody that was still doing business with IBM had to
sit on their hands at one point or another waiting for goods.

Meanwhile, average PC prices declined prior to the Aug. 24 launch
of Windows 95, shot upward by several hundred dollars shortly
after the launch and have recently shown signs of spiraling
downward. But a greater concern for retailers has been declining
margins.

Retailers and their suppliers worked together in 1995 to curb
the margin decline by shifting to MAP programs and exclusive
PC offerings. For example, Power Computing unveiled its Macintosh
clones and signed an exclusive deal with Computer City. The
new year should bring more of the same.

The critical issue for the market leaders in hardware sales
is that systems sales generate traffic, which, in turn, generates
sales in the software, accessories and supplies departments.

The downside of systems sales, though, is that vendors have
bundled so much hardware and software in the systems that some
upgrade opportunities are beginning to evaporate, even as retailers
are putting in the infrastructure to support in-home and in
store upgrades.

Sales Climb and Barriers Fall -- Office and consumer-electronics
superstore sales soar, while mall players struggle

By:
Kathleen Richards

In 1995, total retail software sales increased 26 percent, to
$4.1 billion, from $3.5 billion in 1994, according to CRW estimates.

Retail sales of CD-ROM software doubled in both dollars and
units in 1995, driven in part by a robust holiday season in
1994.

The lower cost of goods, combined with a higher average price
for CD-ROM products, meant CD-ROM publishers enjoyed higher
gross margins and a broader retail channel that now included
mass merchants, bookstores, video and music retailers, and
supermarkets.

At the same time, the old guard-software specialty retailers
and computer superstores-had to rethink merchandising, store
formats and pricing strategies as consumer electronics stores,
office-product superstores and warehouse clubs continued to
capture greater market share.

Egghead, the top software retailer in 1994 according to CRW
estimates, maintained its status this year with $735 million
in software sales, down from $750 million in 1994.

Computer superstores continued their reign on the top 10 software
retailer list, benefitting more than other retailers in the
third quarter from Microsoft's release of the Windows 95 operating
system.

Indeed, these stores augmented their market share to 33 percent
in October, from 24 percent in July, according to Storeboard
Channel Tracking, a research division of Computer Intelligence
InfoCorp., La Jolla, Calif. Still, CRW estimates show the overall
share of retail software sales declining, from 35.4 percent
in 1994 to 33.1 percent in 1995 for computer superstores.

Despite widespread claims that software specialty retailers
continue to lose market share faced with decreasing margins
and increased competition, Egghead, NeoStar Retail Group and
Electronics Boutique maintained their top 10 status. But their
share of sales fell to 28.8 percent from 35.4 percent.

This year, office-product superstores increased software visibility,
picking up more categories and cashing in on greater demand,
driven in part by Windows 95. Office Depot increased total
software sales to $122 million from $71.5 million last year.
OfficeMax and Staples posted substantial gains.

Applauding the Best , Brightest -- Overdue recognition for retail
innovators

By:
Roger C. Lanctot

When some of the largest retailers are recognized as computer
retailing's best and brightest by their suppliers, it may not
come as a surprise. But when Computer Retail Week asked 200
top channel sales executives to vote, we asked them to recognize
performance, not reputation.

The fact that "the usual suspects" captured the lion's share
of the awards should not obscure the fact that 43 different
retailers received at least one vote in one or more of 10 categories.
The retailers cited in this report stand out for their ability
to find new solutions to old problems and to persevere in a
merciless marketplace. The recognition they receive here is
long overdue.

The Most Knowledgeable Sales Professionals -- Those computer
retailers that offer the best training and the best opportunites
for career advancement retain the best sales staff

By:
LINDA KAZARES

There are several components to hiring, developing and retaining
good selling talent. Most important are career track opportunities,
training and compensation.

Career retail sales individuals are committed to retailing.
Their job satisfaction depends on how well they are integrated
into the company and what career path they can expect at the
company. Income is directly tied to performance.

How the retailer perceives and treats sales employees has a
huge impact on performance and retention. If sales personnel
are treated like professionals and offered training, they are
more likely to perform well.

Such is the case at Incredible Universe, where sales employees
can boost their salaries with accumulated training credits.

Micro Center sales associates are expected to present themselves
professionally, including wearing business attire and having
complete knowledge of the products they are selling.

The store sales personnel who perform best have an interest
in keeping themselves abreast of the latest technology, consider
the job their career and know what their contribution is to
their employer's success.

Linda Kazares serves as the president of Ambit International,
a consulting and research firm based in San Francisco.

The Best Merchandising Strategy -- The best in-store merchandising
improves both the shopping experience for the shopper and the
profitability for the retailer

By:
Stephen Baker

Today's best in-store merchandising adds value to the shopping
experience while improving profitability for the retailer.

When more retailers are selling the same products at the same
prices, getting customers into the store is not enough. They
need to be satisfied when they leave and excited about returning.
Merchandising makes all the difference.

If retail is detail, then merchandising is the heart of the
detail. Customers will never notice good merchandising, but
bad merchandising sticks out like a sore thumb. Logical product
categorization makes finding products a breeze, and good adjacencies
remind buyers to purchase everything they need.

Shelf price tags should be correct and product spec sheets accurate,
up-to-date and available. Eye-level end caps should be reserved
for products that sell. Product displays should show the wide
variety of product on hand.

Good merchandising generates repeat business and profitability.
High visibility for high-margin, high-turnover products, and
cross-merchandising that raises the average ring are all profit
enhancers that are good merchandising techniques.

Stephen Baker is a computer industry analyst at International
Data Corp., based in Framingham, Mass.

The Most Effective Store Layout -- A successful store layout
is one that combines good floor planning with elements of education
and entertainment

By:
J'Amy Owens

A successful store layout-one that encourages customer "dwell
time" and ensures sales-combines good floor planning with elements
of education and entertainment.

Customers should be able to shop the store from the door. Best
Buy, for one, combines high-bay racking around the perimeter
of the store and low gondolas in the middle to create an understandable,
easily negotiable environment.

A natural partner to the shop-from-the-door idea is an effective
and compelling circulation path. To get customers to the back
wall, retailers need to create a way for them to get there
and reasons why they should. The winners are retailers that
combine a racetrack or ziggurat configuration with fun, interactive
areas along the way.

Nebraska Furniture Mart's Mega Mart "infocaps" teach customers
about specific products or services. CompUSA's Logitech strike
zones entertain shoppers with lively, interactive displays
set in areas on the floorplate where they're sure to walk.
These are two examples of the many elements of a successful
format. Congratulations to this year's winners. We can all
learn something from you.

J'Amy Owens serves as the president of The Retail Group, a retail
consulting firm located in Redmond, Wash.

The Best Interactive Merchandising -- Savvy computer retailers
recognize the bottom-line impact of a dollar invested in dynamic,
interactive merchandising tools

By:
Jim Alexander

In an industry where more than two-thirds of buying decisions
are made at retail, savvy computer retailers recognize the
bottom-line impact of a dollar invested in dynamic, interactive
merchandising tools that dazzle and capture the attention of
customers.

Frost & Sullivan, a New York-based market research firm, foresees
billions of dollars in sales associated with the use of interactive
advertising technology, or kiosks. Kiosks can supplement and
train a retailer's sales staff, provide direct product fulfillment,
increase customer knowledge and satisfaction, and provide useful
market data. Also, their full-motion video, animation, sound
and touch-screen technology move people to action.

Other popular merchandising tools include custom store videos,
video walls, hands-on multimedia computer displays and information
centers. In 1996, kiosks will become one-stop shopping machines.
The Internet will also play a role educating potential customers
about both retailers and new products, and facilitate interaction
between manufacturers, retailers and the general public.

Jim Alexander serves as the president of Merchandising Solutions,
a marketing and consulting firm based in El Segundo, Calif.

The Best Marketing Program -- Although it's easier said than
done, the best retailers, including the three nominees, know
their clientele and give them what they want

By:
ADAM LEVIN

Good marketing boils down to doing two things really well: Knowing
who your target customer is and knowing what influences his
or her purchases.

More specifically, it is making sure that the marketing campaign
being used by the retailer is designed around the factors that
will make target customers buy from them. It sounds simple;
everyone should be able to do this. Yet, in the retail PC industry,
almost every retailer fails miserably and spends millions of
vendor dollars (and a little bit of their own) in doing so.

The key point is knowing your target customers. Many retailers
are still targeting the majority of their marketing efforts
to the first-time system buyer, yet the majority of systems
sold in the U.S. market today are sold to second-time buyers.
Second-time buyers want to buy high-end, full-featured machines
or want to be able to upgrade and enhance their existing PCs.
They want selection, and they want to buy when they're ready
not when the retailer decides it is a good week to feature
computers. And they want a very good justification to make
the purchase today.

The best retailers, including the three top nominees, recognize
this and market accordingly. Knowing the customers, and giving
them what they want-now that is a marketing philosophy to live
by.

Adam Levin is the president of Levin Consulting, Shaker Heights,
Ohio, and is a regular contributor to Computer Retail Week.

The Best Pricing Strategy -- After years of increasingly brutal
price wars, retailers, particularly computer and consumer electronics
superstores, look to implement higher-margin business models

By:
PHIL MAGNEY

Low-cost, high-volume retailing is the fundamental approach
behind superstore retailing, but this strategy is evolving
into a higher-margin model.

CompUSA no longer regards "lowest prices" as its primary competitive
advantage. By comparison, other retailers that compete with
CompUSA may be as much as 10 percent lower in price on a given
product-sometimes at, or below, cost. CompUSA is now more likely
to charge what the market will bear, at prices that earn 10
percent to 15 percent gross margins.

Micro Center, Computer City and Fry's Electronics are beginning
to represent the high end of retail. Vendors note that Fry's,
in particular, almost always sells products above their minimum
advertised prices. Customers at these stores may be more experienced
and willing to pay more than those at Best Buy or Circuit City
for better selection and service.

Best Buy no longer "low-balls." The retailer starts high (say
12 percent to 16 percent margin) and then works prices down
as conditions warrant. Best Buy may still be the best price
in town, with "7 Percent Over Cost" sales, but these sales
typically last for only a few days.

Despite store-opening blitzes from Micro Center and occasional
clearance sales, today's retail market presents a pricing spectrum
increasingly bent toward the high end.

Phil Magney is president of ARS, a research and consulting firm
based in Dallas.

The Best In Broadcast Advertising -- Stores should drive their
own brand-name awareness and loyalty, while pushing price out
of the driver's seat

By:
PAUL GIGANTE

While bringing customers into your store is the No. 1 objective
of retail advertising, building your store's brand (i.e., your
store's name) is just as important. Ironically, while all retailers
recognize the value of listing the brand names of the merchandise
they sell as well as the weight those names carry in terms
of quality and loyalty, they seldom recognize the value of
their own brand image.

In a price war, those retailers with the strongest brand loyalty
will win every time over those that do little more than publish
price lists. Look at the success of CompUSA, Circuit City Stores
and Office Depot. They've each built their own distinct image
and personality, providing their customers with a reason to
come back time and again to enjoy the shopping experience.

What separates effective retail advertising from typical efforts
is advertising that answers a simple question: Why come into
my store rather than my competitor's? Like any effective advertising,
effective retail advertising creates emotional bonds between
store and customer through a consistent voice.

Retailers cannot drive traffic consistently at the exclusion
of their brand image. Only by building brand image and loyalty
while driving traffic will retailers keep customers coming
back again and again.

Paul Gigante is president and creative director of Gigante Vaz
Advertising, New York.

The Best Print Advertising -- Effective print advertising must
reflect the personality of the company and its customers. It
must be derived from clear objectives, such as building brand
awareness

By:
PETER JANSSEN

Advertising is like the stock market. The "experts" can't agree,
yet everyone has an opinion. But in the simplest of terms,
advertising is good if it works!

Effective print advertising is derived from a clear and crisp
objective, such as driving sales, building brand awareness
or informing the public. Print advertising can be more efficient
than broadcast advertising.

Either way, advertising must include a "call to action." Good
ads reflect the personality of the company and its customers.
But to be effective, advertising plans must achieve critical
mass.

Most retailers jam too much in their ads to appeal to the broadest
customer demographic and capture the greatest amount of supplier
funding. Consequently, it can be difficult to differentiate
one retailer's ad from another.

The personal-computer industry could use more ads that attempt
to inform and educate the consumer.

Based on the available demographic data, we know that we are
speaking to an intelligent consumer who is thirsty for information.
Consumers ask, for example, "How real is the obsolescence factor?"
and "How much memory do I really need?"

Among the best at answering these questions are Best Buy, CompUSA
and Computer City SuperCenters.

Peter Janssen, a computer retailing and manufacturing executive,
is president of Peter Janssen & Associates, Seattle.

The Most Efficient Distribution of Products -- Few are able
to consistently get the right product to the right place at
the right time in the right quantities

By:
Roger C. Lanctot

The great distribution debacles of '93 and '94 (Acer and Dell
at Wal-Mart, Best Buy's out of stocks) are now but a faint
glimmer in the rearview mirror as the retail computer industry
glides into 1996. By this time, retailers have learned that
the computer merchandising model is so tight and the margin
opportunity so narrow that there is little room for error.

Windows 95's arrival sorely tested the distribution acumen of
all channel participants. From coordinating special events
to ratcheting down purchases of systems with Windows 3.1 while
cranking up purchases of PCs loaded with Windows 95, retailers
had their hands full.

That experience taught all retailers that excellent product
distribution involves good forecasting, dependable infrastructure
and systems, reliable personnel and strong vendor relationships.
A little good fortune helps, but successful retailers make
opportunities happen with sound planning and execution.

Still, even the most skilled merchants are always learning,
and no replenishment scheme, however elegant, is beyond improvement.
The new year promises to be yet a new test.

Roger C. Lanctot is CRW's editorial research director.

The Most Effective Sales Training Program -- Those computer
software and hardware retailers that take time to lay a sound
foundation of sales and administrative skills benefit every
day

By:
SEYMOUR MERRIN

Training a retail rep in today's market is a daunting task.
Trying to match numerous SKUs and their complex features and
benefits to a baffling array of customers can be overwhelming.

The first challenge that retailers face is laying a foundation
of product knowledge, customer awareness and store procedures.
Sales associates must know products' gross specifications,
where individual SKUs are shelved, where customers can get
comparative information and what's on sale. These are fundamental
bits of information, without which the sales associate will
fail.

Sales associates must also have some knowledge of general category
characteristics. What do the specs actually mean? How will
the customer perceive the performance of the product?

It's also critical for associates to know the store's sales
and administrative procedures, so that the actual purchasing
process for customers can be as painless as possible.

Once these basics are taught and reinforced, then individual
vendor information may be introduced. Retailers that lay a
sound foundation of sales and administrative skills reap the
benefits every day.

Seymour Merrin is president of Merrin Information Systems, Palo
Alto, Calif., and a frequent contributor to CRW.

Have Screwdriver, Will Moonlight -- Some sales reps offer high
tech house calls

By:
Maria V Georgianis

SAN MATEO, CALIF.-As ever-increasing numbers of consumers buy
their first personal computers, retail sales associates are
joining the ranks of police, plumbers and electricians in an
age-old practice: moonlighting.

Sales associates are parlaying technical expertise into extra
earnings by helping customers get products up and running once
they leave the store.

"I do it all the time," said a Staples sales associate in Southern
California who asked not to be identified. "I only set up the
systems that I sell, so Staples benefits from it. I wait until
I get off work and set a scheduled time for the customer, with
a fee of $20 to $30 per hour."

A consumer might pay about $50 for the same services from an
independent contractor, the sales associate estimated. As long
as it doesn't affect his work in the store, the sales associate
said, his manager approves of his helping Staples customers
at their homes.

The sales associate, who said he doesn't solicit such business
from customers or hand out his business cards in the store,
only offers his services when customers ask if they are available.

"I've been doing it for two years," he said, adding that customers
recognize his particular store as very service-oriented because
of his efforts.

A Staples spokeswoman said the company has not established a
policy regarding house calls.

"We don't officially have anything set to send associates to
homes, but we don't have a policy saying associates shouldn't
do things to help customers outside of Staples," she said.
"Staples is constantly reviewing the marketplace and the services
it offers."

Not all retail management approves of moonlighting by sales
associates, however, and some prohibit it outright.

Any sales associates contemplating moonlighting should be clear
on an employer's stated or unofficial moonlighting policy.

"A lot of my techs won't take [the chance] because of the repercussions,"
said an OfficeMax computer supervisor in a Northern California
store. "Making $20 to $40 [on the side] isn't worth losing
a $300 paycheck."

After establishing that you won't jeopardize your job by moonlighting
for your store's customers, make sure you are technically up
to speed. If you don't do this, you risk damaging a customer's
computer equipment, your employer's reputation and your own
job.

CompTIA, Lombard, Ill., is a not-for-profit professional organization
that developed a personal-computer technical proficiency exam
administered by training and testing centers nationwide.

The ability to pass CompTIA's A+ certification program examination
is widely recognized as a strong measure of comprehensive personal
computer competency.

Whether or not you have A+ certification, be up-front with customers
about your abilities. Explain that services you provide are
on your own time and do not involve your employer. This minimizes
the risk if a problem arises in the course of servicing, upgrading
and setting up a customer's equipment, particularly if the
problem is neither your own fault nor your employer's.

Another piece of advice for would-be moonlighters: Be patient
with customers.

Many beginners are looking for basic training with their computer.
While you may find the process of teaching the basics tedious,
your experience is valuable and can build an ongoing, potentially
lucrative customer relationship.

Providing such personalized customer service on the side "usually
creates more sales for the store," said a manager of a Babbage's
in the Midwest. "There are people who will buy products from
us even if something costs $5 or $10 more [than at a competitor],
because they know someone here can help them with it."

He occasionally offers his services as a consultant to customers
for $20 an hour, although at most, he said, he probably earns
$200 a year from such moonlighting.

Like the Staples sales associate, the Babbage's manager said
he doesn't offer his services unless a customer asks for help.
He believes Babbage's unofficially approves of moonlighting,
within reason.

"We're not allowed to say, 'Buy this hard drive, and I'll install
it for you,' " the manager said. He said he realizes his employer
may be concerned that sales associates would take advantage
of the situation by selling some products and then telling
customers their systems require an upgrade related to that
purchase.

The manager said he ends up helping customers by telephone more
often than making house calls. Babbage's wholeheartedly endorses
this practice, he said.

A spokeswoman for Babbage's said sales associates are not permitted
to make house calls, regardless of whether or not a customer
requests such service.

According to some store managers, employers' concerns regarding
moonlighting center primarily on a store's potential exposure
if a customer is unhappy with the services performed.

"It's not about the money; it's about trying to control the
interaction of the customer and the salesperson," said a manager
at a Doppler Computer store in Seattle. "You can't control
what the employee does once they leave the store. If they do
something that upsets the customer, it reflects poorly on the
[retailer]. The worst-case scenario would be if something was
stolen from a customer's home."

The Doppler manager said the issue came up with an employee
who had his own computer consulting firm and was soliciting
customers for work outside the store. That sales associate
was warned not to solicit customers for his consulting business
from the store floor. Doppler moved to formally prohibit its
sales associates from soliciting outside business in its employee
manual, the manager said.

Among retailers offering in-home support-a service that is becoming
more widely available-sales associates are foolish to risk
competing with their employers.

Sales associates interviewed by CRW said they provide services
not offered by their employers, such as installing hard drives
and extra memory, or teaching users the basics of the Windows
and DOS operating systems.

Because they weren't duplicating services their employers sell,
most felt there was no conflict of interest. Others at retailers
that offer in-home or other technical services said they help
customers for free.

Secret Shopper: CompUSA



Philadelphia, Sat., Dec. 9 , 2p.m.

OBSERVATIONS: At the peak of the holiday selling season, the
Secret Shopper descended on the City of Brotherly Love in search
of joysticks to use with Interplay's hit entertainment title,
Descent.

Joystick sales and product offerings have recently experienced
explosive growth. The Secret Shopper wanted to find out whether
sales associates know which of the new joysticks work best
with Descent, and whether they know their triggers from their
fire buttons overall.

The Secret Shopper entered the store to find it teeming with
customers, mostly families with small children in tow.

The store's signage, both hanging and on shelves, was plentiful.
The Secret Shopper used it to find the aisle where joysticks
were located, toward the middle of the store.

After locating the joysticks, the Secret Shopper took some time
and perused the shelf, since every sales associate in the area
was busy waiting on other customers. It was a full 10 to 15
minutes before a harried sales associate approached offering
help.

The Secret Shopper asked the sales associate which joysticks
work best with Descent. The sales associate responded with
questions of his own. His first questions were designed to
learn about the Shopper's system. He asked about such specifics
as the system's memory and available ports. He also asked which
software titles were on that system, and whether the Secret
Shopper already owned Descent. After establishing that the
Secret Shopper was indeed just looking for a joystick, he got
down to business.

"How much do you want to spend?" he asked. Assured that the
Secret Shopper was an avid gamer and money was no object, he
pointed toward the ThrustMaster MarkII Flight Control System,
explaining that it was very intuitive and ergonomic, and that
it would work with a variety of games.

This didn't surprise the Secret Shopper, since the ThrustMaster
model was the most expensive on the shelf. It carried an $89.99
price tag.

In addition to the ThrustMaster stick, CompUSA carried a wide
variety of joysticks, including several from Microsoft, Logitech
and Advanced Gravis.

After making a recommendation, the sales associate excused himself
to wait on a family of four whose members looked like they
might be interested in something that cost more than a $90
joystick.

The Secret Shopper didn't feel slighted, since the sales associate
had been helpful. As he excused himself, he told the Secret
Shopper to think it over, and offered to answer any other questions.

All told, the sales associate spent about 10 minutes answering
the Secret Shopper's questions-impressive since the store was
overrun with holiday shoppers, several of whom cast Scrooge
like glances at the Secret Shopper for monopolizing the sales
representative's time.

Monitors generally bundled with PCs at this level typically
are 14-inch, .28 dot-pitch models. Audio components typically
include a 16-bit FM-synthesis sound card and 4-to-12-watt-per
channel powered satellite speakers. Built-in MPEG capabilities,
which are designed for scaling full-motion video footage on
screen, are software-based in this class of products.

Configuration:

These systems generally are powered by a 75MHz to 100MHz Pentium
processor, and include a minimum 850M-byte hard drive and

8M bytes of RAM.

Software:

All systems ship with productivity applications, CD-ROM-based
games, edutainment titles, communications software, telephone
answering machine and online packages and a vendor-developed
"front end" for navigating Windows 95.

Mid-range: IBM Aptiva M63

Price:

Typically sells at $2,000 to $2,500

Features:

These products ship with at least a 19,200-bps, and often a
28,800-bps, internal voice/data fax modem incorporating a full
duplex speakerphone and microphone, allowing parties to speak
and be heard by each other simultaneously. Quad-speed CD-ROM
is still standard. Monitors bundled with PCs at this level
typically are either 14-inch or 15-inch .28 dot-pitch models.
Audio components usually include a 16-bit wavetable sound card,
3-D sound synthesis and 10-to-20-watt-per-channel powered satellite
speakers. Some vendors offer hardware-assisted built-in MPEG
capabilities at this level.

Configuration:

These systems typically are powered by a 100MHz to 120MHz Pentium
processor, and generally ship with 8M bytes of RAM and a 1G
byte to 1.2G-byte hard drive.

Software:

Systems at this level ship with the same applications found
in entry-level models. Some add graphics-intensive CD-ROM games
that take advantage of built-in MPEG capabilities, and full
versions of office-suite and desktop video-editing packages.

High-End: Compaq Presario 9564

Price:

Typically sells at more than $2,500

Features:

These products ship with 28,800-bps internal voice/data fax
modems incorporating a full-duplex speakerphone and microphone.
Quad-speed CD-ROM is standard; some vendors offer six-speed
drives. Monitors bundled with PCs at this level typically are
either 15-inch or 17-inch .28 dot-pitch models. Audio components
usually include a 16-bit wavetable sound card, 3-D sound synthesis

with bass modules. Some vendors offer hardware-assisted built
in MPEG capabilities at this level. Most products at this level
are available in minitower designs that provide extra expansion
options.

Configuration:

These systems typically are powered by a 133MHz to 150MHz Pentium
processor, and generally ship with 16M bytes of RAM and a 1.6G
byte to 2G-byte hard drive.

Software:

Again, systems at this level ship with the same applications
found in entry-level models, but add graphics-intensive MPEG
based CD-ROM games and full-fledged office-suite and desktop
video-editing packages.

Qualifiers :

Who will use the system: adults, children or both? Is the customer
a first-time buyer, or a second- or third-round purchaser?
Will the computer be used primarily for basic productivity
chores, such as word processing and home finances? Is the customer
a hard-core gamer or 'net surfer? Is the ability to run desktop
full-motion video or reproduce high-fidelity audio high on
the customer's wish list?

The Pitch:

Entry-level systems are adequate for running basic productivity
applications, such as word processing and home-finance packages.
Midrange systems and their faster modems are better suited
to file downloading on commercial online services or the Internet.
High-end systems deliver heavy-duty graphics performance, audiophile
sound and full-motion, full-screen desktop video capabilities.

Step-Up:

Demonstrating hardware-assisted MPEG capabilities found in some
midrange and high-end systems is a quick way to convince some
customers, especially hard-core gamers and graphics-oriented
users, to step up from entry-level models. Ditto for sound
demonstrations that showcase 3-D and wavetable audio, as well
as wider frequency response, found in midlevel and top-end
systems.

The Close:

Recommend an entry-level system to first-time buyers who are
uncertain which applications they will run on their new computer.
Moderate to hard-core gamers and online aficionados will appreciate
the improved communications and processing performance of a
midrange system. Audiophiles, graphics professionals and desktop
video directors will want nothing less than a high-end system.

CD-ROM to drive changes seen for '96 -- Win95 Likely To Dominate
Platforms At Retail Level

By:
Kathleen Richards

NEW YORK-CD-ROM will likely be the predominant media sold by
computer retailers this year-one of several significant shifts
expected in 1996.

Once strictly viewed as a productivity tool, software has expanded
with the advent of CD-ROM to include content-based titles that
inform as well as aid users. With the popularity of CD-ROM
come numerous questions regarding packaging, shelf space, fixtures
and preview mechanisms for the consumer confronted by thousands
of titles.

By October 1995, CD-ROM titles represented 47 percent of all
software units sold through retail and 40 percent of retail
software dollars- almost double the percentages year-over-year
from 1994, according to market research firm PC Data, Reston,
Va.

Similarly, static applications that provide content that becomes
out of date as soon as the disc is pressed are starting to
evolve into dynamic programs that link to online databases
with up-to-the-minute information.

Meanwhile, Windows 95 is still expected to drive productivity
software sales in 1996 as more business users migrate from
Windows 3.1 to the Windows 95 operating system.

The majority of retail PCs will ship with the 32-bit version
of Windows pre-installed, further increasing the demand for
native Windows 95 applications.

Many companies, however, may bypass Windows 95 and upgrade to
the more powerful next version of the Windows NT operating
system, code-named Cairo, which will offer a Windows 95 shell.
Cairo is expected to reach beta late this year and ship in
1997.

Although Microsoft indicated that it would not release interim
versions of Windows 95, the company will offer service packs
that feature drivers and other upgrades, which are also available
through the company's Web site.

This month, Microsoft is expected to offer the first Windows
95 Service Pack, which will feature client codes for NetWare
4.1, an upgrade to the Internet Explorer browser, infrared
transmission port drivers, ISDN support and updated device
drivers for video and sound cards. The company will not sell
the service packs through retail.

Windows 96, code-named Nashville, is scheduled for release this
year, but has been characterized by the company as a minor
Windows 95 upgrade. This version will focus on Internet integration
throughout the operating system, according to company officials.
Microsoft has not committed to a release date.

The number of Windows 95 applications reaching the channel will
increase exponentially this year as the majority of Windows
titles are developed as native 32-bit Windows applications.

In the first quarter, IBM subsidiary Lotus is slated to release
1-2-3 96 for Windows 95 and Organizer 96 for Windows 95, rounding
out its suite of native Windows 95 applications in SmartSuite
96, which shipped in November.

Graphics powerhouse Adobe plans to ship several native Windows
95 applications in the first quarter, including Adobe Illustrator,
Adobe Persuasion, Adobe Acrobat 2.0 and Adobe Type Manager.

While analysts who predicted a software shift to Windows 95
in 1995 were overly optimistic, this year at retail the 32
bit operating system is likely to become the dominant Windows
platform.

In October 1995, total sales of Windows 95 products represented
15 percent of unit sales and 20 percent of retail software
dollars, according to PC Data. Windows 3.1 still dominated
retail software dollar sales in 1995 for the year-to-date through
October with a 40 percent market share, followed by DOS with
19 percent, Macintosh with 17 percent, Windows 95 with 9 percent,
hybrid products with 6 percent and OS/2 with a 0.61 percent
retail market share.

Nevertheless, IBM is ringing in 1996 with strategic plans for
its OS/2 Warp line of products. Apple Computer is expected
to release a new version of its operating system this year,
code-named Copland, which offers interface enhancements, more
multimedia capabilities and a shell that supports multitasking.

Also this year, the threat of online applications and services
will loom larger.

Microsoft released one online program last fall, CarSource,
that may serve as a model for software to follow. The client
software is free to Microsoft Network subscribers who, in effect,
have the option to download a "form" and then access dynamic
consumer car reports from the Microsoft Network. The primary
benefit is that users have access to the latest information,
such as pricing.

This year, Microsoft plans to release three or more additional
online-only programs, said Marty Taucher, senior group marketing
manager, Microsoft Consumer Division.

The company will also pursue the opportunity to offer extensions
of shrinkwrapped products online. For example, small-business
add-ons or templates could be offered for products such as
Microsoft Works or Microsoft Publisher, said Taucher.

Other publishers are expected to follow Microsoft's lead.

In 1996, accessing the Internet may seem like last year's hot
trend. However, many productivity releases will ship with Internet
browsers and offer free access to publishers' Web sites for
more information on company products and enhancements to existing
software.

Online links may also start to change the traditional upgrade
path. Publishers that have online connections to users' desktops
instantly increase options regarding product promotions, minor
upgrades and information dissemination.

A whirl of mergers and acquisitions changed the face of the
software industry in 1995, and more of the same is expected
in 1996 as larger publishers build extensive product libraries,
often targeting a range of price points and affiliate-label
programs.

This month, the fate of Novell's applications group, namely
WordPerfect and the PerfectOffice suite of applications, may
come to light. Novell has pledged to finalize the sale by the
end of January to coincide with the end of the company's first
fiscal quarter.

Novell's announcement to sell the division last fall has stalled
product cycles, delaying the release of the Windows 95 version
of PerfectOffice, which was originally slated to ship in this
quarter. The uncertain status of Novell's applications group
has also temporarily halted plans to roll out SelectOffice,
an innovative retail program that would allow users to essentially
build their own customized suite by sampling 50 titles on a
CD-ROM and then buying the desired programs. The CD-ROM, which
would offer several free titles, could be purchased for a nominal
fee. Retailers were to receive margins on each title selected,
even if the software was not carried by the storefront.

Another trend last year had leading publishers seeking market
share in the value-priced category, a phenomenon partly driven
by the success of companies such as SoftKey International and
Expert Software. One publisher, however, will not try to sell
titles priced less than $20.

"It may be our mistake, but Microsoft will not actively participate
in the budget category," said Microsoft's Taucher.

Data Stream



SOFTWARE DISPATCH: Productivity software may be hard to locate
this week at CES amid the edutainment and entertainment titles
crowding the show floor. Nevertheless, several publishers will
show productivity titles worth checking out.

Specom Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif., is demonstrating a
$49.50 video-conferencing title called VisionTime Pro. The
software allows small-business users to send video, graphics
and text over standard telephone lines when used with a modem,
a video capture card and a camcorder. VisionTime Pro also supports
ISDN lines. This Windows 3.1 application shows both the remote
video and local video whiteboard onscreen. It supports document
conferencing with simultaneous voice, provided that the user
has a DSVD modem. High-resolution images from TWAIN-compliant
devices such as scanners can be transmitted to the receiver
or saved for later use. In addition, users have the ability
to add drawings or text to video. The company promotes the
software as a video-conferencing solution for notebook users
with a PCMCIA video capture card.

Specom Technologies is developing an Internet version of VisionTime
Pro, scheduled for release in the first quarter of 1996.

Syracuse Language Systems, Syracuse, N.Y., is showing three
titles from the Living Language Multimedia series. Let's Talk
is a four-language vocabulary builder in Spanish, French, German
and Italian that supports speech recognition. This Windows
3.1 CD-ROM has an expected street price of $29.95. Also on
display are two full-language learning titles that the company
shipped in October: Spanish Your Way and French Your Way. Both
titles incorporate speech recognition-the software evaluates
a user's pronunciation-and ship with a microphone plus an audio
cassette that contains conversations. Each title has an $89.95
expected street price.

Not available for viewing at CES-but worth noting-is the latest
3-D effects title from Visual Software, Woodland Hills, Calif.
Instant 3D for Windows 95 lets users enhance Windows 95 documents
or presentations with 3-D text and images. It features hundreds
of 3-D clip-art objects and textures that can be scaled or
edited in a 3-D window. Instant 3D for Windows 95 follows close
on the heels of the company's Simply 3D, a Windows 3.1 title.
The SRP for Instant 3D is $49. The software is bundled with
the Micrografx ABC Graphics Suite.

Year in Review '95 -- Strong Showing For CD-ROM, Internet Apps

By:
KATHLEEN RICHARDS

Retail sales of CD-ROM software doubled in both dollars and
units in 1995, driven in part by a robust holiday season in
1994 during which sales of multimedia PCs soared.

By October, CD-ROMs represented 47 percent of all software units
sold through retail and 40 percent of software dollars, up
from about 20 percent in both units and dollars in the year
ago period, according to research firm PC Data, Reston, Va.

Minimum advertised pricing, long a standard policy for hardware,
became evident in leading software programs in January, as
Novell created a MAP program for its retail applications, set
to begin in April, which would penalize retailers that advertised
products below a minimum set price.

When April arrived, Novell had discontinued its Main Street
line after several merchandising and branding strategies failed
to increase market share, and planned to roll out 15 revamped
titles under the PerfectHome brand. By July, the Consumer Products
Division had been renamed the Personal Access Division, and
the focus was shifted to applications with links to online
services.

In November, Novell announced plans to sell off the applications
group, which included WordPerfect and the PerfectOffice suite
of applications, to a suitable bidder by the end of January
1996, to coincide with the completion of the company's first
fiscal quarter.

Rapid consolidation in 1995 was characterized by a multitude
of acquisitions, notably IBM's hostile takeover bid for Lotus
in June. That same month, Quarterdeck acquired Landmark Research,
and Symantec agreed to buy Delrina in July.

In May, Microsoft terminated its plans to acquire personal-
finance software publisher Intuit, due to ongoing government
investigations that were distracting company principals. Microsoft
Money, the publisher's entry in the personal finance category,
and Intuit's Quicken were again positioned as competitive titles.
The Redmond publisher had intended to sell its laggard personal
finance title to Novell pending the merger; instead, it continued
development on the product, and released Money 4.0 under the
Microsoft Home brand in the fall.

In June, Netscape Communications shrinkwrapped its popular Netscape
Navigator Web browser for off-the-shelf retail sales. The software
was still available free for downloading from the company's
Web site. Netscape Navigator Personal Edition carried a suggested
retail price of $39.95 and offered customers printed documentation,
Eudora e-mail and technical support.

Microsoft discussed a MAP program for the Windows 95 upgrade
SKU in June. The SRP would be $89.95, and the MAP policy would
run through December. The publisher expected between 20,000
to 30,000 retailers and resellers to carry Windows 95, about
a 35 percent increase since the launch of Windows 3.1.

The start of summer had consumer software publishers SoftKey
International and Expert Software each announcing intentions
to offer children's lines of value-priced titles.

At the same time, Apple continued to consolidate its software
divisions, a plan that had begun in April. The company integrated
all software divisions, including AppleSoft, under the jurisdiction
of Apple subsidiary Claris. Guerina Delucca, former head of
the AppleSoft division, was appointed president of Claris in
May.

When Microsoft finally shipped the Windows 95 operating system
on Aug. 24-more than a year after the product's planned ship
date-the launch exceeded the industry's expectations. A decline
in productivity software sales, which had started in late 1994
and continued through August 1995, ceased as publishers started
to release native Windows 95 titles and traffic flooded stores.
However, Microsoft's MAP policy did not maintain adequate margin
for retailers, who had to depend on attach-rate product sales
to recoup software dollars.

Within four days of the Windows 95 launch, Microsoft had sold
1 million units, according to company officials. At retail,
the first week of sales posted $108 million. By the fourth
week, sales had leveled off to $33 million, according to PC
Data research.

And while Microsoft told analysts at its quarterly earnings
conference that the company had sold 7 million units of Windows
95 through OEM and reseller channels in the first five weeks,
several retail buyers were telling suppliers that excess Windows
95 inventory was impinging on open-to-buy dollars. Microsoft
acknowledged a level of unsold inventory at retail, but said
the levels were manageable.

In November, SoftKey Inernational continued its series of acquisitions
by announcing a hostile bid for educational software publisher
The Learning Company, which had accepted a merger proposal
by Broderbund in July, and a bid for Minnesota Educational
Computing Corp. (MECC). SoftKey's next move was to acquire
reference software publisher Compton's NewMedia from the Tribune
Co.

By the start of the holiday selling season, the number of software
SKUs at retail had increased to 13,569 from 10,997 in 1994,
and the Windows 95 platform was significantly impacting retail
software sales. It represented 15 percent of software units
sold and 20 percent of software dollars during October, according
to PC Data.

Business SKUs still dominate



RESTON, VA.-Despite widespread reports that business productivity
software is rapidly losing shelf space to entertainment and
education titles, market researcher PC Data's year-to-date
SKU count in October indicated the category remains dominant
at retail.

Retailers carried 5,549 business software SKUs during the first
10 months of 1995, up from 4,855 in the year-earlier period.
Personal productivity SKUs increased by about 500 to 1,800
from 1,358 in 1994.

The combined number of education and entertainment SKUs closely
matched the business software SKU count. Retailers carried
2,286 education SKUs, an increase from 1,672 in 1994, and 3,283
game SKUs, compared to 2,502 in 1994.

Controversy surrounds concept of $500 device -- PC Vendors Divided
Over Form, Market For Prototype

By:
GREGORY QUICK

SAN MATEO, CALIF.-Heightened discussion about a $500 computing
device has not died down in the aftermath of Comdex/Fall, as
manufacturers jockey for position in a market which, thus far,
doesn't exist.

While many now agree that some sort of device in the price range
will be introduced in early 1996, the features, functionality
and marketplace-and need for the device-are still up in the
air.

At last month's PC Outlook Conference here, the $500 PC was
one of the hot topics of discussion. One panel was dedicated
exclusively to the topic, but the subject kept cropping up
throughout presentations.

The confusion it has created was evident in the contradictory
remarks that came from both supporters and detractors of the
product-sometimes even from within the same company.

Battling back from one side was Apple Computer and Oracle. While
executives from both companies agreed in concept on the $500
device, they were miles apart on specifically what it will
be.

Apple demonstrated its Pippin device, which was launched last
month in Japan. It will hit volume shipments by midyear and
eventually reach the U.S. market, said Michael Spindler, Apple's
president and chief executive.

While Pippin was originally positioned as a game machine, Spindler
demonstrated its ability to access the Internet and its expandability.

He said that it was a mistake to characterize these machines
as "crippled PCs." Instead, he said, they should be thought
of as products with microprocessors aimed at a different market.

Spindler cited a much-used industry figure that only 30 percent
of U.S. homes have PCs. There may be a percentage of those
which do not have a PC and may want a device that allows them
to simply view information, much like they use the TV for now,
he said.

Spindler admitted there was not yet the bandwidth for the expanded
capability companies now associate with such machines, including
interactive games with which millions could conceivably play
at once.

Satjiv Chahil, Apple's vice president and general manager of
new media and entertainment, said the PC marketplace should
not be satisfied with only 30 percent penetration into the
home market. Studies have shown that the huge bulk of home
users are upper- income families, suggesting a broader mass
market is not being reached.

He said that a sector of the market is not "price adverse,"
but rather technology adverse, so that interactive devices
have to be as easy to use as a CD-ROM player.

Oracle, the company that provided fuel to fan the interest of
this market, repeated company chairman Larry Ellison's comments
that not only was it possible to have devices at $500, but
that they would be available in the first quarter of 1996.

The company said that in every other market there is a range
of offerings at different price points, but claimed the PC
market maintains prices that are artificially held at a certain
level.

An Oracle spokesman said a $500 PC is "not an affront to the
PC industry, but an adjunct to it. There is no magic that takes
a $2,500 PC and makes it into a $500 PC.''

However, while Apple and other backers see such units as multifunctional
devices with expansion capabilities, Oracle's course is defined
by a much more limited device incapable of using other media.

Carl Yankowski, Sony Electronics' president and chief operating
officer, opened his comments by noting Sony's pending entry
into the PC marketplace "is not the $500 PC."

He cautioned "not to be swept up in this nonsense," and added
that the $500 PC is not the key to expanding the consumer market.
But he also agreed that there would be a market for such devices.

One of the most active in casting doubt about the viability
of and need for a $500 device was Intel's Avram Miller, vice
president of corporate business development.

"This is like the RISC/CISC debates. It has become polarized,
and the real issues such as ease of use have become overshadowed,"
Miller said.

There have been many attempts at the low end of the personal
computer market that have failed. Among them are pen computing
and PDAs, said Miller.

"Why should a $500 device be easier to use than a PC? I don't
see it," he said, adding, "A lot of things are happening right
now, but they are happening on the PC."

Craig Barrett, Intel's chief operating officer and executive
vice president, echoed Miller's remarks when he said the $1,000
PC has been around, but has not sold well. Users want a host
of interactive capabilities, including the ability to create,
he said.

Barrett said Intel is, "seeing surprisingly strong sales in
the high-dollar-priced personal computers. The $2,000 PC is
the best Internet terminal you can find." He dismissed the
issue as simply a push by the network operating system companies
battling Microsoft.

Supporting the Intel position was Compaq. Robert Stearns, vice
president of technology and corporate development, noted flatly
that "the $500 price point is impossible to refute because
no one has defined it." He doubted that people would give up
their PCs for a device he believed would be extremely slow.

Stearns cited potential problems in getting a device in under
$500, such as difficulty running PC fonts on a television,
the lack of applications or applets, the need for a keyboard
and the need for lots of RAM as well as its high cost.

While the trend is toward increased ease of use, users also
want features. And to get below a set price point, you have
to throw away features, he said.

However, Stearns' boss, Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president
and chief executive, said that "this is the most interesting
direction we will be seeing in the next two years. We see clearly
the paradigm shift" toward the $500 PC.

Pfeiffer acknowledged that a solution of this type could open
the Internet to a much larger population.

"Price elasticity is important to consumers" who want to avoid
costly systems and equipment, he said.

Street Beat: MAP PRICES DO NOT REFLECT TRUE STREET PRICES

By:
Steve Koenig

MAP pricing policies can do much to control the advertised price
points for printers, but MAP prices do not dictate street prices.
In most cases, street prices for printers with MAPs are lower
than the established MAP price. This is not to suggest that
MAP prices do not work. MAP pricing policies work quite well
and are generally responsible for restoring channel margins
for retailers. Hewlett-Packard, Okidata, Epson and Canon have
all gone to MAP pricing recently.

On average, retail street prices on MAP-priced printers are
about 2 percent to 5 percent below the actual MAP price. However,
actual price variations may be much greater than this. For
example, in Dallas the street price of the HP LaserJet 5L recently
dropped to $433 when a price war broke out among retailers
(MAP price on the LaserJet 5L was $479)

Although the MAP price sets a floor for print advertisements,
the MAP price does not restrict what a retailer can sell the
printer for. This also holds true for in-store advertising.
In the case of the HP LaserJet 5L, Micro Center, Dallas, had
an in-store price of $433 on the LaserJet 5L. But the retailer's
print advertisement for the product did not include any price.

Most retailers are generally pleased with MAP pricing because
of the impact on margins. For example, HP sets MAP prices so
that channel margins range from 10 percent to 13 percent depending
on product. Even though actual street prices are a few points
below this range, channel margins are substantially higher
than before implementation of MAP pricing, particularly on
HP's retail printers where margins typically ranged from 0
percent to 4 percent.

Since ARS collects mostly in-store pricing for the Retail Price
Margin Model, the average street prices reflect the true street
price of the products and not the MAP price. Listed above are
the average retail street prices versus the MAP prices for
various printers.

Year In Review '95 -- Communications, low-cost chips were key

By:
GREGORY QUICK

The year 1995 started off with talk on the street focusing on
Intel's recall of Pentium processors, but by the holiday season
12 months later, the hardware market was buzzing about $500
PCs.

Meanwhile, the PC segment of the consumer market took on the
aspect of a revolving door: As Sony announced plans to enter
the market, AT&T exited; and HP entered the market just as
Leading Edge was pulling out.

Desktop computers were still the king of the hill in terms of
PC sales in the retail channel, but the systems users bought
changed over the year.

Several players tried to steal market share from the dedicated
console game machines. IBM and NECT both released systems with
powerful processors aimed directly at the gaming markets.

MPEG compression started to emerge as a standard feature on
desktop systems, both as an integrated hardware and as a software
solution built into the systems.

Apple moved its Power Macintosh technology to retail and jumped
on the PCI bus, allowing add-in card developers to create product
for both platforms.

The chips that powered the systems moved very rapidly last year.
The price point for Pentiums fell faster than expected in October,
a surprising event since Intel's leading competitors were falling
further behind in the industry race.

NexGen and Advanced Micro Devices were forced to merge to stay
competitive; and Cyrix is going direct early this year, although
its high-end Pentium rival 6x86 is currently available.

However, over the course of the year, several of the major players
used processors from both AMD and Cyrix. Among those who took
the plunge were Compaq, Canon, Hewlett-Packard, AST and Epson.

The action was in the Pentium-class processor, with Intel having
phased out most of its production of 486 processors by mid
year. Despite a much-publicized flaw in an earlier version
of the chip, its popularity grew tremendously as the year progressed.

Pentium portables also made a big splash late in the year. Intel
expects the Pentium adoption in the portable market to be faster
than in the desktop arena.

Portables started to gain solid sales in the retail channel
as well as users with one system at home opt for portability
in their second system.

With portables increasing sales share, vendors were focusing
more on providing add-on solutions for them, primarily in the
PCMCIA card market.

PCMCIA cards not only gained attention last year but a new name
as well-now simply PC cards. Besides a variety of storage solutions
that encompass hard-drive, DRAM, SRAM, Flash and wireless solutions,
PC cards are winning popularity as fax modems, LAN adapters
and an increasing host of other functions.

Users have the capabilities now to use a wireless connection
to a LAN in an office to stay in touch with e-mail.

The need to stay in touch, with e-mail, the Internet or an online
bulletin board, helped keep modem sales strong. The technology
rapidly advanced from 14.4K bps to 28.8K bps, and cable modems
capable of moving even faster are on the horizon.

As the year ended, DSVD modems, which can send voice and data
simultaneously, were also rapidly gaining popularity.

ISDN modems, which provide even greater speeds desired by hard
core Internet surfers, are also poised to explode in the next
year, if modem manufacturers have their way.

The year 1995 also ushered in the start of changes in the 3.5
inch floppy drives, a standard on PCs for most of this decade.
Several major Japanese companies started looking at Iomega's
Zip drives, which store as much as 100M bytes in a 3.5-inch
magneto optical format. Power Computing and Micron Electronics
both started including it in systems.

However, Iomega was not alone in the removable mass storage
market. SyQuest introduced rival technology called the SQ3270,
which is also vying for share of mind and market.

Windows 95 helped drive demand for hard-drive upgrades as well
as the sale of DRAM as users upgraded systems to handle the
new operating system.

The market for multimedia upgrades continued to swell. Despite
premature reports of the market's death, the companies involved
have continually upgraded product to provide customers with
offerings not available from PC manufacturers.

Such items as 6x and 8x CD-ROM drives, 3-D stereo, 28.8K-bps
modems and now ISDN offerings first hit as upgrades long before
the rest of the industry caught up.

The market for handheld devices saw some advances last year
but still has not expanded the way analysts and other industry
observers predicted it would several years ago. However, many
of the players in the market did enhance their product offerings.
Last year saw new systems or upgrades of existing ones from
Hewlett-Packard, with its OmniGo 100, Apple's Newton 2.0 specification
and the second-generation MagicLink from Sony.

The peripherals market, meanwhile, has seen rapid technology
transition.

Digital cameras started to reach the price points and feature
sets that made them click with retail consumers. With this
decline in prices has come an increase in competition. Some
long-time players such as Apple have upgraded existing products
and lowered prices in the face of competition from newcomers
such as Epson, Fuji, Ricoh and Minolta.

While CD-ROM drives are spinning faster, they are also holding
more discs, an important feature with the advent of multi-disc
programs and games. Pricing on four-disc changers at the end
of the year roughly paralleled the delta between single-speed
and quad-speed drives when the latter were launched. Many manufacturers
expect these changers to become a standard feature in desktop
systems by mid-1996.

As the speed and capabilities of CD-ROMs have increased, a new
technology saw standardization late last year, and is expected
to challenge the CD-ROM in several markets. Digital Video Disc
(DVD) has become the accepted standard among the giant consumer
electronics and media companies, which were originally headed
in separate directions. The discs, which will have capacities
as large as 14G bytes, should be on shelves by next fall.

Multifunction devices, which combine scanning, printing and
faxing functions, started to gain steam with players like Panasonic,
Hewlett-Packard, Canon and others entering the market. They
still face tough merchandising and consumer-awareness issues,
however.

Computer monitors last year saw an evolution into truly multimedia
stations, as vendors began endowing them with speakers and
microphones, as well as headphone jacks and other functions.

The dedicated game machine market is in the midst of yet another
transition, this time to 64-bit technology. Nintendo of America
previewed its next-generation game machine, the Ultra 64, which
was jointly developed by Nintendo and Silicon Graphics; it
is expected to have a $250 street price.

But the game-system competition was fierce last year: Sega shipped
its Saturn three moths early in select markets while Sony hit
the ground running with its PlayStation, which saw strong sales
in the weeks after its introduction.

The talk at the end of the year was the feasibility of the $500
PC, and whether such a product would truly suit the business
or home markets. Would the machine be a dedicated Internet
cruiser or an expandable system also capable of running spreadsheets
and games?

While the talk was fast and furious from such leaders such as
Apple, Intel, Compaq and Oracle, no company thus far has taken
the concept beyond the discussion stage.

Advanced Gravis ships pair of game controllers

By:
GERGORY QUICK

BURNABY, BRITISH COLUMBIA-Advanced Gravis Computer Technology
has expanded its game controller offerings with a pair of new
products, one destined for the Macintosh market and the other
for Windows users.

The Mac Firebird Programmable Flight and Game Controller for
Macintosh is an advanced controller designed for use with sophisticated
games.

The Mac Firebird has a total of 21 buttons including an eight
directional hat switch that can be adjusted by the user. The
buttons can be used in a variety of ways, including traditional
joy stick mode or to activate single keystroke commands. Buttons
can also be custom programmed.

In addition, the controller has a programmable throttle lever
and a elevator trim control for flight games and comes with
an input slot that supports most popular PC rudder pedals.

The Mac Firebird is compatible with mouse-, keyboard- and joystick
controlled games, and automatically downloads most game settings.

Once a custom setting has been finalized, it can then be printed
out to be used as a reference card when that program is used
again.

The software that comes packaged with the Mac Firebird includes
80 predefined settings for use with most popular games. The
software also allows a user to cut and paste features from
one game program to another. It also allows for individual
features to be drag-and-dropped between different program control
sets, said Grant Russell, Advanced Gravis' chief technology
officer.

Despite the fact that Windows users far outnumber Macintosh
users, Advanced Gravis has seen strong sales for its controllers
in the Mac marketplace.

"The Macintosh has a high penetration into the home. And while
such systems may have been purchased for education purposes,
entertainment quickly becomes one of its primary uses," said
Russell. "We are seeing a lot of game developers writing software
that takes advantage of our controller. We should start seeing
many of those applications very soon."

Still, he acknowledged that since the Macintosh market is significantly
smaller than the Windows market, shelf space is much more limited,
especially in smaller stores. But the company also recently
added Wal-Mart to its retail lineup.

The controller is currently shipping and has a $89.95 retail
price.

For the Windows market the company has an entry-level controller
that does not include the advanced programmable features of
the Mac Firebird.

The Gravis Thunderbird Flight & Game Controller has a four-way
directional hat switch and the same elevator and throttle controls
and four quick-response buttons.

The Gravis Thunderbird is currently shipping and has a $49.95
list price.

Off The Shelf



"The worst December in 30 years," was how one seasoned merchant
described sales in the waning days of 1995.

Harsh weather, maxed-out credit cards and high prices seem to
have collided to keep consumers out of stores, or at least
away from cash registers. And while we are certain there are
chains out there that'll say they've defied the odds, word
of several companies looking at negative comp-store sales the
weekend before Christmas doesn't bode well.

But what's on retailers' minds now is January. Compaq, among
others, is dropping prices to make way for an aggressive, early
shipping product line. Will there be room in the channel for
all these new lines, sporting yet a new round of processors,
if there are stockpiles of the old lines?

Compaq, which is making the most of its CES attendance since
it doesn't attend Comdex, has a host of technology announcements
planned for the show. One item that won't be given the highest
profile is the company's rumored decision to switch to a one
year return-to-depot warranty across its desktop line.

While the spoken logic is that Compaq is appeasing retailers
such as CompUSA who want to sell third-party extended warranties,
the cost savings to Compaq must look phenomenal on paper. Expect
other top-tier vendors to give serious consideration to their
three-year warranty programs.

Packard Bell's decision to rethink its former rejection of minimum
advertised pricing has other makers reconsidering the same.
Packard Bell has flown select retailers to its Sacramento compound
during the past month to talk product and to discuss the prospect
of MAPs on certain sell-through models. Sources said Acer America
also informed key retailers it is considering doing the same
on select models early next year. If it's true, it could reflect
an acceptance of MAPs not only by the vendors, but by retailers
that in the past have strongly objected to MAPs. Best Buy would
be among the more notable of these.

Speaking of Best Buy, word on the street is that the retailer
took Wall Street's advice to trim back its expansion plans
this year. One financial whiz close to the company said to
expect 15 to 20 new Best Buys this year, down from 35 to 40.
In the same boat, apparently, is Incredible Universe, said
to have reduced its planned new stores this year to six from
a former 10; and Computer City, which is now expected to open
20 rather than 30 units in 1996.

While new stores drop, watch prices of color inkjet printers
drop as well. Sources said Lexmark will break ground with the
industry's first $199 color inkjet when it reduces prices on
its model CJ1020C on Jan. 4.

On the personnel front, Fred Brown, the former AT&T retail vice
president, recently took up with MetaTools, the Santa Barbara,
Calif., software company formerly known as HSC Software. Brown
is said to be enjoying a generous AT&T severance package, plenty
of MetaTool stock options and a 10-minute commute to his Santa
Barbara home.

Merchandising: Shelf Life

By:
Max Wurz

Integrated marketing has been a popular concept with marketing
professionals for a long time. However, this has mostly been
the domain of lofty brand-development and advertising types.
With increasing retail competition, it's time to take a new
look at integrated marketing.

It's simple. If retail is at the core of a product's life, retail
should be at the core of a product's integrated marketing.
Sure, the notion remains the same: Put all your eggs in one
focused, highly orchestrated marketing basket. The implementation
is quite different, though.

In the previous version, integrated marketing meant developing
product positioning and slick communications that applied neatly
to consumer advertising. Then, you'd move into "secondary"
efforts such as packaging, channel advertising, retail merchandising
and sales promotion. The primary objective here is building
brand awareness.

My new version, appropriately dubbed Integrated Retail Marketing,
flips this by first asking the question, "What will work best
at retail?" The primary focus here is on building retail sales,
and the critical components are:

Retail packaging. Nothing matters more. Marketing programs come
and go, but your product packaging lives on. Don't skimp.

Public relations. If I only had a dime left after my killer
retail packaging was developed, I would insert it into the
P.R. machine. Look for plugged-in tacticians who can put you
in all the right places.

Promotion and merchandising. Few things turn the sales crank
like retail sales promotion and merchandising. Unlike almost
all other marketing efforts, this combination pulls together
the resources of both sales and marketing to drive stocking
levels, merchandising positions and retailer promotion.

Consumer advertising and direct mail. Do it, but only if you
can afford to do it right. Always integrate it into retail
promotions and merchandising campaigns. And never do it just
because the competition does it.

Interactive marketing. The Web can be a powerful marketing tool.
But don't just settle for a pretty site with product information;
go for the gusto with promotions that will help close the sale.

Bottom line? Integrated marketing works best. Just don't forget
where your sales are.

HIGH-PERFORMANCE TECHNICAL COMPUTING MADE AFFORDABLE

Digital Equipment Corporation has announced new technology --
PCI Memory Channel interconnect -- that enables its highly
scalable AlphaServer systems to deliver new levels of
affordability and price/performance for the technical
computing market. Digital has showcased these new capabilities
in an array of eight AlphaServer 8400 systems with a total of
96 Alpha 64-bit processors running 64-bit Digital UNIX.

Digital makes high performance affordable for compute-
intensive, technical applications such as computational fluid
dynamics, computational chemistry, weather modeling, and
molecular and genetics research. Digital delivers outstanding
price/ performance by taking advantage of standard,
high-volume, low-cost components including a high-speed
interconnect and optimized software. As each processor
delivers 600 MFLOPS, a 96 processor system delivers 57.6
GFLOPS of computing power -- for only $4.5 million.

This combination of affordable price and high performance
enables a wide variety of users to attain performance levels
previously available only with expensive, specialized
supercomputers. Users who would never have been able to afford
supercomputer-class power can now do so with Digital's
systems.

"Digital is making high-performance computing affordable for
more applications than ever before," said Dr. Michael Levine,
scientific director, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. "We're
finding that Digital's approach to connecting AlphaServers is
elegantly simple, and both very powerful and very cost
effective. We can connect AlphaServers of different sizes,
which is important to us because it enables us to match our
systems and applications most efficiently. We're currently
using the system for molecular dynamics, visualization, finite
element and simulated annealing code, and think this
technology prepares us for the future of high-performance
computing."

"Digital's new scalable AlphaServer 8400 array offers a
preview of the next generation in enterprise supercomputing,"
said Gary Smaby, president, Smaby Group, Inc. "By linking
dozens of its blazingly fast Alpha microprocessors through a
robust memory interconnect architecture, Digital has
constructed a mainframe-class computing platform for high-end
technical users tackling applications that benefit from
parallel processing. The system leverages the cost benefits of
commodity componentry to deliver a compelling
price/performance alternative to traditional supercomputers
and MPPs."

Standards-based Commodity Components for Outstanding
Performance and Affordability

Digital delivers these new levels of price/performance by
leveraging commodity hardware and software components. A
standards- based PCI bus Memory Channel interconnect is used
to link multiple AlphaServer systems. This low-latency (less
than 5 microseconds), high-bandwidth (100 Mbytes/sec)
interconnect provides high-speed, memory-to-memory
communications among up to eight AlphaServer 8400 systems,
which allows the multiple systems to operate essentially as a
single system with 57.6 GFLOPS of power. The Memory Channel
interconnect can also link lower-cost AlphaServer 2000
systems for extremely cost-effective high-performance
solutions.

Digital also provides a suite of software tools that allows
technical users to optimize their applications for the new
technology. The software includes:

o Digital UNIX, the industry's only 64-bit UNIX operating
system, which provides greater standards-compliance and higher
performance than any other available UNIX operating system.

o High Performance Fortran (HPF), which allows the arrayed
systems to be programmed as easily as a single system. HPF
automatically optimizes communications among processors for
maximum performance and allows the system to be easily scaled
for a variable number of processors.

o Parallel Software Environment (PSE), which provides the
runtimes for HPF, and performance analysis and debugging tools
for developing parallel applications.

o Digital PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine), an enhanced version
of public domain PVM, which facilitates the creation of
parallel applications.

o MPI (Message Passing Interface), software developed with
Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre, which enables users to
create parallel applications for these systems using an
optimized version of the industry-standard software for
message passing.

Digital's use of these standards-based, off-the-shelf hardware
and software components allow it to deliver systems that are
lower cost, easier to expand and simpler to program than
competitive systems.

"Digital is the leading provider of high-performance UNIX
solutions, as demonstrated by the industry's first
implementation of 64-bit UNIX in 1993, our Very Large Memory
systems last spring, and now the new level of price and
performance of arrayed systems," said Pauline Nist, vice
president, AlphaServer Business Segment, Digital Equipment
Corp. "Through our Technical Solutions Initiative, we have the
high-level expertise to deliver solutions that meet the unique
needs of users in the technical segment. The technology in
these AlphaServer arrays leverages the fastest processors,
the best interconnect, proven, shipping, software and low-cost
commodity components to deliver the best available
high-performance solutions for technical computing."

Digital's Very Large Memory (VLM) technology dramatically
improves application performance by increasing the amount of
information that can be stored in memory. Digital is the only
company delivering high-performance 64-bit servers,
AlphaServer systems, and a 64-bit operating system, Digital
UNIX, which together make VLM64 possible. Whereas 32-bit
systems are limited to 2 Gbytes of memory, AlphaServer 8400
systems can store up to 14 Gbytes of data in memory, for fast
access to large amount of data.

Digital's Technical Solutions Initiative provides customers in
engineering and scientific environments with complete
application solutions.

Through the Technical Solutions Initiative, Digital provides
AlphaStation and AlphaServer customers in mechanical design
and analysis, electronic design and analysis, geographic
information systems, technical CASE and science and research
with industry- leading application performance and
price-performance advantages.

Pricing and Availability

The hardware and software components in the AlphaServer array
will be available in January, 1996. The AlphaServer 8400
array with 96 processors; 4 gigabytes of memory; 32 gigabytes
of disk space; PCI Memory Channel interconnect; Digital UNIX,
HPF, PSE and Digital PVM is priced at $4.5 million. Other

VIDEO CODEC CHIP BRINGS QUALITY VIDEO AUTHORING

Digital Equipment Corporation has announced a powerful, new
video coder/decoder (codec) chip that delivers high-quality,
30-frames-per-second (fps) video compression and decompression
for desktop PCs. The PCI-based 21230 codec chip puts
affordable video authoring and video conferencing on a wide
range of platforms based on Pentium, Alpha, and PowerPC
microprocessors.

Video Compression Essential

Susan Yost, Digital Semiconductor's multimedia marketing
manager, called image compression/decompression "essential" to
reduce the heavy data storage and bandwidth demands of video
applications.

"Video authoring and video conferencing need a video codec
that not only compresses data efficiently, but delivers
high-quality video that accurately represents the original
material. And they need it in real time," she said.

"The 21230 chip is the first video codec to meet this
challenge at an affordable price," Yost continued. "The 21230
video chip implements state-of-the-art compression and
filtering techniques that provide efficient data compression,
exceptional image quality, and realtime performance. In
addition, as a PCI-based, single-chip implementation, it is
designed and priced for the PC market."

According to Peter Hess, manager of OEM development for FAST
Electronic US, Inc., a manufacturer of multimedia products,
"The 21230 chip is capable of encoding video and audio data
from tapes and laser disks into MPEG-1 format in real time for
storage and playback on digital compact disks."

Video Chip, CPU Work Together

Designed as a coprocessor, the 21230 chip takes advantage of
host CPU computing resources while concentrating on codec core
processes to achieve maximal functionality in a cost-effective
package.

The superior image quality of the 21230 video chip reflects
the product's sophisticated filtering, motion estimation, and
scene characterization capabilities, which enable optimal
video compression and decompression for excellent image
sharpness.

The chip interfaces directly to the PCI local bus and features
glueless interfaces to industry-standard NTSC and PAL
decoders, audio digital signal processors (DSPs), optional
peripherals, and external memory, greatly simplifying system
and board design processes.

Supports Video, Audio Standards

For video authoring, the 21230 chip supports MPEG-1
IB(B)P-frame and I-frame standards from constrained bit rates
(1.15 Mb/s) to higher bit rates. For video conferencing
applications, it implements the H.261 video compression
standard for H.320 video conferencing. In addition, the 21230
codec chip is architecturally compatible with the H.263
standard for H.324 POTS video conferencing. The chip also
offers resolution and format flexibility to satisfy customers'
specific needs.

Mikhael Haidar, general manager, Software and Systems
Technology Division at Analog Devices, Inc., said, "We have
worked cooperatively with Digital Semiconductor to provide our
industry- leading family of audio DSPs and codecs to complete
the audio subsystem of the 21230 solution," Haidar said. "This
combination furnishes outstanding multimedia capabilities for
desktop PCs at the lowest cost."

        SMT GOUPIL TAKES CONTROLLING 69% STAKE IN NORMEREL


SMT Goupil SA is bidding to become a dominant force in the
European personal computer market - and meet the challenge of a
Bull SA that has just added Zenith Data Systems to its existing
interests in personal computers. Its latest move is the
acquisition of a controlling 69% stake in Norca SA, the holding
company for ambitious Normerel SA, for about $2.3m. Normerel,
which has spent the past 15 months trying to establish itself in
the US, UK - and Chinese markets, looks for sales of $55m for
1989, and for "satisfactory" profits in 1990. It will become the
OEM arm of SMT - it already supplies Micro Channel machines to
Memorex; SMT also seeks closer ties with Arche Technologies SA,
which has 19% of Norca. Turnover at SMT is running at about
$220m a year.

        OLIVETTI LOOKS TO SHED 500 MANUFACTURING EMPLOYEES


Ing C Olivetti & Co SpA faces labour unrest following the
announcement that it wants to cut the workforce at five plants
in Italy by a total of 500 jobs. The firm says the cuts are
necessary because of rapid price erosion in its product lines.
Olivetti also reports that the 18% rise in sales between May and
July has not been sustained, and that growth for the first 11
months of 1989 was 10.7%; as a result it will not meet its
target of profits matching last year's $275m.

Finding that the hoped-for synergy that would see the numbers
funnelled straight into its spreadsheet programs never
materialised, Lotus Development Corp has thought better of its
diversification into share price delivery systems and agreed to
sell the Signal and QuoTrek services to Financial News Network.
Financial News is 45%-owned by Infotechnology Corp, the New
York-based parent of United Press International and other
electronic publishing ventures. Terms of the sale were not
disclosed, but analysts have valued the business at about $10m.
Lotus's One Source service, which sells electronic libraries of
current, computer-readable data on businesses to professional
investors, is not part of the sale: main users of the services
being sold are small investors.

      ARIX HIT BY COLLAPSE OF OEM UNIX ORDERS FROM UNISYS


That monster OEM contract for multiprocessor Unix machines from
Sperry, continued by successor company Unisys Corp, is turning
into something of a poisoned chalice for Arix Corp. Unisys
accounted for 71% of Arix' $85m business in the year to June
last, but the company now says it has received an order forecast
from Unisys for calendar 1990 that is significantly below
earlier expectations, and account for only 20% of the company's
sales in 1990.Arix is working hard to plug the gap but had not
factored in the accelerated decline in Unisys sales.

       TALKING TACHLIS - 1  YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART THAT
                    MOMMA WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG


Traditionally, a new year begins with solemn resolutions to do
this, become that, or get such and such. In business, the fresh
calendar often coincides with the start of a new budget. Unlike
personal vows, which more likely than not are conceived late on
December 31 and very possibly under the influence, the plans of
an organisation may take as long to formulate as they do to
execute. This does not necessarily make the promises of business
any easier to fulfill. One important measure of a person or
organisation is its resolve. Another, often more telling
characteristic is perseverance when things go awry. There are
many reasons why coping skills fail in the face of the
unexpected. And for every good reason there are a million
excuses. If there is one prominent cause of an individual or
organisation going into crisis in the wake of ordinary
frustration and disappointment, it is self-delusion. For the
most part, kidding one's self doesn't begin with a conscious
effort. Rather, it starts with a garden variety error in
judgement and grows from there. It thrives in the fertile soil
of hubris.

                             Wannabees

It blossoms every time one fails to admit events have taken an
unforeseen turn or that the conditions that exist differ from
those one wished for or anticipated. Eventually, though, it's
time to 'fess up. When hopes, plans and dreams cannot be
realised, only a fresh beginning will do. This requires the
sincere performance of an act that is easy enough before one is
in trouble but damned difficult once problems have grown to
menacing size. That act is called, in Yiddish, talking tachlis.
Talking tachlis means looking at the bottom line, getting down
to basics. While known to the Maccabees - a sensible if overly
goal-directed tribe of years past - talking tachlis seems to be
a lost art among the crowd running things today, the Wannabees.
In corporate life, an avowal of failure is all too often a
career-limiting gesture. Ambition si, admission no.

                           By Hesh Wiener

Post-industrial society has reached a truly appalling state.
It's no longer what you do that counts. It's how you look doing
it. The inevitable result is a world in which positions of
inestimable power are occupied by idiots with great aplomb. Now
please don't get us wrong. We like nice guys as much as the next
person. We want to see them get ahead. But we just can't
persuade ourselves that fooling people is the right thing, even
if it's done in a pleasant manner. Or even when the dissembler
has persuaded himself that he is in fact telling the truth as he
sees it at the time. Listening to a charming, articulate
horsefeathers artist just makes us want to say, loudly and
impertinently, "Hey, cut that out!" This new year, 1990, is
destined for the Guinness Book. A record number of people will
be forced by circumstances not beyond their control to talk
tachlis. Chief among them in our estimation will be IBM's
executives, who will be joined in this sober-minded exercise by
some of their best customers. The process will be quite amusing,
for it will not only involve getting down to brass tacks
collectively, but individually, too. The cold, hard facts are
different for each IBM product line, and for each customer's
situation as well. It would be unfair of us to say that the
3090-J is not a new machine, except for the facts. It's a recast
3090-S, which is a recast 3090-E. And if IBM adds some more
window dressing in the form of a feature or two, that will
hardly make it a different system. It's not necessarily bad that
IBM is selling mainframe customers yet another 3090. The bottom
line - whether the user should move to a J - may have little to
do with a new generation or another set of model designations.
Customers want more bang for the buck, however they can get it.
If the 3090-J offers it, that's good enough. But wait a minute.
Hold the phone. IBM has got to be working on a long-overdue next
generation of large systems. These machines will sock it to the
values of earlier mainframes. So how could anyone be relaxed
about investing in today's IBM iron?

                             Byzantine

What the customer wants is not only lower cost per MIPS, but
also lower cost per transaction. If the user moves to a faster
machine and MVS/ESA, and then finds that the system software
eats more computing power than the new hardware brings to the
table, where's the advantage? Is it really wise for IBM to prove
to the customer that pain is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for gain? If customers want to stay with the Byzantine
systems they're used to, we're sympathetic. But when computers
can no longer give user companies enough extra productivity to
cover their direct costs - let alone help offset inefficiencies
elsewhere in an enterprise - our heart also
goes out to the other people affected. These victims of the
mainframe include user's general managers and the shareholders
at whose sufferance they serve. C'mon, folks. You're all in this
together. How about an end to the conspiracy of silence that
makes every interested party - vendor, user, financing company -
look worse every day? Maybe IBM should acquire Tandem. Maybe we
should all be patient and in a couple of years get Tandem to
acquire IBM. Actually, we'll settle for IBM stealing all
Tandem's good ideas as fast as it can. This leads us to New
Year's Talking Tachlis Prediction Numbers One to Five - but they
will have to wait for another issue.

   PICK AND POQUET ARE SURVIVERS AS INFLUENZA BUG EATS INTO
                      FUJITSU's UK SEMINARS


Fujitsu UK Ltd was joined by companies from various areas of the
compor $2.5m. The only other European sales base is in Spain where
Fujitsu Espana sells a modified version of the r distributes
only through third party resellers that have one or more
vertical market packages. So far, there are approximately 200
installations in the UK with sales averaging at
10 machines a month. In the future Fujitsu intends to launch new
products to increase the expandability of the line, and has
recently added SNA support.

                     Poquet touts the smallest

Bob Senior of Poquet Computer Ltd, in which Fujitsu has a 38%
stake, the rest being owned by management and staff, presented
the overview on portable computers. Poquet claims that its first
product is the smallest fully functional, fully-compatible
MS-DOS portable available. Poquet found that 40% of personal
computer users in the corporate market are always on the move
and that 30% of these would seriously consider buying a portable
personal computer. The Poquet PC is compatible with MS-DOS 3.3,
weighs just 1 lb, and measures 8.75" by 4.3" wide and 0.9"
thick; the two standard AA batteries are claimed to last for 100
hours of continuous use. There is a QWERTY keyboard and 80
character by 25 line screen. It is built around an 80C88 with
512Kb of system RAM and 640Kb of ROM with two slots for 500Kb
RAM or ROM memory cards. These cost around #50 and for the ROM
card version of Lotus 1-2-3 the price is #445. The cards are 68
pin Jieda format and Poquet along with Dupont, Microsoft, Lotus
and others, hopes this will become a standard in the near
future. There is an RS-232 port and input-output expansion bus
compatible with the XT bus, and the Poquet can be linked to a
desktop MS-DOS machine with 5.25" or 3.5" floppy to up- and
down-load files; remote access to files is also possible. A
serial cable will be supplied. Built-in applications include a
diary, calculator, address book and text processing, and
PoquetTalk communications can be used with a modem. The first UK
deliveries are expected in the first quarter of next year and it
will be sold through third parties. Manufacturing capacity at
present is 10,000 Poquets a year, and turnover of $100m is
forecast for 1990. The UK price is #1,300, it will have a one-
year warranty and a 30-day product exchange guarantee. The
seminars on Magnetic Storage Systems and System Backup and
Security were flu'd off, but Greg Carlow of ESS Systems Ltd
commented that the Japanese have vertical recording, which
enables as much as 10Gb to 20Gb to be stored on a 5.25" disk,
ready for release but believes that there is no market demand at
the present time - Japanese manufacturers are still uncomfortable
about pioneering high-end computer technologies before they have
been blessed by US manufacturers.

            AT&T UNIX SOFTWARE SALE TALKS PROGRESS
                  BUT HOW SHOULD IT BE VALUED?


Discussions over the fate of AT&T Co's Unix Software Operation,
which now looks likely to be sold off to companies interested in
acquiring a stake - thus marking the end of the Unix
International-Open Software Foundation conflict that has
dominated the industry this past year - appear to have reached
the point where the main outstanding issue is just how much the
business is actually worth. The problem is that no-one knows how
to assess its value. AT&T has let it be known that it has not
made a profit out of its Unix software activities, and royalty
revenues are currently low, at now more than about $50m
annually. Computer Systems News argues that, comparing the
Operation with companies such as Adobe Systems or Microsoft
Corp, it would have a market value of around $200m, despite its
lack of profits. The true worth of the Operation however, would
be more sensibly valued by its stategic importance to the
interested companies, which apparently include both
Hewlett-Packard Co and DEC. That strategic value would
presumably increase following a cessation of hostilities between
Unix International and the Foundation.

Megatek Corp, San Diego, California, which takes Sun
Microsystems workstations OEM and revamps their graphics
capabilities, has a new X Window development environment for the
Sun-3 and Sun-4 supporting Open Look, and the XView toolkit. The
X-ccerator VME board uses a Texas Instruments 34020 graphics

Sun-3's Motorola 60303 or Sun-4's Sparc CPU. This enables
graphics functions to be significantly speeded up while reducing
the load on the CPU. Each board comes with up to 7Mb memory - to
which an extra 4Mb can be added - and supports an additional
keyboard and mouse on the workstation. Multiple X-ccelerator
boards can be configured in a single system, and the price is
#4,000 each. Megatek, which has UK offices in Basingstoke,
Hampshire, offers a range of enhanced graphics systems, including
the recently introduced Sigma 70, IGW 200 and Megatek 944.

      ALCATEL LOOKS LIKELY TO WIN NATIONAL TELECOM AT 50%
                   DISCOUNT TO FLOTATION PRICE


Less than 18 months after its flotation in July 1988, the board
of National Telecommunications Plc has announced that it will be
unanimously recommending shareholders to accept a cash offer
made by Alcatel Business Systems Ltd that values the company at
around #20.4m. Through brokers S G Warburg & Co, Alcatel is
offering 60 pence for each of the ordinary shares in National
Telecom, representing a premium of 22% over the market closing
price of 49 pence on December 21. Alcatel has already received
irrevocable committments to accept the offer from shareholders
accounting for 26.5% of National Telecom Ordinary shares.
National Telecom, which saw pre-tax losses of #1.6m on sales of
#22.4m for the six months ended September 30, started its ascent
to prominence in 1983 as a company with the uninspiring name of
Small Systems Engineering, operating out of a garage in North
London. The quality and competitiveness of the office telephone
exchanges that still, in more sophisticated forms, make up the
hub of National Telecom's business, were enough to tempt Peter
Chamberlain out of British Telecom to head the company, and
after changing the name to the more impressive-sounding National
Telephone Group, he managed to convince John Nash of the venture
capitalists Advent to back the product - Nash had previously
visited the company in 1982 but was put off by the lack of
management skills. With a #1m cash injection and a government
committed to telecommunications liberalisation, things happened
swiftly in the next five years, with subcontraction of
manufacturing to the then Thorn Ericsson, the move to new
offices in London's Docklands, and diversification by acquiring
Ansaphone and by offering complete turnkey packages for
telephone system installation, servicing and maintenance; by
this time, turnover had risen to #19.5m for the year ending
March 31 1988, with pre-tax profits of #2.9m. The hugely
successful flotation in July 1988, which was 17 times
overscribed at a share price of 120 pence, valued the company at
#29.7m and was followed by acquisitions in the UK and the US,
with National Telecom paying #7m for cellular telephone and
airtime supplier Tactico, #3.3m for Solid State Systems, an
Atlanta, Georgia-based designer and marketer of digital PABXs,
and #2.3m for the distributor TVC General Telephones.

                       Lack of accountability

But by May of this year, it became clear that significant
problems had arisen in the key private telephone exchange
distribution business, with lack of accountability at
middle-management level and deviation from group strategy being
cited as reasons for a disappointing net profit of #2.2m for the
year ended March 31 1989, against market expectations of well
over #4m. Since then, those profits have turned into losses, and
even talks with prospective buyers have not run smoothly, with
National Telecom at one point considering a U-turn from its
original plan and going it alone. All this meant that with last
week's bid, Alcatel will be buying at exactly half their 120
pence price at the flotation, and well down on the 153 pence it
hit just over a year ago. For its part, Alcatel sees the
acquisition as providing a UK outlet in the business
communications equipment market using National Telecom's
existing distribution channels; National Telecom has already
stated its desire to be part of a larger group in order to
achieve "its ambitious growth plans" - among which could be the
setting up and running of its own network, an objective hinted
at by Chamberlain in happier days. - Mark John

        ALPHAMERIC CALLS IN THE OCTAGON COMPANY DOCTORS
                     TO ADVISE ON ITS FUTURE


Keyboards, viewdata terminals and data broadcasting company
Alphameric Plc has decided that it needs outside help to get its
business back onto an even keel, and has called in Octagon
Industries Ltd, the Drs Robb Wilmot-Geoff Bristow vehicle backed
by Close Brothers and Octagon Group Ltd, which is already busy
transforming the former Compsoft Plc, now Headland Group, into a
business well-nigh unrecognisable to its founders. Octagon is
conducting a strategic commercial review of all Alphameric's
activities, getting paid #30,000 in cash for the effort, which
should be complete by the end of the month, plus a 3.9% stake in
Alphameric in the form of 880,000 new shares. While the Octagon
team is looking over the business, Alphameric continues its
efforts to find a joint venture partner for its Data Broadcast
and Display Division. The shares, which plunged 25 pence to 34p
after it announced a first half loss of #2.5m (CI No 1,321), are
suspending judgement and currently change hands at 29p.

          CABLE & WIRELESS IN TALKS TO CUT HONG KONG
                    TELECOMMUNICATIONS STAKE


Cable & Wireless Plc has decided to reduce its exposure to the
Hong Kong economy and is negotiating to sell a stake of between
10% and 20% in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd, in which it
currently holds 75%. The talks are with China International
Trust & Investment Corp Hong Kong Holdings Ltd, an investment
vehicle of the Chinese government. Cable & Wireless says that
the talks are at a preliminary stage, and that it definitely
intends to maintain a majority in and management control of the
Hong Kong phone company. If a deal is sealed, the price is
likely to be the average market price of Hong Kong Telecom
during November. At the November average price, 10% would bring
Cables #350m, 20%, #700m. The news was good for a 40 pence-plus
two-day rise in the Cables share price just before Christmas.

        TOTAL SYSTEMS FINDS THE GOING TOUGH AS COMPUTER
                 SERVICES CUSTOMERS CUT BUDGETS


Placed at 85 pence a share in March 1988 (CI No 896), Total
Systems Plc has not had a very happy time as a public company so
far, and the shares are down at around the 22 pence mark - and
the interims announced just before Christmas, showing pre-tax
profit down 22% at just #40,000, are not going to do anything to
revitalise the price. The company, which does about half its
business from custom software, and also does facilities
management and consultancy, ackowledges difficult trading
conditions, as a result of customers cutting budgets. In an
effort to alleviate the impact, Total Systems has been trying to
broaden its customer base, in particular wooing local
authorities, and reports more work for new clients than in any
comparable period. It reckons that it is now in a strong
position to benefit when purse strings are loosened again, and
stresses that the cash resources remain satisfactory and that
net asset value, which includes the freehold of the London EC
headquarters - the company also has a Bristol office - is
strong.

    IBM's HAND-HOLDING SERVICE FOR PERSONAL COMPUTER USERS
                     OUTRAGES ITS US DEALERS


IBM and DEC have an uncanny knack of biting the reseller hands
that feed them with monotonous regularity, and having upset its
AS/400 resellers, IBM has done it again in the US with its new
End User Support programme for personal computer users (CI No
1,326). IBM UK's porte parole on the subject was not available
to say whether there are any plans to introduce the service in
the UK, but in the US, it offers - for what sounds a steep $30 a
month per machine - users of large numbers of personal computers
- which can include Macintoshes and Compaqs or whatever as well
as PS/2s - a high level of handholding that extends to the
generality of third party software as well as the hardware. But
that price - clearly pitched at what IBM thinks the market will
bear, and which must be about what others are charging,
indicates the size of the potential business, and how important
it must be to the companies that currently offer such services.
And those companies are the very ones that IBM should be wanting
to keep sweet as spring water - the dealers that sell its
personal computers. It is already clear that with the rampant
discounting going on in dealer channels (CI No 1,328), there is
going to be a bloodbath in the US computer high street and
no-one is going to be making any money out of hardware, so IBM's
move is seen by dealers already feeling the pain as taking the
very bread out of their mouths by entering the one business
where they can make money, in particular with their precious
large accounts, the very people at which the new IBM service is
primarily aimed. Accor ding to the Wall Street Journal, IBM has
tried to  calm dealers' fears by saying that the new programme
targets only a narrow segment of the personal com puter market -
but it is the very segment of the market that those dealers
that have survived the previous shakeouts have successfully
tapped; and IBM has  had to concede that the new programme may
cost deal ers some business. IBM sells about 80% of its pers
onal computers to dealers in the US and increased its  unit
share of the market to an estimated 35% in the  first 11 months
of 1989 from 31% in 1988, according  to Audits & Surveys Co -
not least because it has  been wooing dealers with attractive
incentives and  offers of training. "This is putting us back
almost  where we were two years ago," Matt Fitzsimmons, a
ComputerLand Corp dealer in White Plains, New York  told the
Journal. "It's really disheartening to be  in competition with a
manufacturer whose product we  sell." But the net effect is
likely to drive dealers  into the arms of other manufacturers,
led by Compaq.

            C E HEATH's DATASURE PICKS UP RIGHTS TO
                  ADVISA PACKAGE FROM RECEIVERS


Advisa Services, in administrative receivership since November,
has sold the rights to Advisa, its financial sales and support
package, to Datasure Ltd, the computer systems arm of C E Heath.
Advisa Services, formerly known as Professional Networks Ltd,
was established in 1986 to develop an expert system-based
financial software package that runs on IBM-compatible personal
computers and laptops (CI No 1,146). Advisa was jointly owned by
the Moorgate Group and Moorgate Computer Systems, but it
experienced financial difficulties and was subsequently
re-financed in 1988 by Moorgate and several other institutions
including Murray Johnstone. However, a combination of high
research and development investment, loan stock, debt related
finance, and rising interest rates continued to make the going
difficult, and the company went into receivership in November.
Deloitte Haskyns & Sells was appointed as receiver, and sold the
rights to the software for an undisclosed sum, despite the
possibility of a management buyout. Advisa is to be operated as
a division of Datasure, and David Lewis, formerly managing
director of Advisa, will continue to head the division. He says
that the company was previously under-funded, and Heath's
acquisition of the rights should put that right.

               PEEK TO BUY GIFT FOR HUSKY IN FLORIDA


Peek Plc has reached a conditional agreement to pay $2.5m for
Clearwater, Florida-based software house Porta-printer Systems
Inc, a portable data selection system supplier with a turnover
of around $6m. The acquisition, to be finalised on January 12,
will see Porta-printer acting as a US outlet for Husky Computer
Group, the heavy-duty hand-held computer manufacturer bought by
Peek some two years ago: accordingly, Porta-printer's president,
Bill Newall, will be staying on to report to Andy Faulkner,
managing director of Husky. Meanwhile, Peek has simultaneously
announced the disposal of two non-core businesses: fibre optic
connector division Automatic Connector Inc has been sold for
$1.4m, and probes and test leads distributor Test Probes Inc is
to be conditionally sold for a performance-related sum of
between $2m and 2.5m; both were originally acquired with
Dubilier International in June 1988. All three moves, says Peek,
are in line with its stated intention to concentrate its efforts
on technology aimed at traffic and navigation,
database management, and measurement and control.

TECHNO-THEFT IS COSTING MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS MILLIONS

A dozen well-dressed men walk calmly into the front lobby of a
large corporation. Noting the visitors, corporate attire,
employees figure these are legitimate businessmen on their way
to a company meeting. They couldn't be more wrong. Surprising
everyone, the suit and tie executives suddenly pull out
automatic weapons and order employees to lie on the floor. In
a few terrifying minutes, they pillage the company's
computers, remove valuable memory chips and flee with
components having an estimated value of $5 to $12 million!

This latest chapter in an ongoing story of international
intrigue is not a scene from a James Bond movie. California
and is merely a small part of the disturbing trend of rising
computer theft and other "Techno-Crime."

In California's Silicon Valley alone, it is estimated that $1
million in components are lost to Techno-Thievery each week.
Worldwide, overall costs to electronics and insurance firms
are approaching a staggering $8 billion a year and are
expected to soar to $200 billion by the year 2000, according
to the Technology Theft Prevention Foundation in Clinton, New
Jersey.

The Foundation was started by insurance companies who, after
paying out millions in computer theft claims, wanted to
develop ways to curtail the rising Techno-Crime Wave.

According to FBI and other law enforcement agencies who are
working with the Foundation, Techno-Crime can come in many
forms that may or may not be considered thievery. But as far
as theft is concerned, although everything from motherboards
to modems and disk drives are targeted by Techno-Thieves, CPUs
(Central Processing Units) and SIMs (Single In-Line Memory
Modules) represent the crown jewels of computer theft.

"Basically, these parts are non-traceable, said Keith Lowry,
sergeant for the San Jose Police Department. "They are very
liquid just like gold, and the market for resale is fantastic
because there aren't enough products to go around;

It's big business and it's opportunistic," Lowry noted.
Manufacturers and consumers alike are being short changed
because Techno-Crime is having a substantial effect on the
quality of available memory products on both the wholesale and
retail markets.

Although electronic and computer buyers believe they are
getting a good deal, they are frequently getting ripped- off.
And the Techno-Crime Crime itself is sometimes not an obvious
one, such as that mentioned in the beginning of this story;
often the crime is difficult to identify and the price paid
can't be quantified--but consumers are paying the price. For
example, consumers are often attracted to flashy packaging,
which shows a product in its best light. Upon closer
inspection, however, the product within may not live up to the
advance billing given on the box. It is not uncommon for the
module inside not to have been manufactured or assembled by
the company shown. It is important that the consumer knows who
the real manufacturer of the product is and that it is a
reputable company--one that is respected throughout the
industry, no t just at the store on the corner.

"Everybody and their brother is slapping together cheap little
memory products," explained Jim Wong, president of Micro
Solutions, Inc., in Corvallis, Ore., designer of systems for
highly demanding users with specialized applications. "You
have to be very careful about who you buy from and what you
buy." cautioned Wong. "I've heard horror stories from people
who haven't been, but are now our customers because they can
constantly rely upon the quality we provide," Wong said.

With SIMMs comprising up to 50% of a computer system's cost,
and providing much of the computing power, the quality of
memory has become paramount, which has been a boon to
manufacturers putting emphasis on quality.

One such firm is Century Microelectronics, Inc., in Santa
Clara, California. Century, an industry leader in the
manufacture of computer memory, has implemented extra measures
to ensure its memory modules maintain the highest quality
standards.

One way Century does this is by dealing directly with only the
largest, most reputable DRAM manufacturers who have strict
internal controls. Century then adds its own quality
protective measures. For example, each assembled module bears
the Century name to insure strict accountability. The consumer
can clearly identify that the module has been assembled by
Century and not another third party manufacturer with lower
standards. Unless the circuit board manufacturer puts their
name on the board as Century does, there is virtually no way
to trace the product back to the manufacturer when troubles
arise.

Companies like Century use the highest quality components not
just in the DRAM, but in the design and manufacture of the PC
board as well. This philosophy has so far served companies
like Century well in the marketplace where wholesalers,
retailers and consumers have voiced concern over the affect of
Techno-Crime on overall product quality. "A big part of my
business is the ability to give my customers the reliability
that they are getting a first rate part," said Gary Barlow,
owner of RAMTECH in Boulder, Colo., the computer memory
supplier to a majority of users in that area.

"Most of the time price is not the issue as long as you're
reasonable," Barlow explained citing his reason for relying on
Century as his prime memory supplier. "I've been in this
business a long time and I believe Century has the highest
quality parts available," he said. Micro Solutions' Wong who
often utilizes Century products because of their inherent
reliability, agreed with Barlow on stressing quality. "We're
just a small company so what's really important is who our
clients are and the type of machines that we configure," Wong
explained. "We have some pretty major clients like Hewlett
Packard who buy our memory products for insertion into their
own machines so quality is very important to us."

To less scrupulous suppliers, however, price, not quality, is
the primary motivator. Because of competition from makers of
cheap "clone" systems, keeping costs down has become paramount
to both supplier and manufacturer. In this market climate,
even well known original equipment manufacturers (OEMS)
sometimes offer to buy back old memory chips as credit towards
new memory purchases. These suppliers then reuse the memory,
which, since it is used, has a shorter life cycle.

While this might not appear to be an obvious Techno-Crime to
the consumer, such as armed theft or the like, it is, in fact
Techno-Crime in its worst form because while the monetary cost
is just as severe, the crime itself is all but impossible to
detect.

Another factor in the link is when OEMs put pressure on chip
suppliers to step-up production so that increasing market
demand can be met. To please their OEM customers, memory
brokers with limited resources are often tempted to purchase
substandard parts in the "gray market" because they are being
offered a deal that is too good to pass up.

Of particular concern to manufacturers is that substandard
parts within the gray market have often failed to test to
"grade All specification and instead of ending up as scrap or
in a lower performance non-computer application as intended,
the y often end up in machines where they are not up to the
task.

A chip that shows a 60 nanosecond (60ns) rating, for instance,
could really only be able to perform up to a 70ns level.
Pressed for time, unscrupulous suppliers can't be bothered
with checking for quality so substandard memory batches are
either mixed with those having passed inspection, or are
simply remarked with the higher rating that OEMs require.

To remark a product, third party manufacturers will actually
sand the identifying marks off of chips, remark them so that
they appear to be higher performance chips than they actually
are, and resell them to unsuspecting buyers. The
manufacturers, then, end up installing the lower quality
components in their machines because many trust their memory
distributors to bench test the chips. But unfortunately, many
distributors in need of quick revenue unload the components
without testing them. Installed in machines they weren't
intended for, these parts fail immediately, or after a few
months of use.

And while a substandard chip may only cause a computerized toy
to go haywire, it could just as well put a glitch into the
navigational system of a commercial airliner or cause a
surgical device to malfunction, putting patients at risk. Even
if only a small percentage of available computer chips are
faulty, but are resold as acceptable, the implications are
frightening.

Because popular new software programs require more memory than
ever to operate efficiently, technology market analysts say
the demand for memory modules is likely to remain higher than
the supply. Manufacturers will probably continue to experience
periodic chip shortages which will drive up the value of
memory modules, and drive more OEMs into the gray market.
Consumers should understand that they can easily fall victim
to Techno-Thievery without realizing it because Techno-Crimes
are not always obvious. Unless buyers take extra precautions
to ensure the quality of the product they are buying, they run
the risk of purchasing substandard components that could not
be able to perform up to advertised specifications, or could
fail altogether causing disastrous results.

In light of all this, consumer awareness is increasing and the
demand for superior computer components from the highest
quality manufacturers is expected to be greater than ever.

RISC processor -- the PowerPC 604 -- with the versatility of
on-board PMC and the ability to match boards to specific
application and cost needs.

Redstone's new boards are offered in four levels of
environmental durability from air-cooled standard to
conduction-cooled rugged. This provides markets ranging from
industrial to telecommunications to military with the ability
to select the level that best meets the performance,
reliability and budget criteria of the application. The boards
are available in versions for temperatures from -40 degrees C
to +75 degrees C (specials from -55 degrees C to +85 degrees
C), certified to military vibration specifications.

According to Radstone president Pete Yeatman, "The PPC604 is
the first in a new line of boards that truly break new ground
in the VME world. It not only surpasses the performance,
functionality and reliability of previous processors, but
does so with a significant decrease in cost. These new boards
meet the very demanding needs of computer OEM markets that
have changed fundamentally in the last few years. By offering
these boards in a range of air- and conduction-cooled
versions, Radstone is allowing the markets we serve to get
extraordinary levels of performance and meet tougher budget
constraints - including those of the COTS military market,
which now has next generation product available for immediate
development."

Key features of Radstone's PPC604 series include the PowerPC
604 chip, operating to 100 MHz; high speed direct PCI attached
VME64 interface (>70 Mbytes/sec.), and extensive on-board
memory including up to 64 Mbytes of DRAM with EDC for
sophisticated memory protection, plus L2 cache for increased
performance and 1 Mbyte of system FLASH.

Other features include the ability to add function-boosting
mezzanine modules for graphics, FDDI, Fast Ethernet, ATM and
more, extensive operating system support (including LynxOS,
VxWorks and others) plus a wide range of available
shrink-wrapped applications software, and standard on-board
Ethernet, SCSI-2 and serial I/O.

Pricing for an air-cooled PPC604 starts at $4,675. Delivery
is 30 days A.R.O.

Bay Networks sees big Asian opportunity

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Alma J. Buelva
CW PHILIPPINES SECTION EDITOR

BALI, Indonesia, Oct. 31 -- Asia appears to be a good test ground
for the new market-oriented business model of Bay Networks, Inc.,
which covers precisely the areas where the major networking
activities in the region are happening.

Top executives of Bay took turns briefing Asian journalists
gathered here early this month on how the company's new Enterprise
Business Unit (EBU), Internet/Telecom and Remote Access Business
Unit (ITBU), and Commercial Business Unit (CBU) are positioned to
lead in these areas. In brief, it's a strategy that focuses on the
price and performance points of Bay's products and the company's
global distribution and customer service programs.

In the Philippines, however, Bay's business will still largely be
carried out by its four resellers: Anixter, Alcatel, Computer N/W,
and Trends and Technologies.

A plan to set up a Philippine office has not materialized, Bay
officials said, because they have not yet found a country manager.

BUSINESS UNITS

Although the bulk of Bay's business continues to come from the
enterprise area, company officials believe the highest growth rate
will take place in its Internet unit, especially in the next 12
months.

"Companies are now starting to build networks that will
accommodate their telecommunications and Internet requirements by
being linked to the backbone of the enterprise networks," said
Gary A. Rogers, Bay's vice president for international sales. "We
did our homework and saw that from this year to 1999 the service
provider market has a growth potential of over 300%."

The EBU is still expected to have the most number of people,
products and sales. Some of its product offerings and customers,
however, are likely to overlap with that of the ITBU. For example,
telecommunication companies which traditionally fall under the
enterprise group, are also now among the customers that ITBU will
be aiming to get.

Intranet requirements of big corporations, however, will be
addressed by EBU, not the ITBU. In fact, according to Bruce Sachs,
executive vice president and general manager of ITBU, about 80% of
the products to be sold by his unit will be developed by the EBU's
research and development team because of the product overlap.

The CBU, on the other hand, which focuses on the SOHO (small
office, home office) market, is in an area which Bay officials
said has a potential growth of 160% over the next three years.
Again, the Internet is seen fueling this growth, with more home
offices hooking up to the Net.

PRODUCTS

Bay officials believe next year's worldwide market for access,
routing, shared media and switching products will grow 50%. In
Asia, they said, the growth will be even sharper, adding that the
market already grew over 100% last year. To date, the global
networking market is estimated to be worth $15.36 billion, and
could rise to $32 billion in 1999.

This year, sales of Bay's switching products, according to Rogers,
have already caught up with its routers and are continuing to
grow. High demand for the company's remote access line is also
expected, given the Internet explosion.

SUPPORT

Bay also realigned its worldwide customer service operation in
line with its new market-focus structure. Lloyd Carney, vice
president of Bay's worldwide customer service said there are
basically three kinds of services: for large resellers with full
infrastructure, for those who need logistic support, and for
consultants with no support infrastructure.

Lloyd expects the service requirements of the CBU to be the
easiest to handle because this segment pushes more low-end
products. On the other hand, he expects both the EBU and the ITBU
to have demanding service requirements because their clientele are
those which have millions at stake when their networks go down.

Bay's global customer service support recently achieved one of its
goals when it was awarded an ISO 9001 certification. Carney
admitted they still have to beat Cisco in the support area, but
also said Cisco gets high ratings because the products it
supported in the past were not that complex.

"Bay's been supporting the heart of the network, and we have a
three- to four-year lead time dealing with complex networks," said
Carney.

In Asia, Bay has support and training centers in Hong Kong, Tokyo,
Singapore, and Sydney.

Meanwhile, Lloyd said Bay also encourages its channel partners
worldwide to be part of the customer support business program.

Cable Television can be backbone for digital services

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Melba-Jean M. Valdez
CW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- Cable television can be a backbone in a
metropolitan area for a new set of digital services such as
Internet access, telephony, video conferencing, and wireless
networks. This means that via just one cable running into a house,
a family can avail of a range of network services.

During the recently concluded COMDDAP '96 exhibit and convention,
Robbie Villabona, technical operations manager at Sky Internet
said that Sky Cable already has the technology to deliver Internet
to homes over cable. "However, one of our concerns is that we are
not allowed by law to sell this service," he said.

Villabona said a possible set-up is that Sky Cable may lease out
bandwidth to franchise holders such as Globe Telecom and BayanTel
or value-added network providers. Apart from this obstacle,
Villabona also pointed to other important issues that still need
to be addressed worldwide. At present, for instance, there is no
standard for data transmission over cable television, he said.
Interoperability is also a problem, since a manufacturer's cable
modem may not be able to communicate with another manufacturer's
cable modem. Modulation and transmission techniques also need to
be addressed by manufacturers, Villabona said. Another issue is
the quality of service. Villabona noted that it isn't possible,
for instance, to commit bandwidth over cable. On the bright side,
Villabona said, a consortium of cable companies in the US called
CabeLab is now defining standards, such as an interface between a
cable modem and a PC.

"A lot of activity is going on between vendors and cable
television operators to deliver digital services to the home,"
said Villabona.

A major benefit of using cable for the Internet, he said, is
speed.

"One of the common complaints by Internet subscribers today is the
speed by which they can access a Web site," said Villabona. He
said that with cable, downloading 1MB file from the Internet using
a cable modem at a burst of 4Mbps would only take two seconds.
Another advantage is that cable can be split when it gets into a
home, making it possible to connect a TV to television
programming, and a PC and modem to the Internet. Villabona said.

Philippines: Gov't awarded NCR a project worth P108M

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Melba-Jean M. Valdez
CW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- The government has awarded the National Crime
Information System (NCIS) project, a computer-based network system
that aims to modernize the country's judicial process, to NCR
Philippines, Inc.

NCR, which bid P108 million (about $4.1 million), bested three
other IT vendors for the project, and will set up a client-server
based system with four multiprocessing servers, 99 departmental
servers, and hundreds of Pentium-based workstations, all connected
on a Windows NT network.

The NCIS was established through Executive Order No. 386, which
provides for mechanisms necessary to develop a computer-based
system involving the five pillars of the Philippine Criminal
Justice System (PCJS).

Colonel Tirso L. Rosal, head of the Philippine National Police
(PNP) computer center and vice-chairman of the NCIS technical
committee, said the five-phase project has an approved budget of
P108 million for phase one alone.

"NCR was selected based on the technical and financial proposals
they submitted," said Rosal.

EVALUATION

The bidding process formally started in January this year upon the
publication of an invitation to prequalify and to bid.

Commissioner Alexis Canonizado of the National Police Commission
(Napolcom) and chairman of the NCIS prequalification, bids and
awards committee for information technology resources (PBAC-ITR)
said 38 vendors expressed interest in the project, but only 24
actually submitted prequalification documents.

After screening the documents, the number of qualified proponents
was reduced to 10. Canonizado said that upon requests from the
proponents, the submission of the bid proposals (technical and
financial), originally set for May 27, was rescheduled to July 29.
Canonizado said only four of the 10 qualified proponents were able
to submit their proposals within the deadline set by the PBAC-ITR.

"Prior to this, and due to the controversies generated by the
Topweb scam, the NCIS project and bidding process was presented to
the Padolina commission tasked to review and investigate the
bidding rules and procedures followed in large-scale information
technology projects such as the NCIS, pursuant to Section 3.1 of
Executive Order No. 341," said Canonizado.

Canonizado further said that on Sept. 10, members of the technical
evaluation subcommittee (TES) started the technical evaluation of
those complying with the minimum requirements set by the PBAC-ITR.

He said the evaluation results showed that Prime Systems Plus,
Inc. (PSPI) and NCR garnered weighted scores of 49.49 and 54.65,
respectively. He said the sealed financial proposals of both
vendors were opened on Sept. 20.

On Oct. 4, the TES submitted the results of the integrated
technical and financial evaluation to the PBAC-ITR. The results
showed PSPI and NCR garnering weighted scores of 40.00 and 39.97,
respectively.

"Combining the technical and financial scores to come up with the
integrated score, NCR, with 94.62% was adjudged the winner over
PSPI, with an integrated score of 89.49%," said Canonizado.

FIVE PILLARS

The PCJS is composed of the various organizational units within
each of the following five pillars:

1. Law enforcement: the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI),
Napolcom, and the Philippine National Police (PNP)

2. Prosecution: the National Prosecution Service (NAPROS), the
Ombudsman, and the Tanodbayan

3. Adjudication: the Supreme Court of the Philippines (SCP), the
Court of Appeals (CA), regional trial courts, and the municipal or
metropolitan trial courts, and the Sandiganbayan

4. Rehabilitation: the Bureau of Correction, Bureau of Jail
Management and Penology, the Parole and Probation Administration
(PPA), and the Bureau of Pardons and Parole

5. Community: the Department of Social Welfare and Development
(DSWD), and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG)
All the units will eventually be linked to each other, with the
Napolcom acting as system administrator.

CLIENT-SERVER SYSTEM

The NCIS will be an intranet type of wide-area network running
under a client-server environment.

Red Torres, account manager for government accounts at NCR said
they chose Magic Rapid Application Development (RAD) system as the
tool to develop the NCIS application. The NCIS system will also
consist of Windows NT as the network operating system and
Microsoft SQL Server as the database management system.

Torres said hardware will include four NCR S40 multiprocessing
servers and 99 NCR S10 servers, which will be deployed among the
various organizational units of the five pillars.

Three hundred NCR 3349 Pentium-based workstations will also be
distributed among the units.

Cora Pinoy, general manager of Magic Software Philippines, Inc.,
said the National Crime Reporting System (NCRS) will basically
allow law enforcers to capture incident reports at police station
level through a graphical-user interface (GUI) application.

The system will also allow the police to make online inquiries on
criminals, vehicles, firearms and more.

Pinoy said the system will also be capable of generating incident
statistics in text or graphical format.

Fingerprinting and a geographical information system (GIS) will
also be incorporated in the system in later phases.

Another feature of the NCIS is the Weblink, a facility that will
enable the five pillars of the criminal justice system to exchange
and share crime information via an intranet.

"Any agency needing information can send its query to the web
server and the web server will decide which organization's
database to retrieve the data from," said Pinoy. Pinoy said each
organization's database will be updated in real time to provide
up-to-date information for better decision-making.

The NCIS is a five-phase project that has an indefinite time
period. Development of a database system and implementation of a
pilot network within Metro Manila is expected to be achieved in
the first phase. Phase two involves nationwide connectivity.

System upgrades and enhancements will be done in the remaining
phases.

Philippines: NEDA chief supports massive IT build-up

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Melba-Jean M. Valdez
CW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- To gain economic tiger status, the government
and private sector needs to allot bigger budgets to acquire and
implement information technology (IT) resources in the coming
years. Speaking during the Internet World '96 earlier this month,
Secretary of Socioeconomic Planning and Director-General at the
National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Cielito F.
Habito said the Philippines was ranked number two in computer
usage among Asian countries in the 1970s. "[The country's
leadership] slipped away due to missteps in economic policy
management, which led to a prolonged economic slump," Habito said.

Habito, who is also the co-chairman of the National Information
Technology Council (NITC), said that while there are over 150
information technology (IT) training centers in the country today,
IT development still remains inadequate. He said the country's
computer-to-person ratio is at 1:50 compared to the ratio in other
ASEAN countries which stands at 1:10.

This state of affairs he attributed to the government's low budget
allocation for IT. For instance, he said, in 1988, government
spending on IT represented only .42% of the national budget. In
1991, this inched up to .63%.

Past administrations, Habito added, had not fully appreciated the
benefits that can be derived from using IT.

Despite all this, Habito said, the improved economic environment
in the 1990s brought about a wider use of IT, particularly in view
of decreased computer costs. The government as well as educational
institutions have increased their acquisition and use of
computers, Habito added.

Unlike previous administrations, Habito said, the Ramos government
is implementing vital policies and programs that will help propel
IT development in the country.

He also noted that the deregulation of the telecommunications
industry is of strategic importance to the information
superhighway.

POLICY REFORMS

In an interview with `Computerworld Philippines,' Habito said the
NITC is looking into mechanisms to achieve interoperability among
government agencies -- which includes review and improvement of IT
policies such as the National Information Technology Plan (NITP)
2000.

"The IT sector is moving very rapidly. So similarly we have to be
able to adjust the plan," he said. "We have to reexamine the
specific components of the overall government computerization
programs."

Habito couldn't pinpoint which components of the NITP need
refinement. "I can't really be specific at this point, but among
other things we have to look into is the compatibility of the
various systems being put in place."

He said that while it is necessary to link agencies, there may be
some problems later in trying to interconnect all of them.

"In the end, what we really want is to have a government that is
getting the full benefits of IT," Habito said.

Habito told Computerworld the NITC is working closely with the
private sector and the Government Organization for Information
Technology (GO-IT) to achieve interoperability among the agencies.
"Of course, there is a lot of technology involved. It is more of
coordination and enhancement to make sure that all the systems can
talk to each other," he said.

Netscape confident about browser standing

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Reynard I. Juanir
CW PHILIPPINES STAFF WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- NETSCAPE Communications Corp. is still very
confident of keeping its lead in the browser arena despite the
growing popularity of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.

At a press conference organized by Netscape's local distributor,
Client Server Technologies Inc., Netscape regional manager for
ASEAN/South Asia region Casey Ong said that the company's market
share for browsers is still between 70% and 80%. "I don't have
the exact figures, but we're still the leader when it comes to the
browser market."

Ong expressed his doubts over Microsoft's strategy of integrating
the browser into future versions of the Windows 95 client
operating system. "I think this is a very marginal comparison,"
said Ong. "Even if you have better integration with the desktop,
the question is, is the integration with other servers and other
machines better?"

Netscape has for a long time positioned itself in the area of
providing applications and tools for both Internet and intranets.
Ong said the only way for the Internet to go beyond the levels of
use today is through the network computer, not the PC. "If you
think about it," said Ong, "the cost of PCs is still very high...
its not so personal as a `personal computer'. It's not so far-
off in the future that the whole thing about Windows is going to
be irrelevant."

He said the market in Asia is much more suitable to Network
Computers than in the Western countries. "I think in Asia,
Network Computer has an even stronger proposition. We're not like
the US, where the use of PCs has got a much stronger
background....so probably this is even more timely and better for
the Asian users." Ong said he sees the Philippines as more than a
market, but as a source for IT talent. He declined to be more
specific, however, about his company's plans for tapping this
talent.

Netscape's failure to be at the "Browser Brawl" opposite Microsoft
at Internet World Philippines produced some fairly negative
reactions against Netscape, but Ong said it's simply a matter of
scheduling problems.

Philippines: Laissez-faire policy fuels internet growth

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Melba-Jean M. Valdez
CW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- Private investments and the government's
laissez-faire approach have produced one of the region's most
vibrant markets for Internet services.

This was the assessment offered by Jim Ayson, president of W3
Business Communications, Inc., an Internet presence provider that
designs and maintains Web sites for a number of corporate clients.

Speaking at last month's Internet World, Ayson said the non-
intervention of government has created the freest Internet
environment in Asia. Unlike Singapore, China, and Vietnam, he
said, there is no Internet regulation in the Philippines.

On the other hand, Ayson said, the heavy competition means
Internet service providers need to be more aggressive to get a
share of the business. Already, he noted, ISPs have turned to
advertising and promotions aimed at a growing consumer market for
their services.

Also as a result of competition, Ayson said, he expects exciting
new Internet services to come from big players such as Infocom,
which is partly owned by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co.

Ayson added that small Internet service providers might have to
evolve into niche players and serve specific players to survive.

Ayson said the increased popularity of the World Wide Web and
other Internet applications have also increased the demand for
bandwidth. Thus, ISPs are planning to expand their existing
bandwidth. Links provided today by ISPs range from 64Kbps to T1
and E1.

Another exciting area is the prospect of cable companies offering
Internet access through cable modems. Ayson said that a cable
company called TimeNet, a joint venture between Nortel and the
Lopez group of companies, has announced plans to launch an
experimental project in Naga City, which will consist of 100 beta
test users.

PHONE LINES

On the negative side, Ayson said the market could grow even more
if more telephone lines were available and if interconnection
among ISPs and telecommunication companies were not a problem.

"The biggest obstacle to the growth of the Internet in the
Philippines is the poor telephone infrastructure," said Ayson.
"You obviously can't get to the 'Net if you can't get a dial-
tone."

Ayson said that ISPs have complained that PLDT can't provide
enough lines and have turned to new telecommunication companies
such as Bayantel and Globe. "But the new telecommunication
companies are in turn hampered by interconnection problems with
PLDT," Ayson said.

Another issue is the slow access to local Web sites due to the
lack of interconnection among ISPs. He said that all inbound
traffic must still be routed to the US first, before bouncing back
into the country.

"There is an ongoing project by PLDT with the help of some PISO
(Philippine Internet Service Organization) members to develop a
local network access so that Philippine traffic remains inbound,"
said Ayson.

In his talk, Ayson also traced the birth of the Internet in the
Philippines to 10:18 a.m. on March 29, 1994, when PhilNet, an
academic and research network funded by the Department of Science
and Technology, connected to the Internet through a 64Kbps leased
line to the US.

However, Ayson said, even before this hook-up, several electronic
bulletin boards had already provided an interface to the Internet.
He said that in 1991 an E-mail gateway to the Internet was
established.

Shortly after the PhilNet hookup, the first commercial Internet
service provider, Mosaic Communications, entered the market.
"Initially, PHnet and Moscom operated in grey legal area because
of a perceived need of franchising," said Ayson.

However, the Public Telecom Act passed in 1995 stipulated that
network companies could operate without a congressional franchise,
thereby starting a gold rush. "The effect of RA 7925 was the
commercial Internet area became fair game," said Ayson. Ayson said
that in June 1995, ISPs started pouring in. A series of commercial
online service providers also entered the market and evolved into
ISPs later.

Today, the number of Internet service providers in the country
stands at about 68. Ayson said that there is no formal market
study on the number of Internet users today, but informed
estimates range from 30,000 to 45,000 users.

Ayson said the players in the Internet industry can be classified
as one or more of the following: Internet service providers; E-
mail only providers; ISP networks that don't sell directly to the
end-user but to ISPs; cybercafes; Internet presence providers; and
educational institutions that provide accounts to the public.

Philips sees 15" monitors moving to mainstream

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Wong, Chin Wah
CW PHILIPPINES EDITOR

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- Eyestrain may no longer be a common problem as
larger screens and better resolution make it to mainstream
computer monitors. This was the view of an official from Philips,
one of the world's largest manufacturers of PC monitors.

"The trend is toward bigger monitors, and the move from 14" to 15"
is very clear," said Louis van Uden, regional marketing manager
for monitors at Philips Business Electronics.

Van Uden said, the 17-inch segment of the market is also growing
rapidly.

Speaking at a recent international convention for Philips PC
resellers in Cebu, Van Uden said multimedia and windowing
applications are driving the monitor market towards bigger format
screens. Fourteen-inch monitors, which accounted for more than
50% of the market in 1995, will represent only a quarter of all
monitors sold by the year 2000, Van Uden predicted. In the same
period, 15-inch monitors, which accounted for about 30% in 1995,
will become the dominant screen size. At the same time, he said,
available resolutions will become higher, as will screen refresh
rates.

Other trends, he sees are:

* The adoption of PC manufacturers of the Universal Serial Bus;
* The increasing use of software-based monitor controls; and
* The increasing acceptance of environmental measures to allow
recycling and lower energy consumption.

Philippine 3Com office expanding

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Alma J. Buelva
CW PHILIPPINES SECTION EDITOR

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- 3COM Philippines is in expansion mode this
quarter. As the latest office of the networking giant in the
region, it's now out to recruit more personnel and at least 20
resellers in the next two months to boost its market coverage.

"We need more hands and legs on the ground," said Gil G. Edeza,
3Com Philippines country manager. "We're in the market for
additional staff and resellers to carry our products."

Adding energy to the office's full-swing operation is the
nomination, for the first time in 3Com's history, of two
Philippine-based companies as beta sites for 3Com's upcoming token
ring and Ethernet switches. Edeza declined to give the names of
the companies.

"We already have the products in the country. It's just a matter
of delivering them to the beta sites. It would depend on our
customers how long they will perform the tests. 3Com wants to try
the products in various parts of the world," said Edeza.

But unlike Bay and Cisco, 3Com has not come up with a division to
focus solely on the Internet and the requirements of service
providers. However, Edeza said they have plans to start a
Philippine program that involves financing packages especially
designed for for start-up ISPs who may not have the resources to
buy routing and networking equipment outright. He said the program
would allow the ISPs to grow their operations and become viable
before paying for their equipment.

In addition, 3Com Philippines is expected to move to a new office
soon.

NEW PRODUCT

3Com also released this month its third generation of stackable
Ethernet hubs packed with features to handle network segmentation,
management and redundancy.

Wei-Ping Ong, 3Com's South Asia channel development manager, said
the SuperStack II is the industry's most advanced stackable
Ethernet hub for workgroups of all sizes.

The new product introduces a number of technology innovations
previously unavailable in a stackable system, such as port
switching, fully integrated graphics-based network management, hot
swappability and uninterrupted power supply.

The new SuperStack II is available in 12-port and 24-port variants
and 10 hubs that can be stacked together in any combination, said
Ong. All hubs have slots for two transceiver interface modules,
which can provide a variety of different backbone connections.

Philippines: Bills seek to establish better IT environment

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Wong, Chin Wah
CW PHILIPPINES EDITOR

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- Congress is considering a bill to establish an
IT Academy that will update government executives and personnel on
the latest trends in IT, and help them use technology more
effectively in their offices.

The bill, said Congressman Leandro Verceles Jr. of Catanduanes, is
part of a package of measures aimed at creating an IT environment
where computers will be more widely used as critical development
tools.

Speaking at the opening of the COMDDAP Expo '96 earlier this
month, Verceles also said the House of Representatives is looking
at a bill that will set aside 1% of the gross national product for
research and development. It would funnel about P17 billion
annually into R&D projects, making such efforts a cornerstone of
economic development.

Another measure also being considered would establish a computer
center in all state colleges nationwide. All these, Verceles said,
are bills of first impression that will contribute to building an
IT environment.

In his opening remarks, Verceles also gave importance to the
Telecommunications Act of 1995, which paved the way for the
deregulation of value-added network services such as Internet
access. He also reiterated his support for a central exchange that
will link all local Internet service providers (see CW, Aug. 31,
1996).

These developments, he said, run parallel to the government's
service area scheme, where telecommunication firms are required to
set up land lines in their respective service areas.

"As the telecom facilities are put into place, you will see the
emergence of a market for more IT services [in areas outside Metro
Manila]," Verceles said.

He noted, for instance, that his home province of Catanduanes will
soon be connected to the Internet via a 64K connection, with local
government offices getting free access.

"This shows that the Internet doesn't need to be limited to urban
areas, but can reach rural areas as well," Verceles said.

In reply to E-mailed questions about the House bills, Verceles
said the IT Academy would probably have similar directions as the
Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP), which teaches
government policy to public officials.

The IT Academy, he said, would "impress upon public officials and
personnel" information about global trends in IT to enable them to
maximize its use as a critical development tool.

"Right now government officials do not know the critical need for
IT as a development tool," Verceles said. "They must be taught.
Information officers in government also are not kept abreast of
new technologies. This affects the planning of IT and development
of systems in their offices. An academy is needed to assist the
government in their IT planning," he added.

Verceles said it isn't clear yet how much funding would be needed
for the academy, but said this could come from government savings
or the Office of the President, then later on be an integral
annual cost item under the General Appropriations Act.

It would probably be run under a policy-making board composed of
the National Computer Center, the Department of Transportation and
Communication, the Department of Science and Technology, the
National Economic and Development Authority, the National Security
Council, and the National Information Technology Council

WINTER CES 1996 -- 'DVD' SAYS IT ALL

     If there's one thing 1996 edition of Consumer Electronics Show
will have Jan. 5-8 in Las Vegas it will be a theme.  Undeniably,
that's the new, unified DVD, and manufacturers have been hoarding
mockups, prototypes and announcements for U.S. consumer electronics
industry's major showcase -- earlier editions of which launched
VCR, camcorders, CD.

     Vast amounts of consumer electronics industry's hopes are
squandered on that elusive long-sought "new product," and in its
favor, at least, is fact that entire industry is behind single DVD
format.  It almost seems that companies not showing such players in
Las Vegas will be exception rather than rule.  Scarcer still are
companies not promising DVD leadership positions or conceding they
won't be involved in first round of product deliveries.  While much
of DVD news will be generated on main floor, highlight will be
series of consecutively timed news conferences on eve of show Jan.
4 (Thurs.) by Pioneer, Sony, Thomson, Toshiba.

     While major Japanese and Korean manufacturers are expected to
show prototypes from own factories, many industry eyeballs will be
riveted on company that doesn't yet have DVD player production
capability -- TV and VCR industry leader Thomson Consumer
Electronics (TCE), which has been tantalizing industry with promise
of $500 player.

     TCE is expected to announce multiproduct deal with major
Japanese manufacturer, including DVD players that can be sold at
its target price, leveraged, perhaps, by plum of major contract for
other products.  TCE, which is buying major chunk of StarSight and
is entering services arena for first time (TVD Dec 18 p13), is
expected to make another significant move outside its traditional
field -- this time into DVD program distribution in pump-priming
effort, possibly with significant partner.

     Thomson promises DVD marketing announcements under RCA, GE and
ProScan labels, as well as unspecified software component. 
Retailers that met with TCE officials last month said company has
drafted definite plans on how it wants to bring DVD to market,
based on philosophy that first hardware dealers will be encouraged
to carry software titles.  Retailers told us TCE seems poised to
announce specific ways of helping retailers market DVD software,
but Dec. meetings revealed few specifics.

     Dolby AC-3 audio -- now component of DVD software for U.S. --
gains more momentum at show when Sony for first time will
demonstrate working prototype of AC-3 processor.  It's expected to
bill showings as "technical demonstration only" and is "not yet
prepared" to discuss specific marketing plans, Hi-Fi Vp Vic Pacor
said.  First processor is likely to be outboard rather than
integrated receiver, he said, with delivery to "coincide" with
launch of first Sony DVD players.

     In many respects, it will be traditional
entertainment-oriented CES, with gimmicks and gadgets galore, and
heavy emphasis on communication products, including all kinds of
phones, along with audio and video.  Although word "multimedia"
will be featured prominently, many of those products will be
peripherals or items already shown elsewhere.  Videogame glitz has
long since disappeared and migrated to E3 show, perhaps never to
return.  Likewise, after several forays into computer area, CES has
been unable to compete with Comdex, now a show for CE as well as
traditional business equipment dealers.

     Not that computer hardware and software manufacturers are
writing off CES completely.  It attracts nation's top CE dealers --
and that's too important a group to ignore.  IBM and Compaq will be
on show floor, displaying wares designed for CE trade but already
exposed at Comdex and elsewhere.  Microsoft is exhibiting, but its
main presence will be "at suites and doing meetings," Senior Group
Mktg. Mgr. Marty Taucher said, adding:  "It's not clear to us
whether CES will have a big role for us in the future, but we'd
like to keep our options open."

     Like other umbrella industries, consumer electronics is
splintering.  CES was first major showcase for prerecorded video,
consumer computers (a la early Apple, Commodore and Atari) and
videogames -- all of which became industries in their own right,
spawning their own shows.

     Debut of DVD and high interest in such fields as DSS,
on-screen program guides and booming projection TV presumably will
guarantee respectable attendance at this year's event.  Strangely,
as entertainment and computer products "converge," they also grow
farther apart in terms of showcasing.  And who knows what vain
hopes were tied up in designation of Compaq Pres. Eckard Pfeiffer
as 1996 CES keynote speaker.

JUSTICE DEPT. EXAMINING DVD PATENT SITUATION

     Design for central pool as one-stop supermarket for DVD patent
licenses could run into problems with U.S. Dept. of Justice (DoJ),
which recently reached agreement with Philips and Sony to modify
their CD patent pool practices.  Soon after specs for single DVD
format were agreed upon last month, contact was established between
DoJ and Sony and Philips, perhaps other patent holders, and
companies currently are formulating reply to DoJ's questions.

     At recent Tokyo DVD forum, there was talk of establishing
patent pool administered by 4 major developers -- Philips, Sony,
Matsushita and Toshiba -- to which secondary patent holders would
be invited (TVD Dec 18 p14).  DoJ's questions about DVD patents
were described by knowledgeable sources as routine, but agency did
succeed in forcing significant changes in way CD patents are
licensed.

     CD patents in past were bundled into single package
administered jointly by Sony and Philips, with Philips in charge of
actual licensing.  Thus, to make any product covered by any CD
patent, company had to take out blanket CD license.  DoJ started
probe about 2 years ago and, as one CD duplicator paraphrased
questionnaire, asked licensees for all available data including
"every letter and every agreement that you've had with these
companies."

     Voluntary settlement, quietly reached with Philips and Sony,
permits entities to obtain licenses under individual patents or
groups of patents rather than buying entire package.  "If a company
wishes to," Sony official said in Japan, "a company will be able to
obtain licenses for Sony patents from Sony," although company said
it intends to maintain procedure under which Philips handles most
patent licensing.  All present U.S. licensees will be given
opportunity to choose terms of revised licensing program rather
than continuing blanket licenses.

     In new licensing contracts, companies agree to be more
explicit about how patents can be used and when they expire, and
new agreements limit Philips' and Sony's protection in infringement
lawsuits filed by licensees, according to reports.

     CD licensing has been gold mine for patent holders as result
of explosive growth of CDs and derivative optical disc products. 
Disc Mfg. subsidiary of Quixote Corp. was quoted as saying it paid
Philips and Sony 6 cents per disc pressed in 1993 when it made 70
million discs -- about $4 million.

     In answer to our question, Sony conceded that "the revisions
will result in lower royalties, though... we do not comment on
specific royalty rates."  We were unable to obtain more detailed
information last week because of holiday closings and partial U.S.
govt. shutdown as result of stalled budget talks.

CHRISTMAS WASN'T VERY MERRY AT RETAIL

     CE retailers, many banking on holiday sales to brighten
lackluster year, were rebuked strongly by consumers who bypassed
their products despite lure of financing programs and prices at
all-time low.

     Heavy snow in parts of U.S. and lack of compelling products
were among reasons offered by retailers, but bottom line was that
consumers weren't buying what many dealers were selling, despite
such deep discounts as 10-60% off sale at Wiz.

     Retail same-store sales in 31-day shopping season were
projected to be down 3.8% overall, with Northeast and West Coast
decreasing 7.1 and 4.3%, respectively, followed by Midwest, off
4.1%;  Southwest, off 4.0%;  Mid-Atlantic, down 2.2%;  Southeast,
down 1%.  Data were provided in TeleCheck Services survey of
same-store check clearances.  Checks account for about 1/3 of
retail spending, TeleCheck said.  By week's end, analysts had
projected same-store sales at Best Buy (BB), Circuit City (CC) and
Tandy chains would be flat to slightly up, although Sears, which
does strong business in CE, was expected to show 5% rise tied
largely to clothing.  Most retailers are expected to post Dec.
results this week.

     Retail malaise spared few product categories.  TVs, VCRs and
camcorders almost uniformly were down from year ago, as was DSS,
darling of industry in 1994.  There were some bright spots in
audio, including Dolby AC-3 receivers and speakers, but retailers
reporting increases said they were result of change in merchandise
mix, rather than any specific hot-selling product.  Even music
software, onetime profit center, appeared to lose ground, caught in
price war between Circuit City and Best Buy that dropped some new
CD releases to below $10.

     PCs were top sellers but, with margins razor thin, generated
more volume than profit, retailers said.  PCs' impact on CE was
characterized by one retailer's tale of watching shoppers at
adjacent CompUSA store load up cars with PC gear while his store
stood nearly empty.  But other retailers said PCs didn't disrupt CE
business.  "I'm not sure that some consumer dollars that normally
would have gone to a big-screen TV went to a computer," Lowe's
Video Mdse. Mgr. Mark Galchutt said.  "I think in reality there was
nobody in the stores and the customers voted this year that they
were going to control their spending."

     Holiday sales didn't fail for lack of trying.  Retailers
lowered advertised VCR prices in $10-$20 increments leaving
off-brand products such as Symphonic 4-head and 2-head models at
$149 and $119, respectively.  CC advertised what appeared to be
Daewoo-made 25" set at $199.  Chasm between low-end point-and-shoot
camcorders and more featured models grew as GE's Sanyo-made 8mm
Images model appeared in ads at $279.  And cordless phones became
commodity item via $50 rebates offered by office superstore chains.

     "You could walk out of some stores with a hi-fi VCR, 25" TV
and a camcorder, having paid $650," said East Coast retailer. 
"Last year, you paid $650 just for a decent camcorder."

     Slow holiday season also may cause manufacturer and retailer
inventories to rise, although few industry observers expected
repeat of year ago.  Dealers, many of whom were left sitting with
huge amounts of inventory then, were more cautious this year and
sales to dealers in 3rd week of Dec. showed double-digit decreases
(see separate report, this issue).  "The key thing now is what is
the inventory situation going to be like after the first of the
year," Thomson Consumer Electronics Exec. Vp Joseph Clayton said. 
"I don't think it's going to be as bad as last year.  I'm not as
concerned because [retailers] didn't buy a lot.

     Yet some retailers disagreed, insisting there's enough left in
pipeline to touch off another round of price cutting in first half. 
"Whatever we've thought was going to be the low was even lower, so
there's no bottom," said Bernie's TV & Appliance Pres. Milton
Rosenberg, whose chain is honoring competitors' rebate coupons. 
"Everything is hitting new never-been-done-before low price points. 
But once the inventory levels get more realistic, I think everybody
will calm down."

     Shrinking prices and profits may push more retailers to seek
bankruptcy court protection and force others to close this year,
said analysts who predicted that another 5-6 "notable" chains will
file for Chapter 11 this year.  Among candidates will be Fretter,
which closed 190 stores last year and said it's weighing all
options, including bankruptcy.  Sluggish holiday sales also may
play role in determining future of 1995's Chapter 11 casualties
including Bradlees, Caldor, Harvey Electronics, Savemart.

     "The 2 principal factors which have caused the decline in
comparable-store sales were competitive pressures and a sluggish
retail environment," Sun TV & Appliances Chmn.-CEO Robert Oyster
said in reporting that 46-store chain's 3rd-quarter net income
dropped to $1.3 million from $4.2 million year ago as same-store
sales plunged 10%.  Sun, which expanded into Cincinnati last year,
has said it's studying several options to boost stock value,
including possible sale or merger, although Oyster has indicated
chain isn't "actively" seeking deal (TVD Nov 6 p14).

DSS PRICING FOLLOWS CE TREND -- DOWN

     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to drop
and competition increases, entry-level product appears poised to
dip below $300.

     Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) low-end RCA DSS system that
started 1995 at $699, was being advertised by year-end at $499, and
retailers said profit was in danger of drying up.  To combat
falling prices, some retailers are focusing on step-up RCA and Sony
DSS products that promise 20-25% profit margins, but slower sales. 
Overall, 1995 sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expected
to surpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close to
million subscribers.

     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in
1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"
Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6
to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."

     Lower retails are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba
and Uniden enter DSS race this year with Uniden already indicating
it may price product in $499-$549 range.  In addition to DSS,
Alphastar and Echostar are planning to introduce own services --
latter partnering with Philips to bring Magnavox product to CE
retail.  Even Primestar, which primarily has leased equipment to
consumers, has tested sales through group cable operator TCI.

     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2
powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCA
and GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has been
advertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony piece, which
originally had $749 suggested price tag, was featured in Wiz ad at
$648.

     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers,
who have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones with
hardware offered virtually free and profits made on service. 
Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostar hasn't formally
released pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware
retails could hit $500, with programming at $20.

     Alphastar has said it will avoid selling own brand at CE
retail, relying instead on combination of Amway, satellite
distributors, multilevel marketing.  Company signed agreement with
Samsung Electromechanics in Aug. to build integrated receiver
decoders (IRDs) and said it's seeking similar agreement with 2nd
supplier.  Samsung and 2nd supplier are expected to sell branded
product to CE dealers.  "I would think that for this product the
equipment would pass the cost curve much more rapidly than the
marketing cost of attracting a subscriber," said Alphastar
Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein, whose company plans to launch
120-channel service in first quarter with hardware packages at
$600-$700.  "When that happens, it makes sense to give the box away
because the long-term value is in the subscription and the ongoing
revenue that comes from that subscription."

     But with so many satellite systems to choose from, future
hinges on manufacturers' ability to differentiate products.  Many
retailers already have said they won't give category same amount of
shelf space as other products such as VCRs, meaning that suppliers
will be battling for every square inch.

     "The big question will be whether manufacturers can create
clear differences for consumers so they can make choices," Tops
Appliance City Senior Vp-Gen. Mdse. Mgr. Rick Jones said.  "When
you can't [tell differences], you end up dealing with a price issue
and end up with $499 satellite systems."

EMERSON SUES ORION

     Emerson Radio has sued Orion Electric, claiming long-time
supplier breached contract by failing to offer it same price
decreases on select video products that it granted Wal-Mart.

     In suit filed in U.S. Dist. Court, Newark, Emerson charged
Orion and parent Otake Trading violated agreement signed in Feb.
(TVD Feb 27 p16).  Under that pact, Orion was to supply Emerson
with TVs, VCRs, VCPs and TV/VCRs in return for right to use Emerson
trademark for video products it sold to Wal-Mart.

     Orion has "failed to exploit privileges" granted by licensing
agreement, and sales of Emerson video products to Wal-Mart dropped
to $136.1 million for 6 months ended Sept. 30 vs. $181.3 million in
same period year earlier, suit said.  Orion supplied 89% of Emerson
products in 1995 and Wal-Mart accounted for 53% of Emerson sales
for fiscal year ended March 31.

     Orion failed to offer Emerson same price reductions on 19" and
25" TVs that it granted Wal-Mart in Aug., suit said.  Suit said
Emerson was paying 2% less than Wal-Mart for 25" TVs until Sept.,
when Orion dropped retailer's price $17, creating $13 gap.  Orion
also is selling 3 VCRs at Wal-Mart not offered Emerson and hasn't
supplied camcorders.

     Instead, Orion is selling Memorex camcorders to Wal-Mart,
brand licensed from Hanny Magnetics by group of ex-Emerson
executives who formed Memcorp (TVD June 26 p13), suit said. 
Emerson also has sued Memcorp, charging Pres. Barry Smith breached
partnership agreement (TVD July 10 p11).  Emerson and Smith's
Hopper Radio created E&H Partners in 1994 to distribute refurbished
Emerson products in U.S. and overseas and new items in Latin
America.

     Orion also "ignored plain meaning" of agreement requiring
company to accept returns of Emerson product from Wal-Mart starting
Aug. 1, suit said.  Manufacturer hasn't accepted  all products,
leaving Emerson with about $2.3 million worth of returned 
merchandise, suit said.  Orion contended in its suit that Emerson
intentionally delayed receiving Wal-Mart returns and began advising
chain before July 31 to send them to Orion.

     Orion sued Emerson Dec. 21 charging company violated agreement
by disclosing confidential information, including its marketing of
Emerson brand products and number of sales to Wal-Mart (TVD Dec 25
p11).  It also claimed Emerson failed to pay $2.3 million in Nov.
in effort to force parent Otake to accede to pricing and supply
demands.  Otake said Emerson's suit was "without merit" and it was
"trying to hide behind a smokescreen when, in fact, it is the
guilty party."

     In delving into history of relationship between companies that
began with opening of TV assembly plant in Princeton, Ind., in
1987, Emerson's suit said Otake Pres. Shigemasa Otake told it in
1992 that Orion brand would be sold at retail as competing product. 
At same time, Otake hired ex-Emerson executive John Bond, who was
"familiar" with company's trade secrets, suit said.

TOPS MAPS CHANGES

     After year-long experiment with noncommissioned sales, Tops
Appliance City is returning to full commissions as it seeks to
expand home office business.

     Edison, N.J., chain switched to noncommissioned sales last
Jan., but strategy didn't "achieve expected results" and resulted
in turnover of sales force, Vice Chmn.-CEO Robert Gross said.  Tops
revived commissions in Nov. and will complete conversion this month
covering 1,400-member sales force, he said.

     Commissions also are being reintroduced as Tops moves to add
4th PC brand and expand hardware to 22 items from 15, Senior
Vp.-Gen. Mdse. Mgr. Rick Jones said, but he declined to identify
new supplier.  Tops currently carries Apple, IBM and Compaq PCs,
and Hewlett-Packard appears likely addition, sources said. 
Retailer also will merchandise current assortment of 300-400 PC
software titles more "aggressively" in terms of pricing and
promotions and expand peripheral product offerings beyond current
60 items, he said.

     Goal is to boost home office sales to 12% of revenues from
current 4-6%, Gross said.  While he conceded PC margins are low,
product appeals to middle and upper income consumers that store is
trying to attract as part of effort to soften one-time hard edge
image.

     To make room for home office offerings, Tops will
"deemphasize" videogames and isn't buying new products for next 2
months as it reviews strategy, Jones said.  "It's been difficult to
manage the software and we've been unable to get good support from
software companies," he said.  "We think it still has a place in
our stores, but we'd like to see where it can fit in."

     Return to commissions also was made with aim of increasing
extended service contract sales and boosting margins.  Service
contracts accounted for about 5% of revenues, and margins ran 23.2%
in 3rd quarter, Gross said.  At same time, Tops has consolidated
operations in stores and at hq, resulting $1.8 million saving, said
Gross, who declined to disclose how many employees were affected by
changes.  Some were moved to other positions in chain, he said.

     Tops earlier reported it had obtained site in Brooklyn for 9th
store, with plans to open by late 1996 (TVD Dec 25 p14).

RECORD OCT. AUDIO SALES

     Significant double-digit increases in portable audio and
components overcame modest declines in systems and aftermarket
autosound to push factory audio sales to 13.9% increase, setting
all-time billion-dollar record for any month, EIA Market Research
Dept. said.

     Oct. shipments climbed to $1.066 billion from year-earlier
$935.73 million.  Record result came despite 2% decline in systems
and 0.8% drop in aftermarket car audio.  Home theater boom
continued to spark once-beleaguered components category, pushing
shipments up 33.4% gain.  Portable audio shipments were up 20% in
Oct., posting monthly record sales total of $426.03 million.

     For 10 months, total shipments topped $7 billion, rising 5.9%
to $7.03 billion from year-earlier $6.64 billion.  Components led
all categories with 13.8% sales increase, other segments posting
more modest gains, portable audio climbing 5.4%, aftermarket car
audio up 3.1%, systems up 1.9%.

     Home theater boom prompted recent surge in audio components
sales, which followed many months of consecutive declines.  EIA's
Consumer Electronics Mfrs. Assn. (CEMA) credited recovery to
"white-hot sales" of speakers and AV receivers.  For Oct.,
receivers rose 41% to $66.4 million and surpassed $400 million in
sales for Jan.-Oct., CEMA said.  Turntables also were pleasant Oct.
surprise, rising 27%, said CEMA, which didn't reveal actual sales
estimate.  Overall home speaker sales doubled in Oct. from year
earlier to $84.3 million, spurred partly by fivefold rise in sales
of surround sound speaker packages for home theater, CEMA said.

     Trade group said 20% Oct. sales gain in portable audio to
record $426 million was category's best percentage rise since April
1992, when shipments jumped 20.2% over year earlier to $156.74
million.  CEMA reported 6% rise in sales of boombox stereos without
CD to $28 million, while CD boomboxes posted "healthy" 17%
increase.

     Unspecified decline in rack system sales hurt overall systems
category in Oct., CEMA said, emphasizing that sales were up 2% for
10 months.  Pattern for most of 1995 repeated itself in Oct., with
strong sales of compact systems supporting category.  Aftermarket
car audio sales "held relatively steady" in Oct., CEMA said,
without mentioning 0.8% decline in month.  Shortfall came despite
11% rise in sales of car speakers, CEMA said.

     CEMA quoted Yamaha Mktg. Dir. Tom Graham as saying that 33%
rise in Oct. components sales "gives further affirmation to the
escalating home theater ownership trend."  He said:  "Consumers are
learning that home theater is more than just video and requires
high-performance audiovideo receivers and components coupled with
quality speakers to truly recreate the movie theater experience."

     Here's EIA breakdown of factory audio sales for Oct. and
year's first 10 months:

ECHOSTAR, DBSC MERGE

     Echostar Communications and Direct Bcstg. Satellite Corp.
(DBSC) have agreed to merger that tentatively gives former
additional orbital slots for DBS.

     Proposed merger, which requires SEC approval, came last week
as Echostar successfully launched Echostar-1 on Long March at Great
Wall Industries site in China.  Satellite will carry first 65-70
channels for service scheduled to go on line in Feb.-March,
Echostar spokeswoman said.

     DBSC will become Echostar subsidiary, although role of DBSC
Chmn.-CEO Harlin Radin in merged company hasn't been determined,
Echostar spokeswoman said.  Echostar had bought 40% of DBSC in
1994.

     DBSC holds FCC DBS permits to operate 11 channels at 61.5
degrees W and another 11 at 175 degrees W, Radin said.  DBSC has
contract with Lockheed-Martin to build 2 of their new A2100
satellites, first scheduled for July 1997 delivery, other year
later, he said.  Each carries 32 transponders, 115 w each, and
contains technology that can double transmission power to 230 w
using 16 transponders.  Echostar has FCC permit to operate 21
transponders at 119 degrees W.

     Echostar's Digital Sky Highway Network (DISH) is expected to
be in service by Feb. with 65 channels and another 65 added with
launch of Echostar-2 in July-Sept. (TVD July 3 p15).  In competing
with Digital Satellite Service (DSS), Primestar and AlphaStar,
Echostar has said it plans to focus on satellite dealers, while
alliance with Philips brings Magnavox brand product to CE retailers
(TVD June 12 p21).  Although Echostar hasn't set pricing, it
indicated in prospectus that hardware would be priced around $500,
with monthly programming fee starting at $20.

     Service originally was scheduled to be available in Sept., was
delayed by investigation that followed explosion of Long March
rocket in Jan. 1995.

     While Echostar hasn't reported plans for international market,
Radin said satellite at 61.5 degrees potentially could supply
programming for Portugal, Spain and U.K. as well as Mexico, Latin
and South America.  Any plans for international service will
require FCC approval.
