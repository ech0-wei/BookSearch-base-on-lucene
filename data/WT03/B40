GRIMMA TO UPGRADE UKRAINIAN SUGAR PLANTS

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Germany's MASCHINEN- UND ANLAGENBAU GRIMMA (MAG) said it was seeking a
DM100 million contract to modernise five sugar refineries in Ukraine.
Grimma is negotiating with various banks to arrange the necessary credits
to finance the work, but intends only to provide equipment and know-how
itself. Ukraine, like other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent
States, is struggling to revive its run-down industry and wean itself off
dependence on bartered sugar imports from Cuba.

SCOTTISH AND NEWCASTLE TAKES CONTROL OF SOUTH AFRICAN BREWER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

One of the largest brewing groups in Britain, SCOTTISH AND NEWCASTLE, has
bought a 75% stake in niche South African beer maker MITCHELL'S BREWERY
for an undisclosed amount. Mitchell's started operations in Kynsna on
South Africa's south coast in 1983, adding further small brewing
operations in Cape Town in 1989 and Johannesburg in 1991. The company
currently produces around 1,500 hectolitres of beer a month, giving it a
domestic market share of less than 1%. The South African market is
dominated by SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES which has a 97 % market share.

ESTONIAN BREWER SELLS STAKE TO FINNISH GROUP

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Estonian brewer TARTU OLLETEHAS, has agreed to sell 15% of its shares to
Finland's OLVI. The Estonian brewer said the deal would boost its exports
by means of Olvi's sales network and become the best brewer in the Baltic
states. Olvi is encroaching on a Baltic market which has so far been the
preserve of BALTIC BEVERAGE HOLDING, a joint venture between HARTWALL AND
PRIPPS RINGNES, owned by Norwegian food conglomerate ORKLA and VOLVO, of
Sweden. Olvi paid Nkr10 million for the shares. It also said it wanted to
put at least a quarter of its shares onto the burgeoning Tallinn stock
exchange. Tartu Olletehas had share capital of Nkr7.5 million and turnover
last year of Nkr175 million. The brewer is owned by MAGNUM KONSUMER, which
is also the main stakeholder in the TALLINN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, which
recently sold 10% of its shares to foreign investors. Both parties have
agreed that next year 25% of Tartu shares will be listed on the Tallinn
stock exchange.

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Irish fruit wholesaler and distributor FYFFES Plc has sold its 50%
shareholding in the BANANA TRADING CORPORATION to a wholly-owned
subsidiary of DOLE FOOD COMPANY Inc for a total consideration of USD26.3
million. Fyffes has also entered into new long-term shipping agreements
with Dole for shipping part of its banana requirements from Latin America.
Fyffes said the shipping agreements would be of benefit to Fyffes and Dole
and would give both companies significant economies of scale. Banana

other related assets including certain banana farming assets in Honduara.

LA MODERNA TO CLINCH DEAL WITH ROYAL VAN NAMEN

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Mexican conglomerate EMPRESAS LA MODERNA is close to a deal to buy Dutch
fresh produce distributor ROYAL VAN NAMEN. With annual sales of some USD50
million, Van Namen is one of Europe's largest produce distributors and
would add to La Moderna's growing network of distribution in the Americas.
Produce would be shipped to Europe from the Americas and vice-versa. La
Moderna grows and buys fresh produce from Chile to Canada. About 75% of
its production is currently sold in the United States and Canada. The
fragmented fresh produce market - with the largest player capturing only
7% of the market - is fertile ground for La Moderna to leverage its vast
distribution capabilities Demand in the US fresh produce market is
expected to grow more than 10% a year. A pure cigarette company just three
years ago, La Moderna has expanded into agri-biotechnology and packaging.
Its agri-biotechnology division consists of a fresh produce division and a
seeds company SEMINIS. The group's produce division exported USD250
million worth of vegetables last year. Moderna's produce company
BIONOVAJUST merged with Oakland-based DNA PLANT TECHNOLOGY to form DNAP
HOLDINGS.

BASS CRITICISED FOR HOOPERS HOOCH CAMPAIGN

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The advertising campaign launched by British brewer BASS to promote its
"Hoopers Hooch" low-alcohol fizzy drink has drawn criticism in
professional circles and from authorities worried about the temptation of
alcohol for young consumers. For similar reasons, Carlsberg Tetley was
recently forced to change the labelling on its "Tchickhead" brand and
Whitbread has been censured by Alcohol Concern for the implicit incitation
to violence and the anti-social behaviour that its "Lemon Jag" and
"Vanilla Heist" beers inspire amongst youngsters..

SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES ACQUIRES POLISH BEER MAKER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES, together with EURO AGRO CENTRUM, has acquired 52%
of the capital of the Polish brewery group TYSKIE in Tychy. SAB, which has
made enormous strides on overseas markets since 1993, has thus moved up
into fourth place on the world brewers' league, with a total production
capacity of 38 million hectolitres, behind ANHEUSER BUSCH (107 million
hectolitres), HEINEKEN (64 million hectolitres.) and MILLER, a subsidiary
of the US Philip Morris group (54 million hectolitres). With the Tychy
brewery, as well as the Lech brewery in Poznan, in which they already had
a controlling stake, SAB and EAC now hold 20% of the Polish beer market.
Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, SAB is now the biggest brewery group in
Hungary and is set to become Romania's number one too. In the 1995/96 year
(ending March 31), SAB turned out 24.6 million hectolitres of beer in
South Africa and 11.4 million hectolitres abroad. SAB has just made a loan
issue on the international capital market for USD300 million, in order to
raise funds to reinforce its long-term strategy.

BONGRAIN REPORTS SLIGHT RISE IN TURNOVER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Back home in France, Bongrain has just published its latest half-yearly
results, which show a slight increase in sales turnover to 5.055 billion
French Francs, up from FF 4.935 billion at end-June 1995. Sales were badly
affected by poor weather conditions in June, but picked up sharply in
July, which will help lift second half 1996 figures. Bongrain's turnover
also progressed at international level.

The French group's operating profits, which in the first half of 1995 had
reached FF 312.2 million, fell back to FF 250.3 million, as a result of
several different factors. For a start, manufacturers have not been able
to offset the increase in the price of milk paid to producers in relation
to its cheese-making quality by a rise in retail prices from Autumn 1995
onwards. And at the same time, by-products and surpluses have lost a lot
of their value (-20% in the case of lactoserum, for example) - something
which accounted for nearly half the drop in operating profits.

Bongrain has meanwhile continued to invest in the main brand names and in
advertising at European and international level. The group has also
managed to reinforce its presence on new markets.

Bongrain's overall profit in the first half of this year works out at FF
148.1 million (FF 184 million in the previous six-monthly period), and net
group profits at FF 129.5 million compared with 164.6 million for the
first six months of 1995.

Although no forecasts were made for the year as a whole, Bongrain is
expecting a difficult year. The company is nonetheless pressing on with
its innovation strategy, with several major launches on the cards for its
subsidiaries.

BONGRAIN FINALISES ACCORD WITH MAJOR CZECH CHEESE MAKER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

French food group BONGRAIN, which already has a foothold in the Czech
Republic via its PRIBINA subsidiary, is busy finalising an agreement to
take over the Povltavske Mlekarny cheese-making concern, to the South East
of Prague. The Czech firm, one of the biggest in the dairy sector,
produces soft cheese and fresh cheese, as well as other dairy products. It
has an annual turnover of more than 100 million French Francs and employs
275 people. Thanks to this latest transaction, Bongrain will become sole
owner of the Hermelin soft cheese brand sold by Pribina and Pvltavske
Mlekarny.

UNILEVER OPENS FIRST SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CENTRE IN CHINA

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The Anglo-Dutch agri-foods and consumer products group UNILEVER opened on
October 7 its first scientific research centre in China, which is to serve
as a starting point for a successful partnership between the food industry
and academia in the country. Set up in Shanghai's Institute of organic
chemicals, the new research centre will help Unilever to draw on the
strength of the local Chinese scientific world and, at the same time,
steer the locals towards developing the most suitable technologies. The
research centre will use its scientific know-how to help match consumer
preferences with Unilever's branded products as a means of boosting sales
in China, and particularly the business of the twelve joint ventures the
Anglo-Dutch group already has in the country.

VRANKEN GROUP BUYS HEIDSIECK CHAMPAGNE FROM SEAGRAM

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Canadian drinks group SEAGRAM announced on October 14 that it had signed a
deal to sell its famous champagne Heidsieck Monopole to Vranken. The
sell-off covers not only the brand name, but also the business premises
and stocks - some 4.5 million bottles or more than three years of sales -
and roughly 130 hectares of vineyards. Heidsieck Monopole's 70-strong
workforce will also be taken on by the Vranken group and no redundancies
are foreseen. The price tag on the transaction was not revealed, but it is
estimated in professional circles to be in excess of USD400 million.
Paul-Francois Vranken, a Belgian businessman who set foot in the Champagne
region just 20 years ago, has become, through successive acquisitions and
launches of new brands like Charles Lafitte and La Demoiselle, the fifth
biggest champagne trader, producing some 8.5 million bottles in 1995 and
with a sales turnover of more than 600 million French Francs. Until
recently, Mr Vranken was still short of a big brand name - a gap that he
will now try to fill by relaunching the Heidsieck Monopole.

To start with, he launched the Charles Lafitte and La Demoiselle brands of
champagne. Then, in 1994, he brought his company into a new phase of
external growth by taking over the Barancourt house which has a sales
turnover of more than two million bottles of champagne a year, and then
through the acquisition of Champagnes Charbaut (with sales of 1.2 million
bottles). These acquisitions enabled the Vranken group to sell more than
8.5 million bottles of champagne this year and post a turnover of nearly
FF 700 million.

Last year, Heidsieck Monopole sold 1.2 million bottles of champagne,
three-quarters if which were intended for the export market. From
Seagram's point of view, this transaction is a follow-up to the
restructuring plan its champagne branch launched last Spring.

DANISH GROUP BUYS PFIZER'S CHY-MAX DAIRY CLOTTING AGENT RANGE

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The Danish group CHR. HANSEN has strengthened its position as market
leader in the field of dairy clotting agents by acquiring from PFIZER of
the United States the CHY-MAX range, along with all patents and related
rights. A production contract has just been signed with the American
company, which will continue to manufacture the CHY-MAX range of clotting
agents at its Indiana factory in the US. Last year, the CHY-MAX product
range's worldwide turnover was nearly USUSD14 million, according to a
communique, which did not, however, reveal the price tag on the
transaction with HANSEN. CHY-MAX is a range of dairy clotting agents
produced via fermentation and used in cheese-making. Chr. Hansen already
owned a similar range of products called CHYMOGEN. The Danish company,
better known as a major supplier of food ingredients, is a subsidiary of
Chr. Hansen Holding A/S, a firm specialised in biotechnology applications
for food ingredients, anti-allergy treatment and for technological
services for agriculture. The holding company has a workforce of about
2,000 in 30 different countries, and, for the 1994/1995 financial year,
reported a turnover of 1.8 billion Danish Kroner.

DANONE TAKES CONTROLLING STAKE IN CHINESE BREWER, DONGXIBU

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

French agri-foods group DANONE has strengthened its foothold in the
rapidly-growing Chinese beer market, by taking a 60% stake in the WUHAN
DONGXIHU BEER COMPANY, the fifth biggest brewer in China. Thanks to this
acquisition, the French group has moved up to fourth place on the Chinese
beer market, according to Danone, although it did not reveal the price tag
on its latest investment. The Chinese market, which is now as big as 160
million hectolitres of beer, is still very fragmented. Dongxinu is fifth
in the league table, with a production figure of 2.9 million hectolitres
of beer a year. Situated in Wuhan, in the Hubei province (in central
China), Dongxihu holds 40% of the market in the province, which is home to
60 million people.

Last January, Danone had announced plans for a joint venture with Haomen,
the tenth biggest beer maker in China, based in the Beijing region. China
itself has the second largest market for beer in the world, behind the
United States. And the market is expanding rapidly. It is set to cross the
200 million hectolitre mark by the year 2000, making it the biggest market
in the world.

Last year, the Danone group turned out 25 million hectolitres of beer
(Kronenbourg). It is the leading brewer in France, Italy and Spain and the
second biggest in Europe. In China, Danone is also present on the market
for biscuits, fresh dairy products (Danone brand), Chinese milk-based
drinks (Wahaha) and sauces (Amoy).

ambitious targets for recovery and states that recycling and re-use must
contribute an important part of recovery. Recycling of plastics can give
rise to concern about the migration of contaminants from the recycled
plastic into a packaged food. One component of a research project
currently being carried out in the United Kingdom under the EU-sponsored
Agriculture and Agro-Industry R&D programme (AAIR) is studying the
effectiveness of a virgin layer of plastic (PET) (polyethylene
terephthalate) in limiting the migration of chemicals from recycled PET,
i.e. three-layer plastic bottles (for soft drinks) were made with a buried
layer of either virgin PET or PET contaminated deliberately with
chemicals, and migration levels were measured in parts per million (ppm).

The results of research work undertaken so far show that even with a high
level of deliberate contamination of the middle layer of the 3-layer
bottles, with hightly mobile model contaminants, migration was not
detectable after the standard conditions of 10 days at 40 degrees C or 
even after 6 months at room temperature.

This has brought the research workers to the conclusion that an intact PET
layer represents an efficient functional barrier against migration from
contaminants encapsulated in a recycled PET material under normal
conditions of use for soft drinks. The results also allow the conclusion
that the 25% recycled material employed in this test could be increased to
any technically feasible percentage provided that the characteristics of
the functional barrier layer remained unchanged.

BIOTECHNOLOGY: NEW MEANS OF BOOSTING WHEAT PRODUCTION

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The use of modern biotechnology processes is the best way of raising world
production of wheat and meeting growing demand for this staple food,
concludes a study published on October 18 by the International Centre for
the Improvement of Wheat and Maize. The Mexico-based research centre
employs scientists from some 40 different countries, including two giant
wheat and corn producer nations - the United States and France.

Thanks to biotechnology, more wheat can be harvested from the same surface
area using the same amount of water for irrigation and the same quantity
of fertilizers; it can also help keep the impact on the environment to a
minimum, pointed out Matt Reynolds, the main author of the study. Other
means of boosting production - expanding the sown surface area or wider
use of fertilizers - are not viable in the long term, argues the
scientist. "We can use biotechnology to identify the genetic
characteristics of adaptation and resistance to insects and diseases",
said Mr Reynolds, adding that the size of the grains and the taste of
wheat were equally important.

The development of a new prototype wheat crop and the idea of leaving the
ears to develop over a longer period of time are among the other solutions
suggested by the study to the problem of meeting rising world demand for
cereals. The Mexican research centre's study also recommends the use of
"hybrid" crops, which are more hardy and resistant to disease, insects and
parasites than older generations of crops, even though they are not fit
for reproduction. The authors of the study point out that a possible
stagnation of wheat yields would further aggravate the problems of poverty
and famine in the world, since wheat is "the staple food of humanity".
"While the world population is growing at a rate of 2.5% a year, wheat
yields are increasing by only 1% a year", pointed out Timothy Reeves,
Director of the International Centre for the Improvement of Wheat and
Maize.

RESEARCH PATENTS: NEW EUROPEAN PATENT SEARCH SERVICE WILL HELP AVOID
DUPLICATION

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

For the last few months, European scientists have been able to draw on a
new European patent search service called QUICK SCAN, which the European
Commission would like to promote among a wider user base. It is targeting
small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, because this new service
- one of the various support measures offered under the Community's
specific programme for the dissemination and exploitation of the results
of research and technological development activities (INNOVATION) - can
help avoid duplication of research effort and unnecessary expense on
investment.

According to the European Commission's estimates, up to ECU 25 billion is
wasted every year in the EU in duplicating research and development work
already carried out elsewhere. This problem is of particular relevance to
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are less likely to have
access to the patent information system (a study carried out by the
European Patent Office last year showed that over 60% of European SMEs do
not have access to the system). In this context, the aim of the QUICK SCAN
activity is two-fold: it not only helps avoid duplication of research and
thus promote more efficient use of funding resources, but it can also
raise awareness of the patent information system.

The Commission has sought to keep the methodology of the new service as
simple as possible. It falls under the "Technology Validation and
Technology Transfer" action line of the INNOVATION programme and projects
are subjected to a "novelty check" by the search division of the European
Patent Office (EPO). This check compares the technical developments
proposed by the project with the existing state-of-the-art in that
particular area thus enabling a well-informed evaluation of the innovative
character of the proposal.

During the months of April and May 1996, no less than 100 project
proposals selected for the definition phase under the INNOVATION programme
were submitted for assessment. 13% of these were not suitable for scanning
by the EPO for reasons of either form or content. Following the scan, 30%
of all projects submitted were classified as being "novel". In 57% of
cases, however, the novelty of the project, or parts of it, was questioned.

In at least two cases, the QUICK SCAN search results led to a complete
redirection of the project due to the discovery of information on existing
research not known to the consortium carrying out the research project. In
a few other cases, QUICK SCAN provided valuable information on possible
competitors, pointed towards interesting prior R&D work or possible end
users of a new technology.

In the eyes of the European Commission, this first exercise has clearly
demonstrated the cost effectiveness of the QUICK SCAN activity. Generally
speaking, it estimates that the costs of the scan itself amounted to only
one-tenth of the funding that has been directly saved as a result of the
scan.

FRENCH RESEARCHERS MAP COFFEE GENOME

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Researchers at the ORSTOM Institute in Montpellier have succeeded in
mapping the coffee genome, break-through that is expected to improve plant
selection. Launched at the beginning of the 1990s, research into the gene
structure of coffee was carried out by the Laboratory for genetic
resources and the improvement of tropical plants (LRGAPT) attached to
ORSTOM (the French Institute of scientific research for development and
cooperation) in collaboration with the Nestle research centre in Tours.

The map was drawn up through the molecular analysis of plant material
provided by researchers at the Man coffee genetics station in the Ivory
Coast, where several thousand varieties collected across Africa have been
nurtured and studied for almost thirty years. The map is of Coffea
canephora, more commonly known as the Robusta variety, which is grown in
West Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. It may, however,
also be used for other varieties, notably the more widespread Arabica.

Using molecular markers, it is possible with a genetic map to identify and
locate the genes carried by the chromosomes, enabling scientists to
identify genes of agronomic interest at an early stage of development:
disease resistance, yield, bean size, caffeine content, etc. The map will
make the selection of coffee plants more rapid and effective. It has until
now taken ten years to assess the potential of new strains. Moreover,
selection has traditionally been a very expensive process, because of the
large areas needed for trials and the array of tests to assess the quality
of a coffee variety. In the longer term, the map may be used in
genetically modifying coffee plants. LRGATP researchers will soon apply
their map in the context of a programme in Kenya to control the transfer
of a diseases resistance gene identified in Robusta to the Arabica
variety. Joint projects have also been launched in the Ivory Coast and
Costa Rica.

COSMETICS: EU COMMISSION GUARANTEES SAFETY OF RAW MATERIALS USED

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The safety of cosmetics and their ingredients in the European Union is
subject to strict regulation. The conditions in which cosmetic products
can be marketed without posing any risk for consumers are lid down by EU
Council Directive 76/768/EEC - the so-called Cosmetics Directive - which
has been amended on several occasions, pointed out EU Consumer Policy
Commissioner Emma Bonino in response to a written question from German
Green Member of the European Parliament Hiltrud Breyer. Worried about the
"mad cow disease" scare in the United Kingdom, the MEP was asking if
cosmetics users ran any risk of infection through broken skin, and, more
particularly, if the UK still used beef derivatives as raw materials in
cosmetic and was taking the same safety precautions as in Germany and
other EU Member States.

Permanently reinforced safety standards.

In reply to the German MEP's first query, Mrs Bonino simply said that the
Commission's services had no knowledge of any study that had assessed the
risk of infection through the use of cosmetics on a cut or broken skin
surface.

As for any risks related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the
Commissioner recalled that Council Directive 93/35/EEC amending the
Cosmetics Directive for the sixth time, had tightened up safety standards
for cosmetic products. This Directive requires cosmetics manufacturers or
importers in the European Union to provide the national authorities, or
monitoring purposes, with an information file, giving data notably on the
qualitative and quantitative aspects of the product, as well as the
physical, chemical and microbiological specifications of both the raw
materials used and the finished product, purity criteria and conditions
for microbiological control of cosmetic products, the method of
production, and an evaluation of the safety of the end product from the
human health point of view.

As for the risks posed by BSE, the Commissioner recalled that, at the
beginning of the 1990s, the World Health Organisation and various national
and EU scientific and veterinary committees concerned by the mad cow
scare, including the EU Scientific Committee for Cosmetics, recommended
that manufacturers used only beef derivatives from countries free from
bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The European cosmetic toiletry and
perfumery association (Colipa) has made quite clear that it has
scrupulously followed the experts' recommendations.

Thus specified beef offal supplied to cosmetics producers must be
accompanied by a certificate of origin. Colipa also confirmed earlier this
year that beef cattle offal most likely to pose a risk of contamination,
such as brain, spinal cord and eyes were "not used in the manufacture of
cosmetic products in the Community".

At the EU level, legislation adopted since the early days of the BSE
epidemic has been largely of a veterinary nature. After the British
Government admitted there was a potential risk of BSE transmission to
humans last Spring, the European Commission imposed a blanket ban on UK
exports of beef, beef products and derivatives. Directive 96/239/EC of
March 27, 1996 prohibited British exports of any products originating from
cattle slaughtered in the UK intended for medical, cosmetic or
pharmaceutical use. Decision 96/362/EC of June 11, 1996 stipulates that
the UK may only allow production of such products in plants under official
veterinary control which have proved that they respect the necessary
conditions. This measure states that rules governing products from the UK
also apply to production of medicines, cosmetics etc. for the domestic
market. But with this piece of legislation, the Commission also gave the
go-ahead for a partial lifting of the embargo on gelatine and tallow. The
embargo is being relaxed gradually, insofar as strict conditions laid down
by law are respected. For its part, the United Kingdom has taken a whole
host of measures since 1988, including steps to keep specified beef offal
off the market.

Tallow is mainly used for making soaps. Among the other beef extracts that
can be used in the manufacture of cosmetic products, some, such as
gelatine, are taken from various cattle tissue (bones, skin etc.) and are
used in different types of products (shampoo, soap, hair care products).
Other derivatives are extracted from specific organs such as the placenta
or the thymus and are only used for making a very limited range of
cosmetic products. The Commission nonetheless recalled that:

- beef derivatives are not used in cosmetics in their natural state, but
first have to undergo various chemical treatments;

- in most cases, raw materials of animal origin only account for a very
small percentage of the make-up of the end cosmetic product.

Under the sixth amendment to Directive 93/35/EEC, the list of ingredients
that may be incorporated into cosmetics has to be given on the label of
the product. In the case of beef derivatives, listed in a
recently-published inventory of ingredients used in the manufacture of
cosmetics, the organ from which they are obtained will also be mentioned
if it is a clearly-defined organ such as the placenta or spleen.

BIOMEDECINE: YEW TREE YIELDS CANCER-FIGHTING PRODUCT

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

An Italian company based in Milan, Indena, has developed a new medicine
that can used to treat cancer - taxol - which is made from raw materials
derived from the yew tree. The raw materials are supplied by Bioagrico, a
company based in Beert-Pepingen in Belgium, which prunes and trims yew
trees (Taxus baccata) free of charge, recovers the leaves and branches and
packs them up for delivery to Italy where they are processed.

The yew tree, a conifer that is easily pruned, is well known in the
European countryside. It can also be deadly if just a few score or hundred
grammes are ingested. Horses and sheep are particularly at risk (they can
die only a few hours after eating just 200 grammes of yew tree leaves).
The yew tree's pine needles and berries are also highly toxic.

The basic substance used for making taxol is baccatin, a substance
extracted from yew tree pine needles and which can be used in treatments
against several different types of cancer. Some twenty years ago, it was
extracted from the bark, but this endangered the survival of the trees
themselves. The substance can also be extracted from pruning or clipping
waste. In Belgium, Bioagrico has been awarded a contract to supply yew
tree clippings up to the year 2007, unless in the meantime another, more
effective substance is found to combat cancer. Currently, Bioagrico prunes
yew trees owned by 4,200 private citizens, with each cropping bringing in
about 50 kilogrammes. In season, several teams are busy working at the
same time on private yew trees, while gardeners may also send their
cuttings to Bioagrico. The "harvest" is then dried before being dispatched
to Italy. The Belgium-based company prunes yew trees in all regions of the
country and is seeking to expand its expertise to other Member States of
the European Union.

PYRETHRINS: EU PROJECT SEEKS TO RE-CONQUER NATURAL INSECTICIDE MARKET

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

A non-food research project seeking to improve and develop cultivation of
pyrethrins (natural insecticides) in Mediterranean Europe has just
received the backing of the European Commission. Bringing together
agronomists, chemists and biologists from various Member States of the
European Union, this project is being coordinated by the French firm
Sanofi Chimie and will benefit from EU financial assistance to the tune of
ECU 1.231 million for three years. Known in Europe since antiquity, but
abandoned for the last few decades, pyrethrin growing could allow the
cultivation of up to 5,000 hectares of poor and arid soil in southern
Europe, thanks to this research project.

Australian offensive.

Natural pyrethrins were the first insecticides used by man. Known from
time immemorial, cultivation of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefoium, from which
they are extracted developed in Europe from the Middle Ages onwards and
were widely used until the appearance of the first synthetic insecticides
in the middle of the 20th century. Today, because of their total
harmlessness to man and domestic animals as well as their excellent
biodegradability, they remain the reference point as active materials in
the field of domestic use, body hygiene (anti-lice products), animal
health (for keeping insects out of livestock farm buildings) and
biological agriculture, etc... All these are fields where the consumer and
EU regulations encourage the use of "clean", rather than synthetic,
insecticides, preferably of "natural" origin.

Although use of natural pyrethrins is still significant and even
expanding, cultivation of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium historically
deserted Europe after the Second World War, shifting to Africa on a wide
scale (notably Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania). Today, these African
cultivations are threatened either because of the political instability of
the region, or because of inadequate productivity. An important market is
thus up for grabs. Europe, for its part, although a high user of these
natural insecticides (with 20% of the world market) is at the moment
lagging behind, for it is the Australians who are taking over from the
Africans and developing vast areas of mechanised cultivation in Tasmania.

If improved varieties similar to or better than those being grown in
Australia - and adapted, as in Tasmania to intensive, mechanised
cultivation - can be developed, a whole new market could no doubt be
re-conquered by European farmers, by growing a high added value crop that
is perfectly suited to fallow land and poor and arid land too.

The research project that has just got off the ground has the following
main aims:

- to study the action of natural pyrethrins, an especially the comparative
activity of the various active principles identified in the plant, as well
as the possibilities of biological synergies;

- to implement a genetic selection process designed to obtain varieties
with maximum active principle content

- to develop an optimised cultivation technique which is economically
adapted to European farms, notably through mechanisation.

More specifically, the project involves crop improvement work (evaluation
of germ plasma in the field, study of yield factors of the leaves,
isolation of different isomers, modes and sites of action of the different
isomers among insects), techniques such as interpolating cultivation and
hybridation, diseases, crop maintenance, climatisation and field
transfers, harvesting etc. and studies into the extraction/purification
process.

FARM PRODUCT PROMOTION: COMMISSION PLEASED WITH COMPANY POLICY

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Food product promotion campaigns sponsored or run by the European Union
have taken on much greater importance in recent years and have even
qualified to have their own unit within the European Commission in
Brussels Unveiling at the Paris food show in early October the promotion
campaign for grape juice contracted out to Sopexa (a French company for
promoting sales of farm and food products), Sergio Ventura, who runs the
Agricultural Product Promotion Unit of the Commission's
Directorate-General for Agriculture (DG VI), recalled that there had
originally been no general legal base for promotional measures financed by
the EU. However, some specific sectors had their own legal base allowing
EU-sponsored promotion campaigns for a few products like milk, textile
fibres, olive oil, etc.). Later on, the necessary legal foundations were
gradually laid to enable the use of Community funds for promoting other
products. And, from 1991 onwards, a specific division was created to
manage all the product promotion schemes. With the recent reorganisation
of DG VI's structure, the existence of the Promotion Unit has injected a
bit more coherence into this field of marketing.

Grape juice consumption boosted by 70%.

His trip to Paris gave Mr Ventura the chance to explain to Sopexa's
managers that there is still a wide variety of promotional actions,
ranging from direct actions 100% managed by the European Commission, which
puts out calls for tender via specialised public relations agencies, to
actions delegated to the Member States themselves. Even in this latter
case, the Commission is still responsible for ensuring the follow-up from
the conception stage to follow-on operations, including the choice of
agencies proposing to organise the promotional measures. And some are 100%
financed by the European Union, while other actions involve joint
participation in the costs by associations or producer groups benefiting
from the promotion campaigns.

Mr Ventura illustrated his explanation with the long-running grape juice
promotion campaign as an example. Launched in 1986 at a meagre cost of
only ECU 4.6 million to the farm budget of the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fun (EAGGF), the campaign has helped boost sales of
grape juice in France, Germany and Spain (Belgium and Italy had originally
taken part, but have since dropped out). In the case of France (which
accounts for 50% of EU production of grape juice), for example, the EU
funds are channelled through the national interprofessional wine office
Onivins, which in turn gives Sopexa a budget of eleven million French
Francs. The advantages of promoting consumption of grape juice are of
course linked to the high costs of intervention and distillation in the
table wine sector. Grape juice is also sold on a highly competitive
market, dominated traditionally by citrus fruit juices, but it has
benefited from the strong growth of the fruit juice market worldwide.

In terms of product image, the overall impact of the advertising and
promotional actions carried out in France over the last ten years has been
quite clear: grape juice has come to be seen in the eyes of consumers as a
more modern, more original and party-type drink, according to a market
research study undertaken last year. Moreover, grape juice could count on
the support of nutritionists, just as wine could draw on the support of
the medical world for the famous "French paradox" (namely that regular,
but moderate, consumption of wine can help avoid cardio-vascular
illnesses).

The numbers show very positive results too, points out the Commission. For
instance, consumption of grape juice in France has risen by nearly 70% in
the space of ten years, with household purchases rising from 220,000
hectolitres to 374,000 hl in 1995. On a fruit juice market which, last
year, began to see a slow-down in its growth rate (+11%), sales of grape
juice continued to expand strongly, both in volume terms (+16%) and in
value (+15%). This expansion was evident in all the main regions of
France: sales progressed in the West, the South East and the Paris region,
which all had previously recorded below-average consumption of grape
juice, while the North remained well above average. And two and a half
million more homes have been converted to grape juice since 1987 - an
increase of 60% in ten years (+12% for 1995 alone).

BEER: GREEN PAPER ON EXCLUSIVE PURCHASING AGREEMENTS IMMINENT

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Already a year late, the European Commission is expected to publish a
Green Paper on selective distribution and exclusive purchasing agreements
in the beer sector - authorised since 1967 under an exemption to Community
competition rules - but probably not until the end of this year or the
beginning of next. EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert is
considering extending until 1999 block exemption Regulations based on
Article 85.3 of the EU Treaty for beer sector agreements. The Commission
said on October 16 that the proposal was to avoid a "legal vacuum" that
may occur if the block exemptions from EU competition rules were to expire
before the consultations on the Commission's Green Paper for their
replacement had been concluded. Requested by Member of the European
Parliament David Thomas (PES, UK) to comment on consultations with beer
producers and distributors, the Commission indicated that no formal
meetings had as yet taken place.

The first derogation to the general ban on agreements laid down by the
Treaty of Rome dates back to 1967 (Regulation 1967/67). This regime was
extended for 15 years in 1983 by virtue of two separate block exemption
Regulations, one covering selective distributions (1983/83), the other
exclusive purchasing (1984/83). The latter text, general in scope,
required more specific provisions for particular sectors, including
brewing, and notably the British beer industry, where the breweries hold
beer-supply contacts with pubs owned by them. The Regulations now cover
tens of thousands of agreements by which a supplier, on the one hand,
appoints a reseller as his exclusive distributor in a given area
(Regulation 1983/83), and on the other hand, a reseller agrees to buy all
his products from one supplier only (Regulation 1984/83).

At the time of their adoption, the Commission was acting on the assumption
that exclusive purchasing contracts in this sector required a major
investment by the supplier and a long-term commitment by the seller and
therefore justified exclusive contracts. The Commission therefore decided
to make special allowances for beer-sector agreements. The maximum length
of an exclusive contract was set at five years for beer and other drinks
and from five to ten years for beer exclusively. Specific clauses covered
situations where the supplier and seller had also signed a lease for
points of sale. It was agreed that the length of the purchasing contract
could correspond to that of the lease, even if the latter was for a period
of more than ten years.

The British way of life.

Under pressure from the breweries, British MEPs have visited Brussels to
ask Mr Van Miert for an extension of the exemptions for a minimum of 15
years. An EU source said the Commissioner was not unsympathetic to the
legal uncertainty for breweries caused by the possible review of the
exemptions, and that he had also understood the "tied tenancy" pub-supply
agreements were "part of the British way of life". The Commissioner has
also been lobbied hard by British all-party MEPs who are strongly in
support of an extension to the exemptions. One solution which may be put
forward in the Green Paper would be to carry on with sectorial block
exemptions. Another would be to base exemptions on the market share of the
company operating the restrictive agreements. In the meantime, when Mr Van
Miert makes a formal proposal for the extension of the rules, his decision
must be approved by the full team of Commissioners.

Threat to "real ale"?

Meanwhile, a meeting in Brussels on October 11 between Commission
officials and the European brewers' lobby group, the Confederation des
Brasseurs du Marche Commun, failed to make much progress towards solving a
dispute over tied tenancy rules allowing pubs tied to national brewers to
sell a beer from another, i.e. foreign, brewer only if it has been
produced by traditional "real ale"-making methods. The Commission is
worried that this discriminates against beer imported from other EU
countries, where beer is rarely cask-conditioned. But the UK is now
threatening to drop the "guest beer" provision altogether if it is forced
under Community law to include continental European lagers in the
definition of a "guest beer".

SPIRITS: RUSSIAN AND CHILEAN "PROTECTIONISM" CRITICISED

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

New Russian plans to limit vodka and ethyl alcohol imports from the
beginning of 1997 have sent a tremor through Brussels. The hangover from
the measures announced by Moscow could mean a serious drop in EU sales in
1997 - 50 million litres instead of the 200 million litres exported in
1995. EU officials thought they were seeing double when they learnt of
these new Russian plans, since negotiations were in theory still under way
on current limits on vodka imports following Commissioner van den Broek's
trip to Russia in March. There is no justification for introducing new
unilateral safeguard measures, the Commission said on October 9. The
threat to outlets in Russia is not the only thing worrying EU spirits
producers, who are still voicing loud complaints about discriminatory
taxes applied to alcoholic drinks in Chile.

Russian unilateralism.

Negotiations on a possible ceiling for EU (and Belgian, in particular)
exports of vodka to Russia started back in March following a visit by EU
External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek. Following the Russian
announcement of import restrictions, the Commission said that, until it
had received more information, consultations would continue between EU and
Russian negotiators in the framework of the Interim trade Agreement
between the two sides, which came into force on February 1, 1996. The
Commission reckons that imports of ethyl alcohol in 1995 and 1996 did not
harm Russian domestic interests at all and thus there was no justification
for the unilateral introduction of safeguard measures. Besides, protective
measures of this kind go against the letter and the spirit of the Interim
Agreement. Brussels has now asked the Russian authorities to continue
consultations on the issue and - pending their outcome - to suspend the
safeguard measures.

This is not the first time the EU has had to remind the Russians of their
obligations under the Interim Agreement. Under a unilateral trade rule
imposed by the Russian authorities on March 13, EU exporters of vodka were
required to sell into Russia at a minimum price of USD8.2 per litre,
putting them at an obvious competitive disadvantage to vodka exporters in
the Commonwealth of Independent States, who are subject to a minimum price
of USD3.8 per litre. The new rule not only hit EU vodka suppliers and
their estimated ECU 200 million trade with Russia; it also dealt another
blow to EU confidence in the reliability of the Russian signatures on the
trade pact with the EU.

In 1994, the EU Member States exported ECU 266 million worth of alcoholic
drinks to Russia (including ECU 167 million worth of vodka). This figure
was almost reached in the first eight months of 1995, when EU sales of
alcohol to Russia were worth ECU 240 million (including 150 million
generated from vodka sales).

Discriminatory Chilean taxes.

Having seen their long-running campaign against Japan's alcohol taxes
vindicated in the World Trade Organisation, European spirit producers are
now turning their attention to Chile's taxes which, they say, discriminate
against foreign spirit imports. The Confederation of European Spirits
Producers (CEPS) welcomed the recent decision by the WTO's Appellate Body
to uphold an earlier ruling by the Dispute Settlement Body, that Japan's
tax regime discriminated against foreign imports. But CEPS President
Christian Delclaux warned on October 8 that similar rules were being
planned in Chile. "Given the WTO ruling, we are amazed at reports that the
Chilean administration is now proposing to submit GATT-inconsistent
legislation to the Congress", he said.

Mr Delclaux says although the new proposals address Chile's current
discrimination, they would still maintain differences in taxes.
"Maintaining such a wide variation in the levels of taxation is
discriminatory - and the WTO has just affirmed this fact", he pointed out.
"If Chile believes this is an acceptable solution, it is sadly mistaken.
Indeed, I am certain that if producers and exporters of Chilean wines were
treated in a similar discriminatory manner in, for example, the United
Kingdom - their second largest export market - they would feel likewise."

Chile - and, to a certain extent, South Korea - the alcohol tax regime
bears remarkable similarities to that of Japan. Under current Chilean law,
whisky is taxed at a rate of 70% ad valorem at wholesale. Other spirits
are taxed at 30%, while pisco, the country's top selling local brew, is
taxed at 25%. Mr Delclaux says that the current differentials should be
removed by applying a uniform tax rate, based on alcohol content, for all
spirits.

EU producers set out trade objectives

European spirits producers have meanwhile welcomed EU External Relations
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan's support for their tariff and other
objectives for the WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore in December and
the subsequent work programme. Much of what the European spirits industry
is seeking is very close to the Commissioner's own thinking for Singapore
and the WTO's work in coming years, according to the CEPS. Sir Leon has
also said the Commission will continue to work closely with the industry
to promote the shared objective of improving market access for European
exporters throughout the world. "Given that the value of EU spirits
exports to markets outside Europe totals nearly 4,000 million ECU, the
Commissioner's personal endorsement of our WTO objectives, especially
improved market access for distilled spirits in world markets, is most
welcome", said CEPS President Christian Delclaux on October 17.

CEPS is urging the Commission to help secure at the Singapore Ministerial
"substantial reductions" in the import tariffs applied to distilled
spirits beyond those agreed in the Uruguay Round in 1994. This includes
expansion of the 'zero for zero' import tariff phasing-out arrangements
for brown spirits, e.g. Cognac and Scotch Whisky (agreed by the EU,
Canada, Japan and the United States) to encompass all spirits and liqueurs
and extension of the arrangements to other WTO signatories.

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The European Commission has signed a contract for a study of the
food-products market in Korea with a French company, Sofres S.A. and its
subsidiary in Seoul. Of the thirteen firms that offered their services in
reply to the Commission's call for tenders, the Directorate-General for
External Relations (Commercial Policy and Relations with North America,
the Far East, Australia and New Zealand, Unit China, Korea, Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan) selected the French firm on the basis of a number of
criteria such as the fee proposed for the study, professional
qualifications and experience of the personnel, the number of people
working on the market study etc. Sofres S.A. will receive ECU 125,345
(excluding travel and subsistence expenses) for carrying out the market
study covering a number of sectors of the food products market in the
Republic of Korea.

EXTRACTION SOLVENTS: COMMISSION PROPOSED TO UPDATE 1988 DIRECTIVE

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

To take account of scientific and technical progress, the European
Commission is proposing to amend for the third time Directive 88/344/EEC
on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on extraction
solvents used in the production of foodstuffs and food ingredients. The
proposed changes concern mainly the use of certain solvents, their
conditions of use and maximum residue limits in food. The European
Parliament has just given its stamp of approval to the proposal during its
October 23 plenary session in Strasbourg.

According to the draft Directive, the Annex to Directive 88/344/EEC would
be amended as follows:

In Part I, the substance butyl acetate is deleted (as it is no longer used
in agri-industry).

In Part II:

The entry for hexane is modified.

In Part III, the substance methyl-propanol-1 is deleted and in its place
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is added with a maximum residue limit of 0.02
mg/kg in the foodstuff due to the use of extraction solvents in the
preparation of flavourings from natural flavouring materials.

The Member States must amend their laws, regulations and administrative
provisions so as to authorise trade in products complying with this
Directive by July 1, 1997 at the latest, and must ban trade in products
not complying with this Directive from January 1, 1998 onwards.

INWARD PROCESSING: COOPERATIVES OPPOSE EU COMMISSION PROPOSAL

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

French agricultural cooperatives - whether involved in upstream farm
production or downstream in the agri-food processing industry - are up in
arms about a draft proposal from the European Commission that seeks to
amend arrangements for access to international trade. The cooperatives are
particularly critical of the proposed changes to the inward processing
regime which attracts a wide range of agricultural products. The draft has
also been given a cautious welcome by European agri-food industry
specialists. But there may be room for improvement as, according to some
sources, it appears that the future rules for the system of inward
processing traffic have not yet been finalised within the Commission's
Directorate-General XXI (Customs and Indirect Taxation).

The inward processing regime is a system that enables goods to be imported
into EU customs territory for processing - without having to pay customs
duties. The only condition required of these goods is that they are
immediately re-exported outside the EU after processing, other wise they
will be liable for normal customs duties. In their position paper, the
French farm cooperatives, who are supported in their quest by cooperatives
in other EU Member States, reckon that this system cannot provide an
adequate response to the new, liberal regime ushered in by the GATT
Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and can only be regarded as an
exceptional regime.

Widening its scope, say the cooperatives, would "not be compatible with
global respect for  Community preference". Not can it provide an
alternative to the traditional, unsatisfactory, policy of export
restitutions.

They also feel the Commission's draft proposal will risk encouraging
production of agricultural raw materials to move elsewhere: since the
"substitutability" of foodstuffs cannot rely solely on volume and price
equivalents. The farmers say what is needed is a "material yield"
equivalent, enabling a qualitative differentiation to be made on the basis
of raw material accounting. The processing stage between import and export
of a food product must be visible through the use of two different customs
tariffs, one on the way in and one on the way out. The French cooperatives
reckon that the proposed reform goes against the policy guidelines
requested by the farming industry itself.

The European Commission's draft proposal assumes that the GATT Agreement
on Agriculture has restored world market prices for agricultural products
to normal. But this hypothesis, according to the cooperatives, needs to be
given more in-depth consideration because there is still considerable
speculation son markets that are supposed to be better governed nowadays.
To sum up, the French farm cooperatives really want to see a simpler,
clearer and less expensive system. Above all, they cite the principle of
acceleration and greater transparency of the system, the need for faster
clearance of the backlog of requests for licences and recourse to
computerised means of transmission.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR RURAL CHARTER

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The EU's Common Agricultural Policy should be subsumed under a wider
European rural policy which will include objectives such as help to rural
communities and other measures which are complementary to agricultural
policy goals. This idea is part of a report from Irish MEP Liam Hyland
officially adopted by a plenary session of the European Parliament in
Strasbourg on October 25. Mr Hyland's report argues that sensible use of
the rural environment is the basis for all good spatial and resource

planning and calls for an EU "Rural Charter" to be drawn up forthwith.

Enlargement of EU "rural" areas.

Mr Hyland points out that following the accession of Sweden, Finland and
Austria approximately one quarter of the Union's population now live in
rural communities, and that rural areas account for almost 85% of the
surface area of the European Union. As the European Union expands over the
next decade to take in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, whose
farming conditions are very different, it "makes sense to review the
present arrangements, and to adapt and amplify them where necessary with a
view to achieving a strengthened and mutually consistent body of measures
which allows the mobilisation of a maximum of synergies and leads
progressively to an integrated rural policy," says the European
Commission's November 1995 White Paper on "Future Strategies for the CAP".

However, Mr Hyland points out that there is not even a definition of the
word "rural" on which all Member States agree. A number of Member States
use a population threshold (France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Germany)
although the population threshold used differs. Other countries use a
planning-based approach (Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and the
United Kingdom). The OECD uses a definition based on a population of less
than 150 per km2; Eurostat uses 100 inhabitants per km2. The proposed
Council of Europe Charter avoids using a precise figure, defining an area
of the countryside as rural when the "main part" is used for agriculture,
forestry, aquaculture and fisheries, for the economic and cultural
activities of country-dwellers, for non-urban recreation and leisure and
for other purposes such as housing. Mr Hyland wants a single clear
definition agreed that can be used in all discussions on rural affairs.

The problems of rural areas.

In the Commission paper on "The Future of Rural Society", problems of
rural areas are analysed under three categories:

- areas "suffering from the pressures of modern life", near towns and
cities in areas of heavy population, particularly in the centre-north of
the Community and in many coastal regions.

- areas suffering from "rural decline", such as several regions in Greece,
the Mezzogiorno, inland Spain and Portugal, and the island of Ireland.
Here agriculture is still important but farms are often so small that they
can barely provide a living for one person and the absence of alternative
employment lead to a drift from the land, especially among the young.

-"remote areas", e.g. mountain regions

Mr Hyland identifies two common misconceptions. Although there are some
parts of the EU where rural areas have been abandoned and depopulated,
this is not universal. The decline in numbers of farmers during the 1970s
and 1980s is often cited as an important effect on rural areas, but this
decline has been replaced in very many parts of the Community with an
inflow of population from elsewhere. Nevertheless, the "drift from the
land" persists in Greece, Ireland, some parts of Italy, Spain and Portugal
and in some areas of France, the Scottish Highlands, many islands, higher
parts of the Alps and Pyrenees, the Massif Central, the West of Ireland,
and some mountain areas in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The
rapporteur also sees the need for a fourth category since the accession of
the Member States having Nordic regions, which are characterised by a very
low population density.

Secondly, contrary to general belief, overall unemployment in the rural
areas of the Community is not greater than in urban areas, and
unemployment for males is generally lower in rural areas. Within this
overall picture, however, there are sharp differences. Rural unemployment
is largely a matter of agricultural under-employment: the Commission
estimates that almost one third of all farmers in the Community are
underemployed - i.e. they work less than 50% of a normal working year on
their farm and have no other gainful employment. However, the problem of
female unemployment in rural areas is one which warrants special
attention. Precise EU data on this is not currently available, a point
which the Commission ought to remedy soon, reckons Liam Hyland.

The Community role.

The share of the Structural Fund budget for 1989-1993 devoted to rural
development will double from the present approximately 15 billion ECU to
approximately 30 billion ECU in 1994-1999.

The rapporteur believes we cannot simply establish a rural policy in the
way we have established agricultural policy - dealing with specific
market, with specific mechanisms, and finance. This is true partly due to
the the principle of subsidiarity - it is the Member States who currently
propose programmes to the Commission, which are then negotiated in
partnership to establish broad framework policies and objectives, and
which the Community co-finances (50% in most cases, 65% in Objective 1
cases). National and regional authorities have primary responsibility for
dealing with rural affairs through their policies on land, taxation,
development, training, administration etc. "Community action can only be
part of the total, and, being realistic, only a small part", says Liam
Hyland. However, the rapporteur believes the development of an integrated
rural policy, based on the principles of a European Rural Charter, will
enable the "rural dimension" to be taken into consideration in the
elaboration of these various policies, both nationally and at EU level,
which is not the case at the moment.

Principles of Rural Development.

Rural development must enshrine the right of all sectors of rural society
to participate in economic activity, stresses the report, setting out five
central areas of policy concern which have to be addressed; it is the
combination of these actions that will lead toward the principal objective
of maintaining viable rural communities, which in turn depends on tackling
the most fundamental problem of rural areas, which is unemployment, says
Liam Hyland. The five areas are:

Agricultural adjustment to new world trends - increasing world competition
and increasing mobility of capital and labour- by continuing to adapt
agriculture to the needs of the market place, while investing in new
developments such as planned forestry, organic production and the creation
of non-food energy sources. Farmers should also be encouraged to maintain
an attractive, diverse and ecologically rich rural environment, which
includes organic production. Such support should facilitate land mobility
through schemes for young farmers.

Industry and enterprise. Growth in rural employment will not come from
agriculture alone, or from forestry, but will be replaced by the growth of
alternative economic sectors such as tourism or development based on new
technologies and telecommunication, in which the rural areas will provide
advantages over urban areas for the development of service industries.

Environmental sustainability and cultural preservation. Farmers have an
important role as guardians of the countryside, and that as such they
ought to be paid for that role. We have to secure and sustain a
countryside which is clean, attractive and rich in wildlife, historical
features, preserving the rich traditions of culture built up over
thousands of years, while developing recreational opportunities, says the
report.

Rural communities. One of the most important issues for rural communities
is the shortage of rural housing. One of the problems in this respect has
been the environment: any approach to develop new land for building is
often resisted on environmental grounds. Local authorities must have a
positive housing programme for rural areas, which should include the
upgrading and preservation of existing housing stock.

Planning and land use. It is important to overcome the popular belief that
the countryside is under constant threat, because this leads to the '`no
development" ethic that is damaging to rural economies and rural
societies, says Liam Hyland. What is needed is a land use policy which is
tailored to specific areas and needs, and which allows for the proper
integrated use of land for agriculture, forestry, leisure, tourism,
industrial development and housing. It is better to consider the use of
good quality land for development where it might have greater economic or
amenity use than as setaside land on which nothing is done, environmental
degradation takes place, and costs increase yearly, stresses the
rapporteur.

COMMISSION PROPOSES TO ALLOW MORE WAXES FOR USE ON FRUIT

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Under pressure from the fruit trade, represented by the European Union of
the Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale, Import and Export Trade (EUCOFEL), the
European Commission has proposed to allow three more waxes to be used on
fruit in the EU. The proposal to extend the list of waxes allowed for use
on fruit forms part of a proposal for a European Parliament and Council
Directive to amend the basic Directive on food additives other than
colours and sweeteners that the Commission tabled earlier this Autumn.
According to the new proposal, the following waxes will be allowed for
surface treatment only on fresh avocados, mangoes, papayas and melons:

E905 Microcrystalline wax (maximum level permitted: 140 mg/kg)

E912 Montanic acid esters: (quantum satis*)

E914 O oxidized polyethylene wax: (quantum satis)

The proposal has been sent to the European Parliament and the Council of
Ministers for approval, but the legislative process may take months, if
not years.

* The quantum satis principle means that no maximum level is specified,
but additives, such as waxes, may be used in accordance with good
manufacturing practice, at a level not higher than is necessary to achieve
the intended purpose and provided that the consumer is not misled.

EU MAKES NEW ATTEMPT TO LEGISLATE ON FOOD IRRADIATION

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

After the failed attempts by successive Council Presidencies in the late
1980s, early 1990s to get a Community Directive on irradiation of
foodstuffs adopted, mainly because of strong opposition from Germany and
Luxembourg to the very principle, the European Commission is having
another go now. It recently sent the Council of Ministers two draft
Directives which it hopes the Irish Presidency can steer through the
legislative process.

The first proposal is for a general framework Directive laying down
general rules on the conditions applicable to food irradiation, and the
second is an implementing Directive, establishing a positive list of
foodstuffs for which irradiation would be authorised throughout the EU.

If the Council adopts the proposals, Member States would no longer be able
to ban the marketing of irradiated foodstuffs, if these meet the
requirements laid down in the framework Directive. So far, the proposal
only allows irradiation for herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings. On
this point, the Commission is treading cautiously after its earlier
proposals for a much wider range of food products were watered down to
cover only herbs and spices. International organisations like the UN Food
and Agriculture Organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency and
the World Health Organisation have issued a number of studies and
statements showing no risk to human health from correct use of irradiation
techniques.

On the whole, Member States seem to accept this new approach, according to
trade sources, but differences of opinion remain as regards the need for
labelling of irradiated foodstuffs, and the need to continue national
authorisations to irradiate certain types of food.

The draft framework Directive says that irradiation may only be authorised
when there is a clear benefit for the consumer. Moreover, it stresses that
labelling to inform the customer that irradiation treatment has been used
is necessary in almost all cases.

DAIRY POLICY: MEMBER STATES' "INCOMPATIBLE OBJECTIVES" FOR MILK SECTOR

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Some EU Member States want to cut back dairy quotas in order to maintain
prices, some would be happy to see Community prices fall to world levels,
accompanied by an across-the-board increase in production quotas to
maintain income, others are clamouring for milk production rights to be
"more fairly" redistributed, a few countries place the emphasis on
expanding exports to the world market, while others again are more
interested in social protection for their dairy farmers. This is the
situation facing European Commission sector experts as they wrestle with
draft proposals designed to take the Community milk industry into the next
century. The proposals, which will seek to define options for an EU
strategy towards the world trade talks at the turn of the century to
continue the reforms agreed under the GATT Uruguay Round, is due to be
tabled by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler in the early part of 1997.
Recent discussions within the Council's Special Committee on Agriculture
indicate however that progress on the dossier may not be swift.

Trade liberalism and East Europe.

EU dairy production is destined to be one of the next farm sectors to
undergo upheavals as part of the continuing reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP). The Netherlands, which takes over the rotating
EU Council Presidency on January 1, has announced its intention of
addressing the subject at the informal Farm Council in May 1997. The next
round of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) are likely to have a more radical impact on farm
trade liberalisation than the ones concluded under the GATT Uruguay Round
in 1994 and not just because they are largely intended to continue the
reform process begun with the GATT Agreement on Agriculture. Not only is
the free market philosophy gaining strength around the world, but radical
solutions may have to be found if the emerging economies of the Central
and East European countries (CEECs) are to be incorporated into the
European Union and the international trade scene in general.

EU the world's N #  1.

The European Union currently has around 21 million head of dairy cattle,
producing some 110 million tonnes of milk annually, out of a world total
fluctuating around 520 million tonnes. EU exporters hold more than 40% of
the world market, way ahead of nearest rivals New Zealand (16%) and
Australia (9%). The Community sets an annual intervention price at which
public authorities are obliged to buy in milk and butter of the required
quality, and also pays export refunds to bridge the gap between EU and
world prices.

Prices set to fall.

Under the GATT Agreement on Agriculture, which brought the farm sector
into the international trade framework for the first time, the initial
tariff levels designed to replace trade barriers were set so high that the
mandatory phased reductions are currently having little effect on the
market. However, further tariff cuts would almost certainly force producer
prices down. A report drawn up by Professor S.J Sheehy of University
College Dublin* sees prices falling by as much as 5% per year towards
2010, whether or not the EU decides to maintain its production quota
system. The report assumes the EU will make arrangements to compensate
farmers for the drop in income they will suffer in the early part of the
21st century, as was the case following the "MacSharry" reform of the CAP
in 1992. Under the GATT Agreement, direct income payments to farmers are
exempt from the obligation to reduce aggregate levels of support, and the
Community will come under increasing pressure from the US and other
trading partners to further decouple aid payments from prices.

The main options.

Professor Sheehy argues it will be impossible to maintain both the present
quota system, whereby each Member State is allocated a maximum quantity of
milk it may produce, alongside the high prices the EU has been at pains to
maintain through its aid and intervention scheme. If tariffs are cut
further, prices are certain to fall. A "fortress Europe" approach,
rejecting international calls for reduced tariffs but agreeing to trim
export subsidies instead, would imply buying back some 10% of farmers'
production rights to bring supply and demand into balance, says the report.

CEEC accession.

However, this approach would pose serious questions for the integration of
the CEEC candidates into the European Union. Maintaining quotas while
allowing prices to gravitate downwards towards international market levels
might solve this problem, provided a long-enough transition period for
CEEC accession is agreed, reckons the Irish Professor. A more radical
option would be to abolish quotas altogether ahead of, or just after, the
next WTO accord. In the short term, this would place an enormous burden on
the EU farm budget, as dairy producers would have to be compensated for
sharply-falling prices, but it would quickly align Community production
with the world market, and have the advantage that the thorny question of
quota allocation and compensation payments to the new CEEC Member States
would not arise.

The Sheehy report has brought plaudits from free-trade supporters Denmark,
Sweden and the UK, who welcome the chance to view the EU dairy regime in
the wider context of world trade. However, a majority of the Member States
feel that the quota system should be determined in the light of the
Community's internal policy aims, rather than merely commercial aspects.
The French in particular have described the document as "too biased
towards trade liberalisation". France is the EU's second largest dairy
producer, with a guaranteed quantity around 24 million tonnes of milk a
year.

Quotas needed to preserve farming?

Germany, the EU's leading dairy producer, Austria, Portugal and
Luxembourg, believe the quota system is the only sensible way of limiting
production and stabilising the market, and should be extended beyond the
deadline of 2001. Bonn would like to see a 5% cut in quotas to firm up
prices, while Vienna argues that farming would die out in some mountainous
and other less-favoured regions without a structured system of dairy
production. Portugal would reluctantly accept quota cuts as a necessary
evil to maintain prices.

Dual pricing system.

Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands are unconvinced of the need to act
urgently. They believe gradual price cuts towards world levels in the
medium term will obviate any potential problems with CEEC accession, and
that there is no need to abolish quotas. Meanwhile the French are pressing
the case for a dual pricing system to balance the internal and external
needs of the Community, and the Danes, who reluctantly admit that
abolishing quotas may be politically unfeasible, have suggested the
introduction of "A" and "B" quotas along the lines of the sugar regime
(see separate article on sugar). "B" quota milk could be exported without
refunds, they argue, without the risk of forcing down world prices.

Export vocation vital.

In spite of their conflicting views on practical strategies, France,
Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark all agree on one basic point: it is
vital that EU dairymen are able to go on exporting to the world
marketplace. The Irish and Dutch also back the UK view that compensation
paid to farmers should be granted on the basis of uniform economic
criteria. They argue that other Community objectives such as help for
small farmers, young farmers, less-favoured areas, etc ought to be dealt
with through separate instruments. Member States opposed to this hard
stance reckon that some modulation should be envisaged in order to target
support where it is most needed. A senior Commission official tasked with
the dossier lamented recently that so far the debate had done no more than
reveal the Member States' "incompatible objectives".

UK MEAT PLANT THROUGHPUT DIPS 7% IN FIRST 8 MONTHS OF 1996

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

During the first eight months of 1996, meat plant throughput in the United
Kingdom declined by 7% on corresponding 1995 levels to just under 22
million head, according to the Irish Food Board's Market Monitor bulletin.
Cattle throughput was 32% lower than last year at 1.5 million head. Sheep
supplies at 11.2 million head were 6% lower while pig throughput declined
by 3% to 9.3 million head.

Steer throughput up to the end of August was 28% lower than last year at
569,000 head. Heifer supplies declined by 25% while cow throughput was 64%
lower at 186,000 head. The reason for this decline is that since April an
average of 30,000 cattle per week have been removed from the food chain
through the over-30-month culling programme to help combat "mad cow
disease" (BSE). Young bull throughput over the period increased by 3% on
1995 levels to 269,000 head.

Lamb throughput up to the end of August at 9.7 million head was 6% below
corresponding 1995 levels. Cull ewe supplies declined by 5% to 1.5 million
head, according to the Irish Food Board, An Bord Bia.

Supplies of fattening pigs were 3% lower during the first eight months of
1996 at 9.1 million head. Sow throughput over the period fell by 11% to
total 216,000 head.

SAUDI ARABIA RE-OPENS FOR IRISH BEEF

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The Saudi Arabian Ministry for Foreign Affairs has announced that it is
lifting its temporary ban on imports from Ireland of frozen and chilled
beef and veal, milk and milk products from cattle, beef gelatine, food
products containing milk and gelatine products derived from cattle and
bovine products used in veterinary and medical preparations, cosmetics and
drugs. All these products neverthelss have to be accompanied by a
certificate stating they are BSE free.

These products are allowed entry to Saudi Arabia through the ports of the
Netherlands and Belgium, on condition that they stay on the same vessel
for the duration of the journey and are not unloaded in other ports which
they may pass through.

The Saudis have also agreed to lift the ban on imports from Switzerland
and France for the same products.

MAD COW DISEASE: MIXED SIGNALS FROM COMMISSION ON "PROVEN" BSE/CJD LINK

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The European Commission sent out mixed signals on October 24 to news that
UK scientists may have proved a direct link between bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) and a new variant of the human brain condition
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (dubbed by experts "vCJD"). Speaking at a press
conference in Paris, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said he thought
in the light of the new findings, the European Union ought to bring in
stricter legislation on consumption of animal offal, and stressed that the
UK authorities should now proceed with the planned targeted cull of some
150,000 cattle, suspended by the Major Government in mid-September.
Meanwhile back in Brussels, a Fischler aide spoke of both positive and
negative aspects of the scientific discovery. The negative side, he said,
was the obvious public health risk, now shown to be very real, that eaters
of infected beef tissue may have contracted brain disease. The positive
element consisted in the fact that the new discovery would make it easier
to trace animals incubating the disease, he stressed.

BSE and vCJD prions "match".

The British scientific journal Nature carried a report on October 23 of a
new technique developed by Dr John Collinge and his colleagues in the
Prion disease Group at Imperial College School of Medicine, London, for
tracing the "molecular marker" of the prion protein which causes the brain
tissue of sufferers to degenerate into a spongy mass. "The biochemical
signature of prions in patients who died from new variant CJD matches that
of prions in mice and macaque monkeys experimentally infected with BSE,
but differs from that of prions in human patients with acquired or
sporadic CJD", says the Nature report. This finding "greatly strengthens
the conclusion that vCJD is a consequence of the BSE epidemic in British
cattle", it goes on. The new technique is likely to form the basis of a
rapid diagnostic test for spongiform encephalopathies, say the experts.

Further safety precautions?

Reacting to the news, a European Commission spokesman stressed that the EU
executive had been proceeding on the assumption of a BSE/CJD link for some
time and that all necessary measures to protect the public were already in
place. The new study would go to the EU scientific committees for
examination, and any necessary new proposals would be made on the basis of
their recommendations, the spokesman explained. However, from Paris, Franz
Fischler indicated to the press that he would be re-tabling to the Farm
Council on October 28 proposals to completely exclude from the food chain
those cattle and sheep tissues found most likely to transmit the BSE agent.

Harmonisation needed.

The legal situation regarding use of brain, eyes, spinal cord, nervous
tissues, spleen and lymph glands (shown to be capable of transmitting the
fatal prions) from cattle and sheep varies across the European Union. The
only EU-wide statute on the subject relates to UK bovine tissues, which
are banned from export. Also, ruminant waste may not be fed to cattle and
sheep, but does constitute an important ingredient in the meat and bone
meal still fed to pigs, chickens and other farm animals. The French
authorities paved the way towards tighter rules in June, when they banned
from both human foodstuffs and all animal feeds the tissues in question,
from cattle aged over 6 months and sheep and goats aged over one year.
Ireland and the UK have brought in similar regulations. Mr Fischler
believes Member States' rules should now be harmonised on the French
model. However, a proposal to that effect he tabled to the Council in July
met with little enthusiasm from the EU Standing Veterinary Committee.

The French Agriculture Ministry gave a favourable reaction on October 25
to an announcement by the Bonn authorities of a new national legislative
Bill that would, in line with French law, ban all imports from France of
the sensitive tissues. The Ministry welcomed the move, as likely to foster
EU-wide harmonisation of measures. The German Government has since July
maintained a unilateral ban on all products containing beef tissues from
the UK and Switzerland, the two main centres of the BSE epidemic in Europe.

Confusion over "regional approach".

Meanwhile confusing messages emerged from Luxembourg on October 28
regarding the UK's strategy for eradicating BSE and ending the embargo on
British beef products. UK Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg, in town for
the EU Farm Council, told the press corps he was not pressing for a
regional approach to lifting the ban, but would be trying to make progress
towards resumption of beef exports "from certified herds". These would be
pedigree grass-fed herds whose owners can prove they have never used the
suspect mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM) blamed for spreading the
disease to feed their livestock.

However, the presence of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth in the UK
delegation sent out a different signal. Both Scotland and the UK province
of Northern Ireland have a large number of such herds. Earlier, the Farm
Council President-in-Office Ivan Yates told the press corps that a
regional proposal "could be considered", provided the agreed targeted cull
of cattle most at risk from BSE were implemented in that region. "A
special case can be made for Northen Ireland because of their animal
identification system and that they are surrounded by water", said the
Irish Agriculture Minister. However, Douglas Hogg rejected the idea of
destroying cattle from herds already certified free of mad cow disease as
"irrelevant".

The implicit rejection of Mr Yates' support may be for UK domestic
consumption rather than for Mr Hogg's EU partners. Indeed the UK
authorities now appear to have given up hope of having the export embargo
- imposed on March 27 after the risk of human beings contracting
spongiform brain disease from BSE-infected cattle tissues came to light -
lifted for the whole of the country in the near future. The Major
Government decided in mid-September to suspend the selective cattle cull,
agreed as part of the "Florence framework" for gradually ending the ban,
and has now changed strategy in favour of the "certified herds" approach.

French MBM figures "correct".

However, the Irish Farm Minister was able to offer some relief to
Pierre-Mathieu Duhamel, the beleaguered Director of the French Customs
Service. Mr Duhamel's team has been widely accused in the French press of
laxity in tracing potentially infected MBM imported from the UK between
1993 and 1995 and fraudulently labelled as of Irish origin. Ivan Yates
confirmed on October 21 that the French figure of 59,873 tonnes for Irish
MBM exports to France during the period in question now appeared to be
"accurate". Dublin had originally declared a figure of just 25,815 tonnes,
leading to French fears that large quantities of suspect MBM had entered
the country illegally. The discrepancy appears to have arisen because
UK-based brokers continued to ship to France consignments of MBM which
they had purchased in Ireland, Mr Yates explained.

BEEF CRISIS: MINISTERS URGED TO SWALLOW THE MEDICINE

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

As Agri-Service International went to press in the afternoon of October
30, EU Farm Ministers meeting in Council in Luxembourg were well into
their third day of talks on proposed support and restructuring measures
for the beleaguered beef sector. A second compromise paper tabled by the
Irish Presidency to take account of the more strident objections from the
Member States delegations had secured the backing of EU Agriculture
Commissioner Franz Fischler, and Ministers were being urged by both
Presidency and Commission to swallow unpalatable measures in order to
finalise a deal. Among the most significant changes being proposed to the
original Commission document, the new draft includes a commitment to find
ECU 500 million for short-term support for farmers, an option for Member
States to encourage early marketing of both male and female beef cattle
instead of destroying them at birth, and a call for restrictions on import
of calves from Eastern Europe. However deciding on the ratio for
distribution of aid top-ups among the Member States remained the biggest
stumbling block to agreement.

The Fischler beef package.

A package of three linked proposals tabled by Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler on July 30 calls for reductions in arable aid payments and cuts
in investment support to pay for higher beef intervention buying and other
short-term measures designed to absorb surplus EU beef production,
estimated at 1.2 million tonnes per year since consumption has fallen in
the wake of the "mad cow" crisis. Parliament used its urgency procedure to
vote an Opinion on the first part of the package - the purely beef sector
measures - on September 20, but refused to do the same for the
controversial arable aid cuts. The Commissioner has always expressed
reluctance to see the three elements split up. If measures costing over
ECU1 billion are to be agreed, then the Ministers should decide at the
same time where the money is coming from, insisted a Fischler aide.
However, a majority of Member States are in any case against the proposed
arable cuts.

Emergency measures already taken.

In fact, going into Council, Franz Fischler had already given away an
important bargaining chip in agreeing to raise the Community beef
intervention ceiling from 400,000 to 460,000 tonnes for 1996, and endorse
public buying-in of lighter cattle ("weanlings") under 300 kilogrammes in
weight. These decisions, voted through on a Commission proposal by
Ministers at the Fisheries Council on October 14, took some of the urgency
out of the issue, and the Member States' delegations were more inclined to
hold out for better terms for their farmers in the overall package. The
more intensive farming countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium are opposed to moves to lower the regional stocking ceilings used
for calculating eligibility for special beef premium payments to farmers
and reduce the stocking levels for eligibility to the "extensification
premium". The Netherlands and Italy are unwilling to introduce the
new-born calf slaughter option, which they feel will outrage public
opinion, France wants to see premiums payable on suckler cows raised,
while Portugal is still fighting to maintain the second premium payable on
its older, extensively-raised, bulls.

Immediate cash commitment.

The most significant addition to the Fischler beef package is the
commitment to find ECU 500 million somewhere in the 1997 EU Agriculture
Budget to top up cattle farmers incomes for the second time since the BSE
crisis hit demand in April. In June, the Ministers agreed to provide ECU
850 million, with an added provision for Member States to match this
figure out of national funds. Earlier, the Farm Commissioner had suggested
there was no justification for further short-term support of this kind. A
report from the Commission Directorate-General for Agriculture (DGVI),
whose publication was temporarily blocked by French Commissioner Edith
Cresson on October 23, estimates beef producers' aggregate losses due to
the BSE crisis at ECU 1.277 billion (calculated per animal at ECU 65 for
males and ECU 45/ head for suckler cows) or at ECU 1.02 billion on a
production basis. Nevertheless, French calf producers are said to be
losing up to ECU 100 per head in the current depressed market for beef
animals.

Exports booming.

On October 25 the EU Beef and Veal Management Committee accepted a further
31,000 tonnes of prime beef, plus 180 tonnes of weanlings, into
intervention, bringing to 396,000 tonnes the total amount of beef carcases
now in public storage. The Commission spokesman stressed that 1996
intervention would not now approach the 720,000 tonnes foreseen in early
pessimistic scenarios at the height of the crisis. Exports from the Union
are now running well over 22,000 tonnes per week and some 100,000 tonnes
ahead of schedule for the year 1996/97, as foreign demand has picked up
again. However, the GATT Agreement on Agriculture limit on export of
subsidised EU beef is likely to be reached before June 1997, when the
problem will flare up again, he warned.

Finding the ECU 500 million.

All sides now agree that the manoeuvre of postponing until after October
15, 1997 part of the oilseeds advance payments for next year is the right
way of freeing up the necessary ECU 1.2 billion or so for intervention and
production-curtailment measures for 1997. However, uncertainty still
surrounds the question of just where the ECU 500 million extra top-up is
to be found. Following an agreement struck in Killarney in September,
Member States have made early disbursements totalling some ECU 230 million
on suckler cow premium payments and the EU Budget Authority will now be
asked to authorise the use of an equivalent amount from the 1997 budget.
That would leave ECU 270 million to be financed over the next twelve
months from savings on other expenditure items within the Farm Budget.

A further bone of contention is just which farmers will receive the agreed
aid top-up. Germany, alongside France one of the two major cattle
countries in the Community, received only 14% of the June package, while
the French producers carried off some 30% of the cash, stressed
Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert. Hence Mr Borchert, backed by the
Irish delegation, wants a new "distribution key" to be worked out.

Compromise details.

Based on the July 30 proposals from EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler,
the Presidency compromise makes the following adjustments:

-the calf-processing premium ("Herod premium") designed to encourage
farmers to reduce future beef supplies by slaughtering new-born calves
would be compulsorily offered for dairy herds only; an early marketing
premium suggested by the German delegation would be available for both
male and female calves up to average slaughter weight less 20%. The EU
Management Committee would set the premium and the implementation rules
but the objective is to remove 1 million calves from production next year.

-intervention buying of weanlings, introduced on October 14 for 1996, to
be maintained only as an emergency measure for Autumn 1997

-the regional ceilings for the special beef premiums for both 1997 and
1998 to be cut back to current levels for Greece (to 140,130 head),
Austria (423,400), Portugal (154,897) and the UK (1,419,811). Spain to be
allowed a higher ceiling than under present arrangements

- a single premium to be set for bull headage payments at ECU130, which
represents a 19.6% increase on the present level of ECU 108.68 as against
the Commission proposal for a 14% increase to ECU 123.90

- the 1996 intervention ceiling to be raised to just 550,000, instead of
the 720,000 originally proposed, which would leave a capacity of a further
90,000 tonnes for this year

- an additional ECU 36/head for farmers who bring their cattle stocking
level under 1.4 livestock units per hectare and ECU 52 per head for levels
less than 1LU/ha.

Link with dairy reform?

In addition the Commission is asked to draft a proposal to change
legislation so that the East German Lander derogation on the 90-head herd
limit continues to apply until end 1998 and to draw up proposals for long
term measures by June 30, which would link beef sector structural measures
with plans for dairy reform. A number of delegations are unhappy however
to link these two distinct sectors.

CEEC imports attacked.

Following strong calls from a number of delegations to renegotiate
preferential cattle import arrangements with Central and East European
countries (CEEC), the compromise text calls on the Foreign Affairs Council
to take action along these lines. The Commission warns however that the
CEEC will justifiably demand compensation in other trade areas.

Beef for food aid?

Mr Yates also revealed on October 21 his ideas for shipping unmarketable
EU beef as food aid to the Third World. The Irish Agriculture Minister
said he would be making a proposal to this effect at the World Food
Summit, scheduled to take place in Rome from November 13 to 17. Since the
BSE crisis arose in March, public intervention stocks of Community beef
have risen from almost zero to just under 400,000 tonnes. This figure
could rise to 700,000 tonnes when pre-Winter selling gets under way,
reckons the European Commission. These quantities of meat are unlikely to
find a market abroad, given the continuous flow of new supplies, say the
experts. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates
that some 800 million people in the world currently suffer from
under-nutrition.

Identification and labelling.

The Council also took its first look at Commission proposals for cattle
identification and beef labelling rules. The idea is that all EU cattle
should be identified by means of an eartag and personal passport. As
regards labelling, individual producers and organisations would be
authorised to put in place voluntary schemes for providing the customer
with detailed information on their beef products. The draft Regulation
lays down what information may appear on a label (for details see last
issue of Agri-Service International ), and lays down rules for verifying
the truth of any claims made. The Commission hopes this scheme will be up
and running by January 1997, but the European Parliament will need to
register its Opinion before the Council can go ahead and adopt the
legislation. Meanwhile Ministers have sent the dossier to the Committee of
Member States' Permanent Representatives to the EU (COREPER) for further
work.

POTATOES: EU MARKET REGIME PROPOSALS SOON TO BE BURIED AGAIN

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Despite renewed pressure from farmers' organisations, MEPs and the
authorities of a number of EU Member States for a formal Community market
regime to be established for potatoes, it now appears unlikely that this
will be achieved in the foreseeable future. The Irish Presidency of the EU
Council of Ministers has so far been unable to secure sufficient consensus
on the existing Commission proposals to justify bringing them back to the
Council table, while the Dutch, due to take over the Council chair on
January 1, are not convinced of the need to institute a Common Market
Organisation (CMO) in this sector. Meanwhile, the absence of any formal
Community-wide structure for potatoes leaves the market subject to sharp
fluctuations, allows individual Member States a free hand on allocating
national aid, and renders EU farmers vulnerable to low-priced imports from
third countries.

New calls for a CMO.

As hopes rose recently that the potato dossier might make progress under
the Irish Presidency of the EU, Spanish Socialist Members of the European
Parliament Jesus Cabezon Alonso and Juan Colino Salamanca raised a
parliamentary question with the Council of Ministers, the basic thrust of
which is to press for detailed regulation of the market "in order to
achieve better market balance, guarantee producers' incomes and prevent
distortions of competition (...)". Meanwhile COPA and COGECA, the EU
farmers' and farm cooperatives organisations, have issued a 6-point plan
for an EU potato regime. The plan, which insists on the need for an EU
Advisory Committee on Potatoes to assist the European Commission, calls
for:

- a common methodology to determine potato quality and to establish a
minimum quality standard to protect consumers from sub-standard or
diseased potatoes;

- a common methodology for the collection, analysis and distribution of
statistics;

- a modest fund for the setting-up of potato groups and industry
organisations in those Member States where such structures are weak;

- an occasional fund for the generic promotion of potatoes in high yield
years;

- funding for research and development into the safe use of modern
technology for growing, storing and presenting potatoes;

- potatoes to be brought within the general safeguard measures applicable
to all other crops to protect EU markets from subsidised or state-aided
imports from third countries.

"Light" regime proposed.

Proposals drafted by the European Commission as long ago as 1992 call for
the establishment of a "light" Community potato marketing regime
recognising and providing aid for setting up producer organisations which
would take responsibility for selling all the produce of their members.
The producer groups would also organise research and development of better
strains and run generic promotion campaigns for potatoes. Quality
standards would also be established under Management Committee procedures,
and the Commission empowered to take action against excessive imports, by
requiring import licences.

No consensus.

Consensus within the Council's Special Committee on Agriculture has proved
hard to achieve, however. Southern Member States such as Italy, Spain and
Portugal are in favour of formal regulation of the market, but would
prefer to see potatoes included in the fruit and vegetables CMO, which
also provides for aided withdrawal of surpluses and other market
interventions of a "heavier" nature. France and the UK have been urging
Ivan Yates, the President-in-Office of the Farm Council, to push the
dossier forward, but London is categorically opposed to aided withdrawals
of surplus produce from the market, and wants potatoes kept strictly
separate from other, more perishable, fruit and vegetables.

Like the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium have their own national
potato marketing bodies, and are thus allied with the Swedes and Danes,
who are basically against instituting new sector regimes. Under EU
legislation, the state aid rules laid down in Articles 92-94 of the Treaty
do not apply to farm sectors not governed by a CMO.

"Illogical" absence of regulation.

A sector expert from the COPA/COGECA tandem described the situation as an
"illogical" gap in the completion of the Single Market. Potatoes are one
of the most important farm products for which no market organisation has
so far been established. With a total cultivated area of 1,334,000
hectares, potatoes constitute a substantial crop in the European Union.
They are grown in all the Member States, although because of climatic and
soil conditions, they are more widely grown in Northern regions. The Union
is in fact self-sufficient in potatoes, with the exception of early
varieties, which are imported in Winter and early Spring from
Mediterranean countries when limited Community production is available.
The main suppliers are Egypt, Morocco and Cyprus. During the past few
years an annual average of some 400,000 tonnes of early potatoes have been
imported from third countries.

However, the potato market is highly weather-dependent and is notoriously
characterised by wide fluctuations in crop yields from year to year.
Growers' incomes are highly uncertain. Farmers react quickly to rising
prices during shortages by planting extra acreage for the following
harvest, which in turn drives the price sharply down again. In 1994 for
example, when drought affected both quantity and quality, prices rose
steeply, only to fall back again during 1995, when the harvest was much
better. The sector is also vulnerable to speculation, as potatoes can be
stored for a much longer period than many other vegetables.

PROGRESS ON FRENCH APPLE EXPORTS TO JAPAN

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Great strides have been made in the long-running negotiations on French
apple exports to Japan, to the extent that a date for the start of French
shipments can now be envisaged. French diplomatic sources have revealed
that considerable progress has been made over the last year on the
technical level, with only a few details blocking a final agreement. Paris
is anxious to tie up the ends of the technical dossier and agree a "start
date" to be announced during President Jacques Chirac's state visit to
Japan beginning on November 17.

Japan recently appointed experts in France to examine how French farmers
are combating insect parasites which are endemic to apples in Europe but
unknown in Japan. Concerns over plant health are generally regarded as the
principal obstacle to the sale of foreign apples in the archipelago.
Quoting unidentified Japanese Government sources, the English-language
daily the Japan Times has suggested the ban on the import of French apples
may be lifted by next Summer, provided no serious problems come to light
during testing in Japan.

French sources have been reluctant to confirm the Summer of 1997 as a
starting date for apple exports to Japan, pointing out that a date can
only be set following the results of public inquiry that has still to be
carried out. If all goes well, France, the world's leading exporter of
apples, will become the fourth country authorised to sell its fruit to
Japan after New Zealand, the United States and South Korea. However, it
remains to be seen whether French Golden Delicious apples will sell in
Japan, where consumers are partial to very large and attractive fruit. In
1995, imported apples accounted for less than 1% of the Japanese market
despite costing infinitely less than domestic apples.

DURUM WHEAT: COMMISSION SECTOR REFORM PROPOSALS BOGGED DOWN

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

European Commission plans to reform the management of the EU durum wheat
sector have run into opposition from Member States' negotiators in the
Council's Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA), and the new regime is
now unlikely to take effect in the coming marketing year. Although the
basic proposal to institute a Maximum Guaranteed Area for durum wheat
production and promote supplies of quality grains to the market would
rally a qualified majority in Council, the main producer Member States are
still squabbling over allocation of the 3-4 million hectares traditionally
sown to this crop in the Community, while some of the other countries want
official recognition of the "non-traditional" acreage on which their
farmers grow up to 400,000 hectares of hard wheat per year. If all
requests were to be granted, an extra million hectares of Community-aided
durum wheat would be added to the Commission draft, costing the CAP budget
a further ECU 280 million a year.

Injecting more flexibility into the durum sector.

The Commission's July 30 proposals are designed to loosen up what has
become a highly rigidified system and bring the sector into line with both
market disciplines and current farming structures. Younger farmers are
having particular difficulty in obtaining growing rights, which are tied
to the land, and the practice of "producing for aid" rather than for the
market, has become rife among some farmers, the Commission points out.
Meanwhile the EU processing industry has been importing heavily to ensure
supplies.

Under the present regime, aid is paid on an individual basis to producers
in the "traditional" growing areas whose acreage, calculated as the
highest area for which production aid was paid in one of the reference
years from 1988 to 1991, is listed in a register. This aid currently
amounts to ECU 358.6/tonne, based on the production aid paid before the
1992 CAP reform, plus the difference between the current intervention
price (aligned on that of other cereals) and the higher pre-reform
intervention price.

A 3 million hectare ceiling.

The Commission's solution to the imbalance which has developed, while at
the same time keeping a grip on budgetary expenditure, is to abolish
production registers and establish a Maximum Guaranteed Area (MGA) for
durum wheat, distributed according to traditional production totals.
However, the EU executive is proposing to base the MGA on aid applications
paid since the 1992 reform, for a total of 3 million ha, ranging from
1,610,000 ha for Italy to 35,000 for Portugal (see Agri-Service
International N 446 for full details), while registered acreages actually
amount to over 4 million ha.

Widening the scope.

Most delegations to the SCA support the Commission's general aim of
promoting adequate supply of quality durum wheat to the processing
industry by abolishing traditional monopolies on production rights and
granting aid only to those farmers who sow specified seed-types and grow
their crop through to maturity. However, producers have been lobbying
their governments to ensure they do not lose out proportionally to rivals
in other EU countries. Thus arguments within the SCA have aligned the
Member States into three groups: those with allocated MGAs are demanding
larger areas; those countries, including Austria, who have hitherto
benefited from "non-traditional" aid payments (amounting to some
ECU138.9/ha - i.e. half that payable on "traditional" areas) want their
production to be included in the scope of the new regime; some countries
who have never drawn aid in either category, such as Germany and the UK,
are insisting they too should be allocated a small "non-traditional" durum
acreage.

Faced with these extra demands, the major producers have countered by
demanding an allocation of non-traditional acreage on top of their
traditional area. The aggregate of all these requests would bring an added
550,000 ha of traditional and 400,000 ha of non-traditional durum
production within the aided regime.

TUNISIA ANTICIPATES ABUNDANT OLIVE HARVEST

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Official estimates suggest olive oil production in Tunisia will exceed
200,000 tonnes in 1996/97, drawing a line under two years of poor
harvests. With crops ravaged by drought in 1994/95 and 1995/96, olive oil
production plummeted to 70,000 and 60,000 tonnes. Agriculture Minister
Mohamed Ben Rejeb has indicated that abundant production over the
forthcoming season, beginning in November, should result in a substantial
increase in olive oil exports and a resumption of normal supplies to local
markets that have been faced with shortages for more than a year.

Sales abroad were restricted last year to 26,000 tonnes, a little less
than half of the authorised quota for exports to the European Union,
Tunisia's principal customer. Under the terms of the Association Agreement
with the European Union signed in July 1995, Tunisia will enjoy
preferential conditions on the sale of 46,000 tonnes of olive oil per year
on the European market, up to the year 2000. According to the Assabah
daily, Mr Ben Rejeb is currently negotiating an increase in the European
quota to 60,000 tones per year.

The Minister is also reported to have warned exporters of a possible slump
in prices, particularly over the next three months. A floor price for
exports has been set at 2,900 Dinars per tonne, and storage capacity has
been raised this year to 250,000 tonnes. Olive oil is also expected to
return to the menu in Tunisian households, with the Minister forecasting a
fall in prices on the domestic market. The Tunisians, who traditionally
consume about 50,000 tonnes of olive oil per year, have been forced of
late to turn to cheaper imported and state subsidised vegetable oils.
Tunisia's leading agricultural export, olive oil earned the country an
average of USD200 million a year between 1991 and 1994.

WHEAT PRICES RISE AS MAIZE AND SOYA FALL

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The price of wheat on the Chicago futures market is rising as rates for
maize and soya fall, although gains will be limited by the favourable
rains that have watered freshly-planted crops of Winter wheat in the
United States. Pressure on maize and soya prices was already building up
before the rains that have hampered harvesting in the Midwest. Jason
Roose, an analyst with US Commodities, has blamed the fall on hedging by
producers and storage companies.

Soya prices in particular have declined two weeks before the publication
of new production estimates by the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) which may raise forecasts, according to Mr Roose. With prices
sliding to USD6.97 per bushel at the end of morning trading on October 29,
speculation on whether soya should be trading above USD8 per bushel has
been replaced by conjecture as to whether prices should have fallen below
USD7.

In a separate development, analysts have yet to react to the decision by
the American tax authorities to ban farmers from deferring tax payments by
collecting revenue on current sales in January. American producers have
previously able to sell harvests at this stage of the year but defer
payment until January, so as to withhold payment of tax on these sales
until the following year. Under the new regulation, these sales will be
directly taxable.

CEREALS: INTERNATIONAL GRAINS COUNCIL RAISES 1996/97 CROP FORECASTS

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The world cereals harvest for 1996/97 (July to June) should prove more
abundant that previously forecast, reckons the International Grains
Council (IGC), whose monthly report, out on October 24, raises production
estimates to 573 million tonnes for wheat and 875 million tonnes for
coarse grains (corn, barley, rye, sorghum, oats). The London-based
inter-governmental organisation has raised forecasts sharply to take
account of bumper harvests in the European Union, China and Australia.
Likewise, the United States maize harvest has exceeded expectations. The
increase in production in some regions has more than compensated for the
disappointing wheat harvests in Kazakhstan, Russia and the United States.
Last month, the IGC forecast harvests of 571 million tonnes for wheat and
869 million tonnes for coarse grains.

Stocks set to rise.

Following the mediocre crops of recent years, these plentiful wheat and
corn harvests should be reflected in an increase in world grain reserves.
World stocks of wheat are expected to rise to 104 million tonnes
(unchanged on the September estimate, see Table 17 below), an increase of
10 million tonnes in a single year. The estimate for reserves of coarse
grains has been raised from 100 to 105 million tonnes, 21 million tonnes
more than last year. The IGC has also increased its estimate for global
wheat consumption, which totalled 558 million tonnes in 1995/96, from 561
to 563 million tonnes.

Grain trade volume shrinks.

World trade in wheat is now put at 89 million tonnes, compared with a
September estimate of 88 million, still slightly less than the 90 million
tonnes bought and sold internationally in the 1995/96 marketing year. As
regards coarse grains, the IGC has reduced its September consumption
estimate of 856 million tonnes to 854 million, still a considerable
increase on the 831 million tonnes consumed in 1995/96. World trade in
these cereals, which amounted to 93 million tonnes in 1995/96, is expected
to fall back to 89 million tonnes. A fall in imports to South Korea has,
according to the IGC, been largely offset by rising sales to Saudi Arabia.

National grain policy.

Meanwhile a number of countries have announced changes in their national
cereals trade policies.

NETHERLANDS JOINS INTERNATIONAL PLANT VARIETY CONVENTION

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The Dutch Government deposited its instrument of acceptance of the 1991
Act of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of
Plants on October 14. The Geneva-based UPOV is an inter-governmental
organisation which cooperates in administrative matters with the World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). It runs the International
Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants with a view to
recognising and ensuring intellectual property rights to breeders of new
plant varieties. The member states of UPOV grant such a right in
accordance with the provisions of the Convention, under their national
legislation.

The Netherlands, which is already a member state of UPOV, is the third
country to ratify the 1991 Act of the UPOV Convention. From the point of
view of international treaty law, the 1991 Act will not enter into force
for the Netherlands until one month after two additional states have
deposited instruments of adherence to the 1991 Act. But from the point of
view of national law, the Netherlands has now effectively adapted its
legislation to the 1991 Act. A number of other states also have laws which
conform with the 1991 Act and can be expected to sign up in the coming
months, UPOV said in a statement.

The 1991 Act of the Convention makes the protection of all species of
plants mandatory for member states after the expiration of a transitional
period and strengthens the protection afforded to plant breeders. It does,
however, leave protected varieties available, as at present, for use as a
source of variation for the development of other varieties. "The
strengthened protection for plant breeders will increase the incentive
provided by the Convention for plant breeding and will lessen the threat
to breeders from piracy of protected plant varieties and plagiaristic
breeding activities", according to UPOV.

VIETNAM JOINS INTERNATIONAL COFFEE ORGANISATION

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The Executive Director of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO),
Celsius A. Lodder, said on October 15 that the London-based Organisation
had just received notification from the United Nations that Vietnam had
deposited its instrument of accession to the 1994 International Coffee
Agreement the day before. Vietnam exported some 3.5 million 60-kg bags of
coffee in 1996, making it the world's sixth biggest coffee exporter by
volume. Vietnam's arrival brings the ICO's membership up to 60, comprising
42 exporting and 18 importing member countries. Exporting members account
for nearly 95% of world coffee exports. Eight of these also belong to the
African coffee producers' organisation, OAMCAF (Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Congo, the Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Madagascar and
Togo).

ICO member countries as at October 16, 1996:

Exporting members: Angola, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi, Cameroon, Central
African Republic, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia,
Gabon, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Jamaica,
Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mexico, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Venezuela,
Vietnam, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Importing members: Austria, Belgium/Luxembourg, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, as well as
the European Union.

3rd Asia International Coffee Conference.

One of Vietnam's first major functions as a new ICO member will be to host
the Third Asia International Coffee Conference (AICC '97), to be held in
Ho Chi Minh City from January 14 to 18, 1997. The ICO Executive Directive
will be among the key speakers, along with Vietnam's Vice-Ministers from
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of
Trade. Organised under the auspices of the Vietnam National Coffee
Corporation (VINACAFE) and the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association
(VICOFA) and sponsored by the ICO and Coffee Board of India, the
conference will put Vietnam's coffee industry in the spotlight and
consider whether the country will "maintain and grow in status as a major
player in the world coffee arena". In the last ten years, Vietnam has seen
phenomenal success in producing coffee, with output rising from just
467,000 bags in 1985/86 to close to 3 million bags in 1995/96. This rapid
growth, together with market expectations of a further rise in capacity
and the fact that Vietnam exports more than 80% of its production, has the
world coffee industry monitoring closely developments in the country.
Other key issues to be addressed at the conference include international
price and cost competitiveness; quality concerns and issues; international
marketing and access into the international coffee world; Arabica
production prospects for Vietnam.

CGIAR: PLANET HAS THE RESOURCES TO FEED 8 BILLION IN 2025

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Our planet has the necessary resources to feed a world population of 8
billion in 2025, provided agricultural research is pursued and Governments
adopt appropriate policies, according to the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Celebrating its 25th
anniversary, CGIAR published a statement on October 27, highlighting how
an additional billion individuals have been fed since 1971 as a direct
results of its research, and underlining the need to continue funding such
research.

Established in 1971, and made up of representatives of 52 governments and
international organisations, CGIAR endeavours through agricultural
research, to contribute to guaranteeing adequate food supplies to the
populations of developing countries. The Group is financed by the World
Bank, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the
United Nations Development and Environment Programmes (UNDP & UNEP).

Agricultural production in 10 large developing countries has risen by 74%
since the beginning of the seventies, with the increase in yields achieved
through the introduction of new technologies accounting for 70% of this
improvement, according to CGIAR. However, official government aid to
agriculture has fallen from 2O% of total aid in 1980 to 14% in 1990.
Support programmes for international agricultural research now account for
less that 0.05% of this aid. CGIAR has an annual research budget of 300
million dollars.

CGIAR Chairman Ismail Seragedin claims "a mere increase in yields will not
be sufficient to feed the whole world in 30 years". He emphasises the
importance of "increasing the revenue of the poor, adopting appropriate
policies, and above all, ensuring that research responds to real needs".
To this end, the Group has developed specially adapted farm machinery for
small holdings which can help farmers without replacing them. Scientists
linked to CGIAR, have for example developed a mini-machine for removing
rice husks, carrying out a tedious task previously done by hand. Other
scientists have launched the micro-nutrients project, developing new
varieties of mineral-enriched cereals that may hit the markets within 6 to
10 years. CGIAR claims the diet of more than two billion people is
deficient in iron and other minerals such as zinc, with 1.2 billion
suffering from anaemia caused by these deficiencies. About 225 million
children suffer from a serious lack of vitamin A which proves fatal in 28%
of cases.

The international centre for the improvement of wheat and corn, also
linked to CGIAR, has developed six varieties of corn that prosper on acid
soil previously regarded as unfit for agriculture. Varieties of parasite
resistant crops have also been developed to reduce the use of pesticides.
Finally, CGIAR scientists have focused considerable attention on water
conservation techniques and irrigation, developing methods of collecting
water from torrential downpours and "tapping" water that condenses during
the night.

OECD: EXPORT FRUIT BOOM FROM THE SOUTH A THREAT FOR THE North?

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

There has been strong growth in global trade of temperate-climate fruit in
the past decade. Progress in preserving and transporting fresh fruit has
enabled the Southern Hemisphere countries - especially Chile, Argentina,
New Zealand and South Africa - to rapidly expand their fruit exports,
driving up world trade in apples, pears, peaches, plums, apricots, grapes
and kiwis by some 30%. Although this export boom from the South is a major
trade development of the decade, a new study from the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development, entitled "Export Fruit Boom From the
South: A Threat for the North?" foresees global trade in fresh fruit
developing differently in the years ahead:

Rising demand will stimulate an even larger volume of trade in
temperate-climate fruit, but the major source of demand growth will shift
from the OECD to the non-OECD region, predicts the report. Trade flows are
expected to shift significantly: there will be greater
internationalisation of trade, with larger numbers of exporting countries
and more varied destinations; the Northern Hemisphere will import more
from the Asian region and export less in favour of Southern Hemisphere
exporters; intra-hemisphere trade flows will also change, with intra-Asian
trade of apples increasing in the Northern Hemisphere, intra-European
trade in apples, pears, table grapes and kiwifruit expanding, and
intra-Central and South American trade also growing.

Export competition will increase for virtually all markets, meaning that
countries must hone their international competitiveness if they are to
continue to successfully market their exports: they will have to develop
astute international market strategies, improve their market research and
development, and achieve greater marketing efficiencies. At the national
level, policies that ensure safe reliable supplies and an environmentally
sound production of fresh temperate-climate fruit will become increasingly
important.

The OECD study explains this medium-term evolution of the international
market, and the likely increase in trade volumes, by:

- the general increase in consumer disposable income, especially in the
Asian region;

- shifts in consumer preferences toward a reliable year-round supply of
good quality, fresh temperate-climate fruit;

- improved marketing efficiencies and market development in exporting
countries that take advantage of non-seasonal demand;

- technical progress in sea-borne shipping and storage;

- technical progress in plant breeding and biotechnology, with shorter
growth periods, better-tasting fruit, and more varieties available to
consumers;

- greater market access, smaller volumes of subsidised exports, and more
efficient phytosanitary rules thanks to the Uruguay Round Agreement on
Agriculture;

- greater bilateral and plurilateral cooperation between countries through
regional trading arrangements and customs-free zones.

BANANA PRODUCERS' FORUM OPENS IN SANTO DOMINGO

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The 12th Forum of Latin American banana producers opened in Santo Domingo,
capital of the Dominican Republic, on October 28, in the presence of 800
public and private sector delegates from around the world. The Forum is
intended to promote the regular development of the international banana
economy. Expobanana 96, a specialised fair for the promotion of the
product, its derivatives and associated services, was running in parallel
to the Forum.

The gathering has given Latin American and Caribbean banana growers an
opportunity to keep abreast of the latest technical progress and
plant-health developments, as well as market organisation policies
worldwide, through a programme of eight conferences and round tables
addressing specific sectors and issues. Banana-producing countries in the
region are still demanding better conditions of access to the European
Union market, regulated for the last three years by quotas and duties
which vary for Dollar zone producers (the Latin Americans) and for
African, Caribbean and Pacific signatories of the Lome Convention.

AGWEEK MAGAZINE EDIBLE BEAN MARKET COLUMN

By Ann Bailey, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--HIGHLIGHTS: The edible bean market remained in the holiday doldrums
last week, with Minnesota and North Dakota dealers quoting pinto prices of $14
per cwt. and navy prices of $15 per cwt. 

Looking ahead to the new crop, there were contracts of $18 per cwt. for navies
and $16 per cwt. for pintos available. 

DEMAND: On the demand side, the devalued peso continues to make it tough to
sell pinto beans to Mexico. In February, the country will issue permits to 
companies to buy pintos. Under NAFTA, Mexican buyers can purchase up to 1.2 
million cwt. of beans, duty-free. 

If Mexico's economic situation improves and the country is able to purchase
the beans, it would help clean up the supply of U.S. pintos on hand, 

says Tim Courneya, executive vice president of the Northarvest Bean Growers 
Association. 

With pinto and navy beans at inexpensive levels, the United States should also
continue to move out beans through the U.S. government's Food for Peace 
Program, Courneya says. However, there may be competition with green peas and 
lentils for exports because those legumes are even cheaper than navies and 
pintos. END

BEAN PRODUCTION UP, BUT SUNFLOWER CROP DIPS FOR YEAR

By Ann Bailey, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--One thing edible bean growers can pretty much count on is that the
market is cyclical: If prices are high one year, farmers are likely to plant
more beans the next year, and prices will drop. 

The cycle continued this year when U.S. farmers increased their navy bean 
production by 2.1 million cwt. to 7.3 million. Prices in the region dropped 
from $26-$27 per cwt. a year ago to $14 per cwt. this year. 

North Dakota farmers harvested 149,000 navy acres this year, up 129,000 acres
from last year when flooding and frost destroyed some acres, according to
USDA. Harvested acreage in Minnesota increased by 20,000 acres to 61,200, 
the agency says. 

N.D. navy production was 2 million cwt. this year, up from 1.5 million from a
year ago. Minnesota farmers produced 845,000 cwt. of navies, up from 678,000
last year. 

U.S. pinto bean acreage, meanwhile, dropped from last year. Farmers harvested
760,000 acres of pintos nationwide, about 70,000 fewer than last year. But in
North Dakota and Minnesota, acreage was higher than last year. Farmers
harvested 362,000 acres, a 35,000 acre increase over last year. Minnesota
farmers harvested 35,000 acres, 10,400 more than last year. 

Nationwide, U.S. pinto bean production was 11 million cwt. this year, down 1.6
million cwt. from last year. North Dakota farmers produced 4.7 million cwt. of
pintos, 424,000 cwt. more than last year, USDA says. Minnesota pinto
production increased 138,000 cwt. to 433,000. 

Pinto bean prices in the region, at about $15 per cwt. are similar to last
year. 

Adverse weather conditions hurt Northern Plains sunflower production this year.

USDA projects that North Dakota's average yields of both oil and nonoil 
sunflowers will be 1,360 pounds per acre, down 75 pounds per acre from last 
year. Total North Dakota "all sunflower" production is pegged at 2 million 
pounds, down from 2.2 million last year. 

Final figures for the year aren't available yet, but the National Sunflower
Association anticipates that North Dakota's oil yields will be lower than
USDA's projections, says Jay Hesley, marketing director of the National
Sunflower Association. 

Late planting, a shorter growing season and poor harvest conditions 
contributed to lower yields, he says. Some of this year's crop was planted a 
week to 10 days later than normal. 

In Minnesota, a wet growing sseason that spawned crop diseases reduced yields.
Hesley expects yields will be lower than the five-year average of 1,480 pounds
per acre. USDA projects average yields of both non-oil and oil sunflowers in
Minnesota to be 1,250 pounds per acre this year, down 13 pounds per acre from
last year. Total production in Minnesota is pegged at 558,750 pounds, down
41,250 pounds from last year. 

In South Dakota, USDA projects average yields of 1,380 per acre for both 
non-oil and oil sunflowers. That's a decline of 171 pounds per acre from last 
year. USDA projects total South Dakota production at 1.3 million pounds, down 
from 1.4 million last year. 

Total U.S. production of non-oil and oil sunflowers will be 4.6 million pounds,
down from 4.8 million last year, USDA projects. 

While yields are lower than last year, prices are higher. Prices are near 11
cents a pound, nearly 2 cents higher than last year. Hesley says the reason is
twofold: Farmers are reluctant sellers and buyers are trying to give farmers
an incentive to plant sunflowers this spring. Sunflowers will have to compete
with other commodities for acreage, Hesley says. END

DAKOTA FARMER'S AGRIDATA INC. CREATES FIELD INFORMATION SYSTEM

By Jayson Menke, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--David Hagert wanted to find an easier way to keep field information.
So he designed a management information system. Hagert, who farms 2,700 acres
of wheat, barley, soybeans and edible beans with his brother, Curtis Jr., near
Emerado, N.D., started working on a model in his basement in the winter of
1991, and moved to his current location at 2600 Demers Ave. in Grand Forks,
N.D, in May. 

Since going into business, AgriData Inc., has branched out into more than just
field records, it now focusus on all areas of precision farming. 

The business assists farmers with precision farming techniques by utiliziation
of an improved field recordkeeping system that integrates computer analysis,
automated data entry, mapping, field monitoring and Differential Global
Positioning Satellite technology. 

"By broadening our horizons we are able to provide customers with the lastest
equipment, software and information in one convenient location," Hagert says. 

Hagert has incorporated tillage, fertilizer, pesticide, planting, conservation
determination, weather, harvest, irrigation and soil nutrient data and maps
into two pages of information for one field for one year. 

"In the past you would have about eight pages of printed out data per field.
What we're doing is simplifying and tying everything together," Hagert says. 

Hagert's goal was to develop an easy-to-use computer system that would service
all aspects of farming. 

In the early stages of development he used speadsheets to post his farm 
records. 

His new software program, Field Facts, will be available in the mid- January. 

Farmers can purchase Field Facts from AgriData and receive training on the
software or they can gather the data and AgriData will process the information
and print it out for the farmer. 

Hagert says that precision farming endorses site specific application of crop
inputs. 

According to Hagert the goal of precision farming is to improve profits by
putting money spent on crop inputs exactly where it will do the most good. 

"The main focus is establishing patterns that are determined by yield 
monitoring equipment, satellite imagery and soil types," Hagert says. 

Hagert says the premise is that fields have varying patterns of soil types,
nutrient levels, and ultimately, varying yield levels through out a given
field. By recording and analyzing this data, crop inputs can be adjusted
through out a field to maximize yeilds and reduce total cost of inputs. 

That is, a constant rate of application over an entire field results in over
application in some spots and under application in others. By varying the
appliation rate of applications, costs can be reduced and yeilds increased. 

Hagert started keeping track of records on ACSC maps and began charting more
intensely in 1988 and designed the first prototype in 1991. 

"The main emphasis is on collecting data," Hagert says. He and his brother
used a yield monitor in 1994 and last year added a correctional signal which
enables the farmer to pinpoint spots in field through differential global
positioning system. 

"Now we can produce yield maps and look at it with satellite imagery and look
for patterns." 

AgriData will offer record keeping support, mapping, satellite imagery, 
software sales and support and consultation on hardware. 

AGRIDATA INC. Owner: David Hagert Address: 2600 Demers Ave., Grand Forks, N.D.
Year started: 1991. Employees: 4. Main line of work: Precision farming
management system. Motto: Bringing precision farming down to earth.

AGWEEK MAGAZINE EDITORIAL: OPENING THE DOORS

Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY AWAITS PRAIRIE AGRICULTURE Jan. 1--Whirlpool, a
leading maker of home appliances based in Benton Harbor, Mich., is one of a
number of Midwest manufacturers that has set its sights on the global market
everyone in agriculture is talking about. 

As Prairie farmers grapple with the challenges of more economically liberal
farm policy, and tackle the business world through processing and marketing
ventures, a look at Whirlpool's global adventure suggests that strategic
planning and focused energy can be bountifully rewarded. 

In its transformation from a domestic supplier into a world-class competitor,
Whirlpool evolved from a $4 billion company into an $8 billion company. In a
recent interview with Suzanne Cosgrove at Knight-Ridder Financial News,
Whirlpool CEO David Whitwam recalled that the company was devoted almost
exclusively to the U.S. marketplace in 1987 when he took his current position. 

While solidly successful, Whirlpool faced a mature environment, with only slow
natural growth -- based on population growth -- seen for the coming decade.
Whitwam concluded that the only reason it was a slow-growth industry was that
it was limited to domestic markets. 

It was time to go global. Whirlpool recognized that, while a fridge is a 
fridge is a fridge, you don't just export American-style appliances to Brazil 
and expect to reap a fortune. 

Today, Whirlpool is the No. 3 appliance supplier in Europe, and the No. 1 
supplier in both North and Latin America. 

Now it's on to Asia. Whitwam figures the Asian market will be twice the size
of U.S. market within 10 years -- as big as Europe and the United States 
combined. When asked what new language he would learn if he had time, Whitwam 
was quick to answer: "Mandarin." 

There are ample lessons for Prairie farmers in this stellar example. Stoves
aren't soybeans, but the principles of marketing and competing in new markets
are. 

The most important factor is focus, or "stick to your knitting." In other 
words, if you're selling processed flour products into the Chinese market, 
don't spin you wheels trying to sell tractor tires. 

Unlike appliances, foodstuffs are a much more fractured and diverse market. So
market research is essential. That includes building relationships that
eventually turn into deals. But where some folks look at market research as
daunting, successful ventures don't go adrift into the information sea without
a plan. 

First, know your own products, your own production potential and your own 
reserves of creativity. 

Second, have your money lined up -- nothing quite limits business 
opportunities as failing to meet contracted output quotas because you run out 
of cash. 

Third, have fun. The world market is exciting, interesting and challenging.
Prairie farmers have an unbeatable combination of a highly productive resource
base, a solid experience pool from which to draw, a lively economic
development sector, and the drive to create new business models for the next
century. 

There are those individuals who would have looked at the refrigerator market
and said, "I guess we'll have to make do with what we've got." But innovators
like Whitwam looked farther afield and saw a chance to build on their base. 

The world market wants good food. China is hungry, Russia is hungry, all of
Asia is hungry. And they're all building to a standard of living that we in
the United States saw before World War II. That means opportunity. This is the
year for Prairie farmers to look beyond their borders, to scan the global 
horizon for opportunities and to build relationships that will guarantee our 
future prosperity. 

It's time, in Whitwam's words, to learn Mandarin. EDITOR'S NOTE: Agweek

MEAT PRODUCTION SWELLED IN 1995

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--Livestock producers know only too well what this year's hot grain 
markets mean: fatter feed and forage costs, leaner margins. 

The rise in corn prices, which has encouraged increased oilseed meal 
production, has not triggered a major selloff. Instead, meat production 
swelled in 1995. 

There's not shortage of meat these days. In fact, from the cattleman's 
standpoint, notes a Market Watch For Beef from the National Cattlemen's 
Assocation, supplies are burdensome. 

Increased beef production has led to record U.S. per capita meat consumption,
but it hasn't been enough to turn the cattle market around from its yearlong
slump. 

NCA economists say lower retail prices continue to encourage consumption, 

but the bad news is a cyclical increase in cattle and beef production will 
keep pressure on prices. However, though prices on the hoof are still $10 to 
$20 per cwt. below levels seen in 1993 and 1994, the market this fall has 
started to rebound. 

"Fed cattle supplies tightened considerably during early fall and pushed fed
cattle prices into the upper $60 per cwt. by late November," notes James 
Mintert, a livestock economist at Kansas State University-Manhattan. Although 
cattle slaughter is expected to remain above last year's level through the end
of the year, it looks like slaughter supplies will remain tight enough through
the end of 1995 to support fed cattle prices in the mid- to upper- $60s. 

Mintert notes that breakeven prices for the last quarter of 1995 for 750- 
pound steers and 650-pound heifers are projected at $68.50 to $69.50, $2 to $4
per cwt. more than live cattle are fetching at key terminal markets such as
the Texas Panhandle. The rise in average breakeven is due almost exclusively
to this year's rapid runup in grain, oilseed meal and hay prices. Each $10 per
ton change in hay prices, Mintert says, changes feeding cost of gain by 55
cents per cwt. 

As of Nov. 30, there were 8.7 million cattle on feed in the top seven 
producing states, up from the year-ago level of 8.63 million head, and still 
ahead of the five-year Nov. 30 average of 8.64 million head. On-feed 
inventories peaked in April at 8.99 million head, according to USDA. 

The government notes its quarterly view that the number of cattle on feed in
the top 13 states as of Oct. 31 was up 2 percent from a year earlier and is
the second largest for that date since 1975. Feedlot placement in September
rose sharply before declining slightly in October, but are likely to remain
above year-ago levels. Marketings are expected to continue to remain above
year-ago levels into 1996. 

USDA estimates 1995 total U.S. beef production at 25.124 billion pounds, up
from 24.358 billion last year. 

A surge in beef exports will continue, which is a major positive influence on
U.S. beef prices. U.S. beef exports this year hit a record 1.88 billion pounds,
17 percent more than last year. 

More beef entering the domestic market would keep pushing prices down. Average
retail beef prices dropped 2 percent in 1995, according to USDA, and could
drop another 2 percent in 1996. The average retail beef price in 1995 checked
in at $2.60 per pound, with sale prices averaging $2.40 per pound. 

Most cow-calf producers this year experienced their first sizable losses since
1986, according to the National Cattlemen's Association. Most operators will
be unprofitable for another two or three years, and some will leave the 
business, the group says. END

AGWEEK MAGAZINE JUAN MIGUEL PEDRAZA COLUMN

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

RURAL STATES MUST INVEST IN AG RESEARCH, MARKETING Jan. 1--When she takes
over as head of the Northern Crops Institute Jan. 15, Patricia Berglund has a
good dea what she's getting into. The North Dakota State University scientist
sees big times ahead for NCI and other research and marketing organizations in
a post-farm bill world. 

There's no doubt about it -- as governments worldwide ratchet back farm 
spending, farm income will increasingly depend on the markets. What does that 
mean exactly and where do NCI and similar organizations fit in? 

Eventually every penny you earn from every bushel you grow will come from the
price you get at the elevator. Two things come to mind: One, the elevator 
cannot be your sole source of income. Two, to make more money on what you grow,
you'll have to add value to it. On a community level, that means capturing
more of the market's dollars and retaining them at home, rather than exporting
that value to someone who'll cash it all in down the line in Minneapolis or
Chicago. 

NEW STATE OF MIND: As we shift our thinking from farm policy debates into the
real world of business and finance, the ag community must refocus its efforts
at home. That means substantially more local support for organizations like
NCI, Minnesota's Agricultural Utilization and Research Institute and Kansas
State University's international grains institute. 

Here's where the going might get rough. Though we appreciate the efforts of
policy research groups like congressionally funded Food and Agriculture Policy
Research Institute, in the real world where every dollar of profit must be
sweated from the market, their work will be increasingly marginalized. 

In other words, we're looking for real-world products and marketing ideas, not
long-range forecasts. The tough decision will come in apportioning a shrinking
pot of dollars among policy-oriented and market-oriented research facilities.
As we look to our bottom lines, the market-oriented organizations should
likely win the lion's share of that money. 

BREAD AND BUTTER PRACTICALITY: We need economists to give us some sense about
what we're doing, but the fact is over the past 50 years -- since economic
forecasting first became popular in the post-Keynesian world -- economists
have racked up a dismal record for accuracy. When you're looking to butter
your bread, you need less think-tanking about policy and a lot more practical
ideas about where the bread and butter are. 

That's great news for Berglund and NCI, and their colleagues at other 
market-oriented research and promotion organizations. But they won't get their
meal tickets without a fight. Whatever else she's got on her plate, 

Berglund and other NCI-type leaders will have to set aside a significant chunk
of time and energy to lobby local legislatures, farm groups and development
authorities to make sure that they can continue their vital work. 

After all, in a free market, everyone has to compete. And unless you can prove
you've got what it takes to make money, you're not likely to get much money. 

From our vantage point here, we see tremendous potential for NCI, for 
Agricultural Utilization and Research Institute, for the land grant colleges 
in our area, to materially contribute to the future success of the many 
agribusiness ventures that have yet to sprout. Whatever else we do with our 
money, we need to assure that Berglund and her colleagues nationwide get what 
they need to help us succeed.

PORK PRODUCERS HAVE RECORD YEAR IN '95

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--America's pork producers cranked out a record 17.86 billion pounds
this year, a bit more than last year's 17.7, but well below the 18.5 billion
pounds projected earlier this year. 

The numbers reflect lower market hog inventories this year, connected in part
to the rapid inflation in feed costs. Cash break-even prices are projected to
average in the low $40s per cwt. and are likely to continue rising this winter,
according to USDA economist Steve Reed. 

But despite rising grain prices, Reed says, producers are on gradually 
expanding their herds again. The number sows farrowing from September through 
next February is projected to be about the same as a year earlier. However, a 
larger pig crop is likely during this period since more pigs are being saved 
per litter. 

The good news for pork, like in beef, is exports. Record pork exports last
year had a significant impact on the industry's bottom line. 

Export sales of U.S. pork and pork variety meats in 1994 accounted foir about
6 percent of the wholesale value of total U.S. pork production, up from 5.3
percent in the early 1990s and six times what exports meant to pork industry's
bottom line a decade ago, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. 

A USMEF-sponsored study shows that hog prices in the United States benefit
substantially from increased overseas demand for U.S. pork. Total export sales
of pork last year added $3.32 per cwt. to the value of slaughter hogs, up from
a 79-cent contribution 10 years ago. 

U.S. pork exports last year totaled a record 284,000 metric tons, or 626 
million pounds, and are expected to stay on track this year. The industry's 
growth in foreign markets is just beginning, says USMEF's Philip Seng. 

"We see potential for U.S. pork export sales of more than $1.2 billion in the
year 2001, and that's just around the corner," he says. 

That foreign demand for pork has kept hog prices steady through the 
traditional early winter market decline, according to the S.D. Pork Producers 
Council. Top market hogs sold for up to $46.75 a cwt. in Sioux Falls last week,
the highest price since October. It was more than $18 higher than the 
late-November drop in 1994 when top hogs in Sioux Falls sold for $28.50. 

"Historically, right after Thanksgiving is pretty much the seasonal low in our
markets," says Hurley farmer Steve Schmeichel, president of the South Dakota
Pork Producers Council. "The good news is that's been here and past." 

Schmeichel says an active export market and increased slaughter capacity at
packing houses helped keep pork moving at good prices. For the first time in
more than 40 years, the United States was a net exporter of pork this year. 

And pork exports should continue to increase along with the world population,
said Tom Farnsworth of Madison, executive secretary of the pork producers. 

"When you look outside the United States, pork is the meat of choice," 
Farnsworth says. "We expect our pork exports to triple in the next three to 
four years."

SOYBEAN PRICES STAGE YEAR-END RALLY

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--The soybean market is traditionally the most volatile of all the ag
commodities except maybe pork bellies. This year, beans were the laggards, 
with production numbers limiting the rally. 

Eventually, though, the market caught up with the reality in field: U.S. 
output was shortened by moisture, though not as badly as other crops. USDA has
estimated the U.S. 1995 soybean harvest at 2.183 billion bushels, down 13 
percent from 2.731 billion the previous year. 

That redution, not as dramatic as the plunge in corn output, set the stage for
a big year-end rally linked to drought in Brazil, the world's No. 2 soybean
exporter. The result is that farmers are feeling bullish, holding onto what
they've got and forcing the market to push bids up to pry loose available
supplies. 

Some merchants believe farmers have set a near-term goal of $7.50 a bushel for
soybeans, with handful of diehard bulls calling for double-digit dollar
figures for soybeans by spring. Soybeans have traded above $10 a bushel only
once this century, following the discovery in the 1972 to '73 season of the
Pacific Ocean current warming system known as El Nino. 

USDA economists aren't that optimistic, but they do argue that strong domestic
demand and energetic overseas buying are supporting U.S. soybean prices.
USDA's November supply-demand report pushed the average farmgate price of
soybeans for 1995 to '96 at $6.30 to $7.30 per bushel, up from $5.45 per
bushel last season and an average of $6.40 in 1993. 

The action in soybeans has pushed up prices all across the oilseed front, 
with sunflowers, safflower and canola all enjoying rallies this year. 

World vegetable oil prices continued relatively strong this year, though the
crush for meal following sharply increased feed grain prices has caused a 
short-term glut of vegoil in many markets. 

USDA says soymeal prices will average $197.50 to $222.50 per short ton (10
cents to 11 cents per pound), well ahead of year-ago levels. Still, because
the soymeal-to-corn price ratio remains favorable, and because livestock
(especially pork and poultry) output is rising, the government sees modest
growth in demand for meal. 

On the oil side, the equation is not as good largely because China, the big
buyer in 1995, has sharply curtailed purchases this year. The Chinese have
planted and harvested high-oil content crops, including soybeans, peanuts and
sunflowers and they still have stocks left over from last year's vegoil import
binge, USDA says. END

AGWEEK MAGAZINE COWBOY LOGIC COLUMN

By Ryan M. Taylor, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

NEW YEAR'S FORTUNE: SAVINGS AND SATISFACTION AHEAD TOWNER, N.D.--Jan. 1--I
was a little worried about my financial future after tallying up my year end
pluses and minuses. The bottom of my tally sheet had a pretty sizable number
inside a pair of brackets -- brackets mean a big fat minus and denote red ink
for those of us without a color printer. 

But then I got a letter in the mail and all my financial fretting flew right
out the window. The folks at Fortune magazine were ready to lend me a hand and
extend to me the tools necessary to make 1996 a banner year for both me and my
banker. 

I had no fear that this might be a letter they'd send to just any over- 
extended rancher in Smokey Lake (N.D.) Township. The letter said, "We're 
conducting a nationwide search to attract leading business professionals and 
key decision-makers, and your name was referred to us from the Towner City 
(N.D.) area." 

Wow! All those leading business professional to choose from in the entire U.S.
of A. and little ol' me was referred by the Towner (population 669) City area!
It's not often that us Towner suburbanites in Smokey Lake Township get 
referrals from the big wigs in the Towner City area. Not for everybody 

This offer definitely wasn't for just any Jack out in the countryside. The
envelope said, "The enclosed Professional Discount Voucher is for the express
use of the person named herein and is nontransferable." 

The publisher had authorized Brian Wolfe, consumer marketing director, to give
me 74 percent off the newsstand price, send me a free guide full of 
breakthrough ideas and unconventional tactics, and guarantee my satisfaction 
because of my "status as a business professional" (in the Towner City area). 

I could see that making that kind of offer to the general public would 
probably lose fortune's for Fortune magazine. But cutting someone like myself 
in on the deal made a lot of sense. 

I'm sure their advertisers would be phoning in almost immediately and 
increasing their promotional budget with them once the big orders started 
rolling in from the Taylor Ranch. 

Brian said Fortune would help me grow my business (heavier calves and taller
grass), motivate my staff (optimistic cows and horses chomping at the bit,
ready to work), and maintain my edge (not settling to be just another broke
cattleman, but be the best damn broke cattleman there is). What the heck 

Even with the professional rate, I had second thoughts about spending any 
money on anything, what with the cattle market down in the basement and all. 
You can't fall for every smooth talking salesman whose snake oil, or magazine 
subscription, will cure all ills. 

But, then again, like Oscar Wilde said, a cynic is someone who knows the price
of everything and the value of nothing. 

So, without cynicism, the new year brings new optimism, new hope and, most
importantly, a new operating loan. A professionally discounted Fortune 
magazine subscription could be the first chip off the old 1996 borrowed 
capital block. 

Besides, I spotted the little box to check that said "Bill me later." It's a
popular option for us leading business professionals in the Towner City area.

WEATHER HAMPERED FALL POTATO HARVEST IN PARTS OF MINNESOTA, NORTH DAKOTA

Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--Weather conditions varied in North Dakota and Minnesota producing 
record crops in some areas and below average crops in other areas. 

The 1995 fall potato harvest was hampered, especially in northwestern 
Minnesota and parts of North Dakota by rain and sloppy fields. The weather 
kept some growers harvesting late into the fall, while others had to abandon 
fields. 

Storage has also been a problem for growers who may have harvested late blight
infected potatoes. Those potatoes are more susceptible to diseases like soft
rot that can cause potatoes to breakdown in storage. 

Late blight was especially prevalent in irrigated potatoes. Growers will
continue to closely monitor storage bins to try to head off any problems. 

Growing conditions in North Dakota throughout the year weren't good enough to
match the record breaking yields harvested in 1994. 

Some growers blamed hot temperatures in June and too much rain in July for the
smaller yields. 

Yields averaged 210 hundredweight per acre in 1995, down from the record 235
cwt. per acre harvested in 1994. 

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, North Dakota production 
totaled 25.4 million hundred pound bags of potatoes in 1995, compared to 28.2 
million cwt. the previous year. North Dakota growers harvested 121,000 acres 
in 1995, compared to 120,000 acres the previous year. Record breaking year 

But the reverse occured in Minnesota where growers harvested record yields on
their summer and fall crops in 1995. 

Minnesota growers dug up record yields in 1995 averaging 270 cwt. per acre,
which was slightly higher than the previous record of 269 cwt. per acre set in
1994, according to USDA. Minnesota growers produced 20.8 million cwt. in 1995,
compared to 20 million cwt. the previous year. Harvested acreage in Minnesota
was pegged at 77,000 acres, up from 74,600 acres in 1994. 

Total U.S. fall and summer potato production was down in 1995 at 402 million
cwt., compared to 426 million cwt. produced in 1994. Yields averaged 334 cwt.
per acre, down from 352 cwt. per acre the previous year. 

The smaller U.S. crop has kept Red River Valley prices higher in 1995 than the
previous year. 

According to USDA's Market News, prices for No. 1 size A washed round red 
potatoes are at $8.50 to $9 per cwt., compared to $7 to $7.50 per cwt. for the
same time period time in 1994.

'SIGNIFICANT ENFORCEMENT HAMMER' IS NEEDED TO BACK UP HOUSE 
COMMITTEE FOOD ADDITIVE REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS:  McINTOSH AND 
SOUDER

The enforcement mechanisms for the recommendations in "The 
FDA Food Additive Review Process:  Backlog and Failure to 
Observe Statutory Deadline," the Government Reform and 
Oversight Committee's recent report, are inadequate, 
committee members Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) and Rep. Mark 
Souder (R-Ind.) said in "additional views" printed with the 
report  (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 18, Page 41).

Both McIntosh and Souder are freshman legislators; McIntosh 
has been active in the House efforts to enact regulatory 
reform legislation and repeal the Delaney clause (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Nov. 20, Page 16).

"Currently, the Food and Drug Administration's delay in 
approving food additives is caused by inertia within the 
agency," McIntosh and Souder noted, adding:  "While that 
inertia can be somewhat alleviated through instructions to 
do better, I am convinced that it cannot be eliminated 
without a significant enforcement hammer.   I am 
particularly concerned that the recommendations include a 
relaxation of the statutory deadline for a decision on a 
food additive from 180 to 360 days.  While relaxing the 
statutory deadline makes some sense, it also makes sense to 
transform it into a meaningful one."

If the time frames in the report were expected to be 360 
days, then after a brief period -- 90 days perhaps  -- the 
statute should provide FDA with three options, the Indiana 
representatives said.  Those options are:  (1)  issue a 
regulation approving the use of the additive; (2) disapprove 
the use of the additive, but only if FDA can demonstrate 
that an additive has not been found to be safe; or (3) if 
FDA fails to do either, the additive is deemed to be 
approved.

"In this way, FDA is provided with an incentive to engage in 
a real cost/benefit analysis in the allocation of its 
resources," they added, noting:  "... unless hammers such as 
this one are incorporated into the regulatory schemes we 
have developed, we are destined to see agencies fail to meet 
statutory deadlines and justify their failures with claims 
of too much work and too few resources."

Six Report Recommendations Include Elimination of Pending 
Petitions' Backlog within One Year

The report's six recommendations were:  

-- Congress should amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act review period for food additive petitions from 180 to 
360 days for the most scientifically complex reviews, and 
the deadline should be strictly observed by FDA;  

FDA should recognize that the approval of useful and safe 
new products can be as important to the public health as 
preventing the marketing of harmful or ineffective products; 

FDA should eliminate the backlog of pending food additive 
petitions within one year by reallocating the necessary 
agency resources; 

FDA should utilize outside expertise in its evaluation of 
food additive petitions but retain authority for petition 
approval; 

the relevance of the Delaney clause should be studied in 
view of modern scientific standards so that better 
distinctions can be made between nominal hazards and actual 
risks, and 

FDA should amend the review process to prohibit anonymous 
submission of data or comments.  ((6FCN 4602, 14 pages, $8)

WEBB TECHNICAL GROUP TAKES FSIS CONTRACT DISPUTE TO SEN. 
HELMS 

Raleigh-based Webb Technical Group, Inc. urged North 
Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms (R) to step in and prevent the 
Food Safety and Inspection Service from cancelling a meat 
and poultry analysis contract (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Aug. 
28, Page 26).  

The firm alleges that FSIS made the decision without 
conducting the necessary cost-benefit analysis.

Webb said the contract cancellation would result in the loss 
of 17 jobs, waste hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars, 
and threaten meat and poultry safety.  


"It has been suggested that the real savings planned by FSIS 
is to eliminate this work, which would further violate the 
intent of Congress to assure a safe and wholesome food 
supply for U.S. consumers," Board Chairman Neil Webb said in 
a recent letter to Helms.

"Either FSIS has a hidden agenda, or they just don't know 
what they are doing," Webb stated.  "Either way, we would 
appreciate some help in getting to the bottom of this."

According to the firm, Webb has conducted residue and 
compositional testing for FSIS for the past 13 years -- 
specifically, monitoring the meat supply for economic fraud 
and verifying the safety of domestic and imported meat 
products.  On July 25, 1995, Webb was advised that FSIS 
would not renew the contract "due to change in the program 
requirements."  Webb said it found out that FSIS had planned 
to analyze all meat and poultry food chemistry samples in 
its Technical Services laboratories beginning next fiscal 
year.

Webb said the government never proved that such a decision 
would be fiscally sound.  In October, FSIS responded that it 
had not violated procurement regulations when it dropped the 
contract, and that FSIS would be using new technology and 
upgrading equipment at its own laboratories to increase 
efficiency.  Webb argued that USDA guidelines barred the 
North Carolina firm from using new alternate technologies. 

Webb asked for a meeting with Helms' staff on the issue, and 
asked the senator to contact USDA Secretary Dan Glickman "to 
get to the bottom of the situation."  ((6FCN 4604, 19 pages,

USDA 'WHOLESOMENESS' SEAL SHOULD BE DROPPED, WARNING LABEL 
ADDED TO CURED MEATS, GROUPS SAY IN PETITION TO FSIS

Jeremy Rifkin's Foundation on Economic Trends and the 
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine have filed a 
petition with USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service 
seeking removal of the "wholesomeness" seal, stronger 
language on safe handling labels and a warning label on 
cured meat products.

USDA received the petition Oct. 26 but did not place it on 
file in the hearing clerk's office until recently.  The 
groups had been considering suing USDA to stop use of the 
"wholesomeness" seal; the petition cites legal precedents 
and the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) as the basis for 
the groups' claims (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, July 31, Page 
2).

The petition, written by FET's Theodore Waugh and the 
Physicians Committee's Andrew Nicholson, cites the risk to 
consumers from E. coli O157:H7 as the basis for the groups' 
requests.  "The risk of serious permanent physical injury 
and death, USDA's inability to safeguard the meat supply and 
the lack of medical preparedness indicate both the 
seriousness and extent of the E. coli problem," the petition 
said, adding, "Until effective control measures are 
developed to eliminate E. coli contamination, USDA needs to 
take further actions to protect consumers and conform with 
its statutory obligations."

The petitioners misstated the scope of USDA's declaration 
that E. coli O157:H7 was an adulterant.  The USDA 
declaration applied only to raw ground beef; the petition 
said that "USDA has determined that E. coli-contaminated 
meats are 'adulterated.'"

The petition quoted the FMIA as saying, "It is essential in 
the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers 
be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products 
distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated ... 
Unwholesome, adulterated and/or misbranded meat and meat 
food products ... result in ... injury to consumers."

"Thus, according to USDA's own regulations, only meats 
lacking E. coli contamination can be labeled 'Inspected and 
Passed,'" the petition said, adding, "Because the FMIA 
prohibits misleading and false labeling, the USDA must 
remove the 'Inspected and Passed' labels from meat products 
until it can conclusively determine that the meat is 
uncontaminated with the adulterant E. coli."

Nicholson and Waugh said that USDA's baseline survey of 
steers and heifers found that "approximately 15% of all raw 
beef samples contain one or more species of pathogens " (See 
FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Feb. 7, 1994, Page 60).  They also cited 
a Sept. 22 ABC News "20/20" show that quoted "USDA doctors" 
as saying that "probably one out of every thousand 
hamburgers contains E. coli bacteria."

The petition also said that USDA has admitted its sampling 
program for E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef "cannot 
eliminate E. coli from the food supply."

Safe Handling Labels Inadequate, Cured Meats Should Have 
Warning Labels, Groups Say

"It is clear the number of outbreaks has remained high or 
continued to grow even with USDA's safe care and handling 
labels," the groups said, adding, "In light of the 
continuing number of E. coli outbreaks, it is necessary for 
USDA to improve the current safe handling labels."  The 
labels should state the consequences of undercooking, the 
petition said, explaining:

"How can consumers adapt their behavior to meet the 
seriousness of the health risk when they are uninformed of 
the potential consequences?  For all a purchaser knows, the 
only illness resulting from contamination is an upset 
stomach.  If individuals knew that kidney failure and death 
were potential side effects, they would take the warnings 
with the degree of seriousness that the hazard requires."

The petitioners recommended a new safe handling label that 
would begin:  "WARNING: This product may contain E. coli 
bacteria, which can cause serious illness, including:  
death, strokes, seizures, bloody diarrhea, renal failure, 

red blood cell destruction."  Anyone suffering from 
abdominal cramps or diarrhea a few days after consumption 
should consult a physician immediately, the label would 
recommend, as well as stating that the product should be 
cooked until no red color remains, to a minimum temperature 
of 155 F.  

The labels should be bigger and in larger type than the 
current ones, the petitioners said.

They called for a similar warning for cured meat products, 
noting that "it has become clear that E. coli contamination 
can survive the curing process. ... In light of this 
potential danger, USDA should warn consumers of cured meat's 
potential dangers, and at the very least, the agency must 
remove the 'Inspected and Passed' labels from cured meat 
products until it can be certain that the meat is not 
adulterated with E. coli."

"If USDA ignores this request, the agency will have acted in 
an arbitrary and capricious manner in violation of the 
Administrative Procedures Act," the petitioners said.

MOLD CONTENT OF SEVERAL TYPES OF COMMERCIAL POPCORN 
DETERMINED

Noting a general lack of information on molds in popcorn, 
researchers undertook a study of the mold content of popcorn 
in commercial channels, reporting their findings in the 
September 1995 issue of the Journal of Food Protection.

Sarath Katta and colleagues, University of Nebraska, 
Lincoln, Nebr., determined the internal mold infection 
levels of various microwave and nonmicrowave popcorn by 
direct plating of kernels on Dichloran-rose bengal-
chloramphenicol agar (DRBC), Dichloran-18% glycerol agar 
(DG-18), Aspergillus flavus/parasiciticus agar (AFPA) and 
Czapek's iprodione agar (CZID).

The total percentage of mold-infected kernels was low in 
microwave yellow popcorn (5.9%) and nonmicrowave yellow 
popcorn (7.3%), but somewhat higher in specialty popcorn 
(13.6%) and nonmicrowave white popcorn (15.1%), according to 
the report.

Of the molds found, Fusarium species predominated in the 
microwave yellow popcorn (54.2%) and nonmicrowave white 
popcorn (66.2%), whereas Aspergillus species predominated in 
the nonmicrowave yellow popcorn (43.8%) and specialty popcorn 
(52.9%).  Negligible amounts of Aspergillus flavus-
parasiticus molds were found in the samples evaluated.

No significant differences were found among media in 
enumerating total mold infection levels.  DG-18 was 
effective in enumerating Aspergillus species, but 
ineffective for Fusarium species, the researchers reported.  
They recommended that either AFPA or CZID be used to 
determine the total percentage of mold infection levels in 
popcorn.

Effects of Storage Conditions on Popcorn Mold Content 
Assessed

Also in the same issue, Katta and Lloyd Bullerman, also of 
the University of Nebraska, reported their findings on a 
study of the effects of high temperature and relative 
humidity, as well as packaging, on the mold content and 
quality of stored popcorn.

White and yellow popcorn were stored in different containers 
at high temperature (35 C) and high relative humidity (85%) 
for three months.  Gradual decreases in popping volumes with 
the lengthening of storage time were observed in both white 
and yellow popcorn, the researchers reported.

Few differences were found in total infection levels up to 
60 days of storage, except that the Aspergillus glaucus 
group became established in place of field fungi.  A gradual 
increase in mold infection levels was then observed during 
the remaining 30 days of storage.  Visible mold growth was 
also observed on the tops of some kernels by the end of 
storage studies, according to the report.

Internal mold infection in white popcorn stored in an open 
container was lower (18.3%) than in white popcorn stored in a 
closed plastic bag (75%) and closed plastic jar (85.3%), 
whereas the internal mold infection in yellow popcorn stored 
in an open container was higher (23.3%) than in yellow 
popcorn stored in a closed plastic bag (6.3%) and closed 
plastic jar (2.6%), the report stated.

Mycoflora of Various Cereal Flakes Determined

German researchers examined 12 brands of cereal flakes for 
their qualitative and quantitative mold contamination, 
reporting their findings in the July 1995 issue of the same 
journal.

M. Weidenborner and B. Kunz, of the Universitat Bonn, in 
Bonn, Germany, reported higher fungal counts in two wheat 
and one oat flake samples, while the remaining brands showed 
minor contamination rates.

The fungal flora consisted of 64 different species belonging 
to 23 fungal genera, with fungi of the Eurotium, Aspergillus 
and Penicillium predominant in most samples, according to the 
report.

To obtain a comprehensive evaluation, the mycoflora of 
foodstuffs should be investigated on at least three 
different media, the researchers concluded.

Simplified Method for Aflatoxin Extraction From Peanuts 
Reported

Also in the same issue, researchers reported a simplified 
method for extraction of aflatoxin from peanut meal and 
kernels by CO2-methanol, using a highly pressurized fluid 
extraction process.

Pei-Yin Wu, Da Yeh Institute of Technology, Changhwa, 
Taiwan, and Robin Chiou, National Chiayi Institute of 
Agriculture, Chiayi, Taiwan, used peanut kernels infected 
with Aspergillus parasiticus after milling into meals as a 
naturally contaminated material for investigating the 
efficacy of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) as a 
technique for removing aflatoxin.  Methanol solutions (60% 
and 100%) were used to modify the properties of the 
extraction media, and extraction parameters such as 
pressure, methanol concentration, methanol/peanut meal ratio 
and holding time were extensively investigated.

Results using this technique were comparable to those 
obtained using a commercialized immunochemical method, 
according to the report.

FDA PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
DESCRIBED IN POLICY STATEMENT

In response to inquiries concerning its use of confidential 
information in rulemaking, the Food and Drug Administration 

Dec. 27 published a "Statement of Procedures for Handling 
Confidential Information in Rulemaking."  

The cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies questioned FDA 
policy following the agency's August 1995 publication of a 
proposed rule concerning regulation of nicotine-containing 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.  Noting that the 
statement was developed to address this industry's specific 
concerns, the agency said the procedures described reflect 
docket management procedures "long used" by FDA in 
rulemaking.    

According to the statement, FDA does not make available 
trade secret information, confidential commercial 
information or other information "whose disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy."  In 
addition, no information that would "reveal the identity of 
confidential sources" would be placed into a public docket, 
the agency noted.  

While trying to assure that "clearly proprietary 
information" is not "unwittingly made available," FDA 
advised that information submitted to a public docket does 
not carry a "reasonable expectation of confidentiality."  
The agency contends it is under "no legal obligation" to 
closely examine submitted documents to determine whether 
they "may contain proprietary information."  

FDA is aware, however, of the "sensitivity and importance" 
of such information, and has "long followed" certain 
procedures to try to ensure that "clearly proprietary 
information" is not made available, the agency said, noting 
that it scans documents for "obvious trade secrets or 
personal privacy information."  

According to the statement, information marked "confidential" 
is referred to the appropriate center's Freedom of Information 
Act officers, FDA added, for a determination as to whether it 
will be exempt under the act from public disclosure.  Before 
any documents containing such "confidential" information are 
placed on public record, the appropriate center consults with 
the person(s) who submitted the documents as to whether it was 
intended that the document be made available to the public, 
the agency said.

NCTR SCIENCE BOARD TO MEET  FOR SITE VISIT REPORT, RESOURCE 
DISCUSSIONS 

The Food and Drug Administration announced Dec. 29, 1995 
that a meeting of the Science Advisory Board to the National 
Center for Toxicological Research will be held Jan. 29 and 
Jan. 30 at NCTR in Jefferson, Ark.  

At the meeting, the board will be given a progress report on a 
recommendation resulting from its Site Visit Team Report on 
NCTR's Analytical Methods Development program.  In addition, a 
presentation will be made and the board will be asked to 
review the center's integration of the eight programs the 
board has visited.  According to the FDA notice, the 
presentation will include a discussion of the resources 
allocated to these programs, as well as their relation to 
NCTR's strategic vision and goals.  

The closed portion of the board's meeting will focus on 
"personal information" concerning individuals involved with 
NCTR's research programs, disclosure of which would 
constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy," FDA noted.  For additional information, contact 
Ronald Coene, NCTR, 301-443-3155.

HEN STRAIN AFFECTS HOW DIET CHANGES LIPIDS IN POULTRY 
PRODUCTS

Fatty acid metabolism may vary between strains of laying 
hens, according to researchers, who observed differences in 
how several strains incorporated a specific polyunsaturated 
acid from their diets.  But the differences were relatively 
small, and in general, PUFA in the diet produced marked 
increases in PUFA in the eggs and meat of the birds, 
according to the researchers' report in the October 1995 
issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.

Geetha Cherian and colleagues, University of Alberta, 
Edmonton, Canada, studied the effects of feeding diets high 
or low in alpha-linolenic acid on the lipid and fatty acid 
composition of the liver and subdermal fat or on products 
such as eggs, white meat and dark meat of six different 
strains of laying hens.

The researchers noted that increasing the polyunsaturated to 
saturated fatty acid ratio of egg yolk or tissue lipids would 
make poultry products more acceptable to health-conscious 
consumers.

Natural Antioxidants as Vegetable Oil Preservatives 
Investigated

Also in the same issue, Spanish researchers reported on 
their investigation into how some naturally formed oxidized 
lipid/amino acid reaction products are able to protect bulk 
vegetable oils against oxidation.

Manuel Alaiz and colleagues, Instituto de la Grasa, CSIC, 
Seville, Spain, undertook a study to determine if the reaction 
products are able to stop or slow a peroxidative process 
initiated in a vegetable oil.

Their findings suggest that some of the reaction products 
might be playing an antioxidative role in foods by delaying 
the peroxidative process at the same time that they are 
being produced, according to the report.  The researchers 
noted that special attention has been given to natural 
antioxidants in recent years because of the possible, but 
not yet proven, hazardous effects of synthetic antioxidants.

Stability of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Egg Powder 
Assessed

High spray-drying temperatures led to a higher loss of many 
polyunsaturated fatty acids in egg powder, according to a 
report in the August 1995 issue of the same journal.

Francesc Guardiola and colleagues, University of Barcelona 
and CSIC, Barcelona, Spain, studied the influence of 
different factors, including spray-drying temperature, kind 
of antioxidant, antioxidant concentration and packing 
conditions on PUFA losses in egg powder stored for 10 
months.

Storage of egg powder under vacuum away from light 
effectively prevents the loss of many PUFA, according to the 
researchers, who also reported that antioxidants may be 
slightly effective in preventing PUFA losses under highly 
oxidative conditions.

The researchers recommended that spray-dried egg yolk not be 
used as a long-chain PUFA source for enriching weaning 
foods, since oxidized fatty acids "lose their essentiality 
and present several harmful biological effects."

Hydrolysis Seen as Major Cause of Deterioration in Frozen 
Trout

Also in the same issue, Swedish researchers reported that 
hydrolysis is the major cause of lipid deterioration in 
frozen farmed rainbow trout fillets.

Torbjorn Ingemansson and colleagues, SIK-The Swedish 
Institute for Food Research, Goteborg, and Karlshamns 
LipidTeknik, Stockholm, Sweden, studied the extent of lipid 
hydrolysis and oxidation in the muscle tissue of frozen 
rainbow trout to elucidate the effects of acclimatization 
temperature and storage time on these mechanisms, using 
multivariate statistical methods.

Lower water temperature during acclimatization (5 C rather 
than 12 C) resulted in reduced lipid stability during frozen 
storage, according to the report.

ACSH WANTS DELANEY REPLACED WITH FLEXIBL  NEW REGULATORY 
PROCESS

The American Council on Science and Health called on 
Congress to repeal the Delaney clause, so that regulatory 
agencies would be free to balance risks against benefits and 
use a more appropriate weight of evidence test in regulating 
food additive risks.

In a new booklet, "Modernize Our Food Safety Laws:  Delete 
the Delaney Clause," ACSH argued that the zero-risk standard 
has been a "scientifically indefensible double standard," 
and that public interest groups who support the measure 
would "lose power" if the measure were repealed.

"Strict enforcement will endanger the food supply, raising 
prices and making it even harder for Americans to consume 
the very fruits and vegetables that have been linked to 
reduced cancer rates and improved health," warned Elizabeth 
Whelan, president of ACSH.

The New York City-based group said a replacement to the 
Delaney clause should provide a flexible regulatory process, 
not a specific standard.  As part of the new process, tumors 
or cancers should not be the sole or even primary regulatory 
concern, ACSH said, explaining:  "Regulators should consider 
a broad range of possible health risks, including cancer."

It may be necessary to legislate that regulators cannot use 
worst-case assumptions in calculating risk except under 
extraordinary circumstances, the group said.  "By piling 
worst-case assumption upon worst-case assumption, regulators 
easily can overestimate risks by multiples of millions," the 
report said.

Regulators should take into account negative and "no effect" 
test results as well as positive results, the report 
recommended, noting that current law only allows regulators 
to consider the positive development of tumors.


Each substance should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, 
and human exposure and epidemiology should be taken into 
account, it added.  "A substance that is toxic to some 
animals is not necessarily toxic to humans, and vice versa," 
the report said.

Such an approach would be far from perfect, the group 
acknowledged, adding:  "But it would come much closer to 
scientific honesty and prioritization of risks than what we 
have now or would be likely to get from any bright-line 
approach."

The report also reviews past applications of the Delaney 
clause, the Environmental Protection Agency's reform 
efforts, "mouse terrorism," and the politics of Delaney 
repeal.  The group rejected the latest attempt to override 
Delaney with an amendment by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) 
to S 343, which was one of the regulatory reform measures.  

"It leaves in place the Delaney clause and does not directly 
amend it, perhaps inviting litigation," ACSH said.  Also, 
the group said the amendment would have set a new standard 
for barring products on account of risk, regardless of its 
benefits.

CSPI RAISES NEW ISSUES WITH OLESTRA FOOD ADDITIVE PETITION

The Center for Science in the Public Interest Jan. 2 
alerted the Food and Drug Administration to new research 
showing beta-carotene's cancer-fighting ability and to the 
new Dietary Guidelines for Americans' recommendations as 
reasons to deny the olestra food additive petition.

CSPI said the latest study by Harinder Garewal of the 
Veterans Administration Medical Center in Tucson involved 
giving 50 patients a daily dose of 60 mg of beta-carotene 
for six months.  Unpublished results found 26 (52%) patients 
responded to beta-carotene, with their oral leukoplakia 
diminishing, CSPI reported. 

"The result is similar to that found in an earlier study by 
Garewal that used half as much beta-carotene," CSPI 
Executive Director Michael Jacobson said.  Garewal said his 
subjects were not deficient in vitamin A.

According to CSPI, intervention trials have demonstrated 
that beta-carotenoid causes regression of oral leukoplakia, 
which is believed to be a precursor of oral cancer.  FDA has 
stated that a critical issue regarding olestra is whether 
carotenoids, blood levels of which are depleted by olestra, 
serve any biological purpose in humans other than beta-
carotene's role as a provitamin A.

CSPI's Jacobson also took the opportunity to point to the 
newly released Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which 
emphasize the importance of carotenoids as cancer-fighters, 
as inconsistent with FDA's action in considering an additive 
that would reduce carotenoid absorption from foods.

Dietary Guidelines Special Mention Of Beta-Carotene Cited

A sister agency in the Department of Health and Human 
Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture deemed 
carotenoids of such importance that a special box lists 
"Some Good Sources of Carotenoids," Jacobson said.

"With that level of recognition that carotenoids appear to 
offer health benefits, it would be extra ironic if the FDA 
approves carotenoid-depleting olestra just weeks after 
release of the new federal nutrition policy," Jacobson told 
FDA.  The agency is expected to issue a regulation on 
olestra in the next month  

Meanwhile, CSPI submitted lengthy comments to the olestra 
petition Dec. 21 after the group convinced the agency to 
extend the comment deadline (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 
18, Page 13).  

CSPI had asked for the deadline extension based on two new 
studies:  a study on water content of stools, and a large 
home-use study of olestra snacks.  CFSAN was aware of the 
home-use study but chose to ignore it, said FDA Deputy 
Commissioner for Policy William Schultz in a Dec. 8 letter.  
But the agency agreed to permit CSPI to submit comments on 
the newly available stool water content data.  

CSPI filed its comments focusing on olestra's depletion of 
carotenoids and gastrointestinal disturbances after 
reviewing the transcript of the November Food Advisory 
Committee meeting.

Failure to Give Advisory Committee Full Review of Carotenoid 
Data Hit

CSPI argued that the views of Procter & Gamble and "its few 
hired experts on carotenoids" were not consistent with 
experts "who share our concerns about the likely adverse 
impact on health of depletion of carotenoids, and experts 
who have expressed their concern about the likely adverse 
impact on public health of allowing olestra onto the 
market."

The advocacy group reiterated charges that CFSAN staff had 
failed to provide the working group and Food Advisory 
Committee with data needed for an informed decision on 
carotenoid's role in health protection.

"We disagree strongly with the CFSAN staff's decision not to 
provide committee members and the Commissioner with a full 
review of data on carotenoids, since several members of the 
working group and Food Advisory Committee stated that they 
found the question of carotenoids to be the most difficult 
one they faced, and all data bearing on the health effects 
of carotenoids should have been provided to the panels."  
The group added, "We trust that the in vitro, animal, 
clinical, epidemiological, and intervention-trial data will 
be reviewed by the Commissioner when he is considering what 
action he will take regarding olestra." 

CSPI also suggested that CFSAN staff not carry out the 
review, "given that staff's inadequate treatment of those 
important research data."

The group found CFSAN's report on olestra "completely 
ignored a large and growing body" of research on the role of 
carotenoids in protecting health.  Included was a study 
appearing in the Dec. 6, 1995, issue of the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute on the link to consuming lycopene-
rich tomato products and the reduced risk of prostate cancer 
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 11, Page 10).

"While that study did not prove that lycopene protects 
against prostate cancer, the findings are very important in 
evaluating olestra, because lycopene is the most lipophilic 
carotenoid and the carotenoid most severely depleted by 
olestra and by the sucrose polyester used in the recent 
Dutch study," CSPI commented, adding:  "Since lycopene is 
abundant in tomatoes, it is of obvious concern that savory 
snacks containing olestra may well be eaten with tomato-
containing meals."

CSPI reiterated charges that carotenoid levels are likely to 
be reduced significantly by olestra, despite claims by 
Procter & Gamble, and that between-meal consumption of 
olestra would have some impact on carotenoids.

On the issue of gastrointestinal disturbances, CSPI charged 
members of a working group on olestra and the Food Advisory 
Committee with defining "out of existence the diarrhea 
caused by olestra."  The comments added, "There was very 
little discussion of the numerous other gastrointestinal 
disturbances associated with consumption of olestra, and, 
since diarrhea was likely the most serious of the symptoms, 
by concluding that olestra did not cause diarrhea, it then 
became fairly simple for the panels to reach a conclusion of 
'no harm.'"

The group concluded that FDA should deny the olestra 
petition because evidence suggests that "depletion of 
carotenoids presents a clear risk of harm to public health, 
and there is absolutely no way that a conclusion can be 
drawn that there would be a 'reasonable certainty of no 
harm' if carotenoid absorption was reduced by olestra."

CSPI also took aim at the legal burden of proof that the 
group said has been inappropriately switched to government 
authorities who must prove olestra is harmful.  "Those 
people heard the evidence demonstrating that olestra reduces 
serum levels of carotenoids and the evidence that 
carotenoids reduce risks of cancer, heart disease and 
macular degeneration, yet because there was not proof that 
carotenoids are beneficial, many of them said that olestra 
is safe." 

According to the group, the lucky consumers will be those 
who experience gastrointestinal problems once olestra foods 
become available and stop eating such foods, so "their 
carotenoid intake would no longer be threatened."




Procter & Gamble Questions APHA Olestra Review

On a related note, Procter & Gamble criticized the American 
Public Health Association's conclusions on the pending 
olestra petition (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 4, Page 19) in 
a Nov. 28 letter to APHA Executive Director Fernando Trevino.  
"Quite frankly, the November 14 letter from APHA was a 
surprise to us, and it is unfortunate that APHA has taken a 
position on olestra's use in snack foods without a full 
appreciation of the data," the petitioner said.

The company said APHA seemed to have little interest in 
olestra before P&G had an opportunity to provide a "cursory 
one-hour overview" of the olestra research program to an 
APHA health protection analyst.  "A one-hour overview is not 
a sufficient basis on which to judge the more than 150,000 
pages of research data that comprise the olestra food 
additive petition," the firm said.  

Comprehensive clinical testing answered key concerns about 
the long-term public health impact of olestra snack foods, 
said the firm, including confirmed safety in people who are 
more likely to eat lower fat foods than the average person 
and safety in people with gastrointestinal diseases.  Procter 
& Gamble responded to APHA's concerns in the 13-page letter.

Procter & Gamble's Christopher Hassall offered to meet with 
APHA to review the research in detail. ((6FCN 4603, 103

CONSUMER COMMENTS OPPOSING APPROVAL  FLOOD OLESTRA FILE

More than 700 comments have filled the olestra file at FDA's 
dockets management branch, the vast majority from consumers 
urging the agency not to approve the fat substitute.

While many of the comments were form letters inspired by the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest's campaign to keep 
olestra out of the food supply (See preceding story), others 
were generated by press reports of the four-day FDA Food 
Advisory  Committee meeting in November held by FDA to 
consider the data on olestra (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS,  Nov. 
20, Pages 17 and 31, and Nov. 27, Page 3).  The comment 
period on the petition ended Dec. 21.

A letter from Terry and Joanie Davis of Eagan, Minn., for 
example, cited a wire service story of the meeting, asking 
FDA, "Why allow the sale of a food product that will 
increase the likelihood of sickness for some and increase 
health care costs for all?"

They noted that a suggested warning label should be required 
to be printed "in no less than 10 point font for the sight 
impaired," but added, "Unfortunately, this won't help the 
unsuspecting guest eater at restaurants or picnics unless 
the server has a conscience and remembers to warn them."

Phytochemical Investigator Urges Denial of Petition

A researcher investigating the anti-cancer potential of 
phytochemicals warned FDA not to approve the pending food 
additive petition for olestra, predicting that use of the 
product may have a negative health impact.

Jed Fahey, faculty research associate with the Brassica 
Chemoprotection Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins School of 
Medicine, said he was "distressed" by the data indicating 
that olestra may reduce absorption of many fat-soluble 
vitamins.  "There are a great number of other, fat-soluble 
phytochemicals, some of which we are investigating in my 
laboratory for their anti-cancer potential," Fahey said, 
adding, "Many of them have yet to even be isolated in pure 
form and are therefore unavailable for testing."

"The inclusion of olestra in commonly consumed American 
foods has a high probability of effecting the wholesale 
reduction of a multiplicity of beneficial compounds from the 
diet of a great many Americans," the letter to FDA 
Commissioner Dr. David Kessler said, adding, "Based on 
overwhelming epidemiological evidence, there is a high 
probability that the use of this product would have a 
negative health impact."

Comments from the American Diabetes Association and the 
American Heart Association took no specific stand on whether 
FDA should approve olestra.  ADA said it supports the 
development and introduction into the marketplace of food 
products that help people lose or maintain weight, but added 
that it "looks to and respects the FDA review process for 
assurance of product safety."  AHA encouraged FDA to 
continue the review of all fat replacers.  The group noted 
that many products on the market labeled as "reduced fat" 
have significant amounts of mono- and diglycerides, which 
are a source of calories and are metabolized as fat.

Comments Commend Conduct of Advisory Committee Meeting

The comments of a variety of researchers supporting approval 
of the fat substitute -- some of which were sent in by 
Procter & Gamble, the petition's sponsor --  were also 
included in the FDA administrative file on olestra.  Many of 
these letters included positive comments about the conduct 
of the four-day Food Advisory Committee meeting.

The American Dietetic Association said one of its 
representatives attended the advisory committee and working 
group meetings on olestra, adding, "We believe that the 
process allowed for a full airing of ADA's views on this 
matter.  We fully support the FAC review process, including 
its interpretation of the data and consideration of public 
comment."

A co-discoverer of olestra, Dr. Fred Mattson, professor of 
medicine emeritus at the University of California in San 
Diego, noted that as early work on the compound progressed, 
"I came to the conclusion that olestra posed no hazard as a 
food ingredient."

"Subsequent studies have served to strengthen this opinion," 
Mattson said.  He noted that olestra "is now supported by a 
much wider range of studies, and now many of these are on 
human subjects.  Moreover, the level of use is inherently 
limited by the nature of the food products in which it will 
be used."

Nutritionist Johanna Dwyer of Tufts University said her 
interest in fat substitutes such as olestra led her to 
independently review some of the studies in the peer-
reviewed literature.  Later, she was asked by P&G to review 
and edit two papers for publication on consumption models 
and use of the pig and other data for assessing human 
effects of consuming olestra.  Noting a specific interest in 
gastrointestinal effects, Dwyer said she requested and 
received additional information on GI effects, and devoted 
particular attention to what might be expected at very high 
levels of intake.

At Dwyer's request, P&G sent her blinded samples of olestra-
containing potato chips and regular potato chips in amounts 
that would constitute the 95th percentile of intake.  Dwyer 
said she ate these potato chips in a single bolus amount for 
a meal on two separate days and subsequently recorded her 
own views of signs and symptoms of GI distress.  "I felt 
more GI distress when eating the regular potato chips, and 
did not record any differences in stool consistency in this 
brief experiment," Dwyer wrote.  She noted that very high 
chronic use might produce changes in the consistency of the 
stool, but it is "inappropriate to describe these changes as 
diarrhea."

Dwyer said she concluded that the product "is safe and may 
provide a benefit to some consumers who wish to eat low fat, 
low saturated fat salty snacks."  She added that the FDA 
evaluation process and the advisory committee deliberations 
"were reasonable, thorough and helpful."

Dr. Harry Greene, clinical professor of pediatrics at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he attended the 
advisory committee meeting in November and was "extremely 
impressed with the presentations by the FDA scientists and 
the presentations by the expert consultants brought in by 
FDA in providing an unbiased and scientific approach to the 
relevant studies which have been performed with olestra."

CSPI Took Data Out of Context, Researcher Charges

Greene criticized presentations by the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, saying much of the data "was taken out 
of context" or "completely misinterpreted due to a lack of 
scientifically acceptable statistical evaluation, and in 
many instances was anecdotal."  In contrast, he said, "the 
data presented by Procter & Gamble scientists represented 
clear examples of well controlled, scientifically credible 
studies."

Greene said the chairman of the advisory committee made sure 
that CSPI had an equal opportunity to present its 
objections.

Also charging that CSPI took data out of context, Dr. 
Michael Davidson, medical director of the Chicago Center for 
Clinical Research at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical 
Center, noted that the clinical studies by P&G "were 
purposely designed to assess the extreme intakes of olestra 
in subjects of various body sizes and dietary habits."  
Davidson pointed out that olestra "was used to replace 
almost 50% of the daily fat intake for those in the 32-gram 
dose group," which he said "included petite young women who 
were unaccustomed to large intake of non-digestible food."

"The vast majority of subjects with gastrointestinal events 
were women who would rarely consume 32 grams of olestra on 
a single day, yet were fed 32 grams daily for eight weeks," 
Davidson added.  He noted that approval of olestra "has 
significant health implications for the entire U.S. 
population," since high fat consumption is a leading cause 
of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and obesity.

Researcher Reports Positive Response to Olestra in 
Nutrition Education Study

Dr. John Foreyt of the Baylor College of Medicine in 
Houston said he conducted a study on the use of olestra in 
a nutrition education program.  Female adults were randomly 
assigned to either an olestra or non-olestra group, and 
various food products containing olestra, including 
shortening, potato chips, oven-ready french fries, and a 
mayonnaise-type salad, were made available as part of an 
overall nutrition education program, Foreyt said.  
"Response to the product was positive," he commented, 
noting that subjects in both groups reduced their dietary 
fat consumption to approximately 30% of total calories.

 "Responses to our questionnaire suggested that subjects 
with access to the olestra products experienced less 
deprivation while reducing dietary fat intake than the 
subjects without access to the olestra products," Foreyt 
said, adding that the study is currently in press.

 "Based on our study, and my reading of the olestra 
research, I believe that olestra can help consumers lower 
overall fat intake because it gives them a choice, without 
sacrificing taste," he said.

Dr. Gail Harrison of the University of California School of 
Public Health in Los Angeles complimented the special 
consultants utilized by FDA as in-depth review experts on 
olestra, calling them "absolutely the best in the field."  
Harrison added, "Their reports can be relied upon in terms 
of scientific validity and perspective."

Recommending approval of the compound, Harrison said she is 
"quite thoroughly acquainted with the data base supporting 
the safety of olestra as it is proposed for use in savory 
snacks in the U.S. food supply, and am convinced on the 
basis of reasonable scientific judgment it is safe by the 
standard that FDA must apply."

Other letters recommending approval came from Dr. Elijah 
Saunders of the University of Maryland's School of 
Medicine, Division of Hypertension, and Dr. George Bray, 
executive director of the Pennington Biomedical Research 
Center at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

A letter from Penny Kris-Etherton, professor of nutrition 
at Penn State University, reiterated conclusions she had 
presented for P&G at the advisory committee meeting -- that 
inclusion of olestra snacks would reduce dietary 
carotenoids over a period of seven days by approximately 
10%.  The calculations assumed that all savory snacks 
included in dietary records randomly selected from study 
subjects in target groups of interest were olestra-
containing snacks, she said.

 "Obviously, in a real world setting, not all savory snacks 
consumed will contain olestra.  Nonetheless, I believe that 
our estimates are reasonable as a means to gain a 
perspective about the average impact of olestra-containing 
snacks in different free-living population groups," Kris-
Etherton added.  ((6FCN 4608, 26 pages, $11)

PETITION NEEDED TO EXPAND ENERGY SOURCES IN POULTRY FEED 
IRRADIATION RULE: FDA

A food additive petition approved recently by the Food and 
Drug Administration sought approval only of the use of gamma 
radiation from cobalt 60 for Salmonella in poultry feed, so 
a separate or supplemental petition would have to be filed 
to expand the approval to include other sources of ionizing 
radiation, the agency said recently (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, 
Oct. 2, Page 42, and Nov. 6, Page 17).

The Center for Veterinary Medicine's George Graber, director 
of the division of animal feeds, discussed the petition in a 
Dec. 6 letter to Paisan Loaharanu, who is part of the 
Secretariat of the International Consultative Group on Food 
Irradiation, International Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna, 
Austria.  Loaharanu had written to CVM in October, 
questioning why the final rule permitting the irradiation 
was limited to gamma rays from cobalt 60 and did not include 
gamma rays from cesium-137 and electrons and X-rays from 
machine sources.

Loaharanu had asked if there were scientific reasons for 
this limitation, and questioned whether it would be possible 
to include other radiation sources in the regulation.

Petition, Rule Refer Only to Cobalt 60

Graber noted that when Nordion International Inc. filed the 
food additive petition, FDA sought comment only on the use 
of gamma radiation from cobalt 60, but said "no public 
comment was received," and pointed out that the scope of a 
proceeding for issuing a food additive regulation "is 
limited by the terms and conditions of use set out in the 
filed petition."

"To the extent that a person seeks to extend the petitioned-
for terms and conditions of use, the person must do so by 
separate or supplemental petition," Graber added.  He 
thanked Loaharanu for sending a copy of the ICGFI document 
entitled, "Code of Good Irradiation Practice for the Control 
of Pathogenic Microorganisms in Poultry Feed."

Similar letters were sent to E-Beam Services, Cranbury, 
N.J., AECL Technologies, Hauppage, N.Y., and Dr. Elsa Murano 
of the Texas A&M University's Department of Animal Science.  
In objections filed following publication of the rule, all 
had questioned why the regulation limited the source of 
ionizing radiation to gamma radiation from cobalt 60.

In the letters to the companies, Graber noted that nothing 
in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or in FDA's regulations 
suggests or authorizes that "interested persons use the 
opportunity to object as an opportunity to expand the 
authorized use beyond those sought in the petition."

"Indeed, the records of the rulemaking (the petition and 
comments, in this case, none) only contain information 
concerning the use of cobalt 60, and thus it appears that 
there would be no support in the record for your 
objections," he said.

If FDA were to proceed to complete its evaluation of the 
objections and request for a hearing, "it is likely that the 
agency would deny the request on the basis that the request 
is beyond the scope of the petitioned action and is more 
appropriately resolved through the submission of a food 
additive petition," Graber said, adding that "the proper and 
more timely resolution is the withdrawal of the objection at 
this time and submission of a food additive petition."  He 
urged the companies to withdraw their objections, and 
offered to meet with them about pursuing a food additive 
petition.  ((6FCN 4607, 9 pages, $7 )

AFDO FLOATS PROPOSED FOOD CODE CHANGES TO MEMBERS

Proposed changes to the Food and Drug Administration's 1993 
Food Code have been sent to members of the Association of 
Food and Drug Officials by AFDO's Food Committee, with 
instructions to respond by Jan. 16.

"The impetus for this action came as a result of a 
questionnaire sent by the AFDO Food Committee to state 
officials concerning the 1993 FDA Food Code and subsequent 
workshops during the [AFDO] Annual Conference," AFDO 
President Arthur Dell'Aria said in a Dec. 8 letter that 
accompanied the proposed changes.  In addition, "an Ad Hoc 
Committee was formed to address this task immediately after 
the annual conference.  The Ad Hoc Committee included state 
officials, USDA representation, FDA assistance and 
representatives from the affected industries" (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, July 3, Page 25).

In November, FDA issued a 1995 Food Code, which made a 
number of minor changes and clarifications to the 1993 Code; 
an FDA-er referred to the 1995 revision as the "housekeeping 
edition," intended to clean up language, etc., prior to an 
anticipated major overhaul for the 1997 Code.  FDA wanted to 
wait and do the more extensive changes after input is 
received from AFDO and from the Conference for Food 
Protection, which meets in April of this year (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Nov. 6, Page 22).

Potentially Hazardous Foods Subsection Would Be Removed

The subsection in Chapter 1 dealing with potentially 
hazardous foods should be eliminated, AFDO members said, 
because such a variance is unnecessary.  The original 
language noted that  a food is not potentially hazardous if 
"laboratory evidence that is the basis of a variance granted 
by the regulatory authority demonstrates that rapid and 
progressive growth of infectious and toxigenic 
microorganisms or the slower growth of C. botulinum cannot 
occur." 

In Chapter 2, AFDO members suggested adding food manager 
certification "as a means test for demonstration of 
knowledge."  The additional wording would read:  "... the 
person in charge shall demonstrate his knowledge by 
compliance with this code, by being a certified food manager 
who has demonstrated knowledge of required information 
through an accredited test or by responding to the 
inspector's questions when applicable."

The special handwash procedure outlined in Chapter 2, which 
dealt with the procedure food handlers would use after using 
bathroom facilities, should be eliminated, AFDO members 
concurred.  Instead, the section should be renamed "handwash 
procedures" and should be enforced throughout food 
operations.

The variance for recreationally caught scombrotoxin-prone 
fish and all reference to recreationally caught fish in 
Chapter 3 should be eliminated, AFDO members said, with the 
section reading that only fish that are commercially and 
legally caught and harvested may be received for sale or 
service.  Also in that chapter, the variance requirement for 
using more than one tagged or labeled container or 
shellstock at a time should be eliminated.  The handler(s) 
would still be required not to commingle differently tagged 
or labeled groups before the fish is ordered by the 
consumer.

The variance for cooking raw animal foods (such as raw 
shellfish, steak tartare, soft-cooked eggs, etc.) to 
required temperatures should be eliminated, AFDO members 
said, to remove language that grants a variance from the 
section if based on a HACCP plan.  Instead, consumers 
ordering such foods must be informed by food establishments 
of the possible dangers of eating such foods through 
labeling of menus, table tents, etc., AFDO noted, adding 
that consumer advisory requirements would be met by the 
statement:

"Thoroughly cooking foods of animal origin such as beef, 
eggs, fish, lamb, milk, pork, poultry, or shellfish reduces 
the risk of foodborne illness.  Individuals with certain 
health conditions may be at higher risk if these foods are 
consumed raw or undercooked.  Consult your physician or 
public health official for further information."

Two other suggested changes were to eliminate the 
requirement for a variance before brewing alcoholic 
beverages or using food additives as a method of flavor 
enhancement (Chapter 3) and to eliminate the variance 
requirement for utilizing a molluscan shellfish life-support 
system display tank for storage and display of shellfish 
(Chapter 4).  However, the tank system would remain part of 
a hazard analysis critical control point system that assures 
that safety and quality of the fish is not harmed through 
the use of such a tank, among other requirements, AFDO 
members noted.

Ad Hoc Committee Specific Recommendations Cover Food 
Handling, Holding Temperatures

The AFDO Ad Hoc Committee had a number of specific 
recommendations of its own, including rewording of a 
Chapter 2 section on the responsibilities of the "person in 
charge," to include food handling requirements, training 
and the explanation of responsibilities.  Suggested new 
wording included:  "Employees are preventing cross-
contamination of ready-to-eat food with their bare hands by 
properly using suitable utensils such as deli tissue, 
spatulas, tongs or single-use gloves; employees are 
properly trained in food safety; and the responsibilities, 
rights and authorities assigned by this Code are explained 
to the:  1) food employee; 2) person in charge, and 3) 
regulatory authority."

In Chapter 3, the committee suggested the addition of a 
cooking chart that includes minimum cooking times and 
temperatures for a variety of cooked meats, eggs and 
related products  -- "145 F (63 C) for 15 seconds for shell 
eggs for individual order, immediate service, fish, 
seafood, beef, veal, lamb, mutton, etc., not specified 
below; 155 F (68 C) at 15 seconds, or 150 F (68 FC) for 1 
minute, or 145 F(63 C) for 3 minutes, for pork, game 
animals, ground chopped meat and fish, injected meats and 
eggs in multi-serving batches; and 165 F (74 C) for 15 
seconds for field-dressed wild game, poultry, stuffed 
fish, meat pasta or poultry, or stuffing containing fish, 
meat or poultry."

An exemption in the cooking time/temperature requirements 
should be made for whole muscle intact beef steaks prepared 
in response to a consumer's order, the committee noted, 
adding that reheating for hot holding requirements should 
be changed so that the two-hour rapid heating requirement 
would be applied to all reheating practices.

While leaving intact the code's requirements that 
potentially hazardous foods should be stored for hot 
holding at 140 F (60 C) or above or at 41 F (5 C) or below, 
the AFDO committee suggested language be added to allow for 
45 F 

refrigerated storage of potentially hazardous food 
"provided the mechanical refrigeration unit in which the 
food is held is incapable of meeting the [41 F or below] 
requirements; is currently in place and in use; and is 
replaced with a unit that can meet the [41 F or below] 
requirement when replacement is required."

The section in Chapter 3 dealing with ready-to-eat, 
potentially hazardous food disposition would also be 
significantly changed by the ad hoc committee, the report 
explained:

"An addition here would require an automatic cut-off 
control activated by temperatures above 45 F for vending 
machines that dispense ready-to-eat potentially hazardous 
food.  Disposition of temperature-abused foods from such 
systems would be consistent with the requirements for 
other potentially hazardous food (five days or 10 days).  
The reference to manufacturers' 'sell by' or 'use by' date 
is removed, as they are not present on many potentially 
hazardous foods and are not enforced by most states."

As for time as a public health control, the committee 
recommended a change in wording so that hot food would have 
to be served or discarded within two hours from the point 
in time when the food is removed from temperature control 
(the code's four-hour rule would remain in effect for cold 
foods). 

The committee said the exception for pyrethrin-based 
compounds should be removed from the Chapter 7 section on 
application of pesticides.  Also, pesticide treatment by 
uncertified persons under the direct supervision of a 
certified person would be allowed.  The change was 
suggested so that a broad interpretation of "applicable 
law" regarding application of pesticides would be allowed.

In addition, AFDO is recommending a number of rewording, 
editing and reformatting changes for simplification or 
clarification.  ((6FCN 4601, 145 pages, $41).

FSIS IDENTIFIES REFORMS NEEDED BEFORE HACCP IMPLEMENTATION

The Food Safety and Inspection Service Dec. 29 identified 
several areas of reform it says are necessary, both as part 
of the Reinventing Government initiative and because the 
regulations in question need to be changed before the 
planned implementation of a hazard analysis critical control 
point system for meat and poultry inspection (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Sept. 11, Page 46, and related stories, Pages 
25 and 41).

The advance notice of proposed rulemaking lists a number of 
proposed areas ripe for modification or elimination because 
they are inconsistent with HACCP principles.  Such 
regulatory changes will be made before HACCP is implemented 
in plants, the ANPR added.

Regulations mentioned in the ANPR fall into broad 
categories, such as:  definitions; inauguration, suspension 
and withdrawal of suspension; appeals procedures and related 
administrative procedures; reinspection of product entering 
establishments, and retention and disposition of product; 
restrictive, command-and-control type regulations that 
delimit processing and treatment methods intended to 
eliminate specific food safety hazards; and recordkeeping 
and access to records under the Freedom of Information Act.

The ANPR invited comment on any of these areas, and added 
that "FSIS specifically requests comment on its efforts to 
transform regulations from heavy reliance on command-and-
control approaches to greater reliance on performance 
standards, and solicits detailed suggestions concerning 
which existing regulations need to be changed to be 
consistent with HACCP, and how those regulations should be 
changed."

Several specific candidates for revision or removal were 
presented in the ANPR.  Under "definition":

Include general HACCP-related terms and redefine inspection 
organization and activity terms.

Under "application for and grant or refusal of inspection":

Revise prior approval procedures; shift to performance 
standards.

Under "inauguration and withdrawal of inspection; inspection 
program employees":

Clarify role of inspection program.  Integrate this with 
rules for suspending and withdrawing inspection.

Assure that appeals procedures comport with enforcement 
under HACCP.

Under "facilities for inspection":

Clarify standards for essential facilities.

Convert requirements for sanitation and facilities to 
performance standards or decision criteria; supplement with 
guidelines as needed.

Simplify detailed requirements for equipment and 
cleanliness, for example; convert to performance standards 
and/or decision criteria; supplement with guidelines as 
needed.

Convert equipment and cleaning requirements to performance 
standards and/or decision criteria; supplement with 
guidelines as needed.

Remove obsolete provisions for slack barrels, similar 
containers and means of conveyance, and burlap wrapping.

Clarify decision criteria concerning employment of diseased 
persons.

Convert tagging insanitary equipment, utensils, rooms and 
compartments provisions to performance standards; clarify 
role of inspection program employees.

Update rules for temperatures and chilling and freezing 
procedures for poultry and make changes to accommodate HACCP 
(i.e., changes in addition to pathogen reduction amendments 
proposed 2/3/95).

Under "entry into official establishments, reinspection; 
reinspections, preparing and processing establishments":

Convert rules for articles entering establishments and 
product disposal to performance standards and clarify role 
of inspection program employees.

Eliminate prior approval procedures for total quality 
control systems.

Convert requirements for processing procedures and articles 
used in preparing products to performance standards, and 
clarify role of inspection program employees.

Eliminate command-and-control type requirements for the use 
of nitrite and sodium ascorbate or erythorbate in bacon; 
convert these requirements to performance standards and 
clarify role of inspection program employees.

Convert requirements for the treatment of pork and pork 
products to destroy trichinae into performance standards; 
supplement with guidelines as needed.

Convert requirements for preparing articles not for use as 
human food (e.g., dog food) to performance standards; 
clarify role of inspection program employees; eliminate 
command-and-control type requirements.

Eliminate redundancy with other provisions (i.e., mixtures 
containing products that are not classed as meat food 
products).

Convert procedure for handling product adulterated by 
polluted water to performance standards and decision 
criteria; supplement with guidelines as needed.

Convert requirements for tagging chemicals, preservatives, 
cereals, spices, etc., to performance standards; clarify 
role of inspection program employees.

Convert rules for substances such as pesticide chemical 
residues, food additives and color additives to performance 
standards and role of inspection program employees.

Make requirements for handling of certain material for 
mechanical deboning consistent with any new time-temperature 
requirements.

Convert compliance procedures for meat derived from advanced 
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems to 
performance standards, and clarify role of inspection 
program employees.

Convert requirements for canning and canned products to 
performance standards and clarify role of inspection program 
employees.

Under "transportation":

Eliminate obsolete provisions; focus on and clarify policies 
and performance standards.

Comments are due Feb. 27.  For more information, contact Paula 
Cohen at 202-720-7164.

IBP COMPLAINS OF RED MEAT, POULTRY EQUITY ISSUES AT HACCP 
MEETINGS

IBP, Inc. complained in a recent letter to the Food Safety 
and Inspection Service that recent meetings on the 
HACCP/Pathogen Reduction proposal should have focused on red 
meat versus poultry regulatory equity issues.

In the letter to USDA Acting Undersecretary for Food Safety 
Michael Taylor, the Nebraska firm's James Lochner said he 
attended all six of the HACCP public meetings and the Food 
Safety Forum (See Food Chemical News, Nov. 13, Page 32), but 
that there was "insufficient focus on red meat versus 
poultry regulatory equity issues." 

"There is ample published research demonstrating increased 
food safety risks with poultry as a result of current 
processes allowed by FSIS poultry regulations," Lochner 
said, questioning "why these issues have not been addressed 
in more detail."  

In the second round of comments to the proposal, IBP 
stressed the importance of microbiological testing in HACCP 
validation and ongoing HACCP verification.  The firm also 
stressed that insufficient data exist to use indicator 
organisms for a performance standard.  

"IBP believes USDA has only one choice: microbiological 
guidelines as a HACCP verification component.  This is the 
only viable solution until data is generated on an ongoing 
basis and then related to an increased risk of human 
health."   

Validation should be defined as documenting a critical 
control point that eliminates microbiological hazards, IBP 
said, and, "When possible, validation should demonstrate the 
elimination of pertinent pathogens, i.e., Salmonella and 
Escherichia coli O157:H7."  Validation, Lochner added, 
should be conducted either off-line in a research facility 
or with extensive on-line testing using indicator organisms, 
or with past reported research.

Verification Testing Based on Volume for Large Plants, Time 
for Small Plants Suggested

Verification should be defined as an ongoing demonstration 
of control with microbiological testing to verify that the 
process is in control, according to Lochner IBP's senior 
vice president, technical services.  

USDA should prescribe minimum frequencies for an acceptable 
HACCP program based on volume for large plants and time 
frame for small plants, IBP's Lochner told Taylor, 
recommending one microbiological verification test per 
species per 1,000 head increment per week for large meat and 
poultry plants and a minimum sample frequency of once a week 
for small plants.  For fresh meat and poultry plants that 
are not slaughter plants, microbiological testing as a HACCP 
verification should focus on relative change and operational 
sanitation, Lochner said.

All plants should be required to submit their ongoing HACCP 
microbiological verification results to USDA, which will 
then generate averages and baselines over a two-year period.  
USDA will need to develop details on where samples are 
taken, how they are handled, and laboratory methods for the 
information to be useful, IBP said. 

In other comments, the firm recommended that USDA develop 
criteria for a process step to be classified as an 
antimicrobial treatment, adding that a one log reduction was 
not an effective criterion.  Also, USDA should allow carcass 
cooling rates to be incorporated into HACCP programs with 
micro validation and verification to demonstrate that the 
chill rates control growth of indicator organisms or 
pathogens.  USDA must reconsider the use of immersion 
chilling in poultry "if it seriously wants to improve the 
protection of public health," IBP added.

Finally, IBP urged USDA to move quickly in implementing the 
sweeping regulations and suggested that if certain 
industries or companies are unwilling to improve the 
process, then USDA may require mandatory controls.  "These 
cannot be political decisions," Lochner added.  ((6FCN 4606,

L. MONOCYTOGENES, B. CEREUS CONTAMINATION PROMPT WARNINGS TO 
WHITEFISH, PEDIATRIC MEDICAL FOOD MANUFACTURERS

Detection of Listeria monocytogenes in processed whitefish 
roe prompted a warning letter from the Food and Drug 
Administration to a Wisconsin fish roe manufacturing 
operation.  The Dec. 11 letter from FDA's Minneapolis 
District to James Vander Mause, president, Atlas 
International, Inc., Jefferson, Wis., said the pathogen was 
detected in a sample collected during an inspection of the 
facility.

FDA said that according to documents obtained during the 
inspection, Atlas does not sample and analyze incoming 
whitefish roe for microbiological pathogens, nor does the 
firm obtain "written assurance from suppliers that the roe 
is in compliance with federal laws and regulations."  The 
agency urged Vander Mause to incorporate a mechanism to 
"assure" that incoming fish roe will not be contaminated.  

Failure to assure compliance with laws and regulations may 
result in regulatory action without further notice, FDA 
warned Vander Mause.  The agency said he should notify the 
agency of "specific steps" taken to correct these 
deficiencies. 

Contamination with diarrheal enterotoxin producing Bacillus 
cereus has caused a pediatric medical food to be deemed 
adulterated, according to a warning letter from FDA's 
Minneapolis District.  

The Dec. 1 letter to David Pyott, president/CEO, Sandoz 
Nutrition, Inc., St. Louis Park, Minn., said samples of the 
firm's Vivonex Pediatric Medical Food were found to be 
contaminated.  While acknowledging that the contamination 
was "spotty," the agency said several portions contained 
>100 B. cereus and of the isolates tested for enterotoxin 
production, all were found to produce enterotoxin.  

FDA noted that the Sandoz contention that there was no 
significance to the B. cereus findings was based on several 
assumptions:  the strain will not grow at a pH of 4.85; 
there is a four-hour growth lag period after hydration, and 
room temperature storage "significantly decreases" rate of 
growth.  The agency added, however, that while this may 
"normally be the case," it should not be assumed for this 
strain, "particularly in a food intended for individuals of 
compromised health."  

Pyott was warned that failure to assure compliance with laws 
and regulations may result in regulatory action without 
further notice.  The agency said he should notify the agency 
of "specific steps" taken to achieve correction of these 
deficiencies.

Insanitary Processing, Storage Conditions Lead to Warnings 
for Mushroom Processing Plant

Michael Giorgio, owner, Prima Foods, Inc., Rehrersburg, Pa., 
received a warning from FDA's Philadelphia District 
concerning violations of acidified food manufacturing 
regulations.

The Dec. 7 letter said an inspection of Giorgio's mushroom 
processing plant revealed the following deficiencies:

water in washing tank was not changed during a full day's 
processing and became "increasingly dirty," resulting in 
mushrooms still bearing soil entering the blancher;

blancher observed with discolored mushrooms and "grease-
like" material adhering to it;

equipment used to hold mushrooms before and after blanching 
was not "adequately cleaned";

walk-in cooler has a drain pipe leading directly outside and 
the pipe was not screened to prevent pest entry;

mushrooms packed in brine remained on packing floor for 
several hours before being refrigerated, with mushrooms 
labeled for refrigeration at 35 F stored in a cooler at 47 F;

brine solution for coldpack mushrooms was stored in open vat 
and hand-dipped to fill mushroom container, with ascorbic acid 
used in brine preparation stored in uncovered container;

pH meter was used without being standardized;

blancher auger had flaked rust between blades and the rubber 
conveyor leading into blancher was frayed at edges, and 

a "large amount" of steam built up in the building.

In addition, FDA noted that several mushroom samples were 
found to contain "very high levels" of bacteria, leading the 
agency to be concerned that this may be "indicative of poor 
processing or handling practices."

FDA said that Giorgio acknowledged that Prima Foods should 
have "ceased production" of the mushrooms and that should 
the firm wish to make these foods in the future, 
registration as an acidified food manufacturer is required.

'Serious Violations' Alleged at California Fish Processing 
Operation

FDA's San Francisco District sent a warning letter to Robert 
Johnson, president, MFM, Inc., Berkeley, Calif., saying that 
an inspection of his 

shell fish and fin fish processing operations in San 
Francisco revealed "serious violations" of food 
manufacturing regulations.  

According to the Dec. 1 letter:

water lines serving processing operations lacked backflow 
prevention devices;

raw shrimp were held in a metal, perforated container, 
placed directly on a wet floor and washed with a water spray 
from a hand-held hose;

inspectors observed soap suds draining from drain board 
containing thawing shrimp, large drinking cup floating in 
sink, fork "nearly submerged" among shrimp and "personnel 
items" on drain board;

chemical cleaners were stored on shelf directly above fish 
in open cardboard box;

employees were seen handling hoses and other non-food items 
then resuming processing of seafood without washing or 
sanitizing hands, and

an unprotected ice machine, with standing water in three-
sided trough at its base, was located in an area allowing 
car and forklift traffic.

FDA also said that L. monocytogenes, Type 1, was detected in 
a swab sample taken from the surface of a packaging table.  
The swab was among several other environmental swabs found 
to be negative for Listeria and Salmonella microorganisms.  

Johnson was told to take "appropriate steps" to correct 
these violations to prevent adulteration of foods 
processed by the facility.  Adulterated foods are subject 
to seizure, the agency added.  

Insect, Rodent Findings at Bakery Draw Warning Letter

An FDA warning letter to Ralph Pacifico, president, Angelo 
Pacifico & Sons, Inc., Altoona, Pa., said insanitary 
conditions at the bakery resulted in bakery products being 
adulterated.  

The Nov. 22 letter from the agency's Philadelphia District 
said beetle-like insects and one larval stage insect were 
found throughout the flour storage and conveyor system, one 
dead mouse was found on the production floor near mixes, and 
exposed bread products and "potential rodent entry points" 
were observed.

FDA said its laboratory analysis of flour revealed insects 
in various stages of the beetle life cycle, indicating 
nesting.  Analysis of various finished bread products 
revealed rodent hair, insect fragments and cat or dog hair, 
the agency added.  

During the inspection of the bakery, it was noted that the 
conveyor and access panels were welded or glued shut, making 
inspection and cleaning "more difficult," FDA noted.  The 
firm's response that it would initiate a program aimed at 
cleaning the whole flour system "until no further insect 
nesting activity is noticed" is not sufficient, the agency 
added, saying that the company needs an "effective, ongoing 
sanitation program" to eliminate the insanitary conditions.  

Pacifico was told to take prompt action to correct these 
deficiencies.  Failure to do so, the agency added, may 
result in regulatory action, such as seizure and/or 
injunction, without further notice.    

'Insanitary Conditions' Cause Stored Foods To Be Deemed 
Adulterated

Foods at an Alabama warehouse have been deemed adulterated 
due to "insanitary conditions," according to a warning 
letter from FDA's Nashville District.

The Dec. 12 letter to J. Barton Greer, Jr., chairman of the 
board, Autry Greer & Sons, Prichard, said an inspection of 
the facility revealed a "widespread insect infestation" in 
the dry storage portion of the warehouse; spilled products 
at numerous locations within the warehouse; food products 
stored directly against the wall; insecticides and other 
hazardous chemicals stored directly adjacent to food items; 
poor handling of distressed food products, and damaged 
floors and walls in produce and meat coolers.  In addition, 
FDA said that 10 separate lots of food products, including 
flour, cornmeal, rice, beans and instant pudding, were found 
to be insect infested.

Greer was told to take prompt action to correct these 
deficiencies or face possible regulatory action such as 
seizure and/or injunction.  

Undeclared Colors Prompt Warning Letters

FDA's Chicago District sent a warning letter to Rashid 
Sweiss, president, Eden International, Inc., Blue Island, 
Ill., concerning misbranding of two of the firm's products. 

The Aug. 30 letter said that "Eden's Red Chickpeas" 
contained undeclared FD&C Red #3 and "Eden's Gourmet Mix" 
contained undeclared FD&C Red #40.  FDA also advised Sweiss 
that net contents need to be declared in metric as well as 
in inch-pound units.  Sweiss was told to inform the agency 
of steps taken to correct the violations.  

Airlines Warned About Insanitary Processing Facilities, 
Public Conveyance Violations 

Food processing and watering point violations involving the 
airline industry were subjects of warning letters from FDA's 
San Francisco District.

Herbert Kelleher, president and CEO, Southwest Airlines, 
received a Nov. 21 letter pointing out several processing 
deficiencies as well as watering point violations.

The insanitary conditions resulted in a classification of 
the facilities as "Not Approved."  

A "Non-Approved" or "Use Prohibited" classification was 
awarded to a facility serving the airline industry, 
according to another warning letter from FDA's San Francisco 
District.

The Dec. 1 letter to David Tam, president, Tam Fresh Cut-
Pack, Inc., Sacramento, Calif., said an inspection of the 
facility revealed the following:  lack of chemical test kits 
for chlorine sanitizer; standing water on floor near 
vegetable sink and floor of walk-in refrigerator; vegetables 
in boxes stored directly on refrigerator floors; 

knives on soiled surfaces were not sanitized; lack of 
functional thermometers in walk-in refrigerators; 
accumulation of old, slimy vegetable debris on onion slicer; 
accumulation of old food debris on exterior of scales; waste 
water flows across driveway to sewer, with employees seen 
walking through this water while cleaning food containers; 
unshielded fluorescent lights over processing areas, and 
unsealed hole in double wall in production area providing 
possible hole in the wall for vermin. 

Both Kelleher and Tam were told to notify the agency of 
steps taken to correct the violations.  

Manufacturing, Labeling Violations of Vet Products Disclosed 
in FDA Warnings

Failure to follow good manufacturing practice regulations 
for finished pharmaceuticals resulted in FDA issuing a 
warning to a Missouri veterinary drug manufacturer.

The Dec. 5 letter from FDA's Kansas City District to Henry 
Bobe, president/chief executive officer, Fermenta Animal 
Health Company, said an inspection of the firm's Elwood, 
Kan., facility revealed the following "significant 
deviations":

failure to establish and follow an adequate process 
validation plan for all tablet, bolus and powder products to 
assure they have the identity, strength, quality and purity 
they purport or are represented to possess;

failure to include directions in certain product Master 
Formula Records to recirculate product from the dead space 
at the base of the ribbon blender, and 

failure to have in place an adequate method validation for 
finished product analysis.  

Noting that the inspection consisted in part of pre-
approval review of manufacturing compliance, FDA said the 
deviations must be corrected before the district can concur 
with approval of the ANADAs and it has therefore 
recommended to the Center for Veterinary Medicine that 
approval of these ANADAs be withheld.  FDA said the 
inspection also revealed that a manufacturing change had 
been instituted for another product "without CVM approval."   

Bobe was told to notify FDA of the specific steps taken to 
correct the noted violations.  

FDA's Los Angeles District sent a warning letter to Louis 
Gottlieb, president, Very Healthy Enterprises, Inglewood, 
Calif., noting that several of the firms products are new 
animal drugs which are not the subject of approved NADAs.

The April 3 letter said that a new animal drug may not be 
legally marketed unless it is the subject of an approved 
NADA.  FDA said the following products are not generally 
recognized as safe and effective for the indications for use 
in their labeling:

Ear Relief Natural Medicine & Ear Cleanser for Dogs and 
Cats; Scratch Free Natural Medicine for Dogs and Cats; Eye-C 
Eye Medicine for Dogs and Cats with Vitamin C and Zinc (Zinc 
Plus C Ophthalmic Solution); Flea Relief Natural Medicine 
and Diar-relief Natural Medicine.

Gottlieb was told to take prompt action to correct these 
violations or face possible regulatory action, such as 
seizure and/or injunction, without further notice.

FDA's Buffalo District has warned a veterinary products 
company that it is manufacturing/repacking and distributing 
adulterated and misbranded new animal drugs.

In a May 17 letter to Richard Sanzen, president, Equest Inc., 
Saratoga Veterinary Products Co., Saratoga Springs, N.Y., FDA 
said no NADAs are in effect for the firm's Equi-Spaz Paste, 
Re-Coup and Doloflex products.  The firm's failure to provide 
FDA with a  list all drugs manufactured/repacked results in 
the products being deemed misbranded, FDA said.  The agency 
said Sanzen should take action to ensure that the firm meets 
all federal law and regulation requirements.

Violations of Medicated Feed Mill Regulations Described in 
FDA Warnings

Phil Yoder, president, Yoder Feeds, Kalona, Iowa, received a 
warning letter from FDA's Kansas City District concerning 
violations of federal current good manufacturing regulations 
for medicated feeds.  

The Oct. 18 letter said an inspection of the facility 
revealed a failure to perform assays at periodic intervals 
for all medicated feeds requiring approved applications, and 
the use of Type A articles in the manufacture of medicated 
feeds beyond their labeled expiration dates.  

Failure to correct these deficiencies may result in 
regulatory action, such as seizure and/or injunction, 
without further notice, FDA said.  

The Kansas City District also sent a warning letter to 
Leland Smith, president, Custom Feed Services Corp., 
Norfolk, Nebr. concerning medicated feed manufacturing 
violations.

In the June 30 letter, FDA said an inspection of Smith's 
facility revealed a failure to conduct the required number 
of assays of medicated feeds in a calendar year.

Smith was informed by FDA that failure to correct these 
deficiencies may result in regulatory action, such as 
seizure and/or injunction, without further notice.

FDA's Cincinnati District sent a similar letter to Leslie 
Gossett, terminal manager, PM AG Products, Inc., Owensboro, 
Ky.  In its Dec. 7 letter, the agency said deviations from 
medicated feed regulations included the failure to:  provide 
a drug scale suitable for the units or weights for which it 
is used; assure daily inventory records are accurate and 
adequate, and check batch records to determine that all 
required steps have been performed, as errors were found in 
drug receipt and production records.

Gossett was urged by FDA to establish procedures whereby 
such violations do not recur.  Until the violations have 
been corrected and the corrections verified by FDA, CVM will 
not approved medicated feed applications from the facility, 
the agency added.

FDA Notes Illegal Drug Residues in Animals Intended for 
Human Food

FDA's Seattle District warned two animal producers 
concerning the detection of illegal drug residues in animals 
intended for use as human food.

In an April 13 letter to Cornelius Timmermans, Lynden, 
Wash., FDA said a USDA analysis of a calf revealed the 
presence of neomycin at 7.27 ppm and tetracycline at 0.96 
ppm in the kidney.  Neomycin residues in the kidney of 
another calf were found at 41.54 ppm, the agency noted.

Al and Anna Biemold, Cascade Farms, Everson, Wash., also 
received a warning letter from the Seattle District.  The 
April 3 letter said a USDA analysis of a bob veal calf 
detected residues of neomycin at 3.31 ppm and 8.80 ppm 
tetracycline in kidney tissue.

Timmermans and the Biemolds were told to correct the 
violations and to establish procedures to prevent their 
recurrence.  Failure to do so, FDA added, may result in 
regulatory action without further notice.

Two warning letters concerning detection of illegal drug 
residues were also sent by FDA's Cincinnati District.

A Dec. 11 letter to Ray Geiser, Apple Creek, Ohio, said a 
USDA analysis of a bob veal calf revealed the presence of 
0.48 ppm penicillin in the kidney and 0.43 ppm in the liver.  

In a Dec. 4 letter, Roger Morlock, Valley City, Ohio, was 
told that a USDA analysis of a bob veal calf detected 
tetracycline in the liver at 1.3 ppm and in the kidney at 
4.3 ppm.  

FDA said Geiser and Morlock hold animals under conditions 
"so inadequate" that diseased animals and/or medicated 
animals bearing potentially harmful drug residues are likely 
to enter the food chain.  Both were urged to correct these 
violations and to establish procedures to prevent their 
recurrence.

Louis Agueda, Merced, Calif., received a warning from FDA's 
San Francisco District.  The Nov. 15 letter said a USDA 
analysis of a cull dairy cow revealed the presence of 
oxytetracycline in the liver at 5.3 ppm and in the kidney at 
0.26 ppm.  

Noting that Agueda has "a history" of offering adulterated 
animals for sale for human food, FDA said other animals 
contained illegal antibiotic residues and one tested CAST 
positive.  

FDA said Agueda lacks adequate systems for determining the 
medicated status of animals, for assuring that medicated 
animals are withheld from slaughter for appropriate periods 
of time and for assuring that drugs are used according to 
label directions.  The agency added that Agueda should 
correct these deficiencies or face regulatory action, such as 
seizure and/or injunction, without further notice.  ((6FCN

SINGLE PETITION PROCESS FOR ADDITIVES TO BE USED ON MEAT OR 
POULTRY PROPOSED BY FSIS, FDA

The Food and Drug Administration and Agriculture Department's 
Food Safety and Inspection Service Dec. 29 proposed a 
simplification of the review process for food additive, color 
additive and generally recognized as safe affirmation 
petitions for substances that are to be used on meat or 
poultry products.  Currently, such products must go through 
separate FDA and FSIS reviews, the proposal suggests a single 
joint review instead. There were two notices published on the 
issue, one from FDA, one from FSIS, both in the Dec. 29 
Federal Register.

Under the proposal, a single petition would be submitted to 
FDA, which would pass on pertinent petitions or parts of 
petitions to FSIS.  Future FSIS listings for meat and 
poultry additives would be harmonized with those of FDA and 
incorporated into FDA's regulations, "providing a basis for 
the eventual elimination of FSIS' separate listing in Title 
9 CFR," said the FDA notice.  An FSIS notice said that the 
Title 9 review will occur in three to five years, leading to 
the elimination of duplicative listings found in FDA's Title 
21.  FSIS will continue to retain a small list of specific 
substance use prohibitions and will add new prohibitions as 
necessary, the FSIS notice said.

FAPs, CAPs and GRAS affirmation petitions not involving use 
in meat, meat products or poultry would not be affected by 
this proposal, and would continue to be reviewed by FDA 
only.

The two agencies developed a memorandum of understanding on 
how they will work together 

in reviewing such petitions.  Basically, according to the 
MOU published in the FSIS notice, FDA will share pertinent 
petitions with FSIS, and FSIS will provide advice to FDA on 
any criteria, restrictions, conditions of use or other 
prohibitions that may be necessitated by the Federal Meat 
Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act.

Some notable specifics of that MOU include:

"In situations where FSIS' Title 9 and FDA's Title 21 do not 
specifically address the intended use of a particular 
substance for meat or poultry products, any interested party 
may request that FSIS evaluate the status of such use.  FSIS 
will conduct a review and determine whether the use is 
acceptable in meat and poultry products, including whether 
the use is approved under the FFDCA (Federal Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act).  Under the terms of the MOU, FSIS would seek 
FDA's concurrence with FSIS' review and conclusions.  If FDA 
does not concur that the use is approved under the FFDCA, 
the petitioner would be required to submit a food additive 
or color additive petition to FDA requesting that FDA's 
regulations be amended to accommodate the requested use.

"In situations in which FDA receives a petition for the use 
of a substance or a use of a substance that is not approved 
under the FFDCA, a petitioner shall prepare and submit a 
food additive petition or a color additive petition only to 
FDA.  FDA will consult with FSIS regarding petitions for 
meat and poultry use, and, under the terms of the MOU, FSIS 
concurrence would be required for the approval of the use of 
substances intended for use in meat and poultry and that are 
codified in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

"FSIS will provide any advice to FDA, in writing, on any 
criteria, restrictions, conditions of use, or prohibitions 
FSIS believes necessary concerning use of the products 
subject to the FMIA and the PPIA.

"Requests for a determination (by FSIS) of the acceptability 
of substances may result in the need for rulemaking when (1) 
FSIS standards of identity and composition preclude the use 
of a substance; or (2) there is concern about the 
suitability of a substance for the intended use because the 
substance has never been used in meat and poultry before, or 
the applications of the substance are new, e.g., a new meat, 
meat food, or poultry product category.

"Requests for determination of acceptability of new 
substances and new uses of substances in meat and poultry 
products are currently submitted by the requester ... to 
FSIS.  FSIS will continue to require that a request for an 
acceptability determination for the use of a new substance 
in meat and poultry or for the new use of an approved 
substance be supported by information and technical data 
that establish that (1) the use of the substance will not 
render the product in which it is used adulterated or 
misbranded and (2) the proposed use of the substance is at 
the lowest level necessary to accomplish the intended 
technical effect(s) in each category of the product in which 
the substance is used.

"The evaluation by FSIS of the acceptable use of a new 
substance or new use of a substance in meat and poultry 
products subject to this MOU will be based on the following 
conditions that must be addressed by the requester.  The 
conditions set forth are in accordance with the provisions 
for use of substances in 9 CFR and 21 CFR:  (1) The 
substance has a documented history of use in foods; (2) The 
substance is derived from food or a food ingredient and is 
not considered to be a chemical or synthesized additive; (3) 
The process for manufacturing the substance does not result 
in a severe alteration of the molecular structure resulting 
in the formation of a chemical residue whose safety has not 
been shown; (4) The safety of the substance has been 
evaluated by an independent authority and adequate safety 
data have been presented; (5) The suitability and efficacy 
of the substance have been shown through adequate data 
submission.  The lowest level of the substance necessary to 
achieve the intended functional effect must be shown, and 
the use cannot render the products to which the substance is 
intended for use adulterated or misbranded; (6) The FDA has 
determined the common or usual name of the substance, and 
(7) FDA must concur with FSIS' determination of 
acceptability in order to allow use."

Proposal Part of FSIS Reinventing Government Process

Several regulatory reforms were published by FSIS Dec. 29 
(See related stories, Pages 18 and 41).  "By adopting modern 
regulatory tools and streamlining or eliminating old rules 
and requirements, we will enhance the safety of meat and 
poultry products on the tables of America," said USDA Acting 
Under Secretary for Food Safety Michael Taylor in a Jan. 2 
statement.  The proposals were all part of the agency's 
Reinventing Government initiative (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, 
Sept. 11, 1995, Page 46).

According to the Dec. 29 FDA Federal Register notice, the 
reason for the change was that:

"Over the years, the two agencies have cooperated on food 
ingredient issues on an as-needed, substance-specific, and 
case-by-case basis.  Nonetheless, because of their different 
regulatory needs, the two agencies' regulations governing 
the use of these substances in foods are cast in formats and 
terms that are not fully consistent with one another.  This 
absence of consistency causes difficulty and inconvenience 
to persons who need to refer to both agencies' regulations 
on approved substances and uses."

In addition, it is not clear where one agency's jurisdiction 
ends and another's begins, the notice said, and this has led 
to both agencies conducting separate, sequential review and 
rulemakings before a new meat or poultry use can be 
permitted.  "Many years can elapse between the time a 
manufacturer petitions FDA for the approval of a food 
additive or a color additive under the act and the 
appearance of FSIS regulations of approval for meat and 
poultry uses," the FDA notice said.

The notice went on to say that under the proposal, such 
substances would be authorized for use in meat and poultry 
products under the jurisdiction of FSIS on the basis of 
FDA's regulations.  Future FDA food additive, color additive 
and GRAS substance affirmation listings would specify any 
approved meat or poultry product uses, and the conditions of 
such uses, in accordance with FSIS recommendations "to the 
extent those recommendations are consistent with" the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

In the future, FDA will include in its listings the amounts 
and uses of substances permitted for meat and poultry 
products, the FSIS notice proposed.

Also, the administrator of FSIS would retain legal authority 
to prohibit or restrict the use of specific substance(s) in 
meat or poultry products by notice-and-comment rulemaking, 
"but is not expected to have to exercise that authority on a 
regular basis because FDA's statutory authority, exercised 
in accord with the MOU, would provide a basis for 
appropriate limitations on uses in meat and poultry 
products," it continued.

Another proposed change in the regulations states that 
sorbic acid, calcium carbonate, and other salts of sorbic 
acid "shall not" (as opposed to the current "may not") "be 
used in cooked sausage or any other product; sulfurous acid 
and salts of sulfurous acid shall not be used in or on any 
product, and niacin or nicotinamide shall not be used in or 
on fresh product, except that potassium sorbate, 
propylparaben (propyl p- hydrobenzoate), calcium propionate, 
sodium propionate, benzoic acid, and sodium benzoate may be 
used in or on any product provided in 21 CFR or by a 
regulation in this subchapter" --         9 CFR 318.1(d)(2).

GRAS Products Subject of Special Provision

"Substances whose use is GRAS, however, are exempt from the 
premarket approval requirements of the act and need not be 
listed in FDA's regulations in 21 CFR.  For a substance that 
is not affirmed by FDA as GRAS or otherwise listed (in 21 
CFR parts 182 or 184) of FDA's regulations, or for a GRAS 
substance listed by FDA for general food use, where meat and 
poultry uses are neither specified not prohibited, FSIS 
would continue to consider a manufacturer's basis for 
claiming GRAS status and suitability for use in meat or 
poultry products,"

the notice said, adding that FSIS would make the 
determination in consultation with FDA as needed to ensure 
the appropriate advice is given and that FDA has notice of 
the determination.

Substances currently listed as GRAS for food use generally 
(in accordance with good manufacturing practices) would be 
considered GRAS by USDA for use in meat, meat food products 
and poultry products, unless otherwise restricted by FSIS 
regulations such as standards of identity or composition, 
"or in specific cases where the inspection program 
determines that use may adulterate the product," FSIS added.

Manufacturers also have the option of seeking advice from 
FSIS regarding the suitability of products currently listed 
in FDA regulations for general use in foods or for use in 
meat or poultry products.  "FSIS' responses and related 
correspondence could be available to the public, except that 
the formulation and process data for proprietary mixtures 
would be kept confidential," the FSIS proposal said, adding:  
"Parties requesting such evaluations would be advised to 
petition FDA when the requested use is not permitted under 
FDA's regulations."

The notice said that such inquiries should be addressed to 
Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection 
Service, Product Assessment Division, USDA, FSIS, RP, West 
End Court Building, Washington, DC 20250-3700.

FSIS Will Maintain Listing of Authorized Substances for 
Interested Parties

"FSIS' title 9 listing of authorized substances is 
incomplete, inconsistent with, and duplicative of FDA's 
listings," said the FSIS notice.  "The agency plans to 
eliminate its current listing over time by rulemaking as 
listings are determined to be duplicative of FDA 
regulations.  However, FSIS will retain its own regulations 
on specific substance use prohibitions and will add new 
prohibitions as necessary."

Also, for the convenience of its inspectors, inspected 
establishments and other interested persons, FSIS will 
maintain a comprehensive listing, in its directive system, 
of substances authorized for meat and poultry uses under 
USDA's 9 CFR and FDA's 21 CFR.  This listing will include:

Substances currently listed in 9 CFR;

Substances currently listed for meat or poultry uses in FDA 
food additive, GRAS or prior-sanctioned listings;

Approved color additives currently listed under FDA 
regulations (21 CFR section 73,74, and 82), approved food 
additives listed in 21 CFR 172-173 and 180, prior sanctioned 
substances listed under part 181, GRAS substances listed in 
21 CFR 182 and 184, if permitted for general use on foods 
(which includes meat and poultry) in accordance with good 
manufacturing practices, unless meat or poultry uses of the 
substances are otherwise precluded;

GRAS substances found by FSIS to be suitable for specified 
meat and poultry uses on the basis of information and data 
submitted by petitioners to FSIS.  Factors affecting FSIS 
findings of suitability include:  Existing FDA GRAS 
listings, which need not explicitly permit but may not 
preclude the specific use in meat or poultry products; and, 
concurrence of FSIS with the petitioners and FDA acceptance 
of FSIS' determination;

FDA food additive, color additive, GRAS, prior-sanctioned 
substance listings promulgated after this proposal becomes 
final that provide for meat and poultry uses.

Comments must be received by Feb. 27 (at FSIS) or March 14 
(at FDA).  For more information, contact FSIS' Ralph 
Stafko at 202-720-8168 or FDA's George Pauli at 202-418-
3090.

NU-TECH POULTRY SYSTEM RESULTS IN LESS VISIBLE CONTAMINATION 
BUT SIMILAR MICRO COUNTS, FSIS SAYS

An automated poultry evisceration system being tested in a 
Georgia plant significantly reduced visible carcass 
contamination over a Streamlined Inspection System line, but 
microbiology tests between the two lines were not 
significantly different, according to a Food Safety and 
Inspection Service midterm report on the pilot project (See 
FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 23, Page 30).

The October report on Stork Gamco's Nu-Tech Poultry 
Processing System, being tested in a Gainesville ConAgra 
plant, concluded that "the data supports continuing the 
pilot and approving a second pilot to verify the Nu-Tech 
system."  The Nu-Tech system operates at up to 140 birds per 
minute, with four USDA inspectors.

Postmortem disposition agreement for the Nu-Tech and SIS-2 
lines compared favorably (0.7% for the Nu-Tech line vs. 0.4% 
for the SIS-2 line) and supports the acceptability of the 
inspection procedure, the FSIS report said, adding that 
"higher condemnation rates on the Nu-Tech line may be due to 
improved visibility of the viscera target organs and the 
inside carcass cavity."

The Nu-Tech system's complete evisceration prior to 
inspection "greatly reduced internal and external visible 
contamination (digestive tract contents, feces, gall)," the 
FSIS report said, adding, "Visibly cleaner carcasses were 
presented for inspection.  Carcasses prior to final washing 
and chilling were visibly cleaner.  Visible contamination on 
the Nu-Tech line remained constant from post-evisceration to 
the final wash at 11% outside contamination and 4%-5% inside 
contamination.  Visible contamination was markedly higher 
and increased on the SIS-2 line from post-evisceration to 
the final wash from 19%-27% outside contamination and 12%-
15% inside contamination."  The Nu-Tech evisceration probe 
causes less organ damage compared to the conventional spoon 
eviscerator, FSIS said.

The number of carcasses identified for reprocessing at the 
inspection stations was similar for both systems.  The Nu-
Tech line was higher, as expected, FSIS said, adding, "The 
one-step evisceration on the Nu-Tech line prior to 
inspection allows for greater visibility inside the bird.  
The SIS-2 reprocessing rate does not include the inside and 
outside carcass contamination observed post-inspection at 
viscera separation."

No Correlation Between Visible Contamination and Microbial 
Load:  FSIS

The microbiological testing "showed no significant 
difference between the lines or between points within each 
line," the report said, adding, "There does not appear to 
be correlation between the amount of visible contamination 
on the carcass and the microbial load."

The report noted a "significant decrease in Salmonella 
presence on the SIS-2 line between rehang and prior to the 
cropper.  The interpretation of the Salmonella decrease in 
this study is not clear and will require further evaluation 
of the raw data."  ((6FCN 4609, 19 pages, $9)




Nu-Tech Project Has Lost Union Support:  Carney

The Nu-Tech pilot project, called the Poultry Carcass 
Inspection/Evisceration Project (PCIEP) by FSIS, has lost 
the support of the inspectors' union, the National Joint 
Council of Food Inspection Locals, NJC Chairman David 
Carney said in a Dec. 19 letter to acting Under Secretary 
for Food Safety Michael Taylor.

At a Dec. 14 consultation with the agency on the project, 
Carney said, "it was evident ... that FSIS management has 
made every attempt to promote PCIEP to the poultry industry 
by reducing the number of the line inspectors and increasing 
line speeds. ... FSIS has been remiss in the efforts of 
promoting PCIEP by not conducting ergonomic impact studies 
and has yet to follow through with Cumulative Trauma 
Disorder Task Group.  With lack of supporting data for PCIEP 
progression, the National Joint Council must now take the 
position that we can no longer subject inspectors to 
whimsical accommodations to the poultry industry.  It will 
now be the position of the National Joint Council that (the 
union) will no longer participate in Poultry Carcass 
Inspection Evisceration Projects."

The union asked to negotiate the "'methods, means and 
technology' of performing work" with FSIS.  Carney noted 
that although the NJC's Southern Council had engaged in a 
memorandum of understanding for the ConAgra pilot plant, 
"this does not circumvent nor diminish impact to the 
bargaining unit at other proposed test sites."

Inspectors Walk Off Line at Georgia Poultry Plant; FSIS to 
Fill Future Vacancies

As many as eight FSIS inspectors walked off a poultry line 
at a Georgia plant for several minutes recently because they 
had not been given a break.  The union said the action 
underscores how serious the shortage of inspectors has 
become.  FSIS officials said a break was planned for the 
inspectors, but that the inspectors walked off the line 
before the Inspector-in-Charge could get to them.  FSIS 
officials said poultry carcasses piled up on the floor 
during the inspectors' absence and that the agency may take 
disciplinary action.  "This tells me they think they're more 
important than the food hundreds of people are going to 
eat," one agency official said.

The only solace for the agency and industry is that the 
shortage may not get any worse.  Taylor has apparently 
decided to hire one new inspector for every one that leaves 
in the future, although the new inspector may be hired in a 
different area if agency officials think a more critical 
vacancy exists elsewhere.

Final 1,000-Plant Review Report Reiterates: Sanitation 
Biggest Problem

The final report of the 1,000-plant review conducted by 
FSIS' Review and Assessment Program was released last month, 
and the conclusions were similar to those of an interim 
report:  sanitation remains the biggest problem found in 
plants (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, March 13, Page 27).

The review of 1,014 plants between October 1993 and February 
1995 resulted in 129 plants being issued Accelerated 
Deficiency Notices.  Sixty percent of all deficiencies found 
in the review were in the area of sanitation, and over 90% 
of those deficiencies were found in less than half of the 
plants reviewed.  The report also said that "dramatic short-
term decreases" in sanitation problems were found in plants 
where ADNs and Progressive Enforcement Action measures were 
applied.  The 1,000-plant review results were used to 
develop FSIS' proposed standard operating procedures for 
sanitation included in the HACCP proposal.  ((6FCN 4611, 22

DRAFT NUTRITION ACTION PLAN URGES HACCP, FOOD CODE ADOPTION

A draft report of the U.N. Plan of Action for Nutrition 
recommended the application of HACCP to pre- and post-
harvest of all foods and encouraged universal adoption of 
the Food and Drug Administration Model Food Code by all 
levels of government.

The U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human 
Services and Agency for International Development are 
seeking comment on the draft plan by Jan. 29, a Dec. 28 
Federal Register notice said.  The final U.S. Plan for 
Action is to be submitted to the World Health Organization 
for approval.  The latest effort stemmed from a 1992 meeting 
of the International Conference on Nutrition in Rome where 
159 countries agreed upon a general blueprint for improving 
world nutrition status.

Besides the HACCP and Food Code recommendations, the draft 
plan urged policymakers to improve the health and 
environmental status in animal agricultural systems by 
expanding the use of proven research such as baseline 
studies of microbiological problems to gauge contamination 
levels in the slaughter and processing of cattle and other 
species.

The report urged expanded automated information systems such 
as the Field Automation and Information Management 
initiative to support the modernization of USDA field 
inspection programs.  In-plant inspectors should have access 
to automated information systems and such technology should 
be used to improve field to headquarters communication, the 
draft plan recommended.

Plan Also Calls for Monitoring Dietary Exposure to Toxic 
Chemicals

Other recommended strategies to improve U.S. food safety 
included:  stepped-up monitoring of dietary exposure to 
toxic chemicals in foods, and continued assurances that food 
and food ingredients developed through new processing, 
packaging and packaging technologies are safe and 
nutritious.  Special nutritional foods should be regulated 
following the same standards of method and validation as for 
regular foods, the draft plan said.

The government-wide plan endorsed new technologies that 
increase shelf life of perishables, improve safety in crop 
production including Integrated Pest Management, and improve 
ways to monitor food additives and detect toxic chemicals in 
foods.

One emphasis in the draft plan was on expanding public 
education on food safety by promoting the use of hotlines 
and enhancing government disease reporting systems. 

The draft plan earmarked gaps in the U.S. food safety system 
that must be addressed in order to improve good health and 
nutrition.  The plan's authors recommended that more food 
processing operations use modern, proved effective systems 
to prevent food contamination, that legal requirements and 
enforcement for safe food handling need to keep pace with 
changes in marketing and preparation, and that some public 
water systems need to be upgraded.

The nutrition plan also focused on the need for improved 
diagnosis and reporting of foodborne and waterborne 
illnesses and for expanded consumer education.  Gaps in the 
following food safety research areas were highlighted:  

"Rapid detection and identification of foodborne and 
waterborne biological, chemical, and physical hazards; 
prevention of food and water, biological, chemical, and 
physical contamination; achievement of desired behavioral 
changes among consumers and food producers and processors; 
measurement of the incidence of foodborne and waterborne 
illness; and assessment of risk related to microbial 
organisms." 

Nutrition Monitoring Gaps Identified in Draft Report

Pointing to the current budget climate, the draft plan 
ranked the "most critical gaps" in nutrition monitoring that 
should be corrected.  

The report urged the government to develop culturally 
sensitive survey instruments for dietary information from 
high-risk groups; a set of methods and interpretive criteria 
for nutritional status and health conditions and improved 
dietary indicators; and methods that can be used by states, 
local communities and researchers that are comparable with 
national methods and allow for surveillance.  Guidelines for 
verifying and updating food composition data should also be 
revised as new methodologies are developed, the draft plan 
said.

The report also cited gaps in nutrition-sensitive food 
production and economic programs and agricultural research 
that can hinder efforts to incorporate nutrition 
considerations in national policies.  The draft plan found 
that decision-makers need to improve coordination and 
dissemination of nutrition information to food producers, 
improve information on sustainable agriculture, step up 
research information to support cost/benefit analysis of 
nutrition policies, and increase interdisciplinary training 
for those seeking careers in nutrition.

To address gaps, the report recommended a strategy that 
included basic research to enhance plant germplasm and 
sustainable production, to increase animal and fish 
production through integrated management and health systems, 
and to beef up economic analysis methods that can chart 
costs and benefits to society of healthy eating.  

The draft plan identified gaps in human nutrition research 
that may block understanding between diet and disease.  

Issues identified included:  the range in intake of 
nutrients and other food components that optimize health 
and reduce chronic disease; patterns of food intake and 
physical activity that provide the nutrition standard and 
appropriate energy balance to improve health; the point 
where nutrients interact with human genes to alter disease 
risk; factors affecting adoption and maintenance of 
behaviors that support optimal nutrition and physical 
activity patterns; and how research can translate into 
community interventions that improve health and 
nutritional status.

The draft plan called for expanded public and private 
basic and applied research into a host of areas, such as 
basic studies of nutrition and dietary modulation of gene 
expression and cellular and metabolic processes, 
bionutrition, interaction with nutrients and environmental 
agents, safer upper limits of nutrition and nutritionally 
vulnerable populations.

The document also mentioned gaps in U.S. policies that 
promote breastfeeding and proposed strategies to fix them.  

The draft U.S. action plan identified the following themes 
in the December document:  Eating for Health, Nutrition 
Security for All, Safe Food and Water from Source to 
Table, Promoting Breastfeeding, Nutrition-Sensitive Food 
Production and Economic Policy, Human Nutrition Research 
and Nutrition Monitoring.  The plan also includes an 
international section, which outlines how the U.S. 
government can support developing countries in each of the 
World Plan of Action's subject areas.

Nutrition are available from Jay Hirschman, Center for 
Nutrition Policy and Promotion, USDA, 1120 20th St., N.W.,

CALIFORNIA MARKET OWNERS FINED FOR SELLING, MISBRANDING MEAT 
ADULTERATED WITH SODIUM SULFITE

The U.S. District Court, Central District of California, has 
fined owners of a California meat market over $7,000 for 
selling adulterated and misbranded meat, according to USDA's 
Food Safety and Inspection Service.

Cazares Carniceria, a partnership doing business as Maywood 
Plaza Market, Inc., Riverside, pled guilty to selling meat 
to which sodium sulfite had been added and mixed to conceal 
damage and make the meat "appear of better and greater 
value," FSIS reported.  The partnership was fined $6,200.  
Also fined was another partner, Ignacio Cazares, who pled 
guilty to misbranding meat because it had no labeling saying 
it contained sodium sulfite.  

FSIS also reported that the partnership and Ignacio Cazares 
were placed on two years' probation for the incident, which 
took place in 1993.

Bacteria-Tainted Ice Cream, Decomposed Tuna Steaks Recalled

Potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria 
prompted Friendly Ice Cream Corp. to recall half-gallon 
containers of its Chocolate Fudge Brownie Yogurt and Purely 
Chocolate Yogurt, according to news wire reports.  The 
company said there have been no reports of illness linked 
with the yogurt, which was manufactured in Troy, Ohio.    

The Massachusetts-based firm said it halted production of 
the frozen yogurt and issued recall of 30,000 containers 
after the Food and Drug Administration detected the 
contamination during routine testing.  The recall affected 
product distributed in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, 
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New 
York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont 
and Virginia.  

A recent FDA Foods Class II enforcement report noted the 
recall of over 14,000 pounds of frozen yellow fin tuna found 
to be decomposed and containing "hazardous levels of 
histamines."  

Recalled by Tysons Foods, Inc., Springdale, Ark., the recall 
involved IQF Tuna Pieces; 4-oz. Tuna Steaks; 6-oz. Tuna 
Steaks; 8-oz. Tuna Steaks, and 4-oz. Tuna Sandwich Cuts 
manufactured by Tyson Seafood Group, Seattle, Wash.  Recall 
of the tuna, distributed nationwide as well as 
internationally, is ongoing, FDA reported.

FDA CLEARS MENADIONE NICOTINAMIDE BISULFITE FOR USE IN 
CHICKEN, TURKEY FEED

In a final rule issued Jan. 2, the Food and Drug 
Administration amended  573.625, menadione nicotinamide 
bisulfite, to provide for the safe use of the food additive, 
1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-methyl-1,4-dioxo-2-naphthalene sulfonic 
acid with 3-pyridine carboxylic acid amine, CAS Reg. No. 
73581-79-0, as a nutritional supplement for the prevention of 
vitamin K deficiency and as a source of supplemental niacin 
in chicken and turkey feed when used at a rate not to exceed 
2 g/t of complete feed.  Vanetta (U.S.A.) Inc. petitioned the 
agency for the regulation (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Aug. 22, 
1994, Page 38).

Animal Drug Sponsor Changes Announced by FDA

Jan. 4, FDA issued final rules amending animal drug sponsor 
regulations to reflect changes in sponsor name and addresses 
and one change in sponsor:

 522.883, etorphine hydrochloride injection, was amended to 
change the sponsor from Fort Dodge Laboratories to Wildlife 
Laboratories, Inc.;

 510 was amended to reflect a change of sponsor name and 
address from American Cyanamid Co. to American Cyanamid, 
Division of American Homes Products, P.O. Box 1339, Fort 
Dodge, Iowa  50501, and to reflect a change of sponsor 
address for TRINADA, Inc. to One Executive Drive, P.O. Box 
1399, Fort Lee, N.J. 07024.

POLYMALEIC ACID AND ITS SODIUM SALT CLEARED FOR USE IN 
PRODUCTION OF BEET AND CANE SUGAR JUICE, LIQUOR

The Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule Jan. 5 
amending  173.45, polymaleic acid and its sodium salt, to 
clear its use to control mineral scale during the production 
of beet and cane sugar juice and liquor at higher levels 
than the maximum currently permitted, as well as to amend 
specifications for the additives.  

Ciba-Geigy, Inc. submitted a petition to FDA for the 
regulations (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 3, 1990, Page 34) 
containing information on a new manufacturing process which 
resulted in a lower weight-average molecular weight and 
number-average molecular weight than those currently 
permitted.  

FDA issued a tentative final rule May 2, 1995 (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, May 8, 1995, Page 22), noting that the 
molecular weight determinations (weight-average in the range 
of 540 to 850; number-average in the range of 520 to 650) 
are to be based on the improved analytical method submitted 
by Ciba-Geigy, entitled "Determinations of Molecular Weight 
Distribution of Poly(Maleic) Acid."  Having received no 
comments or responses to the tentative final rule, FDA 
concluded it should be issued as a final rule.

CDC FOODBORNE DISEASE INVESTIGATION EFFORTS CRIPPLED BY 
BUDGET STALEMATE

The month-long budget stalemate has yet to have long-term 
consequences for the national sentinel site program but has 
crippled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
ability to investigate foodborne outbreaks (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, July 17, Page 37).

"No doubt the furloughs have made it difficult to keep the 
national surveillance system going," remarked CDC Medical 
Epidemiologist Fred Angulo.  State and local health 
departments are still collecting and reporting surveillance 
data to CDC investigators, but the agency cannot synthesize 
the data without support staff, he explained.  

Travel is severely restricted, so CDC has had to postpone 
site assistance to state officials who have requested help 
from federal disease investigators, he added.  The budget 
crisis means states are not provided with resources to 
determine the magnitude of potential foodborne outbreaks.

"Fortunately, nothing major has happened," Angulo said, 
warning that the government shutdown could place CDC 
officials in a difficult situation if there were another 
deadly outbreak such as the Hanta Virus.  "How would we 
respond when we have no support?" Angulo said.

Another key area where disease control officials are 
crippled is laboratory support.  With CDC's reference 
laboratory closed, federal officials are unable to analyze 
difficult case samples forwarded by state health 
departments.  These samples are checked against the federal 
laboratory's large specimen collection.  "We are the only 
lab in the country that does this," Angelo noted.

While CDC has not been able to synthesize data from the 
national sentinel site program, a multi-agency effort to 
chart foodborne disease trends, the schedule is not likely 
to slip, CDC's Angulo predicted.  

Since the objective of the program is not to respond to 
daily outbreaks but to record long-term trends, the 
furloughs are expected to have only a short-term impact.  
The information is still being forwarded to CDC and, once 
the government budget battle is over, the data can be "run 
through computers," he explained.  

"We've been unable to compile information and look at it," 
he said.  "But when the furlough ends, we will be on the 
same schedule."

HHS Moves to Shore Up Health Statistics Branch

Meanwhile, CDC Director David Satcher was told Dec. 13 that 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would be 
designating a "consolidated health statistics entity" to 
strengthen and coordinate general-purpose health surveys 
throughout HHS.

HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said the new effort will create 
a stronger National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
while keeping the agency within CDC.  Shalala stressed that 
the new effort must continue to be objective and neutral in 
providing the foundation for health policy. 

Among the changes, Shalala plans to strengthen the role of 
NCHS director, expand NCHS's role in HHS data policy and 
provide the agency with greater independence and "a greater 
ability for NCHS to assume responsibility for the integrity, 
quality and efficiency of HHS statistics effort."

Shalala said she plans to review the changes in two years 
and assess whether NCHS should stay in CDC in meeting 
statistics objectives.  ((6FCN 4612, 35 pages, $13)

DIETARY GUIDELINES VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM ADVISORY PANEL'S 
RECOMMENDATIONS

The fourth edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
unveiled last week as the "gold standard for good nutrition 
and health," is virtually unchanged from the draft prepared 
this summer by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee 
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Aug. 28, Page 38).  

The guidelines for the first time include information on 
physical activity and dieting, vegetarian diets and 
recommendations that adults maintain their body weight as 
they age.  They also include an expanded section on grains, 
fruits and vegetables.

The guidelines, last issued in 1990, were generally praised 
by industry and consumer groups.  However, the American 
Frozen Food Institute said the guidelines mislead consumers 
by suggesting that eating cooked or raw vegetables is the 
only way to obtain proper vegetable servings.  "[T]his 
language omits other categories of vegetable products, such 
as frozen," the group said.

In the only reference to frozen foods, the guidelines state, 
"The availability of fresh fruits and vegetables varies by 
season and region of the country, but frozen and canned 
fruits and vegetables ensure a plentiful supply of these 
healthful foods throughout the year." 

Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala stressed 
that the guidelines reflect an increased understanding of 
the role of physical activity in maintaining an adequate 
diet.  "Diet and exercise are the twin engines that can 
carry you on the road to good health," she said at a Jan. 2 
news conference.

Baltimore Researchers Find Weight Loss Is More Effective 
than Exercise in Reducing CHD in Middle-aged and Older 
Overweight Men

Several recent studies published in prominent medical 
journals have examined the effects of weight loss and 
aerobic activity on heart disease and other health 
conditions.

Weight loss proved more effective in improving coronary 
artery disease profiles than exercise did in a group of 170 
obese middle-aged and older men, a group of Baltimore-based 
gerontology experts led by physician Leslie Katzel of the 
University of Maryland School of Medicine noted in a study 
published in the Dec. 27 Journal of the American Medical 
Association.  The scientists set out to compare the effects 
of weight loss vs. aerobic exercise training on CAD risk 
factors in healthy, sedentary, obese, middle-aged and older 
men.  Ninety-seven percent of the study subjects were white.

Seventy-three subjects started a nine-month, diet-induced 
weight loss program; another 71 an aerobic exercise program, 
and 26 served as a control group.  The "controls" were 
instructed not to lose weight or change their diets or level 
of physical activity for nine months.  During the test time 
period, dropouts affected each group  -- 44 finished the 
weight-loss program, 49 finished the aerobic program and 18 
controls completed their assignment.  All original test 

subjects were instructed for three months in the principles 
of an isoenergetic American Heart Association phase I diet 
before the study began.

Study results showed that "weight loss significantly 
improves lipoprotein concentrations, glucose tolerance, 
postprandial insulin levels and blood pressure levels, 
whereas aerobic exercise training in the absence of weight 
loss training has substantially less beneficial effects on 
these parameters," Katzel et al. noted, adding:  "This 
suggests that weight loss should be an integral part of 
interventions to reduce CAD risk in obese, middle-aged and 
older individuals."

In an editorial in the JAMA issue, physician William Hazzard 
of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest 
University, Winston-Salem, N.C., noted that "the most 
encouraging news from this study is that carefully 
supervised weight loss achieved through reduced energy 
intake ... can significantly reduce blood pressure, fasting 
glucose levels (and improve oral glucose tolerance), 
triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol 
levels, all serving to improve CAD profiles.  Correlational 
analyses suggested that the reduction in fat mass achieved 
was central to these changes."

The study by Katzel et al. also "forms another link in the 
chain of evidence pointing toward weight control as a 
principal feature of a successful preventive strategy" for 
slowing the negative health effects often felt by aging 
Americans, Hazzard noted.  Successful aging, or preventive 
gerontology, has as its cardinal principle "the discovery of 
synergistic strategies or common pathways to preserving 
health and promoting health longevity," he said, adding:

"This study further legitimizes the pathogenetic sequence 
that has underlain our advice to aging Americans -- i.e., 
sedentary behavior begets central adiposity begets insulin 
resistance begets hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, 
increased LDL concentrations, decreased HDL concentrations 
and hypertension.  ... However, as demonstrated in this 
study, weight loss reverses this cascade."

Noncentral Obesity, While Less Serious than Central Obesity, 
Still Has Major Health Effects:  Manitoba Researchers

While central obesity, which is characterized by fat 
concentrated in the upper body and high waist-to-hip ratios 
(WHR), is considered the most potentially health-adverse 
type of obesity, Canadian researchers who published a study 
in the same JAMA issue are concerned that people who are 
noncentrally obese are not aware that their condition also 
is likely to be bad for their health.  The scientists 
defined noncentrally obese people as being overall obese but 
with low WHR.

A representative sample of 2,792 adult residents of 
Manitoba, Canada, aged 18 to 74, were interviewed for the 
Manitoba Heart Health Survey.  Of that group, 2,339 
underwent clinical examinations.  Blood pressure, fasting 
plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high 
density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein measurements 
were compared with body mass index (BMI) and WHR.

The Manitoba survey was part of a national effort to 
estimate the prevalence and distribution patterns of 
cardiovascular risk factors and assess the level of 
knowledge regarding cardiovascular health among Canadians.  
In conducting the survey, physician T. Kue Young and 
colleague Dale Gelskey of the Faculty of Medicine, 
University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, found that noncentral 
obesity is not metabolically benign.  BMI as an overall 
measure of obesity is as important as, and sometimes more 
important than, WHR in predicting metabolic effects."

Noncentral obesity is associated with a more unfavorable 
profile of blood pressure, plasma lipids and glucose 
compared with the nonobese, the researchers noted.  The 
Manitoba findings were similar to those from a study on male 
Japanese urban workers, among whom both BMI and WHR were 
associated with blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL.

"There was a gradation in mean systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure between the nonobese, the noncentrally obese and 
the centrally obese," Young and Gelskey said, adding:  
"While WHR was the stronger predictor than BMI for systolic 
blood pressure, the reverse was true for diastolic blood 
pressure. ... Our data relating to BMI and WHR are relevant 
to the design and implementation of health education and 
promotion.  Participants of risk assessment programs who are 
identified as noncentrally obese should still be offered 
appropriate nutritional and behavioral counseling for weight 
control, since this type of obesity is associated with 
significant metabolic effects, although of a reduced 
magnitude than central obesity."

JAMA Contributors Disagree on the Possibility that Blood 
Cholesterol-lowering Drugs May Contribute to Cancer

Researchers/physicians Thomas Newman and Stephen Hulley of 
the School of Medicine, University of California, San 
Francisco, concluded in a "special communication" in the 
Jan. 3 JAMA that, after a literature review of the findings 
and implications of rodent carcinogenicity linked to lipid-
lowering drugs, "the results of experiments in animals and 
humans suggest that lipid-lowering drug treatment, 
especially with the fibrates and statins, should be avoided 
except in patients at high short-term risk of coronary heart 
disease."  They added that "most cholesterol-lowering drugs 
cause or promote cancer in rodents."

They caution, however, that extrapolation of this evidence 
of carcinogenesis from rodents to humans is an uncertain 
process, requiring longer-term clinical trials and careful 
postmarketing surveillance during the next several decades.

Two physicians/researchers from the University of Arizona 
School of Medicine in Tucson disagreed with Newman and 
Hulley's findings, noting in a JAMA commentary in the same 
issue that "Newman and Hulley speculate that some classes of 
lipid-lowering drugs are more likely to cause cancer than 
others.  This speculation overlooks the fact that dietary 
treatment [used to lower lipids] has been reported to have 
the same apparent impact on cancer mortality as drug 
therapy.  If there is a relationship between treatment of 
elevated cholesterol levels and cancer, the critical factor 
would have to be lowering cholesterol levels, not the 
specific drug selected for therapy."

James Dalen and William Dalton noted that they agreed with 
Newman and Hulley that all drugs should be subjected to 
safety monitoring before and after their introduction to 
clinical use.  But they added:  "We do not agree that a 20-
year randomized clinical trial is feasible or necessary."

The Arizona doctors said that Newman and Hulley "have not 
presented convincing evidence that cholesterol lowering by 
diet or drugs increases the risk of cancer death.  Their 
frequently reported recommendations that screening for and 
treatment of high cholesterol should be limited to those 
patients who are at greatest risk of CHD death, i.e., those 
with established CHD, might be supported by cost 
considerations but cannot be supported on the basis of 
safety or the risk of cancer."

Primary prevention of CHD should remain an important public-
health priority, Dalen and Dalton said, but deciding "the 
appropriate age to begin screening and treatment requires 
further discussion and careful consideration of the costs.  
We hope the National Cholesterol Education Program will 
address these issues in their future meetings."

Long-term Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Does Not Halt 
Weight Gain, Fat Distribution

Menopause has been associated with increases in upper body 
(android) fat distribution, researchers Donna Kritz-
Silverstein and Elizabeth Barrett-Connor of the Department 
of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California 
in San Diego, noted in the Jan. 3 JAMA, and they set out to 
see if such weight gain and distribution occurred in women 
taking hormone replacement therapy at the same rate as it 
occurred in women not taking HRT.

They reported the results of a 15-year cohort study of 671 
women aged 65 to 94 who lived in Rancho Bernardo, Calif.  
The women fell into three groups  -- those who had never used 
hormone replacement therapy (194), those who used HRT 
intermittently (331), and those who used HRT continuously 
from the start of the study (from 1972 to 1974, ending with 
follow-up clinic visits between 1988 and 1991).

After adjustment for potentially confounding covariates, 
"there were no significant differences between estrogen 
users and nonusers in BMI at follow-up, change in weight or 
BMI between baseline and follow-up, or WHR or fat mass at 
follow-up," Kritz-Silverstein and Barrett-Connor said.

The researchers noted that many factors other than 
menopausal status are related to the prevalence of obesity 
and fat distribution, which varies substantially by ethnic 
and socioeconomic group.  The Rancho Bernardo subjects were 
white, relatively well-educated and at baseline leaner on 
average than the U.S. population, Kritz-Silverstein and 
Barrett-Connor said, adding:  "Therefore, these findings may 
not be generalizable to populations consisting of other 
racial, ethnic or socioeconomic groups."

Studies Look at Adult Alcohol Consumption's Role in Adult 
Respiratory Health, Children's Cancer 

A group of researchers led by physician Mark Moss of the 
Department of Medicine, Denver General Hospital, looked at 
the effect of chronic alcohol abuse on the incidence of 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in-hospital 
mortality.  Their results, published in the Jan. 3 JAMA, 
showed that a prior history of chronic alcohol abuse 
"increases the risk of developing ARDS in critically ill 
patients with an identified at-risk diagnosis."

There are seven diagnoses that have been defined as causing 
a patient to be at risk for the development of ARDS:  
sepsis, severe pancreatitis, hyper-transfusion, witnessed 
aspiration of gastric contents, abdominal trauma, chest 
trauma and multiple fractures, Moss et al. noted.  They had 
a total of 351 consecutive patients enrolled in their study 
between 1986 and 1993, with the largest group being white 
males.

ARDS is associated with a mortality rate of 40% to 60%, Moss 
et al. noted, and they hope that their results "may be 
useful in the earlier and more accurate identification of 
patients at high risk for developing ARDS."  No specific 
therapy currently exists for treating ARDS, but people at 
high risk for the syndrome might benefit from the early use 
of respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring devices and 
other forms of intensive care unit  technology, the 
researchers said, adding:  "Furthermore, the identification 
of additional risk factors for the development or ARDS could 
yield new insights into the pathophysiology of the 
syndrome."

The use of alcoholic beverages "poses a serious health 
problem for the American society," Moss et al. noted, adding 
that in 1985, an estimated 10.6 million Americans were 
dependent on alcohol, and an additional 7.3 million 
experienced some negative sociological consequences of 
alcohol abuse.  The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism "has estimated that alcohol-related problems cost 
our society $117 billion in 1983, and this figure has likely 
increased over the past decade."  

Meanwhile, an evaluation of data from a Children's Cancer 
Group case-control study was conducted by a group of 
researchers led by Xiao-Ou Shu and Julie Ross of the 
Division of Pediatric Epidemiology/Clinical Research, 
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis."  The conclusions 
reached by Shu et al., and published in the Jan. 3 edition 
of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, were that 
maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the 
risk of infant leukemia, especially acute myeloid leukemias 
(AML), while maternal smoking does not elevate risk for 
either AML or acute lymphoid leukemias (ALL).  The 
implication is that "in utero exposure to alcohol may 
contribute to leukemogenesis involving myeloid cells."

Paternal alcohol consumption did not confer an increased 
risk of infant leukemia, but paternal smoking one month 
prior to pregnancy was related to an elevated risk of ALL 
(OR = 1.56 and 95% CI = 1.03-3.26).

In the Children's Cancer Group study, 302 leukemia cases 
(203 ALLs, 88 AMLs and 11 other leukemia types) were 
diagnosed in children 18 months of age and younger, and 558 
individually matched, regional controls were included in the 
analysis.  Information about parental alcohol consumption 
and smoking behavior during pregnancy and the month prior to 
it was collected by telephone. 

Future studies should focus on the evaluation of the effect 
of timing of alcohol consumption, morphology-specific 
associations and interaction between alcohol consumption and 
other environmental exposures, Shu et al. noted.  Studies of 
biologic mechanisms for alcohol exposure during pregnancy 
and infant leukemia are also warranted, they said.

FUTURE FSIS INSPECTION SYSTEM TO BE DEVELOPED BEGINNING WITH 
FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE, PUBLIC MEETING:  TAYLOR

USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service will begin a 
public process soon to determine how the agency will use its 
inspection resources under a HACCP-based inspection system, 
acting Under Secretary for Food Safety Michael Taylor told 
FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS in an interview last week (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 18, Page 29).

"We've begun talking informally with constituencies about a 
process through which we would develop alternative modes of 
deploying our inspection resources both within plants and 
downstream, during transportation, distribution and retail," 
Taylor said, adding that the agency "would then pilot test 
and gather data to demonstrate that these alternative modes 
are better from a food safety standpoint.  Our goal here is 
not to save money or to reduce the resources we apply to 
this oversight, but to improve food safety by redeploying 
our resources.  We aren't going to make any changes in our 
inspection program unless we are confident that it will work 
to improve food safety."

Taylor said the process will begin "in the next month or so" 
with a Federal Register notice announcing a public meeting 
"and other opportunities for people to help design the 
pilots."  The data from the pilots "will be made available 
in a way that people can participate in evaluating what 
we've learned" so the agency gets "the broadest possible 
input into modernizing how we use our inspection resources," 
Taylor said.

The agency has been plagued by a shortage of inspectors and 
a budget shortfall that has stretched resources thin.  At 
the same time, Taylor has pledged to expand the agency's 
inspection oversight as part of a farm-to-table food safety 
system, and FSIS inspectors are also expected to perform 
additional monitoring and verification duties under HACCP.  
Figuring out how to reconcile all that was one of the main 
charges of the agency's "top-to-bottom" review (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Sept. 11, Pages 4, 7 and 27).

Reinventing Inspection Central to New Strategy

" ...  We have a new framework, a HACCP framework, for the 
plants we inspect, which will require new tasks being 
performed by our inspectors; we also have a farm-to-table 
strategy that says there are going to be roles for FSIS at 
the transportation stage, distribution, and perhaps greater 
involvement in the retail level," Taylor said, adding, "So 
we've got new roles and responsibilities, we've got to keep 
achieving what we've achieved in the past, because what 
we've done in the past is valuable, but with all that, we're 
not likely to get significant new resources to do this job.  
So it's very clear and very central to our new strategy that 
we reinvent inspection itself."

How the agency carries out its statutory mandate of carcass-
by-carcass inspection is likely to be central to the debate.  
One agency plan would replace the current two to three line 
inspectors in broiler plants with one "zone" inspector, with 
plant employees performing sorting tasks (See FOOD CHEMICAL 
NEWS, Dec. 25, Page 53).  Agency officials have also 
discussed eliminating one of the inspection points of head, 
viscera or rail, and one top-to-bottom team recommended 
requiring plants to present only "normal" animals for 
inspection. 

"There's a lot of work that's gone on to begin to develop 
some possible alternative modes of inspection, and certainly 
looking at alternative ways to carry out the carcass-by-
carcass mandate would be part of an overall alternative," 
Taylor said, adding, "We wouldn't be looking at that in 
isolation from how we're overseeing HACCP within that plant 
or how we're inspecting downstream from that plant.  But 
there's no question, going back to the National Academy of 
Sciences' report on a risk assessment approach to poultry 
inspection (1987), that there are opportunities to still 
achieve the very important consumer protection objectives of 
the current system of inspection but then make better use of 
our inspectors in addressing higher-priority food safety 
issues.  We're not wed to any particular alternative. ... We 
plan to lay out some possibilities in the Federal Register 
and the public meeting and have a public discussion about 
them."

Taylor was sympathetic to the concerns of the inspectors' 
union, the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, 
which is likely to be a formidable obstacle to change in the 
current inspection system.  "Everybody knows that we need to 
improve the way we do our job and use our resources and I 
think everyone is also rightfully concerned that we make 
these changes in a way that really will make things better," 
Taylor said, adding, "It's not change for change's sake.  
Our employees, the industry community, the consumer 
community, the scientific community all have a legitimate 
set of interests and concerns that we need to consider and 
take full advantage of, and we're going to have a process 
that does that.  It's a very important undertaking, but it's 
very central to the success of the food safety initiative."

Reorganization Plan to Go to Glickman This Week; Reinventing 
Government Discussed

Taylor also said that the agency's reorganization plan will 
formally go to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman this week.  
Details on the plan, which appeared in FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS in 
December, will likely be made available this week (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 11, Page 5).  Taylor said the plan is a 
"sweeping reorganization aimed not at downsizing the agency 
but at making the best possible use of all the resources we 
have both in the field and in headquarters.  It will be a 
reorganization that is in line with our HACCP, our farm-to-
table food safety strategy."

Taylor made his comments as the agency published several 
documents as part of USDA's reinventing food safety 
initiative (See stories, Pages 18 and 25).  A National 
Performance Review report on current and future USDA and FDA 
food safety initiatives is expected to be released today.

Taylor said the "focal point" of the four FSIS documents was 
an advance notice of proposed rulemaking laying out the 
agency's regulatory reform strategy and listing regulations 
to be revised or eliminated to conform with HACCP.  "I know 
this has been a concern of a number of constituencies, 
particularly industry, that we not simply layer HACCP on top 
of the existing system," Taylor said, adding, "We are very 
committed to having a single integrated inspection that's 
centered around HACCP.  For HACCP to be successful, we have 
to very thoroughly review and reform our existing 
regulations."

Taylor said the regulatory review, reinventing inspection 
and the reorganization are all part of the agency's 
reinventing itself as it moves to a HACCP-based inspection 
system.  "In order to make HACCP work, we need to change 
FSIS in a very fundamental way," he said.

Taylor reiterated his commitment to make existing regulations 
compatible with HACCP before plants are required to implement 
HACCP.  Taylor said the agency is conducting a "page-by-page 
review" of existing regulations.  The initiative "goes beyond 
those that relate to safety and thus to HACCP to include all 
of our labeling regulations, our standards of identity, all of 
our prior approval systems for labeling, equipment, 
facilities.  There are a significant number of rulemaking 
initiatives coming along that not only support our HACCP 
initiative but are part of the president's regulatory reform 
and reinvention of government."

Two published proposals would eliminate duplicative review of 
ingredients with FDA and establish a "generic amendment that 
would permit nutritionally improved standardized foods to be 
sold under a standardized name," Taylor said.  A final rule 
published the same day (Dec. 29) streamlined the prior label 
approval process.

Other "very significant proposals" are forthcoming that 
would eliminate prior approval of facilities, equipment and 
blueprints and establish a performance standard for cooked 
meat and poultry products, Taylor said.  A "very good draft" 
of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on 
transportation, being done in concert with FDA, has been 
completed and will be published in the "next couple months," 
Taylor said.

The agency is also moving ahead on the issue of carcass 
washing versus trimming after an October public meeting on 
the issue (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 30, Page 31).  "That 
was a good discussion of that issue and we have a lot of 
information to consider," Taylor said, adding, "We have data 
from the steam-vacuum trials that are very relevant to this 
issue, and we intend to take a next step on that issue and 
we're working on it."

Despite the frenzy of activity at FSIS, rumors have 
persisted that Taylor will depart with the publication of a 
final HACCP rule.  Taylor said the rumors are untrue.  "I've 
heard the rumors but there's absolutely nothing to it," he 
said, adding, "We've got a lot of work to do."

"We're all very busy but we've got a lot of very capable, 
committed people working very hard to get this done," he 
said, adding, "It is amazing to me how much is being 
produced.  It's a heroic effort that employees here are 
making."

BRIEF NOTES

The Produce Marketing Association on Dec. 22 asked the 
Federal Trade Commission to investigate an advertisement in 
the Dec. 11 issue of Supermarket News by Food & Water, Inc.  
PMA charged that the ad, which stated that pesticide 
residues on produce kill more Americans than assault weapons 
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 18, Page 45), are unfair and 
deceptive.  PMA asked the FTC to issue a cease-and-desist 
order against the ad as well as statements by Food & Water 
that produce treated with agricultural chemicals in 
compliance with government regulations is unsafe. 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service Dec. 29 issued a 
final rule that expands the types of labeling that are 
authorized for use on meat and poultry in both official U.S. 
establishments and certified foreign establishments.  The 
rule is said to eliminate unnecessary duplication in the 
labeling system, and is part of the Reinventing Government 
proposal (See related stories, Pages 18 and 25).  The 
effective date of the rule is July 1.

FSIS Dec. 29 also published another Reinventing Government 
proposed rule that would give definitions of meat and 
poultry products that have been altered due to their 
nutritional content (i.e., "fat free," "low fat," "light").  
Comments on the proposal are due Feb. 27, and questions 
should be addressed to Charles Edwards, 202-254-2565.

Egg quality assurance and the end of the federal Salmonella 
program were the subjects of two recent letters.  On Nov. 
20, Rep. Joe Skeen (R-N.M.), chairman of the Appropriations 
subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and 
Drug Administration and related agencies, asked for "an 
appropriate" amount of federal assistance to be given to the 
Salmonella enteritidis program in 1996 (the budget for which 
has been entirely cut) to allow for a smooth transition from 
a federal program to a state-industry program.  William 
Bell, executive director of the New England Poultry 
Association, wrote to Michael Taylor, USDA acting under 
secretary for food safety, Dec. 13, asking that FSIS 
employee and SE program worker Sheila Foster be funded 
through June to help train state egg-grading personnel to 
act as SE control monitors.

FSIS will be inviting the American Association of Meat 
Processors, the Eastern Meat Packers Association and other 
industry groups to discuss the inspector harassment issue.  
The meeting probably will be held this month in Washington, 
AAMP said Jan. 1 (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Nov. 13, Page 8).

FSIS Dec. 1 allowed Venta de Especialidades Quimicas S.A., a 
Spanish firm, the right to allow the use of a blend of 
carrageenan (70%), xanthan gum (15%) and locust bean gum 
(15%) as a binder mix injected in water-added hams to 
prevent purging of the brine solution.  A letter to the firm 
said FSIS anticipated initiating rulemaking on the subject 
shortly (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 2, Page 9).

Food & Water, Inc. is planning a Jan. 23 press conference in 
Washington at which Samuel Epstein of the University of 
Illinois will present new research on the health risks of 
dairy products from cows treated with bovine somatotropin.

George Giddings died suddenly Dec. 24, according to 
Isomedix, Whippany, N.J.  Giddings was a consultant to 
Isomedix, and helped prepare the petition, now under 
consideration by the Department of Agriculture, seeking 
approval of irradiation of beef.

The "Seafood HACCP Road Show," a series of seminars 
explaining the recently published final rule, has a couple 
of tentative dates lined up for this winter.  Put on by 
FDA's Office of Seafood, the road show hopes to hit the 
highway in February, with a meeting held before, after or 
during the Feb. 18-21 Pacific Fisheries Technologists 
conference in San Diego, Calif.  Also on the agenda are as-
yet-unscheduled seminars in New Orleans and Baltimore and 
one coinciding with the March 12-14 Boston Seafood Show, an 
FDA-er said last week.  Funds permitting, the road show may 
also get to Hawaii, the FDA-er noted, because regulators and 
industry there complained about the difficulty they had 
getting to any of the Pacific Coast meetings of FDA's 
earlier series of informational seminars about the seafood 
HACCP proposed rule (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Jan. 31, 1994, 
Page 16).  For more definite information about the upcoming 
seminars, call the Office of Seafood at 202-418-3133 in 
early February.

None of the 186 samples of domestic and imported animal 
feeds tested for pesticide residues by FDA's Center for 
Veterinary Medicine in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
1995 (July 1 to Sept. 30, 1995) were considered to have 
exceeded regulatory guidances, according to a Dec. 26 
memorandum to regional food and drug directors, district 
directors and state feed control officials from Randy 
Arbaugh, Division of Federal-State Relations, Office of 
Regional Operations, of FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs.  
Tests conducted by FDA regional offices found a variety of 
pesticides, including diazinon, chlorpyrifos-methyl, 
chlorpyrifos-ethyl, malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, diazinon, 
DDT, lindane, fonofos and gardona.  ((6FCN 4613, 8 pages, 
$6)

The Food and Drug Administration announced Jan. 4 the 
availability of a report prepared by the Center for 
Veterinary Medicine's Fluoroquinolone Working Group.  
Addressing issues related to the center's approval of 
fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drugs in food animals, the 
report was written to respond to concerns about "increased 
 ... resistance in zoonotic organisms" in food animals that 
are transmitted to humans and cause disease.  The report, 
which will be featured in a full-length story next week, is 
available by contacting the Communication and Education 
Branch, CVM, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, Md. 20855.

A test being developed by Cornell University researchers 
with funding from the New York Center for Advanced 
Technology in Biotechnology is aimed at being a more 
sensitive and reliable method to test municipal water 
supplies for Cryptosporidium parvum, the university 
reported.  Cornell also said that researchers at the 
university have worked out a way of using carbonation to 
keep dairy products fresh and fortified for months.

The Lancet reported in its Dec. 23/30 issue that 
Streptococcus suis is a threat to pig farmers and abattoir 
workers.  The study found that the pathogen can enter the 
body through cuts or cracks in the skin surface, and can 
lead to fulminate sepsis and a type of meningitis, among 
other serious diseases.  "Infection could possibly be 
prevented by prompt disinfection of skin injuries of persons 
at risk," the article said.

Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest said she did not mean to imply that only 
restaurants are responsible for food safety (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 25, Page 23).  "The bottom line is that 
-- from farm to table -- we all need to share responsibility 
for food safety.  My remarks at the USDA conference are 
clear that neither consumers nor restaurants have sole 
responsibility for ensuring the safety of food products," 
DeWaal wrote the National Restaurant Association's Robert 
Harrington.  Harrington had expressed concern about her use 
of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

Tracking Foodborne Pathogens from Farm to Table:  Data Needs 
to Evaluate Control Options is available from USDA's 
Economic Research Service.  The proceedings cover the 
meeting held on the issue last January (See FOOD CHEMICAL 
NEWS, Jan. 16, Page 38).  It costs $18; call  1-800-999-6779 
to charge a copy or send a check to ERA-NASS, 341 Victory 
Drive, Herndon, Va. 22070.

Some of the active compounds in Sho-saiko-to, a Chinese 
herbal medicine, may have antimutagenic effects, according 
to a paper by Masanori Ohtsuka and colleagues published in 
the December Japanese Journal of Cancer Research.

Some noted food writers and scientists don't want olestra 
used, according to an article in the Jan. 3 New York Times.  
Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the department of nutrition and 
food studies, New York University, and Clark Wolf, a New 
York restaurant consultant, both listed the product as one 
of the things they would "best like forgotten."  Others said 
that they wanted a return to fatty foods (eaten in 
moderation) instead of less tasty low-fat substitutes.

Conjugated lineoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fat found in 
red meat, has been proven to inhibit breast and skin cancer 
in three rodent studies, according to the November/December 
issue of the 1995 Meat Board Research/Meat Science Update.

Butter Flavor Derived
from Lactic Acid

A pilot-scale catalytic reactor system will be used by Natura, Inc.
(3900 Collins Rd., Suite 1007, Lansing, MI 48910; Tel: 517/336-
4635) for the natural processing of 2,3-pentanedione from lactic
acid. 2,3-Pentanedione is used as the buttery flavor in popcorn and
other food products.  According to Chemical Marketing Reporter, an
estimated 15,000 lbs. of 2,3-pentanedione are annually consumed
worldwide in food related applications.

The Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) awarded $203,000 to Natura in a
second-phase grant to develop a large-scale catalytic reaction
process and to improve product purity and yields of natural 2,3-
pentanedione.  The large-scale process should result in lower
prices for the product.  At present, the natural form costs $60-
$80/lb., while the synthetic version costs $50-$60/lb.

When FIN first spoke with Prashant Kokitkar, the principal
investigator in the development of the catalytic reactor system, he
said the pilot-scale reactor was "nearly at the end of the
construction stage" and that he expected to have the system running
"within a week."  The commercial-scale reactor should be
operational within one year.  Kokitkar explained that the one-step
process provides a shortcut in manufacturing, thereby offering
time-saving and cost-cutting advantages over the other two
approaches used by industry currently.

Other advantages are that the process is environmentally friendly
and that the starting material is lactic acid, derived from the
fermentation of corn. The commercial methods of 2,3-pentanedione
production either extract the chemical from dairy products or start
with petroleum in a multi-step, expensive process.

While a post-doc at Michigan State University (MSU), Kokitkar was
part of the group that invented the process.  Dennis Miller of
MSU's Dept. of Chemical Engineering and Ned Jackson of the Dept. of
Chemistry were also part of the team.  MSU has filed a patent for
the process, which will be licensed to Natura.  A contractor will
manufacture the product for Natura.  Kokitkar points out that the
chemical produced by this method has been tested and found to be
"nature-identical."  The investigator adds that in addition to
being a valuable food ingredient, 2,3-pentanedione has the
potential to be used as a starting material for other flavor
compounds.

Natura is a spin-off company of the Michigan Biotechnology
Institute, located at the same address.  Natura, which was
incorporated in December 1994, focuses on the production of natural
food flavors and ingredients.  Ron Carlotti, Natura's president,
explained that the young company is "looking for prospective
investors to get through the start-up phase."  Natura is seeking
potential customers, in both food and non-food areas.  In addition
to 2,3-pentanedione, products under development for the food
industry include a salty flavor and a sugar bulking agent.  A
biophosphorescent material has potential applications outside the
food industry.

Honey Makes Fat
Free Chips Crisper

Fat-free potato chips can be made with microwave technology, but
the appearance and texture of these chips does not compare with
commercial chips.  Scientists in California have found that
including honey in the process can enhance the color and crispness
of microwavable fat-free potato chips.  This research project was
part of a larger effort to develop healthy snack foods.

In the process, sliced potatoes are soaked in brine and honey,
drained, and then sent through a microwave tunnel.  The scientists
investigated 27 combinations of study variables--type of honey,
concentration of honey in solution, and duration of exposure to the
microwave oven.  Liquid honey, drum-dried honey, and a mixture of
the two were investigated.  The level of concentration was 4%, 5%,
or 6% honey.  For each trial, the exposure time variable was set at
4.45, 9.86, or 12.59 min.  Color and texture were measured
quantitatively with a chromasensor and a texturometer,
respectively.

The brownest chips resulted from the potatoes soaked in drum-dried
honey, which contained 70% honey solids.  The 6% honey solution was
found the best for browning.  Not surprisingly, the darkest chips
also resulted from the longest exposure time to the microwave oven.
The potatoes soaked in 5% honey solution made the crispest chips,
based on the amount of force needed to break the chip.  Also, the
median experimental variable for exposure time made the crispest
chips (9.86 minutes).  After statistical analysis, the authors
concluded that the process variables resulting in the crispest,
brownest fat-free chips were 4% liquid honey solution and an
exposure time of 4.45 min.

Kyros Demetriades, Clarissa Guffey, and Hany M. Khalil (Dept. of
Food Science and Nutrition, California Polytechnic State
University, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407; Tel: 619/756-2852) published
"Evaluating the Role of Honey in Fat-Free Potato Chips" in Food
Technology [49(10): 66-67, 1995].  The article was based on a paper
first presented at the Annual Meeting of the Institute of Food
Technologists, Anaheim, CA, June 3-7, 1995.  The project was funded
by the National Honey Board.

In an interview with FIN, Khalil said that the potato chips "tasted
very good," especially if you desire a chip with more of a potato
taste.  For those who crave the fatty taste of regular chips, they
may need to lower their expectations.  Khalil explained that
switching to reduced fat snack foods means you need to "compromise
a little bit for the health benefits."

Khalil's work focuses on the use of microwave energy in process
development.  In addition to developing potato chips and carrot
chips as snack foods, Khalil currently is devising a microwave
method for reducing microbial content in spices.

Vegetable Fibers
to Resemble Meat

Edmund W. Lusas, Gabriel J. Guzman, and Steven C. Doty of the Food
Protein Research and Development Dept. at Texas A&M University
(College Station, TX 77843-2476; Tel: 409/845-2777, Fax: 409/845-
7244) have patented a method (U.S. 5,437,885) for converting
oilseed protein meal into meat-like fibers.  The fibers can be used
in a product such as beef jerky to provide a more nutritionally
balanced snack food.

The first step of the new process is to mix water with dehulled,
defatted oilseed protein meal, such as that originating from
soybeans.  The mixture is heated at a temperature between 200 and
350F, extruded, coated with edible oil or fat, and extruded again.
Non-spongy fibers with a nonporous texture result. The fibers
resemble glistening, broiled meat fibers.

Lusas explained that when these fibers are worked into beef jerky,
the product looks fresher and has a good appearance.  The objective
of the project was to develop fibers that look shiny, which is why
oil is applied in the last stages of extrusion.

The department is a contract process research and development group
that focuses on oilseed processing.  One of their strengths is oil
extraction, and most of the projects are supported by industry.
Projects include the development of reduced-calorie peanut snacks
and a low-cost texturized soybean product that resembles ground
meat.

Better Cinnamon
Rolls with SFE

The true cinnamon of commerce is prepared from the inner bark of
the tropical tree Cinnamomum zeylanicum, while an inferior product
generically termed "cassia" is obtained from closely related trees
of the same genus. Tests for cinnamon purity and quality control
have previously relied on Soxhlet extraction, solvent extraction at
reflux, or simultaneous steam distillation-solvent extraction, but
three U.S. and British researchers have determined that solvent-
assisted supercritical fluid extraction isolates the essential oils
of true cinnamon and cassia more efficiently for separation and
analysis by series-coupled column gas chromatography.

Kenneth G. Miller, Colin F. Poole (Centre for Analytical Chemistry,
Imperial College, South Kensington, London SW7 2AY, U.K.) and Tina
M.P. Chichila optimized extraction conditions for essential oils
from powdered cinnamon by carbon dioxide at 300 atm and 70C. They
mixed 0.5 g of powdered cinnamon with 4.5 g anhydrous sodium
sulfate and added 1.0 ml acetonitrile at the beginning of
sequential 30 min. static and 30 min. dynamic extraction periods.
They collected the semivolatile essential oils by solvent trapping
in ethyl acetate and analyzed them directly by series-coupled
column gas chromatography after filtration and partial solvent
evaporation.

The authors used a Suprex 200A supercritical fluid chromatograph
that was modified for supercritical fluid extraction. Control
extractions were made from each sample by Soxhlet extraction. The
authors used a Seimens Sichromat-2 dual-oven gas chromatograph
fitted with a split injector and a flame ionization detector. For
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, they used a 3400 gas
chromatograph equipped with a model 1075 splitless injector
interfaced to a Finnigan MAT Magnum ion tap detector.

Poole reports in Journal of High Resolution Chromatography [18-8,
461-471, 1995] that the three authors identified and quantified 21
compounds in 24 authenticated and retail samples of cinnamon and
cassia. The dominant essence in both cinnamon and cassia is trans-
cinnamaldehyde, which varies in concentration from 0.5-53 mg/g,
with smaller amounts of various aromatic compounds and esters. True
cinnamon and cassia are easily distinguishable by the presence in
cinnamon of eugenol and benzyl benzoate, which are absent or
negligible in cassia. Cassia, in contrast, contains coumarin and
delta-cadinene, which are absent or trace components in cinnamon.

The extractions were slow or incomplete at pressures below 300 atm
and temperatures below 50C. The authors found that solvent-
assisted supercritical fluid extraction was at least equivalent to
Soxhlet in its ability to extract semivolatile compounds from
cinnamon and cassia, and preferable to Soxhlet for general
applications because it gives faster extractions without generating
artifact peaks. Absolute recoveries by supercritical fluid
extraction and Soxhlet were about the same while solvent reflux for
2 hrs. and simultaneous steam distillation/solvent extraction
achieved significantly lower recoveries of many components.

The concentration of cinnamaldehyde is one parameter for judging
the flavor quality of spice, with quality being directly
proportional to concentration. The average cinnamaldehyde
concentration in cassia, however, is actually higher. Principal
component analysis of the 23 samples using the relative composition
of the 12 major semivolatile essences gave a clear distinction
between cinnamon and cassia. The loadings for "principal component
1" are heavily weighted to benzyl benzoate, 2-
methoxycinnamaldehyde, and benzaldehyde as positive coefficients
and coumarin and beta-caryophyllene as negative coefficients for
cinnamon.

High relative concentrations of benzyl anzoate and 2-
methoxycinnamaldehyde are characteristic of cinnamon and high
relative concentrations of coumarin and beta-caryophyllene are
characteristic of cassia. The authors conclude that principal
component 1 effectively discriminates between cinnamon and cassia.
A plot of PC-1 versus PC-2 clearly separates the 24 samples into
two groups of 11 and 13, with all the U.S. cinnamons falling in the
cassia group.

Isothiocyanates Are
Natural Alternative

Although the commercial use of isothiocyanates is limited, Canadian
scientists propose that the natural agents could replace synthetic
preservatives in certain applications of packaged foods.  Their
volatility make them attractive candidates for use in modern
packaging, either with other antimicrobial agents or on their own.
Pascal J. Delaquis and Joe Mazza of the Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada Research Centre (Summerland, BC V0H 1Z0; Tel: 604/494-7711)
have reviewed the effect of isothiocyanates on microbes.
"Antimicrobial Properties of Isothiocyanates in Food Preservation"
was a peer-reviewed article published in Food Technology
[49(11):73-84, 1995].

Isothiocyanates are found in cruciferous plants, such as
horseradish, cauliflower, mustard, cabbage, turnip, radish,
rapeseed, and Brussels sprouts.  The Romans used mustard seed to
preserve wine and fruit juices.  These sulfur-containing compounds
can be recovered commercially by steam distillation of ground wet
plant material, but synthetic manufacturing processes have been
available since the 1940s.  Isothiocyanates have been used for
military tear gas, pesticides, and industrial purposes.

The molecular structure of isothiocyanates varies.  The generic
molecular formula is R-N=C=S where the R-side group may be methyl
(CH3), allyl (CH2-CH-CH2), or a number of other possible
structures.

Isothiocyanates have been found potent inhibitors of microorganisms
when tested with a variety of fungi, yeasts, and bacteria.  In the
1960s, about 100 natural and synthetic isothiocyanates were tested
for antifungal activity, and it was found that the aromatic
derivatives were the most effective of the natural compounds.  In
the 1990s, Japanese scientists have shown that vapors can inhibit
the growth of several fungi.  At a concentration of 1%, allyl
isothiocyanate can prevent yeast growth in fruit juices.  A review
of the antibacterial studies determined that isothiocyanates are
not as effective at impeding the growth of bacteria as they are
with fungal growth.  Also, certain strains are more resistant to
the bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic effects than others.

Natural extracts of allyl isothiocyanate (CH2-CH-CH2-N=C=S) are
used as a preservative in Japan.  Synthetic forms may be
contaminated with a toxic substance, allyl chloride, which is used
in the manufacturing process.  Allyl isothiocyanate is incorporated
into the packaging material in order to extend the shelf life of
certain foods.

Isothiocyanates are not widely used because the health effects are
unknown.  The findings are mixed regarding toxicity and potential
health benefits.  At least three recent studies show that certain
isothiocyanates may inhibit the development of cancers.  At the
same time, certain kinds are thought to be linked to the
development of goiters through the binding of iodine by the
thiocyanate ion.  Some isothiocyanates are thought to be cytotoxic
or mutagenic.  The data are contradictory.  The authors urge that
more research be conducted in this area, since these compounds
could provide a natural source of preservatives.

Another reason isothiocyanates may not be used widely as food
preservatives is the pungent flavor and odor of these compounds.
Threshold levels range from 8 parts per billion (ppb) for allyl
isothiocyanate to 380 ppb for 3-butenyl isothiocyanate.  But,
antimicrobial activity in foods may be possible with concentrations
below the threshold level in the vapor phase.  Allyl isothiocyanate
is used to control surface growth.  Studies have not been conducted
on the absorption and dissolution of these compounds into food
products.  Delaquis and Mazza urge that more investigations be
conducted to determine the potential of isothiocyanates as food
preservatives.

Covi-Ox Protects
Against Rancidity

Henkel Corp. (5325 S. Ninth Ave., La Grange, IL 60525-3602; Tel:
708/579-6150, Fax: 708/579-6152) markets a product consisting of
natural mixed tocopherols to protect foods containing highly
unsaturated oils.  Covi-Ox protects against oxidative rancidity,
which leads to off-odors and off-flavors.  Natural mixed
tocopherols are GRAS (generally regarded as safe) substances and
are approved as a preservative by the Food and Drug Administration
(21 CFR 182.3890).  According to the company, Covi-Ox tocopherols
are the only approved natural fat-soluble antioxidants available.

Since the tocopherol mixture is of low volatility, Covi-Ox can be
added to the food product during high-temperature processing
without losing activity.  By contrast, synthetic antioxidants
usually volatilize at the same high temperatures.  According to
Henkel, Covi-Ox may be used as an antioxidant to protect lecithin,
vegetable and citrus oils, milk fat, cereal, dehydrated potatoes,
meat products, and a long list of other foods or ingredients.

Covi-Ox is available as a water dispersible powder (Covi-Ox T-30P)
and as clear, viscous oils (Covi-Ox T-50 and T-70).  The optimal
level of tocopherols in food products ranges between 0.01% and 0.2%
of the fat or oil content.

Henkel Corp. is one of the top 200 international companies, and its
Fine Chemicals Div. is the leading producer of natural tocopherols.
In addition to Covi-Ox, the Fine Chemicals Div. markets medium
chain triglycerides, whipped topping concentrates, and bread/baking
ingredients.

Rosemary Puts
Pep in Pepperoni

Diversitech, Inc. (2411 NW 41st St., Gainesville, FL 32606-6662;
Tel: 904/377-7071, Fax: 904/377-7073) markets three forms of
Rosemary extract for extending the shelf-life of pepperoni and
other meat products.  The extract stabilizes color and flavor and
retards the oxidation of fat in the meats.

ColorLife Rosemary extracts come in an oil-soluble powder (Rosemary
Powder-P), an oil-soluble liquid (Rosemary Liquid-O), and a water-
dispersible liquid (Rosemary Liquid-W).  The powder may be added to
the meat mix directly or mixed with dry spices or solids.  When
refrigerated and protected from moisture, light, and oxygen, the
powder remains stable for at least two years.

The usage rate is 0.01% to 0.05%.  Liquid-O can be added to the fat
portion of a food, mixed with flavorings and then added to the
food, or diluted with oil and sprayed onto food.  Liquid-W can be
used in sausage, snack flavorings, and soups.  Depending on fat
content, Liquid-O inhibits rancidity at dilutions of 0.02% to
0.10%, while Liquid-W inhibits at dilutions of 0.03% to 0.14%.

Diversitech markets spice blends to the food industry, primarily to
the meat industry.  The company markets ColorLife as a standardized
rosemary extract.  An advantage of this product is its standardized
active ingredients.  Diversitech offers customized blends with
other antioxidants or spices. According to the company, most of the
rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) imported to the U.S. is grown in
Spain, France, and Portugal.  The leaves contain compounds that
stabilize the fats in meat.

FDA Committee
Says Olestra Safe

The fat substitute olestra is undergoing Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) review.  The FDA Food Advisory Committee met
recently and determined that olestra poses no harm as a food
ingredient.  Olestra is the only fat-based fat substitute ever to
undergo federal review in the U.S.  Other fat substitutes are
carbohydrate- or protein-based.

Procter & Gamble Co. (One Procter & Gamble Plaza, P.O. Box 599,
Cincinnati, OH 45201-0599; Tel: 513/983-1100, Fax: 513/983-9369)
first sought approval to use olestra as a food ingredient in 1987.
At that time, the company filed a food additive petition for using
olestra in shortening and cooking oil.  In 1990, the petition was
amended to use olestra as a fat substitute in savory snacks.
Examples of salty or sharp-tasting snacks of interest to the
company are cheese puffs and crackers.

The Advisory Committee discussed the findings of a team of senior
managers from FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
and FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, who met earlier in 1995.
The team of senior managers reviewed safety data and discussed the
data with experts from academia and federal agencies.  Since the
original petition was filed in 1987, Procter & Gamble has submitted
data from more than 150 investigations on the safety of olestra.

A working group of the Food Advisory Committee reviewed the fat
substitute's chemistry and consumption, toxicology, potential
interference with drug absorption, effects to the digestive system,
labeling, and nutritional effects.  The group decided that the
study questions and data were sufficient, but the vote was not
unanimous for deciding that the data indicated that olestra was
safe for human consumption.  The group recommended that products
made with olestra carry a warning label that the ingredient might
cause intestinal discomfort or might have a laxative effect.
Although no studies showed that olestra has an adverse effect on
the ability to absorb water-soluble vitamins, the committee
recommends that olestra be fortified with vitamins A, D, E, and K.

The full Food Advisory Committee concurred with the findings of the
working group.  The Advisory Committee decided that "a reasonable
certainty exists of no harm" from olestra's proposed food
applications.  The FDA will use this analysis in order to decide on
whether to allow Procter & Gamble to use olestra as a food
ingredient.

Olestra is a fat substitute formed from the combination of sucrose
with fatty acids.  The food ingredient does not liberate calories
because the body cannot metabolize it.  In olestra, the glycerol
molecule present in fat is replaced by sucrose.  And instead of
three fatty acid molecules, olestra has seven or eight.  The fat
substitute is not metabolized because digestive enzymes cannot get
past the fatty acid molecules to access the sucrose center before
olestra exits the digestive tract.

Procter & Gamble reported food and beverage sales of $3.988 billion
in 1995.  Crisco, Jif, Duncan Hines, Folgers, Hawaiian Punch, and
Sunny Delight are examples of its more common household food and
beverage products.

Fatty Acid Polyester
Used in Low-Cal Food

A two-step process prepares saccharide fatty acid polyesters from
a sugar and a reagent containing a fatty acid.  The resulting
polyesters can be used as fat substitutes or low-calorie fats in
foods.

Gerry Hasenhuettl of Kraft General Foods (3 Lakes Dr., Northfield,
IL 60093; Tel: 708/646-7469) invented the process (U.S. Patent
5,440,027).  First, the sugar is partially esterified.  Then, a
reagent containing a fatty acid is used to react with the partially
esterified sugar.  The reagent may be fatty acids, fatty acid
esters, salts of fatty acids, or fatty acid anhydrides.  Saccharide
fatty acid polyesters result from the reaction.

Less carmelization and fewer decomposition reactions are two basic
advantages of using a partially esterified sugar for the reaction.
Also, the reaction system is more homogeneous, and the formation of
low molecular weight ester byproducts is less.

According to Hasenhuettl, these saccharide fatty acid polyesters
would fall into the same category as olestra, a zero-calorie fat
substitute made from sucrose and fatty acids.  Procter & Gamble
(One Procter & Gamble Plaza, P.O. Box 599, Cincinnati, OH 45201-
0599; Tel: 513/983-1100, Fax: 513/983-9369) manufactures olestra
and has petitioned the FDA for approval to use the fat substitute
as an ingredient.

Product Bakes
Moister Cakes

Juan M. Gonzalez-Sanz of the Pillsbury Co. (200 S. 6th St.,
Minneapolis, MN 55402-1464; Tel: 612/330-4741) invented a low-fat
spreadable composition that can be used with baked foods or alone,
as a frosting.   Shortening, starch, a hydrocolloid, an emulsifier,
and a sweetener make up the product.  The starch has a hydrophilic
starch component and a modified hydrophobic starch component.

When used as a frosting, the low-fat composition exhibits enhanced
adhesion.  When used in baked foods, such as cakes, rolls, breads,
biscuits, and pastries, the product increases the moistness. U.S.
Patent 5,439,697 was issued to Pillsbury for this invention.

Proprietary Process
for Peanut Butter

Seabrook Enterprises, Inc. (100 Galleria Pkwy. NW, Suite 580,
Atlanta, GA 30339; Tel: 770/951-0404) now markets a reduced-fat
peanut butter for fillings, coatings, bakery items, nutrition bars,
dairy products, and candy centers.  Only two reduced-fat peanut
butters have been commercialized.  A similar product is the low-fat
peanut spread, which does not contain the minimum level of 90%
peanuts to qualify as peanut butter.

According to Tucker Dodson, Seabrook Enterprise's VP of sales, the
main advantage of Seabrook Enterprise's reduced-fat peanut butter
is that it "has all the same nutritional function with 25% less
fat" than whole-fat peanut butter.  No vitamin or mineral
supplement is added to the all-natural product.  The flavor is more
concentrated, the product is less apt to separate, and the peanut
butter is more heat stable.

About 25-30% of the fat is removed by their proprietary method.  In
1994, the company applied for a patent for the fat-extracting
technology.  Although this product is sold solely as a food
ingredient on the industrial market, the peanut butter is available
for repackaging for retail sale.

Dodson describes the company as a "vertically integrated peanut
shelling and processing company" that is the largest of its kind in
the U.S.  Seabrook Enterprise processes 400 million pounds of
peanuts annually.

Glazing Over
Caramel Corn

Michael L. Jensen and Sara J. Risch of Golden Valley Microwave
Foods, Inc. (7450 Metro Blvd., Edina, MN 55439; Tel: 612/835-6900)
have invented a microwavable mixture for sweetening microwave
popcorn.  The mixture is composed of unpopped popcorn, a sweetening
blend, and a glazing blend.  Salt may also be added to the unpopped
corn.

The sweetening blend is made from an oil and sugar crystals.  The
weight ratio of sweetening blend to unpopped popcorn is between
0.5/1 to 1.5/1.  The oil's melting point is above 115F. The
crystalline sugar has a moisture content less than 2% by weight.

The glazing blend, which is mixed with the unpopped popcorn, is
made from corn syrup (80-90% by weight), oil (10-20% by weight),
and an emulsifier.  As with the oil used for the sweetening blend,
the glazing oil's melting point should be above 115F.

Jensen, a food technologist with Golden Valley Microwave Foods,
told FIN that the method has been used in the past for a marketed
popcorn product.  The work originated in order to eliminate the
second step necessary in making caramel popcorn.  In order to
sweeten the popcorn, a wafer is placed on the cooked popcorn and
melted in a second microwaving step.  Jensen and Risch's invention
eliminates the need for a separate wafer containing sweetener.
Instead, the popcorn is coated with both sweetening and glazing
blends.  The patent may be licensed by companies interested in
using the mixture in their own products.

Systems Bio-Industries
Adds on Aspartame

The NutraSweet Co. (1751 Lake Cook Rd., Deerfield, IL 60015; Tel:
708/940-9800) no longer has exclusive rights to aspartame, and
Systems Bio-Industries (8 Neshaminy Interplex, Suite 213, Trevose,
PA 19053; Tel: 215/638-7801) joins the list of other companies who
have added aspartame to their line of food ingredients.

Aspartame is about 200 times sweeter than table sugar (sucrose).
The artificial sweetener is an ingredient in 500 foods and
beverages, such as yogurt, drink mixes, and carbonated soft drinks.
The product loses sweetness when exposed to heat, moisture, or
alkaline conditions.  Aspartame is made by joining two amino acids-
-aspartic acid and phenylalanine--which are found in natural
proteins.

Aspartame is one of the most widely tested food ingredients.  More
than 100 safety tests were conducted before it was marketed.  The
product was approved in the U.S. in 1981 as an ingredient in
powdered mixes and for use as a tabletop sweetener.  In 1983,
carbonated drinks were added to the list of approved uses. The food
ingredient is marketed in more than 70 countries.  Product names
include NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, and Natra Taste.

According to Jim Duffy, account manager, sales and marketing (620
Progress Ave., Waukesha, WI 53186; Tel: 800/654-2396), the company
is an industry leader among food ingredient manufacturers. In
addition to Aspartame 200, they manufactures a variety of food
ingredients and additives, including enzyme-modified dairy
ingredients, gels, fruit preparations, pectins, and natural flavor
systems.  In January 1995, when SKW Trostberg A.G. of Germany
acquired the company, the name was changed to Systems Bio-
Industries from Sanofi Bio-Industries.  The acquisition increased
SKW's total sales to the food industry by $1 billion.

Sugar-Containing
Solutions Softened

A cation exchange resin-based process for softening aqueous
solutions such sugar juice or molasses has been investigated.
Michael Saska of the Louisiana State University (LSU, Chemical
Engineering Dept., Baton Rouge, LA 70803; Tel: 504/388-3327)
reports that the sugar cane and sugar beet industries produce large
quantities of non-crystallizable sugar juice, or sugar factory
molasses.  This molasses has a high sugar content and is treated
to extract the sugars.

Such conventional treatment involves subjecting the molasses to an
ion exclusion chromatography process using a fixed support of a
strong sodium (Na) or potassium (K) cation resin.  The problem is
that magnesium (Mg) and/or calcium (Ca) salts dissolved in the
molasses and, as charged Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions, replace the Na+ and
K+ ions during the chromatography operation, reducing the
separating power of the technique.  As a result, the chromatography
operation is interrupted periodically to regenerate the cation
resin.

Regeneration reagent is consumed and productivity is reduced.  One
approach to overcome the problem involves the elimination of the
Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions prior to the chromatography step.  Such a
technique also requires the use of a regeneration reagent and has
the additional disadvantage of producing wastewater containing
sugar, reducing the yield from the overall process.

In the new process, the sugar juice is softened by bringing it into
contact with Na+ and/or K+ cation exchange resins in a conventional
manner.  The key to the new technique is the regeneration part of
the process, which makes clever use of one of the liquid effluents
in a sugar factory.  The raffinate generated during the
chromatographic separation and charged with Na+ and/or K+ ions is
normally discarded.  The researchers concentrated the raffinate and
used it to regenerate the resin used in the primary separation.
U.S. Patent 5,443,650 covers the new technique.

Honey Heightens
Taste Perception

Anna Resurreccion and her colleagues at the Dept. of Food Science
at the University of Georgia (Center for Food Safety and Quality
Enhancement, Georgia Station, Griffin, GA 30223; Tel: 770/228-7284;
email: aresurr@gaes.griffin.peachnet.edu) have demonstrated in a
recent study that honey can have an effect on the perception of
sweet, sour, bitter, and salty tastes.  The sensory evaluation
tests were performed by panels of trained evaluators.

The intensity of sweet solutions is enhanced by the addition of
honey.  When 25% honey is added to a 5% sucrose solution, the
sweetness intensity is doubled.  Other solutions, such as 10%
sucrose, are not enhanced to the same degree.  Orange blossom honey
was shown to have the most enhancing power.

Pure solutions of citric acid were used to evaluate honey's effect
on the sourness of solutions.  The sourness intensity rating of a
citric acid solution was decreased from 50 to about 17 by the
addition of 25% honey.  The more sour the solution, the more
pronounced the effect.  A citric acid solution rated at 100 was
reduced to about 28 by the addition of honey.  This study shows
that honey has the ability to increase consumer acceptability of
very sour products, such as citrus beverages, yogurts, and berry-
based products.

Caffeine solutions were used to measure the reduction of bitterness
resulting from the addition of honey.  Orange blossom, wildflower,
and clover honeys were used to evaluate the reduction.  Clover
honey showed the widest margin of difference; the bitterness
intensity plunged from 50 to 3.2.  Food developers could use honey
in order to mask bitterness in certain foods, which can result from
molecular breakdown during processing.

Honey can mask the high saltiness intensity of salt-cured products,
such as ham and bacon.  The panel of evaluators indicated that
adding honey to a sodium chloride solution decreases the salt
intensity score from 50 to about 28.  With a saltier solution, the
score dropped from 150 to about 45 with the addition of honey.

The carbohydrate composition varies between honeys, which might
explain why orange blossom, wildflower, and clover honeys had
slightly different results in this study.  Fructose and glucose are
the main carbohydrates in honey.  In addition to these
monosaccharides, maltose, sucrose, and other oligosaccharides are
found in honey.

In addition to being a sweetener, honey as an ingredient can hold
moisture, can extend shelf-life, can promote color and flavor
development, and can be used as a browning agent or surface coating
in microwavable products.  The National Honey Board Food Technology
Program (P.O. Box 281525, San Francisco, CA 94128-1525; Tel:
800/356-5941) conducts studies on the use of honey in foods.

According to Veronique LaGrange, senior scientist and spokesperson
for the Honey Board (TJP Market Development, 3242 Jones Cr. NW,
Washington, DC 20007; Tel: 202/625-6055), the primary purpose of
the Honey Board Food Technology Program is to "help manufacturers
use honey in their products."  The studies tend to be applications-
oriented for products already in existence.  The program provides
printed documents, in the form of newsletters and research
monographs, and assistance to manufacturers who wish to use honey
in their products.  New ways of using honey, as well as new markets
for honey, are offshoots of the program.

Report Determines
That MSG Is Safe

For most people, ingestion of monosodium glutamate (MSG) does not
pose a problem.  For others, this flavor enhancer can cause
headaches and other unpleasant effects.  The Life Sciences Research
Office of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental
Biology analyzed the adverse reactions people have had to MSG.  The
report was prepared for the Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Free glutamate, in the form of MSG or protein hydrolysates, is used
to enhance flavor.  Currently, MSG must be listed when added as an
ingredient to foods.  But free glutamate is a natural component of
many foods, such as Parmesan cheese and even tomatoes.

The FDA is using the analysis in order to determine whether the
level of free glutamate should be included on labels when present
in a "significant" amount.  A quantitative value of "significance"
is yet to be defined.  According to the Institute of Food
Technologists ("Monosodium Glutamate: A Statement of the Institute
of Food Technologists" Food Technology [49(10):28, 1995]), the
glutamate content of MSG is 78%, while the glutamate content of
hydrolyzed vegetable protein is about 8%.

The report concluded that MSG is safe since the short-lived adverse
reactions are confined to a small subset of the population.  No
studies have demonstrated long-term effects from the ingestion of
MSG, such as the development of tumors or toxicity to the nervous
system.  Other organizations deeming MSG safe include the World
Health Organization, American Medical Assn., Commission on European
Communities, and Institute of Food Technologists.

Most foods contain less than 0.5 grams of MSG per serving.  The
report found that about 3 grams of MSG are necessary for an adverse
reaction to occur.  Subjects eating large amounts of MSG on an
empty stomach were most likely to complain of ill effects.

MSG is made by fermenting starch, corn sugar, or molasses from
sugar cane or sugar beets.  The ingredient harmonizes with salty
and sour tastes, but does little to enhance sweet foods.  Some
scientists classify MSG's effect as a fifth taste sensation known
as "umami."

According to Chemical Marketing Reporter [248:18, 1995], the annual
U.S. market for MSG is 40,000-50,000 metric tons.  Two companies
produce the ingredient domestically, Archer Daniels Midland Co.
(4666 Faries Pkwy., P.O. Box 1470, Decatur, IL 62525; Tel: 217/424-
5200, Fax: 217/424-5839) and Ajinomoto USA (Eddyville, IA).  Both
operations are fairly new:  Ajinomoto USA's domestic plant has been
in operation since 1993, and Archer Daniels Midland Co.'s site went
online in 1994.  MSG's cost per pound is about 69 cents.

While the domestic demand for MSG is stable, exports are on the
increase.  About 60% of the exports are sent to Canada, Mexico, and
the U.K., but the Netherlands and France are also consumers of
American-made MSG.  In 1994, exports totaled about 193 metric tons,
and in 1995, shipments increased to 5,000 metric tons.  One source
claims that the worldwide demand for MSG is increasing by 10% or
20% annually.  The report prepared for the FDA may help to redress
MSG's tarnished image in the U.S. and enhance annual consumption
levels here.

More Intense
Cinnamon Flavor

Baltimore Spice, Inc. (9740 Reisterstown Rd., Owings Mills, MD
21117; Tel: 800/365-3229, Fax: 410/363-6619) is introducing an
encapsulated cinnamon to help bakers who have yeast leavening
problems when adding ground cinnamon to a yeast dough. Typically,
bakers either reduce cinnamon usage in the dough to allow more
leavening or change to topical cinnamon application rather than
adding to the dough. Both of these techniques, however, can
diminish desired cinnamon flavor.

To provide a stronger flavor impact and instant release of volatile
oils, encapsulated cinnamon may be used instead of regular ground
cinnamon, and at a slightly lower level that will still produce an
acceptable cinnamon flavor. The outcome is greater leavening
because there is a decreased percentage of cinnamon in the dough.

SFE Compared with
SPE for Ham Analysis

The conventional method for analyzing N-nitrosamines in hams was
challenged by the development of a supercritical fluid extraction
(SFE) method.  Scientists at the Eastern Regional Research Center
of the Dept. of Agriculture (Agricultural Research Service,
Philadelphia, PA 19118; Tel: 215/233-6400) compared solid phase
extraction (SPE) to SFE for extracting N-nitrosamines in hams
processed in elastic rubber nettings.

Both the SPE and the SFE methods used gas chromatographic-
chemiluminescence detection.  The SFE's variable restrictor was
equipped with a silica gel adsorption cartridge.  No statistical
difference was found between the results obtained by the two
methods.  Advantages of SFE are the reduction in solvent use and
the speed of the analysis.

John W. Pensabene, Walter Fiddler, Robert J. Maxwell, Alan R.
Lightfield, and James W. Hampson published "Supercritical Fluid
Extraction of N-Nitrosamines in Hams Processed in Elastic Rubber
Nettings" in the Journal of the Association of Official Analytical
Chemistry [78(3):744-748, 1995].

Pesticides Removed
from Fruits, Veggies

Two recent publications describe the removal of pesticides from
vegetables and fruits using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).
Both studies found SFE an acceptable method for the removal of
pesticides from produce for analysis.

Steven J. Lehotay and Konstantin I. Eller of the Beltsville
Agricultural Research Center of the Dept. of Agriculture
(Environmental Chemistry Lab, Bldg. 7, Rm. 224, Beltsville, MD
20705-2351; Tel: 301/504-6078) developed a method for analyzing the
levels of 46 pesticides in grapes, carrots, potatoes, and broccoli.
The multiresidue method used SFE in conjunction with gas
chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry in order to extract and
analyze residues.

The SFE was performed at 320 atm and 60C, and the extracts were
trapped on solid phase media.  Silica gel bound to octadecylsilane
was found suitable for this purpose.  The trap was then eluted with
acetonitrile.  Next, the chromatographic analysis was performed.
Greater than 80% recoveries were achieved for 39 of the 46
pesticides.  The recoveries of the other pesticides, with the
exception of methamidophos and omethoate, were more than 50%.

Both incurred and fortified samples were used in a subsequent
analysis to evaluate the method.  The blind experiment showed that
this method resulted in recoveries similar to results from seven
laboratories using solvent-based extractions with traditional gas
chromatograph detectors.

Lehotay tells FIN that the focus of his work is pesticide analysis
of agricultural commodities, and SFE is one of the primary methods
of extraction being developed by the lab.  The study was published
as "Development of a Method of Analysis for 46 Pesticides in Fruits
and Vegetables by Supercritical Fluid Extraction and Gas
Chromatography/Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry" in the Journal of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3):821-830, 1995].

In a similar study, scientists in Spain used a simple SFE method to
remove pesticide residues from fresh pepper, cucumber, and tomato
samples.  Under moderate conditions, commercial SFE equipment
extracted methamidophos at a level greater than 70%, as well as
chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and procymidone.

The fresh samples were mixed with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
Methanol was used as a modifier for the carbon dioxide fluid.
Extraction conditions were a pressure of 300 atm and a temperature
of 50C.  The authors recommend further development of this method
for the extraction of multiple residues.

A. Garcia-Valverde, A.R. Fernandez-Alba, A. Aguera, and M.
Contreras of the Pesticide Residue Research Group of the
Universidad de Almeria (Facultad de Ciencias Experimentales, Spain)
published "Extraction of Methamidophos Residues from Vegetables
with Supercritical Fluid Carbon Dioxide" in the Journal of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3):867-873, 1995].

Focus on Foods'
Health Benefits

Marketers of dairy, tomato, and perhaps flour products have some
heartening news about the health benefits of their foods. The
findings from three independent studies concluded that aged persons
should eat more dairy foods to get vitamin D to reduce risk of bone
loss, men should eat tomatoes to reduce risk of prostate cancer,
and women of childbearing age should eat foods rich in folic-acid
to reduce risk of birth defects.

A report published in the December 5 issue of The Journal of the
American Medical Association found that many elderly people fail to
get enough vitamin D because they lack opportunities to get outdoor
exposure to sunlight.  Sitting by a sunny window won't do the job
because the glass filters out the ultraviolet light needed to
convert precursor molecules to vitamin D in the skin.

The report was based on a study conducted at the Union Memorial
Hospital's Div. of Geriatrics in Baltimore. The subjects were 244
people age 65 and over, some of whom were confined to nursing homes
or in their own homes, and some who were able to go outdoors. The
study raised the question as to whether recommended dietary
allowance levels should be reevaluated in order to see if higher
levels of vitamin D supplementation are needed.  Mentioned as good
natural sources of vitamin D were milk, dairy products, egg yolk,
oily fish such as sardines, salmon, tuna and liver.

Foods containing tomatoes, which are rich in the antioxidant,
lycopene, are believed to provide higher levels of protection
against prostate cancer, according to Harvard University
researchers led by Dr. Edward Giovannucci of  the Harvard School of
Public Health. Men who ate at least 10 servings per week were found
to have a 45% lower rate of the cancer compared to men who ate 4-7
servings weekly and had only a 20% reduction in the cancer.

Further good news is that the tomatoes could be in any form, such
as sauces, juice, raw and even in pizza. In fact, cooked tomato
products appeared to be more protective than either juice or raw
tomatoes, on the assumption that when tomatoes are heated their
cells burst and release more lycopene.

The nine-year study examined the eating habits of 47,000 men in the
health professions between the ages of 40 and 75, and was published
in the December 7 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer
Institute. The first survey was taken in 1986, and the subjects
were followed and periodically re-examined. At the end of the study
in 1992, there were 812 cases of prostate cancer among the
subjects, and the dietary histories of these cancer subjects were
then compared with the subjects who did not develop the cancer.

Also published in the December 5 issue of JAMA  was a report from
the University College in Dublin, Ireland which stated that
fortifying food with folic acid may be the best way to reduce the
number of babies born with severe birth defects.  Irish researchers
at the college said a four-year study of blood samples from
pregnant women showed that those with the lowest levels of folate,
a salt of folic acid, in red blood cells had the highest risk of
bearing a child with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida.

A 48% reduction in the total neural tube defect rate is
theoretically achievable with an increased population intake of 0.4
milligrams per day of folic acid, according to the report, and this
could better be realized by fortifying foods than with
supplementation. Folic acid, a vitamin necessary for blood marrow
to make red blood cells, is found in a wide variety of foods,
particularly liver and raw vegetables. In the U.S., there is
discussion about fortifying flour with folic acid because it is a
staple in the diet and women wouldn't have to change their dietary
habits in order to intake adequate levels.

Consumers Trust
Farmers the Most

After all the money and trouble that food processors went through
to create new labels, how do consumers rank them as credible
sources of information about foods?  Second only to farmers,
according to the second annual American Food Consumer Survey
recently conducted by Purina Mills, Inc. of St. Louis.  The study
asked more than 3,500 consumers from across the country about their
attitudes, practices and sources of knowledge concerning their food
supply, during August-September, 1995.

The food information sources considered as "most credible" by the
survey's respondents included farmers (26%), food labels (19%),
family and friends (14%), food industry (10%), educators (9%),
government agencies (9%), grocers/supermarkets (6%), news media
(4%) and advertising (3%). Further findings were that 74% believe
that farmers should use high yield farming technology to feed our
growing population; 63% feel that the food they consume is safe,
and the greatest concerns among respondents about our food supply
are in the areas of water contamination, bacterial contamination
and pesticide use.

New Markets Sought
by U.S. Food Makers

The search for new markets via new product development or new lands
to sell to have forged three recent marketing agreements between a
leading baking products company and the market leader of fat-free
and reduced-fat snack foods, a maker of natural foods and three
Japanese companies that will market them, and a world-leading soup
company acquires a controlling interest in a joint venture to
penetrate southeast Asian markets.

Pillsbury, the Minneapolis-based subsidiary of Britain's Grand
Metropolitan PLC will produce, market and sell SnackWell's baking
mix products under license from Nabisco.  The first product will be
SnackWell's Low Fat Fudge Brownie Mix, and shipments will begin
this month. The mix was created by a proprietary balancing of
ingredients in order to achieve the rich chocolate flavor of high-
quality brownies, but with less fat. Each brownie has just 2.5
grams of fat, compared with 7 grams in regular fudge brownie mixes.

The baking mix marks the first time the SnackWell's name appears
for this type of product. Currently, the Snackwell's line includes
fat-free and reduced-fat cookies, crackers, breakfast bars, yogurts
and instant puddings.  In just three years, Nabisco's SnackWell's
has become the largest cookie and cracker brand in the U.S.

Since Japanese consumers are like their American counterparts and
want healthy foods, Kushi Macrobiotics Corp. of Stamford, CT has
formed an agreement with three major Japanese natural food retail
and wholesale companies that will market the Kushi Cuisine line of
premium natural food products:  Meiwa Sangyo Co. Ltd., a subsidiary
of Mitsubishi Corp., Anew-Naturally Yours Co. Ltd., and TKB Mart.
Kushi Cuisine products will be the only nationally available line,
and it will include 33 premium, easy-to-prepare natural foods.

Camden, NJ-based Campbell Soup Co., which is the world's leading
soup company, is acquiring its first manufacturing facility in
Southeast Asia, in Malaysia. Campbell has achieved this move by
acquiring the controlling interest in a joint venture with one of
Malaysia's leading food firms,  privately owned Cheong Chan (Hup
Kee) Sdn. Bhd. of Petaling Jaya. The new company will manufacture
soups, chili sauces, ketchup and foodservice products and ethnic
Chinese sauces.  Campbell will market and distribute these products
throughout the ASEAN (Association of South East Asia Nations)
countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Thailand, The
Philippines and Vietnam.

Campbell is hoping to capitalize on the love of soup in Asia, as
well as the strength of Malaysia's economy. A total of 40% of the
world's soup is consumed in Asia, either homemade or commercial.
Soup consumption is strong in Southeast Asia, particularly among
ethnic Chinese, and prepared, packaged soup is popular among people
in the upper income segments. The top selling Campbell soup in Asia
is corn soup designed especially for the local market.

Malaysia has one of the strongest and fastest growing economies in
the Asia Pacific region, and 1995 was the seventh year in which the
growth rate was above 8%. While only 17.5 million people live in
Malaysia, there are  some 300 million people living in southeast
Asia, 83 million of whom live in urban areas.

Companies Expand
and Restructure

To deal with projected domestic growth, one company expands a
facility, and with an eye toward global growth, two companies
reorganize their U.S. or international divisions.

Opta Food Ingredients, Inc. headquartered in Bedford, MA has
completed the expansion of its Louisville, KY facility that will
double its capacity to produce Oat Fibers, its line of functional
texturizing agents that can also increase dietary fiber in foods.
The expansion was in response to increased demand for the
proprietary ingredient from its customers, who include food
processors and foodservice operators. Among the former are five of
the 10 largest U.S. consumer packaged food companies.

Eastman Chemical Co. based in Kingsport, TN has combined two of its
businesses to create a new organization to be known as Performance
Chemicals.  As of January 1, the company's Polymer Modifiers and
Nutrition and Formulation Products businesses will be one
organization that includes four business units, one of which is
Food Ingredients and Specialty Products. Specialty Products is a
consolidation of four business segments--Cosmetics  and Personal
Care, Nutritional Supplements, Textile Chemicals and  Urethane
Intermediates.  (The other three business units comprising
Performance Chemicals are involved with chemicals and
pharmaceuticals.)

International giant, Philip Morris Co. has reorganized Kraft Foods
International, a subsidiary of Kraft Foods, Inc. The international
subsidiary has extensive coffee, confectionery, cheese and other
food operations throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the
Asia/Pacific region. The restructured Kraft Foods International
will include four separate regional units--Kraft Jacobs Suchard
Western Europe; Kraft Jacobs Suchard Northern Europe; Kraft Jacobs
Suchard Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and
Kraft Foods Asia/Pacific.

Xylose Plant Now
Under Construction

Cultor (Kyllikinportti 2, SF-00240 Helsinki, Finland) plans to
construct a $70 million xylose plant in Austria.  Xylose is used in
the production of xylitol, an ingredient used to sweeten chewing
gum and oral hygiene products. Cultor's subsidiary, Xyrofin, claims
that worldwide demand for xylitol is increasing by 25% annually.
The subsidiary also claims to have 80% of the world market for
xylitol.

The xylose plant will be located next to a birch pulp production
unit, allowing Cultor to use one of the byproducts of pulp
production for the extraction of xylose.  The streamlined logistics
will enhance the efficiency of the process.

Sugar Prices Drop,
Maybe Up for Milk

With the announcement by a leading candy maker that prices for a
candy bar will go up five cents, the Washington DC-based American
Sugar Farmers were quick to point out that the price hike had
nothing to do with the price of sugar.  That's because sugar prices
have decreased during the past five years, and cane and beet
farmers have not had a price increase in 10 years.

Supporting this contention are figures from the Dept. of
Agriculture and the Bureau of Labor Statistics which report that
the wholesale price that food manufacturers pay for their sugar has
fallen 16% since 1990.  However, during this same period, the
prices for sugar-containing products, such as candy, bakery goods,
cereal and soft drinks, have increased from 10-22%. So like the man
said, it can't be because of sugar.

Milk prices are another matter because their increase may be traced
to the well-meaning but misguided program currently under
consideration by Congress. According to the International Dairy
Foods Association of Washington, DC, the new dairy plan would lock
in milk prices at January 1996 levels,  the highest levels in the
past five years, and would cost consumers an estimated $1 billion
more annually.

The plan was worked out by the National Milk Producers Federation,
an organization that represents the major dairy farmer
cooperatives. The plan would eliminate some of the surplus products
the government would purchase, locking in a minimum price level for
fluid milk, and adding several new ways that milk producers would
share the money paid for their milk.  Budget savings would be
accrued by changing the government's policy of buying surplus dairy
products. Currently, the dairy price support program buys any
butter, milk powder or cheese that isn't purchased.  Under the new
plan, this would involve only cheese.

The outcome could be that butter and powder would be dumped on
world markets at low prices, which would then be subsidized by a
new system assessing all dairy farmers to cover the difference
between lower prices and former government support levels. This
scenario could cause a shortage of dairy ingredients for U.S. food
manufacturers, forcing up prices of finished products at the
consumer level.

Shifts Seen in
Vitamin E

The market for tocopherol is undergoing major changes a natural
tocopherol is becoming increasingly available for food applications
and as key players in the business are forming strong alliances.

The global tocopherol market is currently almost $1 billion. Most
of this tocopherol, which is produced by synthesis, is used in
agricultural feed. About $100 million in sales are generated by the
food industry.  The market for synthetic tocopherol is shared by
four companies: Hoffmann-LaRoche, with a market share of 45%; BASF,
with a market share of 28%, Rhone Poulenc, with a market share of
16%; and Eisei, at 11%.

A specialty in the food market is natural tocopherol. This is
obtained by an extraction and purification process from soya scams,
the residues which remain after soya oil is processed and refined.
The current worldwide market for natural tocopherol is about $50
million and is shared by Henkel, Eastman Chemical, and Eisei.
Although these companies produce their natural tocopherol by their
own technology, they all depend on the provision of the raw
material by other companies.  The global soya oil industry is
controlled by only two companies: Archer Daniels Midland (ADM),
which has a 40% share, and Cargill, with 35%.

Hoffmann-LaRoche signed an agreement with Cargill in early 1995 to
jointly construct a 1000 ton natural tocopherol plant.  While
Cargill is responsible for supplying raw material, Hoffmann-LaRoche
is responsible for marketing.

The plant is scheduled to come onstream in late 1996. At full
capacity, it will consume about 50% of the worldwide production of
soya scams.  Since the global production of soya oil has reached a
plateau, there is not much raw material left for competitors.

Eastman obtains its soya scams from ADM, but a major procurement
problem will  arise for Henkel--and especially Eisei.  Roche could
eventually obtain a market share of 70%.

Tocopherol is also contained in significant amounts in palm oil and
palm leaves. However the extraction of  pure tocopherol is much
more difficult.  Henkel and Eisei both have a strong position in
the palm oil market, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia.  These
companies may well turn their efforts to developing  new processing
technology to wrest tocopherol from palm sources.  The palm oil
industry is booming and the raw materials available to making
tocopherol are therefore increasing.

Demand for Garlic
Is Seen Tripling

Garlic production in the U.S. has tripled in the past 20 years,
according to a cover story appearing in Smithsonian.  In 1975, the
Dept. of Agriculture recorded 140 million pounds of garlic
produced, and in 1994, the figure had soared to 493 million pounds.
The current annual growth rate is about 10%.

The U.S. also imports garlic from Argentina, Chile, China, Mexico,
Spain, and Taiwan.  About 100 million pounds of the pungent,
bulbous herb are imported each year.  The per capita consumption
was estimated to be 0.6 pounds in 1975 and 1.6 pounds in 1994.  In
Europe, per capita garlic consumption is twice as great.

As a food ingredient, garlic is available as a puree, dry flakes,
and powder.  The product is used in a variety of foods, including
frozen dinners, powdered mixes, and bottled sauces.  California is
responsible for 90% of the commercial garlic produced in the U.S.

FDA Proposes
Changes in NLEA

If you market a food that can deliver health benefits to consumers,
you want to let them know about it.  That's the attitude of members
of the Washington, DC-based National Food Processors Assn. (NFPA)
who have been petitioning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
make changes in the NLEA since October 1994.  Now it looks like
their efforts will be rewarded because the FDA is proposing to
amend existing regulations governing health claims and nutrient
content claims.

The October 25 petition was followed by a preliminary answer from
the FDA on May 11, 1995 which stated there would be some favorable
responses to some requests. The newly proposed rule, published in
the Federal Register on December 21, 1995, calls for:

 Flexibility in Health Claims Language - provides greater
flexibility in health claims language for some of the longer health
claims currently in effect. One proposed amendment focuses on the
calcium-osteoporosis health claims removing the requirement for
noting that specific populations (i.e., White and Asian women) are
at particular risk for osteoporosis. FDA is proposing to permit,
under certain conditions, abbreviated health claims that are
truthful and non-misleading and that include a referral statement
directing consumers to the complete claim elsewhere on the label.
FDA has acknowledged the benefits of permitting more consumer-
friendly messages and communications as supporting the intent of
the health claims concept.

 Synonyms and Implied Nutrient Content Claims - allows the use of
synonymous nutrient content claims on food labels when consistent
with, and adjacent to the defined nutrient content claim term.
FDA's proposal allows the use of synonymous nutrient content claims
on food labels.  In the FDA's view, undefined synonyms of nutrient
content claim terms must be presented on the label immediately
adjacent to a defined term.  The defined term would be required to
be used with the most prominent undefined term, following the rules
outlining prominence of claims.

 Modifications to the "Jelly Bean" Rule in Health Claims -
modifies the requirement prohibiting a health claim from being made
on a food which does not contain at least 10% Daily Value per
serving of at least one of a number of nutrients.  The FDAs
proposed rule modifies the minimum nutrient contribution
requirement, or "jelly bean" rule, for health claims.  This
requirement prohibits a health claim from being made on a food
which does not contain at least 10% Daily Value per serving of
vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, protein, or fiber.
Specifically, FDA has proposed to exempt raw and processed fruits
and vegetables, and enriched cereal grain products and enriched
bread with standards of identity, from the "jelly bean" rule.  The
FDA also will consider whether other types of foods, such as
formulated products, should also be exempt from the "jelly bean"
rule.

 Health Claims Disqualifying Nutrient Levels - discusses case-by-
case evaluation of changing disqualifying levels for total fat,
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, which would prohibit the use
of any health claim, to levels which would trigger a disclosure-
type referral statement. FDA denied a request in the NFPA petition
that FDA change disqualifying nutrient levels for total fat,
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, which would prohibit the use
of any health claim to levels which would trigger a disclosure-type
referral statement.

NFPA had requested that health claims be prohibited only when the
nutrient is adversely associated with the disease referenced in the
health claim. While FDA denied this broad approach, the Agency
indicated it will evaluate this case-by-case.  FDA included in the
preamble to the claims proposed rule substantial guidance to
petitioners, and discusses factors to be considered in any request
that disqualifying nutrient levels be changed to levels requiring
label disclosure.

Another denial by the FDA was NFPA's request that the agency allow
truthful, non-misleading health claims established as presumptively
valid based on the findings of scientifically authoritative third
parties. The FDA stated it does not have authority under existing
law to approve such a policy change.

FDA Requires
HACCP for Seafood

Consumer concern about the safety of eating seafood is about to be
mitigated. The FDA has set safety regulations for the seafood
industry that involve using preventive controls based on principles
of the system, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP).
Seafood processors must identify potential problems that could make
seafood unsafe, then establish and monitor targeted control points
to minimize the hazards, and then keep a record of the results.

FDA surveillance and inspection programs will still be in place but
HACCP recordkeeping will enable regulators to monitor product
safety more effectively on a more continuous basis rather than rely
on the previous system which involved spot checks.  Seafood
processors are responsible for both domestic and imported seafood
materials. The program will be fully implemented over the next two
years but inspections begin in 1996.

The new ruling was immediately applauded by the commercial seafood
industry which sees the HACCP program as one that will benefit
federal and state inspectors, consumers and seafood processors.
Inspectors will now have a historical view of the facility because
HACCP records will date back to the last inspection visit.
Consumers will be assured of seafood safety and quality, and
processors will have a cost-effective system that will help to
increase sales of processed seafood products.

Meat Processors Want
Safety Rules, Too

Now that consumers will be assured of the safety of seafood
products, processors of some types of meat products feel that they
are at a disadvantage because they can't provide the same
assurances. Specifically, the day after the FDA announced its new
requirements for seafood processors (see above story) the National
Pork Producers Council and the National Cattlemen's Assn. announced
that beef and pork industry leaders formed a working group to
prepare a plan of action to achieve equity between red meat and
poultry inspection and food safety issues.

The aim is to improve the food safety process, create a more level
playing field for producers, and provide better information for
consumers.  The group is to consider regulatory, legislative, and
judicial issues to ensure that new safety regulations set the same
requirements for all meat and poultry products, and "to eliminate
economic inequities that put beef and pork at an economic
disadvantage in the meat case."

MEAT AND POULTRY PROPOSAL:  

MEAT AND POULTRY PROPOSAL:  The Food Safety and Inspection 
Service published a Dec. 29 proposed rule to amend its meat 
and poultry inspection regulations to "harmonize and 
improve" the procedures used by FSIS and FDA for reviewing 
and approving the use of substances in meat and poultry 
products.  Under the proposal, FSIS would no longer issue 
its own regulations listing the substances it finds 
suitable, instead deferring to FDA for future regulations on 
suitable substances for meat and poultry products.  FDA 
published a similar proposal in the same issue of the 
Federal Register.  (EDITOR'S NOTE:  This proposal will be 
covered in greater detail in next week's issue of FOOD 
LABELING & NUTRITION NEWS.)

FDA STREAMLINING:  

FDA STREAMLINING:  The Grocery Manufacturers of America said 
it is pleased that FDA has taken a partial step toward 
streamlining its "bulky" nutrition labeling regulations, but 
added that it remains to be seen whether the agency's 
proposal on nutrient content and health claims will actually 
allow food companies to make changes in label claims, a GMA 
spokesman told FOOD LABELING & NUTRITION NEWS (See FLN Dec. 
21, Page 11).  CSPI's Bruce Silverglade argued, however, 
that FDA's proposed changes will allow companies to "clutter 
up" the label with information that will make it more 
difficult for consumers to identify "low" and "reduced fat" 
foods.  "FDA should be clearing up these problems instead of 
making it easier for food companies to make health and 
nutrition claims," Silverglade said.

improved food quality and safety; (4) preventing and 
managing infectious diseases; (5) promoting breastfeeding; 
(6) caring for the socio-economically deprived and 
nutritionally vulnerable; (7) preventing and controlling 
specific micronutrient deficiencies; (8) promoting 
appropriate diets and healthy lifestyles, and (9) assessing, 
analyzing and monitoring nutritional situations.

PHYTOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATOR URGES DENIAL OF OLESTRA 
PETITION

A researcher investigating the anti-cancer potential of 
phytochemicals has warned FDA not to approve the pending 
food additive petition for olestra, predicting that use of 
the product may have a negative health impact.  However, a 
host of letters received by the agency last week stressed 
that research has confirmed the safety of the fat substitute 
(See FLN Dec. 21, Page 3, and Dec. 28, Page 3).

Jed Fahey, faculty research associate with the Brassica 
Chemoprotection Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins School of 
Medicine, said he was "distressed" by the data indicating 
that olestra may reduce absorption of many fat-soluble 
vitamins.  "There are a great number of other, fat-soluble 
phytochemicals, some of which we are investigating in my 
laboratory for their anti-cancer potential," Fahey said, 
adding, "Many of them have yet to even be isolated in pure 
form and are therefore unavailable for testing."

"The inclusion of olestra in commonly consumed American 
foods has a high probability of effecting the wholesale 
reduction of a multiplicity of beneficial compounds from the 
diet of a great many Americans," the letter to FDA 
Commissioner Dr. David Kessler said, adding, "Based on 
overwhelming epidemiological evidence, there is a high 
probability that the use of this product would have a 
negative health impact."

Comments from the American Diabetes Association and the 
American Heart Association took no specific stand on whether 
FDA should approve olestra.  ADA said it supports the 
development and introduction into the marketplace of food 
products that help people lose or maintain weight, but added 
that it "looks to and respects the FDA review process for 
assurance of product safety."  AHA encouraged FDA to 
continue the review of all fat replacers.  The group noted 
that many products on the market labeled as "reduced fat" 
have significant amounts of mono- and diglycerides, which 
are a source of calories and are metabolized as fat.

The comments of a variety of researchers supporting approval 
of the fat substitute -- some of which were sent in by 
Procter & Gamble, the petition's sponsor --  were also 
included in the FDA administrative file on olestra.  Many of 
these letters included positive comments about the conduct 
of the four-day Food Advisory Committee meeting held by FDA 
in November to consider the data on olestra (See FLN Nov. 
23, Page 10).  The comment period on the petition ended Dec. 
21.


The American Dietetic Association said one of its 
representatives attended the advisory committee and working 
group meetings on olestra, and added:  "We believe that the 
process allowed for a full airing of ADA's views on this 
matter.  We fully support the FAC review process including 
its interpretation of the data and consideration of public 
comment."

A co-discoverer of olestra, Dr. Fred Mattson, professor of 
medicine emeritus at the University of California in San 
Diego, noted that as early work on the compound progressed, 
"I came to the conclusion that olestra posed no hazard as a 
food ingredient."

"Subsequent studies have served to strengthen this opinion," 
Mattson noted.  He noted that olestra "is now supported by a 
much wider range of studies and now many of these are on 
human subjects.  Moreover, the level of use is inherently 
limited by the nature of the food products in which it will 
be used."

Nutritionist Johanna Dwyer of Tufts University said her 
interest in fat substitutes such as olestra led her to 
independently review some of the studies in the peer-reviewed 
literature.  Later, she was asked by P&G to review and edit 
two papers for publication on consumption models and use of 
the pig and other data for assessing human effects of feeding 
olestra.  Citing her specific interest in gastrointestinal 
effects, Dwyer said she requested and received additional 
information on GI effects, and devoted particular attention 
to what might be expected at very high levels of intakes.

At Dwyer's request, P&G sent her blinded samples of olestra-
containing potato chips and regular potato chips at amounts 
that would constitute the 95th percentile of intake.  Dwyer 
said she ate these potato chips in a single bolus amount for 
a meal on two separate days and subsequently recorded her 
own views of signs and symptoms of GI distress.  "I felt 
more GI distress when eating the regular potato chips, and 
did not record any differences in stool consistency in this 
brief experiment," Dwyer wrote.  She noted that very high 
chronic use might produce changes in the consistency of the 
stool, but it is "inappropriate to describe these changes as 
diarrhea."

Dwyer said she concluded that the product "is safe and may 
provide a benefit to some consumers who wish to eat low fat, 
low saturated fat salty snacks."  She added that the FDA 
evaluation process and the advisory committee deliberations 
"were reasonable, thorough and helpful."

Dr. Harry Greene, clinical professor of pediatrics at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he attended the 
advisory committee meeting in November and was "extremely 
impressed with the presentations by the FDA scientists and 
the presentations by the expert consultants brought in by 
FDA in providing an unbiased and scientific approach to the 
relevant studies which have been performed with olestra."

CSPI took data out of context, researcher charges

Greene criticized presentations by the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, saying much of the data "was taken out 
of context" or "completely misinterpreted due to a lack of 
scientifically acceptable statistical evaluation, and in 
many instances was anecdotal."  In contrast, he said, "the 
data presented by Procter & Gamble scientists represented 
clear examples of well controlled, scientifically credible 
studies."

Greene said the chairman of the advisory committee made sure 
that CSPI had an equal opportunity to present its 
objections.

Also charging that CSPI took data out of context, Dr. 
Michael Davidson, medical director of the Chicago Center for 
Clinical Research at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical 
Center, noted that the clinical studies by P&G "were 
purposely designed to assess the extreme intakes of olestra 
in subjects of various body sizes and dietary habits."  
Davidson pointed out that olestra "was used to replace 
almost 50% of the daily fat intake for those in the 32-gram 
dose group," which he said "included petite young women who 
were unaccustomed to large intake of non-digestible food."

"The vast majority of subjects with gastrointestinal events 
were women who would rarely consume 32 grams of olestra on a 
single day, yet were fed 32 grams daily for eight weeks," 
Davidson added.  He noted that approval of olestra "has 
significant health implications for the entire U.S. 
population," since high fat consumption is a leading cause 
of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and obesity.

Researcher reports positive response to olestra in nutrition 
education study

Dr. John Foreyt of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston 
said he conducted a study on the use of olestra in a 
nutrition education program.  Female adults were randomly 
assigned to either an olestra or non-olestra group, and 
various food products containing olestra, including 
shortening, potato chips, oven-ready french fries and a 
mayonnaise-type salad, were made available as part of an 
overall nutrition education program, Foreyt said.  "Response 
to the product was positive," he commented, noting that 
subjects in both groups reduced their dietary fat 
consumption to approximately 30% of total calories.

"Responses to our questionnaire suggested that subjects with 
access to the olestra products experienced less deprivation 
while reducing dietary fat intake than the subjects without 
access to the olestra products," Foreyt said, adding that 
the study is currently in press.

"Based on our study, and my reading of the olestra research, 
I believe that olestra can help consumers lower overall fat 
intake because it gives them a choice, without sacrificing 
taste," he said.

Dr. Gail Harrison of the University of California School of 
Public Health in Los Angeles complimented the special 
consultants utilized by FDA as in-depth review experts on 
olestra, calling them "absolutely the best in the field."  
Harrison added, "Their reports can be relied upon in terms 
of scientific validity and perspective."

Recommending approval of the compound, Harrison said she is 
"quite thoroughly acquainted with the data base supporting 
the safety of olestra as it is proposed for use in savory 
snacks in the U.S. food supply, and am convinced on the 
basis of reasonable scientific judgment it is safe by the 
standard that FDA must apply."

Other letters recommending approval came from Dr. Elijah 
Saunders of the University of Maryland's School of Medicine, 
Division of Hypertension, and Dr. George Bray, executive 
director of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at the 
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

A letter from Penny Kris-Etherton, professor of nutrition at 
Penn State University, reiterated conclusions she had 
presented for P&G at the advisory committee meeting -- that 
inclusion of olestra snacks would reduce dietary carotenoids 
over a period of seven days by approximately 10%.  The 
calculations assumed that all savory snacks included in  
dietary records randomly selected from study subjects in 
target groups of interest were olestra-containing snacks, 
she said.

"Obviously, in a real world setting, not all savory snacks 
consumed will contain olestra.  Nonetheless, I believe that 
our estimates are reasonable as a means to gain a 
perspective about the average impact of olestra-containing 
snacks in different free-living population groups," Kris-
Etherton added.  ((6FLN 1401, 26 pages, $11)

RESEARCHERS QUESTION LINK BETWEEN TRANS FAT, HEART DISEASE

The alleged link between trans fatty acid intake and 
coronary heart disease risk is questionable, according to a 
critical review of research studies on Trans Fatty Acids and 
CHD Risk conducted by P.M. Kris-Etherton, Ph.D., and R.J. 
Nicolosi, Ph.D., for the International Life Sciences 
Institute.

The report found that the effect of partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oils is relative to the fats or oils they are 
replacing.  Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils actually 
reduce blood total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
concentrations when substituted for animal fats (e.g., 
butter and lard) and vegetable fats rich in saturates 
(e.g., palm, palm kernel and coconut oil), the researchers 
said.  Hydrogenated vegetable oils, however, modestly raise 
blood cholesterol levels when substituted for the 
unhydrogenated native oil.  Therefore, the report said, the 
overall effect of hydrogenated fats on blood cholesterol 
concentrations in the population depends on the net change 
in the ingestion of saturated, trans, cis-monounsaturated, 
and cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids.

These findings run contrary to the position of the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest, which filed a petition 
with FDA two years ago to require that trans fat be included 
with saturated fat on food labels, and to limit the trans 
fatty acid content of foods making fatty acid, cholesterol 
or vegetable oil claims (See FLN Feb. 24, 1994, Page 14).

CSPI's position is based on evidence supported by studies 
such as one conducted by Judd et al., published by the 
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, which suggests that 
trans fat, at levels consumed by the average American, was 
found to raise LDL-cholesterol about the same as does 
saturated fat.  Another study supporting CSPI's stance on 
the issue is the recently presented Sundram et al. abstract, 
which found trans fat to be even more hypercholesterolemic 
than saturated fat (See FLN June 29, Page 5).

Kris-Etherton and Nicolosi's review, however, found that 
epidemiological data are limited in that they may suggest 
relationships but cannot prove cause and effect.  
Epidemiologic investigations conducted in the 1970s and 
1980s found, for the most part, no significant associations 
between trans fatty acid intake and CHD risk, they said.  
Some investigation conducted in the 1990s found significant 
associations between trans fatty acid intake and CHD risk.  
But most of the study results, over the years, have 
illustrated inherent limitations of epidemiological 
research, according to the report.

Investigations conducted in the '70s and '80s, which showed 
no significant association between trans fatty acid and CHD 
risk, examined concentrations of specific trans fatty acids 
in various body tissues or estimated dietary intake of trans 
fatty acids in comparison to various measures of CHD.  Some 
of the studies indicated that the trans fatty acid t-16:1 
was associated with an increased risk of CHD -- the 
predominant source of this fatty acid is animal fat.  This 
suggests that any association between trans fatty acid 
intake and CHD risk may be due more to trans fatty acids 
from animal sources than from partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oils, the report stated.

Three studies published in the 1990s suggested a significant 
relationship between levels of trans fatty acid intake and 
CHD risk or risk factors, the report said.  One of the 
studies found that individuals with the highest and lowest 
intakes of trans fatty acids also had correspondingly lower 
and higher risks of suffering a heart attack.  The lowest 
risks occurred among individuals eating intermediate levels 
of trans fatty acids.  This finding suggests that other 
factors may be involved in the association, the report 
indicated, adding that lack of a dose-response relationship 
between trans fatty acid intake and risk of heart attack 
illustrates one of the limitations of epidemiological 
research.

Current epidemiological data also appear limited in their 
ability to distinguish between the possibility that trans 
fatty acids cause CHD risk or that CHD risk causes increased 
trans fatty acid intake, the report said.  For example, 
individuals who perceive themselves to be at risk of CHD may 
increase their intake of products made with partially 
hydrogenated vegetable oils such as margarine, and decrease 
their intake of products with higher levels of saturated 
fat, which could induce a biased association between trans 
fatty acids and CHD or CHD risk factors.  A 1992 study that 
reported a significant relationship between trans fatty acid 
intake and CHD risk factors attempted to control for this 
possibility.  The result showed that the relationship 
between trans fatty acids and lipids was indeed stronger for 
subjects who had been told that their blood cholesterol 
levels were high.  This study, the report said, supports the 
theory that those who perceive themselves to be at greater 
risk of CHD may increase their intake of trans fatty acids.

Atherosclerotic properties of trans fatty acids in animals 
examined

To define the impact of fatty acids on CHD risk, scientists 
have compared the atherosclerotic properties of saturated, 
unsaturated, and trans fatty acids in animals, the report 
said.  Numerous studies support the atherogenicity of 
saturated fats, and other studies indicate that the 
saturated fatty acids lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids 
appear to have similar arterogenic effects.  A similar 
association with trans fats, however, is not apparent, the 
report said, adding that data suggest that trans fatty acids 
do not increase risk of arteriosclerosis.  Studies conducted 
over the past 30 years on rabbits, monkeys and pigs have 
demonstrated little if any difference between the effects of 
nonhydrogenated and hydrogenated vegetable oils containing 
high concentrations of trans fatty acids on the incidence or 
severity of atherosclerosis, the report said.

Clinical studies conducted over the past 40 years indicate 
that the effects of hydrogenated fats on blood cholesterol 
levels were intermediate between the unhydrogenated native 
oil and more saturated fats, the report said.  To verify 
these findings, metabolic studies of longer duration with a 
more appropriate number of subjects were conducted.  Ten of 
11 studies confirmed that feeding hydrogenated fat produced 
higher total cholesterol concentrations than did 
unhydrogenated native oils. 

All of these studies also confirmed that the increase was 
less than that observed when butter, palm oil, or coconut oil 
was substituted for the native oil, the report said.  In 
addition, several outpatient feeding studies have confirmed 
the finding that consumption of hydrogenated fats resulted in 
lower blood cholesterol concentrations than typical intakes 
of butter or mixed animal and vegetable fats, according to 
the researchers.

Inconsistent effects of trans fatty acids on HDL cholesterol 
levels have been found in other studies.  Three studies 
reported that the consumption of trans fatty acids was 
associated with significant reduction in HDL cholesterol.  
However, three other studies in which trans fatty acids were 
fed at levels consistent with current intakes in the U.S. 
reported no such reduction in HDL cholesterol, the report 
said.

The report indicated that because substituting hydrogenated 
fats for more saturated fats will lower LDL, and lowering 
LDL has been shown to decrease CHD risk, the overall effect 
of hydrogenated fats substituted for saturated fats in the 
food supply may still be beneficial, despite possible small 
reductions in HDL cholesterol concentrations.  This 
conclusion is supported by a large body of evidence that 
shows that populations with habitual low-fat diets have 
lower levels of both LDL and HDL cholesterol and a low 
incidence of heart disease, according to the report.

WARNING LETTER ISSUED TO CHICKPEA MANUFACTURER FOR 
UNDECLARED ADDITIVES 

An FDA warning letter was issued to a chickpea product 
manufacturer for the presence of undeclared FD&C Red #3 and 
FD&C Red #40, and for failing to declare net contents in 
metric as well as in inch-pound units.

Chicago District Director Raymond Mlecko warned Eden 
International Inc. about undeclared FD&C Red #3 in "Eden's Red 
Chickpeas," and FD&C Red #40 in "Eden's Gourmet Mix," colors 
which are required to be declared by name in the statement of 
ingredients, he said.

In addition, Mlecko advised Eden that the net contents 
should be declared in metric units and inch-pound units.  
Because FDA has not published final regulations as to how 
the declaration is to be made, Eden may add the metric 
statements now, using guidance in the proposed regulations 
published in the Federal Register of December 21, 1993, 
Mlecko said.

In the August 30 warning letter, Mlecko also told Eden that 
the violations mentioned are not necessarily an all-
inclusive list of deficiencies on its labels.  Eden was 
advised to review all of its food labels to determine 
whether they are in compliance with all applicable statutes 
enforced by FDA.  ((6FLN 1402, 2 pages, $5)

DIETARY GUIDELINES' EMPHASIS ON CAROTENOIDS CITED IN CSPI 
OLESTRA LETTER

The consumer group Center for Science in the Public 
Interest, continuing its quest to keep olestra out of the 
food supply, has reminded FDA that the newly revised Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans encourage consumers to eat foods 
containing carotenoids.  CSPI contends that the fat replacer 
inhibits the body's ability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins 
(See Page 3 and FLN Dec. 14, Page 3).

In a Jan. 2 letter, intended as an addendum to earlier CSPI 
comments on Procter & Gamble's petition for olestra, CSPI 
Executive Director Dr. Michael Jacobson referred to the 
agency actions as "ironic."  "The National Cancer Institute 
is urging Americans to consume more carotenoid-rich fruits 
and vegetables, in part because of the probable benefits of 
carotenoids themselves," Jacobson said, adding that the 
guidelines stress the importance of carotenoids as follows:

"Most fruits and vegetables are naturally low in fat and 
provide many essential nutrients and other food components 
important for health.  These foods are excellent sources of 
vitamin C, vitamin B6, carotenoids, including those which 
form vitamin A (see Box 7), and folate (Box 8).  The 
antioxidant nutrients found in plant foods (e.g., vitamin C, 
carotenoids, vitamin E and certain minerals) are presently 
of great interest to scientists and the public because of 
their potentially beneficial role in reducing the risk for 
cancer and certain other chronic diseases.  Scientists are 
also trying to determine if other substances in plant foods 
protect against cancer."

Also included in the new guidelines is a special box (Box 7) 
that lists "Some Good Sources of Carotenoids," Jacobson 
said.  Considering the level of recognition carotenoids have 
received in the guidelines, it would be "extra ironic," 
Jacobson said, "if the FDA approves carotenoid-depleting 
olestra just weeks after the newly revised federal nutrition 
policy."

Addressing the issue of whether carotenoids serve any 
biological purpose in humans other than beta-carotene's role 
as a provitamin A, CSPI also submitted an abstract of an 
intervention trial which CSPI said provides further evidence 
that beta-carotene has anti-cancer potential and "offers 
further basis for denying the food-additive petition for 
olestra," CSPI said. 

The study was conducted by Harinder Garewal, M.D., Ph. D., 
of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Tucson, 
Ariz., and his colleagues at three cancer-research centers, 
CSPI said.  "The key portion of the study involved giving 50 
patients a daily dose of 60 mg of beta-carotene for six 
months.  Twenty-six (52%) of the patients responded to beta-
carotene, with their oral leukoplakia diminishing.  The 
result is similar to that found in an earlier study by 
Garewal that used half as much beta-carotene," according to 
CSPI.

The abstract is an addendum to earlier CSPI comments on 
Procter & Gamble's petition for olestra that included 
intervention trials demonstrating that beta-carotene causes 
regression of oral leukoplakia, CSPI said.  ((6FLN 1403, 2

FDA REJECTS OPTIMAL HEALTH STANDARD FOR DETERMINING RDIs

The Food and Drug Administration has rejected the concept of 
"optimal health" -- a standard requested by dietary 
supplement groups -- as the standard for determining 
Reference Daily Intake values, opting to continue basing 
values on "nutrient adequacy" (See separate stories).

In its Dec. 28 final rule establishing Reference Daily 
Intakes for vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, 
molybdenum and chloride, FDA wrote that it was "not 
persuaded" that a change in the basis for determining RDIs 
is warranted, but noted that since the National Academy of 
Sciences is in the process of evaluating the basis by which 
it determines the Recommended Daily Allowances -- on which 
RDIs are based -- FDA will revisit the issue once NAS reports 
its findings.

"The agency believes that any action to change the basis for 
the RDIs should await completion of the NAS process to 
ensure that such an action reflects scientific consensus and 
to avoid the possible need for consecutive relabeling of 
foods that might occur if FDA were to proceed to revise the 
RDIs before NAS published new values," FDA said. 

The rule also modifies the units of measure used to declare 
the amount of biotin, folate, calcium and phosphorus in food.  
FDA decided not to establish an RDI for fluoride because it 
found no scientific consensus determining that fluoride is an 
essential nutrient.

Vitamin K to be considered in evaluating nutritional 
inferiority of substitute foods

FDA will consider vitamin K when it determines if substitute 
foods are nutritionally inferior to the foods for which they 
substitute, the agency said.  Although it received several 
comments expressing concern that vitamin K should not be 
included in such determinations because of difficulties in 
determining levels of vitamin K in foods,  FDA said it was 
"not persuaded by the comments that there is a lack of 
analytical methods for vitamin K, or that technological 
barriers to analyzing foods for vitamin K, or to adding 
vitamin K to foods, are insurmountable."

The agency noted that many foods that are reformulated as 
substitute foods do not contain much vitamin K in the first 
place, such as foods made primarily of sugar and water, as 
well as many oils, drinks, fruits and fish.  Important 
sources of vitamin K, such as green leafy vegetables, 
legumes and soybean oil, are not generally reformulated, FDA 
noted.

"The primary categories of substitute foods that may need to 
be reformulated or relabeled appear to be those that 
substitute for foods containing eggs, milk, grains, or those 
oils that contain vitamin K," FDA said.  Leaving vitamin K 
out of a substitute food when it is present in the original 
food would make the substitute food nutritionally inferior, 
FDA said. 

The final rule makes the consideration of selenium, 
chromium, molybdenum and chloride optional in determining 
whether a food is nutritionally inferior to a food for which 
it substitutes.

Companies that wish to add the new RDIs to their product's 
nutrition label may do so immediately, FDA said.  Others 
have until Jan. 1, 1997, which corresponds with the 
effective date of DSHEA regulations and should give industry 
time to do the appropriate analysis and implement the 
changes, FDA said.

STRUCTURE/FUNCTION CLAIMS, DISCLAIMER STATEMENTS PROPOSED

One of the key proposals in FDA's triad on dietary 
supplement labeling (See separate stories) would establish 
rules for declaring percentages of nutrients not covered by 
current RDIs or RDAs.  The same proposal, as part of the 
implementation of the Dietary Supplement Health and 
Education Act, would:

-- withdraw a provision of NLEA that dietary supplements of 
vitamins and minerals may not give prominence to any 
ingredient that is not a vitamin or a mineral;

-- specify how the disclaimer required by DSHEA is to be 
presented along with "statements of nutritional support";

-- remove the current NLEA definition of dietary supplements 
in health and nutrient content claims rules.

FDA set a comment deadline of March 13 and proposed an 
effective date of Jan. 1, 1997.

Summarizing in an analysis of impacts which expressed FDA's 
uncertainty as to whether the rule would provide any 
consumer benefit, the agency said, "The proposed rule does 
not significantly change the way in which claims are made, 
with three exceptions: 

"(1) Percentage claims for dietary supplements that do not 
have RDIs or DRVs are no longer prohibited;

"(2) Dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals may now 
highlight an ingredient that is not a vitamin or mineral, 
and

"(3) Labels or labeling of dietary supplements may include 
statements of nutritional support so long as those 
statements include an appropriate disclaimer and the 
manufacturer has substantiation that the statement is 
truthful and not misleading."

New definition

The agency's proposed new definition of the term "dietary 
supplement" in the section on nutrient content claims would 
apply to "foods that are intended for human consumption and 
that are offered for sale, including conventional foods and 
dietary supplements," eliminating the current reference to 
"vitamins, minerals, herbs and other similar nutritional 
substances (dietary supplements)."  The simplification was 
called for by DSHEA, FDA said.  Discussing the coverage of 
the nutrient content proposal, FDA said:

-- "The broad range of substances that can be dietary 
ingredients under Section 201(ff) has the potential to 
create ambiguities as to the coverage of the nutrient 
content claim regime.  With respect to some substances that 
can be dietary ingredients, the context in which statements 
about them are made will determine whether they are nutrient 
content claims or not.  For example, garlic can be the 
dietary ingredient.

-- "A claim on the label or in the labeling of a dietary 
supplement that it is 'high in garlic' or that it 'now 
contains more garlic' is a nutrient content claim within the 
meaning of the act, and the food is misbranded unless such a 
claim has been authorized by FDA through regulation....

-- "On the other hand, a label statement on garlic bread, for 
example, that the product now contains more garlic would not 
be a nutrient content claim if the bread is not labeled as a 
dietary supplement and if it is clear from the context in 
which the claim is made that the claim refers to the taste of 
the product...."

Percentage claims for non-RDI ingredients

FDA noted that DSHEA specifically permitted percentage 
claims for ingredients not covered by Reference Daily 
Intakes (RDIs) or Daily Reference Values (DRVs), using as an 
example "40% omega-3 fatty acids."  DSHEA also would allow 
statements that characterize the percentage of ingredients 
in relation to an equivalent in another food product.  
Examples were "100% of the allicin in a bulb of garlic" or 
"twice the allicin as (product alternative) where 'twice' is 
another way of saying 200%."

"Accordingly," FDA said in the preamble to the proposal, 
"percentage claims such as '40% omega-3 fatty acids' that do 
not in any way characterize the level of a nutrient in terms 
of defined claims such as 'high', 'low' or 'reduced' were 
permitted on dietary supplements as well as conventional 
foods before the enactment of the DSHEA."

The agency said, however, that percentage statements would 
be misleading unless the ingredient is in a meaningful 
amount, continuing:  

"Therefore, firms will need to determine on a case-by-case 
basis whether the stated amount of a dietary ingredient for 
which an RDI or DRV has not been established, and the 
difference between the amount of such a dietary ingredient 
in two products, is meaningful...."

An example:  The statement "300% of the bioflavonoids in a 
large grapefruit" is permissible, but a claim such as "high 
in bioflavonoids" is not.  "FDA has concluded," the agency 
continued, "that if the defined term (i.e., the nutrient 
content claim) is to have any meaning, there must be a level 
that can be used as a reference in determining whether the 
claim is valid and appropriate.  The RDIs and DRVs provide 
such levels.  Thus, FDA has limited the use of 'good 
source', 'high' and other defined terms to use with 
nutrients for which RDIs or DRVs have been established."

FDA said it considers that when a percentage comparison is 
made for ingredients for which no RDI or DRV has been 
established, information on the identity of the reference 
food and on the quantitative amount of the dietary 
ingredient in both products is necessary.  The proposal 
would require that the reference food be clearly identified, 
and the actual amount of the dietary ingredient in both 
foods be provided, adjacent to the most prominent claim or 
to the nutrient label.  When the nutrition label is on the 
information panel, the quantitative information may be 
placed elsewhere on the panel.

Statements of nutritional support

To escape characterization as a drug while making statements 
of nutritional support (so-called structure/function 
claims), manufacturers must, according to the proposal, have 
substantiation that the claim is truthful and not misleading 
and include on the label a disclaimer: 

"This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug 
Administration.  This product is not intended to diagnose, 
treat, cure or prevent any disease."

A plural version of the first sentence would be allowed when 
more than one structure/function claim is made.  

Prominence of the disclaimer is at issue.  Where one 
structure/function claim is made, FDA decided the disclaimer 
must appear immediately adjacent to the claim with no 
intervening material.  When multiple claims are made, 
however, the agency would allow asterisks on the claim, 
referring to a specific place on the label, such as the 
information panel, where the disclaimer would appear.  
Allowing information panel placement, however, must be 
supported by comments, the agency said, noting the receipt 
of a petition on the subject from the Nutritional Health 
Alliance.  The agency said it is concerned that the 
placement of the disclaimer on another panel would not 
reveal material facts in conjunction with the statement of 
nutritional support.  The preamble's discussion continued:

-- "... In addition, the requirement in the act for prominent 
display means that when the disclaimer does not appear 
immediately adjacent to a statement of nutritional support, 
it must be presented on the label or labeling in a manner 
that renders it as readily observable and as likely to be 
read as the statement of nutritional support itself....

-- "Therefore, FDA is proposing in Section 101.94(c)(2) to 
require that a box be drawn around the disclaimer when the 
disclaimer is not immediately adjacent to the statement of 
nutritional support."

Type size and style 

FDA proposed a minimum 1/16th-inch type size for disclaimer 
statements, saying it considers unworkable the NLEA 
provision for letters one half the size of the most 
prominent statement because nutritional support statements 
are likely to be long and, thus, of small type size.

The proposal would remove for dietary supplements the NLEA 
restrictions on use of statements of levels of nutrients 
that are not vitamins or minerals.

FSIS ISSUES FINAL RULE REDUCING PRIOR LABELING APPROVAL 
REQUIREMENTS

The U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service has issued its final rule, first proposed in 1992, 
amending the federal meat and poultry products inspection 
regulations by expanding the types of labeling which would 
not require submittal to FSIS for approval prior to use (See 
FLN Nov. 25, 1993, Page 19; Dec. 23, 1993, Page 27; Jan. 27, 
1994, Page 14; February 10, 1994, Page 21, and Aug. 17, 
1995, Page 7) in a notice published Dec. 29 in the Federal 
Register.

The new rule also amends the federal meat and poultry 
products inspection regulations to permit the submission of 
only sketch labeling, except for temporary approvals, in 
those instances where labeling is required to be submitted 
for approval, and to require retention of certain labeling 
records.  This final rule is intended to eliminate 
unnecessary duplication in the labeling approval system and 
contribute to President Clinton's initiatives for greater 
efficiency in government services (as per the principles of 
the National Performance Review to cut red tape, put 
customers first and eliminate what is not needed).  The 
effective date of the rule is July 1, 1996.

The effect of the new rule is that official establishments 
and foreign establishments certified by officials of foreign 
inspection systems will be allowed to use the following 
generically approved labeling without the submission of 
sketches for approval by FSIS:

1. Labeling for a product which has a standard of identity 
or composition as specified in 9 CFR Part 319 or Part 381, 
subpart P, and which does not contain any special claims, 
such as quality claims, nutrient content claims, health 
claims, negative claims, geographical origin claims or 
guarantees, or which is not a domestic product labeled with 
a foreign language;

2. Labeling for single-ingredient products (such as beef 
steak, lamb chops, chicken legs or turkey breasts) which 
does not contain special claims such as quality claims, 
nutrient content claims, health claims, negative claims, 
geographical origin claims or guarantees, or which is not a 
domestic product labeled with a foreign language; 

3. Labeling for products marked "For Export Only" in U.S. 
establishments which does not contain any special claims, 
such as quality claims, nutrient content claims, health 
claims, negative claims, geographical origin claims or 
guarantees;

4. Labeling for containers of meat and meat food products 
and poultry products sold under contract specifications to 
federal government agencies, when such product is not 
offered for sale to the general public, provided the 
contract specifications include specific requirements with 
respect to labeling, and are made available to the IIC;

5. Labeling for shipping containers which contain fully 
labeled immediate containers, provided such labeling 
complies with 9 CFR 316.13 or 381.127. 

6. Labeling for products not intended for human food, 
provided they comply with 9 CFR Part 325 or 9 CFR 
381.152(c) and 381.193, and labeling for poultry heads and 
feet for export for processing as human food if they comply 
with 9 CFR 381.190(b);

7. Inspection legends, which comply with 9 CFR Parts 312 
and 316 and 9 CFR Part 381, subpart M, and 

8. Inserts, tags, liners, pasters, and like devices 
containing printed or graphic matter and for use on, or to 
be placed within, containers and coverings of products, 
provided such devices contain no reference to product and 
bear no misleading feature.

The rule will also permit official establishments and 
foreign establishments certified by officials of foreign 
inspection systems to use final labeling, without further 
authorization from FSIS, that was approved by FSIS, FLD, in 
sketch form if the final labeling was prepared without 
modification or with the following modifications:

1. All features of the labeling are proportionately 
enlarged or reduced, provided that all minimum size 
requirements specified in applicable regulations are met 
and the labeling is legible;

2. A substitution of the abbreviation "lb." for "pound," or 
"oz." for "ounce," or of the word "pound" for "lb." or 
"ounce" for "oz.";

3. A master or stock label has been approved from which the 
name and address of the distributor are omitted and such 
name and address are applied before being used (in such 
case, the words "prepared for" or similar statement must be 
shown together with the blank space reserved for the 
insertion of the name and address when such labels are 
offered for approval);

4. During holiday seasons, wrappers or other covers bearing 
floral or foliage designs or illustrations of rabbits, 
chicks, fireworks, or other emblematic holiday designs are 
used with approved labeling (the use of such designs will 
not make necessary the application of labeling not otherwise 
required);

5. A change in the language or the arrangement of directions 
pertaining to the opening of containers or the serving of 
the product;

6. The addition, deletion or amendment of a dated or undated 
coupon, a cents-off statement, cooking instructions, packer 
product code information or UPC product code information;

7. Any change in the name or address of the packer, 
manufacturer or distributor that appears in the signature 
line;

8. Any change in the net weight, provided the size of the 
net weight statement complies with 9 CFR 317.2 or 381.121;

9. The addition, deletion, or amendment of recipe 
suggestions for the product;

10. Any change in punctuation;

11. Newly assigned or revised establishment numbers for a 
particular establishment for which use of the labeling has 
been approved by the FLD; 

12. The addition or deletion of open dating information;

13. A change in the type of packaging material on which the 
label is printed; 

14. Brand name changes, provided that there are no design 
changes, the brand name does not use a term that connotes 
quality or other product characteristics, the brand name has 
no geographic significance, and the brand name does not 
affect the name of the product;

15. The deletion of the word "new" on new product labeling;

16. The addition, deletion, or amendment of special handling 
statements, such as "Keep Refrigerated" or "Keep Frozen," 
provided that the change is consistent with 9 CFR 317.2(k) 
or 381.125(a);

17. The addition of safe handling instructions as required 
by 9 CFR 317.2(l) or 381.125(b);

18. Changes reflecting a change in the quantity of an 
ingredient shown in the formula without a change in the 
order of predominance shown on the label, provided that the 
change in quantity of ingredients complies with any minimum 
or maximum limits for the use of such ingredients prescribed 
in 9 CFR Parts 318 and 319, or 9 CFR 381.147 or 9 CFR Part 
381, subpart P;

19. Changes in the color of the labeling, provided that 
sufficient contrast and legibility remain;

20. The addition, deletion, or substitution of the official 
USDA grade shield on labels of poultry products;

21. A change in the product vignette, provided the change 
does not affect mandatory labeling information or 
misrepresent the content of the package, or

22. A change in an establishment number by a corporation or 
parent company for an establishment under its ownership.

As originally proposed, the rule had no provision for 
voluntary submission of labeling to FSIS for review and 
approval, and many commenters to the ANPR asked that the 
option be retained because many products have complex 
compositional and minimum content requirements.  The final 
rule now provides for the option of submitting sketch 
labeling for standardized products for review, an option 
FSIS says it may later propose to remove.

According to the Federal Register notice, the role of the 
ICC (inspector in charge) will not change or be diminished 
as a result of this regulation.  Inspection personnel are to 
continue observing and monitoring product formulations and 
processing procedures to assure conformance with general 
labeling requirements.

The regulation is expected to benefit consumers, the meat 
and poultry industry and FSIS itself, streamlining the label 
approval process from two steps (sketch and final) to one 
(sketch only).  Allowing meat and poultry manufacturers to 
make numerous labeling modifications without submitting 
certain labels for approval should, according to the notice, 
reduce the burden on industry by making the process more 
convenient and cost-effective, and save the meat and poultry 
industries (which will be submitting approximately 82,600 
fewer labels a year to FSIS' Food Labeling Division at $37 
per label) at least $3 million annually.

STANDARDS MODIFICATIONS PROPOSED  BY FSIS

With some exceptions, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service proposed Dec. 29 its expected modifications of food 
standards to allow substitute foods.  An interim policy had 
preceded the proposal (See FLN March 9, Page 16).

A comment deadline was set as Feb. 27, but no effective date 
was noted.

The terms "substitute" or "alternate" would not be required 
in product names for the new products.  FSIS said, "... 
These products will be appropriately named by use of an 
expressed nutrient content claim and the appropriate 
standardized term."

The nutrient content claim, however, would have to be 
presented in the same style, color and size of type as in 
the original product.  

Also, each of the ingredients must be listed, in general, by 
common or usual name in descending order of predominance by 
weight on either the principal display panel or the 
information panel.

Permitted ingredients added at levels in excess of those 
allowed by the traditional standard must be appropriately 
identified as such, FSIS said, with an asterisk in the 
ingredients statement.  FSIS elaborated:

-- "... The statement 'ingredients not in regular (name of 
the traditional standardized food)' or 'ingredients in 
excess of amount permitted in regular (name of the 
traditional standardized food)' or both statements as 
appropriate, shall immediately follow the ingredients 
statement in the same type size. 

-- "The asterisk statements must clearly distinguish between 
'those ingredients not permitted' and 'those ingredients 
used in excess of amounts permitted' in a standardized 
product."

Nutrient content claims would stand in for some requirements 
of current standards under the new definition as proposed by 
FSIS, which said:  "FSIS is proposing to define substitutes 
to processed meat and poultry products as: 

-- "Any processed meat and/or poultry product whose 
formulation has been minimally modified to enable it to be 
used as a substitute for another meat and/or poultry product 
that it resembles and which has a standard of identity in 
the regulations (9 CFR Parts 319 and 381, subpart P).

-- "The meat or poultry product would be eligible to use an 
expressed nutrient content claim to identify it; would 
resemble the standardized product in appearance, form, taste 
and texture, and would use safe, suitable and approved 
substitute ingredients at proper levels and functions, i.e., 
the lowest level necessary to satisfy the criteria for use 
of the expressed nutrient content claim provided in 
regulations."

The product would have to be labeled, according to the 
proposal, "in a manner that conveys allowable ingredient 
differences to consumers."  The agency elaborated:

"The ingredient differences that will be allowed relate to 
the use of ingredients needed to make a product that 
complies with the specific expressed nutrient content claim 
related to a reduction in a constituent that has negative 
health implications ... i.e., fat, cholesterol and sodium.

"The substitute meat or poultry food product will be allowed 
to be named using a standardized term because it either will 
be similar to the standardized product in its performance 
characteristics and the ingredients used, or it will, 
through appropriate labeling terminology, describe how it 
differs from the standardized product for which it 
substitutes."

Taboo practices

The proposal outlined some instances, however, in which 
products will not be considered substitutes for standardized 
products, including:

-- "... Modified versions of standardized products which 
purport to be substitutes of them must adhere to the 
original regulatory standards requirements ... regarding the 
use of meat and poultry from specified anatomical locations, 
the use of a specific kind and/or amount of meat or poultry 
tissue to prepare the product and the use of specified 
processing procedures....

-- "For example, beef stew must contain at least 25% meat 
(i.e., beef).  Since the meat or poultry content of such 
product is integral to its identity, the label for a 
substitute of this product would be false or misleading if 
the substitute was named, in part, by a standardized term, 
but contained less than the amount of meat and/or poultry 
required by the standard....

-- "For example, a product identified with the standardized 
name 'Chicken A-La-King' is required to contain a minimum of 
20% cooked chicken meat and a substitute for this product 
would be required to contain the same amount....

-- "... 'Turkey ham must be made from turkey thigh meat and 
be cured, and in 9 CFR 319.107, 'Bacon' must be made from 
pork bellies and be cured...."

FSIS said it plans to invite comments on a broader reform of 
the standards in an upcoming advance notice of proposed 
rulemaking.

Expressed nutrient content claims

FSIS proposed that "only expressed nutrient content claims, 
i.e., claims that have been defined and are related to 
reductions in constituents having negative health 
implications, be permitted in conjunction with the 
standardized name ... in substitute meat and poultry 
products."  Examples of approved claims were given as "low," 
"lower," "lite," "reduced," "lean," "extra lean" and "free."

Performance characteristics

The substitute foods also must "perform similarly to the 
traditional standardized products," FSIS said, "unless the 
product is specifically labeled to show any significant 
performance usage differences it has, such as a frankfurter 
not being suitable for freezing."

Performance characteristics were listed as including 
physical properties (e.g., texture, cooking qualities, 
freezing qualities), its functional properties (e.g., body, 
spreadability) and shelf life.  However, the agency 
qualified these requirements with:

-- "FSIS recognizes, however, that when a standardized 
product is modified so that its composition accurately 
supports the nutrient content claim intended to be made, it 
may not be possible in all cases to produce a substitute 
product that performs similarly in regard to all uses of the 
regulated standardized meat or poultry food product....

-- "The product would be considered a substitute product 
allowed under this proposal if the limitation on use does 
not affect the fundamental nature of the product and is 
disclosed in labeling....

-- "If there is a difference in performance characteristics 
that materially limits the use of the product, the product 
may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a 
disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim in 
accordance with 9 CFR 317.13(d) (1) and (2) and 381.413(d) 
(1) and (2), informing the consumer of such difference...."

Elaborating with the example of a frankfurter having such 
characteristics as a "link" form, a cured pink color, a 
spongy texture and the ability for refrigeration or 
freezing, and the expectation that it could be prepared in a 
variety of ways, i.e., boiling, broiling, grilling and 
frying, FSIS said:

-- "When fat, however, in a frankfurter or another 
standardized product is replaced by one or more other 
ingredients, it may not be possible in all cases to produce 
substitute products that perform identically to the 
traditional standardized meat and poultry products....  Fats 
exhibit unique physical properties in meat and poultry 
products, e.g., their ability to combine with protein to 
form emulsions and their ability to enhance tenderness.  

-- "In order to make a substitute product that qualifies for 
a 'fat free' nutrient content claim, it may be necessary to 
replace fat with water and binders (i.e., additives that 
hold water and protein), which may result in a substitute 
meat or poultry food product with limitations in performance 
related to product uses....

-- "Therefore, if a 'fat free' frankfurter does not tolerate 
frozen storage for long periods of time, because the 
ingredients needed to make the substitute product do not 
withstand the same conditions of storage as the standardized 
product ... a non- performance statement would inform the 
consumer of that fact, e.g., 'Do Not Freeze'."

Tofu taboo

The proposal listed specific allowable and non-allowable 
ingredients.  Listed as allowable, although they have 
typically been restricted in standardized products, were:  
Agar-agar, algin, sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic 
acid and calcium lactate (or glucono delta-lactone), 
calcium-reduced dried skim milk, carrageenan, carboxymethyl 
cellulose (cellulose gum), dried milk, enzyme (rennet)-
treated calcium-reduced dried skim milk and calcium lactate, 
food starch modified, gelatin, guar gum, methyl cellulose, 
isolated soy protein, sodium caseinate, dry or dried whey, 
reduced lactose whey, reduced minerals whey, whey protein 
concentrate, starchy vegetable flour (e.g., potato flour, 
rice flour and pea flour), vegetable starch (e.g., corn 
starch, potato starch and wheat starch), wheat gluten, 
tapioca dextrin, soy flour, soy protein concentrate and 
xanthan gum.

Also, emulsifying agents to be permitted in combination with 
water and binders as part of a fat-replacement system were 
listed as lecithin, mono- and diglycerides and polyglycerol 
esters of fatty acids, commonly used as emulsifying agents 
in shortenings and margarines.  These are not to be 
considered as fat replacers when used alone.

Humectants, also, would not be considered by themselves to 
be fat replacers, but would be allowed as part of a "fat 
replacement system" because of their water-binding 
enhancement.

The proposal is not intended to allow replacement or 
exchange of any required ingredient or component, USDA 
emphasized, specifically listing as taboo under these 
replacement circumstances:  Textured vegetable protein, 
foods such as bread, rice, potatoes, cheese, fruits and 
vegetables.  The preamble to the proposal elaborated:

"Because these food ingredients have virtually no fat, their 
presence in products would result in a finished product with 
a lowered fat content.  However, the lowered fat content 
would be a result of the food 'filling' or 'extending' the 
product rather than as a result of the food merely 
functioning as a fat replacer."

Prohibited ingredients

Ingredients prohibited in standardized foods would be 
prohibited also from the substitute foods, examples being 
poultry kidneys or sex glands in cooked sausages, because 
they are not approved as safe or suitable for use in meat 
and poultry.  FSIS continued, "For example, 9 CFR 
318.7(d)(2) prohibits sorbic acid and its salts from use in 
formulating meat products and, thus, would continue to be 
prohibited in substitute products."

DIETARY GUIDELINES GENERALLY RECEIVE FAVORABLE REVIEWS

The federal government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
described this week as "the gold standard" for good 
nutrition and health, were unveiled Jan. 2 to generally 
favorable reviews by industry and consumer groups.  (The 
full text of the guidelines will be published in the Jan. 11 
FLN.)

The guidelines are little changed from the recommendations  
issued last summer by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory 
Committee (See FLN Aug. 24, Page 3).  For the first time, 
they include information on physical activity and dieting, 
vegetarian diets and recommendations that adults maintain 
their body weight as they age.  The fourth edition also 
includes an expanded section on grains, fruits and 
vegetables.

The guidelines recommend that Americans choose diets with 
plenty of grains, fruits and vegetables; eat a variety of 
foods; balance food consumption with physical activity; use 
moderate amounts of salt, sodium, sugar and alcohol, and 
choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol.  

Industry generally called the guidelines balanced and 
reasonable.  The National Cattlemen's Association and the 
Beef Industry Council said they support them.  "For the 99% 
of Americans who enjoy meat, the Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans tell us we can continue to enjoy it and still be 
healthy," the groups said.

The Grocery Manufacturers of America said, "The Dietary 
Guidelines provide guidance not only to consumers and health 
professionals, but to industry as well.  Many of the 
innovations in 'better-for-you-foods' over the last decade 
have been driven by the dietary guidelines."

Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala said commodity and industry 
groups were "responsive" to the changes in the guidelines.  
Shalala brushed aside criticism that the guidelines are too 
lenient on recommended consumption levels of sugar and fat.

While the Council for Responsible Nutrition called the 
guidelines "a step forward," it said they need revision on 
several points regarding supplements.  The guidelines 
incorrectly state that supplements "usually" are not needed, 
inaccurately imply that the Recommended Dietary Allowances 
are the upper limit of safe nutrient intakes and disregard 
the importance of supplements in achieving recommended 
calcium intakes, said the supplement trade association.

Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, expressed disappointment about the 
guidelines, calling them only a "marginal improvement" from 
the previous edition issued in 1990.  The guidelines offer 
"bland statements" that fail to provide enough direction to 
help Americans improve their diets, he said.  "The 
government should tell people what is the best possible 
diet," he said.

Dr. Andrew Nicholson, director of preventive medicine for 
the Physicians Committee for Responsive Medicine, also said 
the government should have offered more specific nutrition 
and dietary information.  

"It's a placebo," he said of the guidelines, noting he is 
pleased they include information on vegetarian diets.  There 
are some "very positive statements," he said, "but the 
[Dietary Guidelines Advisory] Committee has not had the guts 
to stand up to the American Meat Institute, the pork board 
and the fisheries institutes and say which foods have the 
saturated fat and cholesterol so Americans know how to 
follow the recommendations."  

"The important thing is to talk foods.  Don't talk 
nutrients.  People don't know where to find saturated fat 
and cholesterol," Nicholson said.

HHS Secretary Shalala said 300,000 deaths and $250 billion 
in health costs and lost workdays annually are associated 
with poor diets.

FDA STRIVES FOR CONSISTENCY IN DSHEA NUTRITION LABEL RULES

FDA's proposal for nutrition labeling of dietary supplements 
has sought to balance the specific requirements of the 
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act with existing 
regulations for nutrition labeling of conventional foods in 
order to achieve some consistency -- especially in format.

In the preamble to the proposal, published Dec. 28, FDA 
acknowledged that despite its desire for consistency in the 
appearance of nutrition information on dietary supplements 
and conventional foods, "the requirements adopted in DSHEA, 
such as the listing of the names and amounts of other 
dietary ingredients and the optional listing of source 
information, necessitate that there be some differences in 
format."  

In order to signal to consumers that nutrition labeling on 
dietary supplements differs from that on conventional foods, 
FDA proposed that the title for the nutrition information be 
"Supplement Facts," rather than the "Nutrition Facts" title 
on conventional foods.  The agency asked for specific 
comment on the appropriateness of this title.

Asking that comments be submitted by March 13, FDA said any 
final rule that is issued based on the proposal would become 
effective Jan. 1, 1997.  It specifically asked for comments 
to focus on the provisions in which changes are being 
proposed from FDA's January 1994 final rule for nutrition 
labeling of dietary supplements that had been published 
under the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992.  After passage of 
DSHEA in October 1994, FDA stayed enforcement of the 
nutrition labeling rule for supplements until it had a 
chance to conform the rule to the specific provisions of 
DSHEA.

'Dietary supplement' term to be part of statement of 
identity

In many cases, FDA found the DSHEA statute to be vague and 
had to guess at its meaning.  For example, the agency noted 
that while DSHEA requires the identity statement "dietary 
supplement" on labels, it did not explicitly address where 
on the food label the term must appear.  However, when 
reading the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as a whole, FDA 
decided that the term "dietary supplement" needs to appear 
as part of the common or usual name of the food, and 
proposed that the term appear in the statement of identity 
of dietary supplement products.

Use of this term, FDA explained, "will distinguish this 
potentially broad class of products from other types of 
food."  In addition, under the broad DSHEA definition of 
dietary supplement, there may be supplements for which the 
presence of the term "constitutes the primary, if not the 
only, means by which consumers will be able to determine 
that the food is a dietary supplement," the agency said, 
especially when supplements are in other than tablet, 
capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap or liquid form.

FDA concluded that no major changes in the 1994 dietary 
supplement final rule are needed on the listing of dietary 
ingredients for which Reference Daily Intakes and Daily 
Reference Values have been established, and proposed that 
the 14 nutrients that must be listed in the nutrition 
labeling of a conventional food, when present in a 
supplement "in amounts greater than that, can be declared as 
zero," be listed on the nutrition label.  They referred to 
these 14 nutrients as "(b)(2) dietary ingredients," since 
they are listed in proposed Section 101.36(b)(2), and to all 
other dietary ingredients as "other dietary ingredients."

The 1994 dietary supplement rule was silent on the listing 
of the  "subcomponents," such as saturated fat, soluble 
fiber and sugar alcohols that may be declared but are not 
required except when claims about them are made.  Since the 
1994 rule applied only to vitamin and mineral supplements, 
and DSHEA now includes other products such as fiber 
supplements to be covered by the same nutrition labeling 
rules, FDA said it concluded that it is appropriate to 
provide for the optional listing of the subcomponents.  

Subcomponents not already specified in the nutrition 
labeling regulations for conventional foods, such as amino 
acids and omega-3 fatty acids, must be listed as dietary 
ingredients for which RDIs and DRVs have not been 
established, rather than as subcomponents of protein or fat.  
FDA said this would provide more consistency between 
nutrition labeling of supplements and conventional foods and 
would minimize consumer confusion.

Although DSHEA requires that all dietary ingredients and 
their amounts be listed, FDA said that requiring the listing 
of all vitamins and minerals with RDIs or DRVs that are 
present in some products, such as herbal products, would be 
"unduly burdensome" and in conflict with the current rules 
which require the mandatory listing only of sodium, vitamin 
A, vitamin C, calcium and iron.  FDA concluded that it is 
appropriate to follow the approach used for conventional 
foods and to require the  listing of vitamins and minerals 
only when they are added to the product for purposes of 
supplementation or when a claim is made about them.  The 
agency asked for comment on this approach.

Noting that it did not declare in the 1994 dietary 
supplement final rule the amounts of vitamins and minerals 
that do not have to be declared because they are so small, 
FDA said it included an explicit statement in the proposal 
that the amounts of vitamins and minerals corresponding to 
less than 2% of the RDI shall not be declared.  FDA said 
this statement "does not represent a change from the 1994 
dietary supplement final rule but is merely a clarification 
of its provisions."

The proposal specified that protein not be declared in the 
nutrition label of dietary supplements that contain only 
individual amino acids.  FDA said it is misleading to 
declare the protein content in the nutrition label of a 
dietary supplement that contains free amino acids because 
protein, by definition, is composed of chains of amino acids 
connected together by peptide bonds.

Use of the heading "amount per serving" is required as it 
was in the 1994 rule, but the agency proposed to allow it to 
be used either over the column of amounts or the column of 
names of ingredients. Requesting comment on this change, FDA 
said it was proposing flexibility in the placement of the 
heading "because space constraints may make placement over 
the column of amounts impractical in some cases."

FDA proposed that instead of listing calories above the 
column of names, as is the case for conventional foods, they 
be listed first in the column of names, under a bar that 
separates the list from the heading, "amount per serving."  
FDA said that giving calories prominence over other 
nutrients is not appropriate for supplements, which usually 
do not contain many calories.  In addition, this change will 
save space, FDA noted.  

The agency also specified the synonyms that may be added in 
parentheses following the names of the (b)(2) dietary 
ingredients, which is identical to the current regulation on 
synonyms in dietary supplement labeling except that the 
agency proposed to permit the use of "folic acid" as a 
synonym for "folate."  While current nutrition labeling 
rules do not permit the term "folic acid," FDA said this was 
an omission and added that it intends to revise the rule for 
conventional foods to permit the listing of folic acid as a 
synonym for folate.

Quantity declarations to be in column to the right of names 
of nutrients

Since DSHEA allows an optional listing of the source of the 
ingredient, FDA proposed requiring that the quantity of each 
ingredient, per serving, be listed in a column to the right 
of the column of names.  FDA said it considered continuing 
to have the weight of the dietary ingredient placed 
immediately after the name of the ingredient or its source, 
"but tentatively concluded that the wide variation in 
placement that could result when some dietary ingredients 
are listed by name only, while others include the source 
ingredient, would make it difficult for some consumers to 
find the declaration of weight."  FDA asked for comment on 
this decision and its possible impact on space requirements.

FDA noted that the weight declared for any dietary 
ingredient "is to be the weight of the dietary ingredient 
rather than the weight of the source of the dietary 
ingredient."  For example, the agency noted, the weight of 
calcium would be declared for calcium carbonate, rather than 
the weight of calcium carbonate.  

While DSHEA is unclear as to the basis for reporting the 
quantitative information, FDA concluded that it is 
appropriate to require it be provided on a "per serving" 
basis.  Interpreting the provision this way means there need 
only be one list of the quantitative amounts of dietary 
ingredients in a supplement, FDA pointed out.  Requiring 
information on a per dosage unit basis might mean that for 
dietary supplements whose serving size is two capsules, 
there would have to be two lists of dietary ingredient 
amounts, one per capsule and the other per serving, which 
would result in overcrowded labels.  However, "the rules of 
statutory construction" do not generally favor the FDA 
interpretation, the agency acknowledged, since it would make 
two sections of the act redundant, and specifically 
requested comment on its proposed interpretation.

Discussing the declaration of percent daily values for each 
(b)(2) dietary ingredient,  FDA said it clarified that the 
actual amount is to be used in the calculation for vitamins 
and minerals, except sodium and potassium, and that either 
the actual amount or the rounded amount may be used for 
other nutrients, such as fat.  FDA said it also reworded a 
provision to make clear that the phrase "less than 1%" is to 
be used when the dietary ingredient is present in an amount 
by weight that requires declaration, yet the amount is so 
small that the percent Daily Value when rounded to the 
nearest percent comes to "0%." 

'Less than' symbol may be used, FDA says

The symbol "<1%" may be used in place of "less than 1%" to 
provide more flexibility when space is limited on the label, 
FDA said, noting that it did not permit the use of the 
symbol in the first set of nutrition labeling regulations 
because of concerns that many people would not understand 
its meaning.  However, the agency said it has received 
numerous requests for its use "and is aware that it is being 
used on some nutrition labels with tight space constraints."  
FDA asked for comments on use of the symbol "and the 
submission of any available data that would demonstrate 
consumers' comprehension of it." 

If FDA permits the use for dietary supplements, it intends 
to provide for such use on conventional foods as well, the 
agency said.

The column for "% Daily Value" may be omitted when there are 
no numerical values declared beneath it, FDA said.  When 
this happens, and the footnote "Daily Value not established" 
is required, the asterisk symbol must immediately follow the 
quantitative amount by weight for each dietary ingredient 
listed under "amount per serving," FDA said.

In considering requirements for the listing of other dietary 
ingredients, FDA proposed that they be listed in the 
nutrition label by their common or usual name in a column 
that is underneath the column of names of (b)(2) dietary 
ingredients and that a "heavy bar" be used to separate the 
listing, which would enable consumers to distinguish between 
the two types of ingredients.

Comments requested on order of dietary ingredients listings

While FDA said it considered specifying that the other 
dietary ingredients be listed in a particular order, such as 
alphabetical order or descending order of predominance by 
weight, FDA said it tentatively concluded that specifying a 
particular order is not justified, but requested comments on 
the issue.

For herbs and other botanicals, FDA encouraged manufacturers 
to use common or usual names that are found in botanical 
data bases and that are widely used. While many of these 
names "are part of our everyday language and are easily 
recognized," FDA acknowledged that arriving at an 
appropriate name for botanicals "may be a problem because 
some plants have more than one common or usual name, or one 
name is used to describe many different species."  In other 
cases, a particular species may not even have a common or 
usual name, the agency said.  FDA said it considers the term 
"botanical" to include fungi and algae.

FDA proposed to require that the quantitative amount listed 
in the nutrition label for a declared dietary ingredient be 
the total weight of that dietary ingredient and not the 
weight of a component of that dietary ingredient or of the 
source of that dietary ingredient.  For example, if a 
dietary supplement lists garlic as a dietary ingredient and 
makes no reference to a component of garlic, then the weight 
specified should be the weight of garlic.  However, if the 
nutrition label lists allicin as the dietary ingredient, 
with the garlic noted as the source ingredient, the weight 
specified ought to be the weight of allicin only.  Liquid 
extracts of dietary ingredients "are not to be treated any 
differently," FDA said, noting that such determinations may 
be difficult and asking for comment on the issue.

FDA said it is giving the manufacturer the option of 
deciding what to list as a dietary ingredient, noting that 
either the botanical or one or more constituents of a 
botanical may be declared as the dietary ingredient.  FDA 
requested comment on whether it should consider allowing 
manufacturers to declare both the botanical and one or more 
constituents as dietary ingredients within a single product, 
with a requirement that the constituents of the botanical be 
indented beneath the listing of the botanical.  FDA said it 
rejected this approach because it could be potentially 
confusing to consumers, but asked whether there are 
alternative approaches and whether this flexibility is 
consistent with DSHEA.

The agency proposed to require that manufacturers express 
the amounts of other dietary ingredients in metric units 
that are appropriate.  The provision requires that any 
declaration of 1,000 or more units be declared in the next 
higher set of units.

Other dietary ingredients must bear an asterisk in the 
column under the heading of "% Daily Value" that refers to 
another symbol placed at the bottom of the nutrition label 
that is followed by the statement, "Daily Value not 
established."  When no (b)(2) dietary ingredients are 
declared and the heading of "% Daily Value" is not used, the 
agency proposed that the symbol follow the declaration of 
the quantitative amount for each dietary ingredient listed.  

FDA said it gave "extensive consideration" to the most 
appropriate wording for the statement to which the symbol 
refers, considering statements such as "not currently 
determined essential," which was suggested by a dietary 
supplement trade association.  FDA said it is "unsure if 
such a statement would be more useful to consumers," but 
noted that the "Daily value not established" statement is 
consistent with that currently used on nutrition labels, and 
asked for comments on an appropriate statement.

Provision outlines requirements for proprietary blends

A section of the regulation provides for the listing of 
dietary ingredients in proprietary blends, in order to 
implement the DSHEA provision that permits the listing of 
the total quantity of all ingredients in a blend labeled 
proprietary.  FDA proposed that the dietary ingredients in 
the proprietary blend be indented under the term 
"proprietary blend," or a modification of the term, and be 
listed in a column or in a linear fashion.

The proposal would require that the total weight of the 
dietary ingredients listed as components of the proprietary 
blend appear on the same line as the name of the blend, to 
make it clear that the weight represents the total weight of 
the dietary ingredients listed.   The proposal also requires 
that the list of other dietary ingredients in a proprietary 
blend be given in order of predominance by weight, since the 
weights of the individual dietary ingredients need not be 
specified.  FDA noted that this is consistent with 
ingredient labeling of conventional foods and "is intended 
to give consumers an indication of the relative amounts of 
the other dietary ingredients present in the absence of 
information on their actual amounts."

If the proprietary blend furnishes more than insignificant 
amounts of any required (b)(2) dietary ingredient, that 
ingredient must be declared, as well as the amount of the 
ingredient and the percent of the Daily Value, FDA said.  
The agency said it would be contrary to the Nutrition 
Labeling and Education Act not to require such a listing.

Dietary ingredients in nutrition label exempt from 
ingredient declaration

While noting some ambiguity in the statute, FDA said it 
interpreted DSHEA to mean that any ingredient listed in the 
nutrition label need not be listed a second time in the 
ingredient statement.  FDA proposed to revise its 
regulations on ingredient listings to allow for this, citing 
a legal analysis from the law firm of Covington and Burling 
that agrees with its interpretation.

FDA proposed that the source of any dietary ingredient may 
be added in parentheses immediately following or indented 
beneath the name of the dietary ingredient, and the words 
"as" or "from" must precede the name of the source 
ingredient, such as "calcium (as calcium carbonate)."  If 
the name of the dietary ingredient is itself the source 
ingredient or its synonym, then the listing of the dietary 
ingredient will fulfill the requirement for the listing of 
the ingredient, the agency explained.  Noting that many 
manufacturers already use the terms "as" or "from," FDA said 
these words will help to convey to consumers the 
understanding that such compounds are the source of the 
dietary ingredients.

When a source is not identified within the nutrition label, 
the proposal provides that it shall be listed in the 
ingredient statement.  The ingredient statement on a dietary 
supplement must appear outside and immediately below the 
nutrition label, or, if there is insufficient space below 
the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right 
of the nutrition label, FDA said.  This provision is in 
accordance with DSHEA, the agency explained.

The agency proposed to require that the ingredients list be 
preceded by the word "Ingredients," unless some ingredients 
are identified within the nutrition label, in which case the 
ingredients listed outside the nutrition label shall be in a 
list preceded by the words "Other Ingredients."   This will 
indicate to consumers that some ingredient information 
appears in the nutrition information that precedes the 
ingredient list, FDA said.

Ingredients that are not dietary ingredients, such as 
fillers and artificial colors, must be listed in the 
ingredient statement, FDA said, noting that a 1942 Trade 
Correspondence which had exempted such ingredients from 
dietary supplement declaration is being revoked since it has 
been overturned by more recent agency statements of policy 
on the subject.

Latin form of botanicals in parentheses required for 
ingredients

Ingredients would have to be listed by common or usual name, 
as is required for conventional foods. In order to ensure 
correct identification of herbs or other botanicals, 
including algae and fungi, FDA proposed that the botanical 
name in Latin binomial form be included in parentheses 
following the common or usual name.  To ensure there is 
consistency and clarity in declaration, the agency proposed 
that any botanical name declared should be "in accordance 
with internationally accepted rules on nomenclature, such as 
those found in the International Code of Botanical 
Nomenclature," FDA said, requesting comments on this issue.

Recognizing that it is possible to have more than one 
acceptable botanical name in Latin form, FDA advised 
manufacturers "to choose the name that is most currently 
used in commerce and in appropriate references and, in cases 
of confusion, to consult with the agency."

FDA also proposed to require that the part or parts of the 
plant, such as leaf, flower, root, fruit, seed or bark, be 
presented in parentheses immediately following the Latin 
name of the botanical ingredient, noting that DSHEA requires 
identification of any part of the plant from which the 
dietary ingredient is derived.  Whenever such information is 
presented, the agency said, the name of the part of the 
plant must be expressed in English, since the pharmaceutical 
names would not be recognized and their meanings would not 
be commonly understood by American consumers.  "When the 
entire plant is used, the label should specify 'entire 
plant' to meet the requirements of the act," FDA said.

The botanical name requirements apply whether the 
ingredient is listed in an ingredient statement or in the 
nutrition label, FDA said.  Since the FD&C Act does not 
require ingredients to be listed when the food contains 
only one ingredient, FDA proposed that for single-
ingredient dietary supplements, the Latin binomial name and 
the part of the plant from which the dietary supplement is 
derived may be prominently placed on the principal display 
panel or the information panel, or included in the 
nutrition label.

When two or more sources are listed within parentheses, 
they should be listed in descending order by weight, "which 
is consistent with the way ingredients are to be listed" in 
the ingredient labeling regulations, FDA said.  Since the 
amounts by weight of the ingredients are listed in the 
nutrition label, these ingredients did not have to be 
listed in descending order by weight, the agency noted.

Reference to official compendium permitted for individual 
ingredients

Individual dietary ingredients that conform to an official 
compendium may be listed as such by a reference to the 
compendium, FDA said, citing as an example "Calcium (from 
carbonate USP)."  If such a representation is made and the 
ingredient does not comply with the specifications of the 
compendium, the supplement would be misbranded, the agency 
noted.

Discussing format requirements, FDA said it is proposing to 
maintain the same graphic requirements in the nutrition 
labeling regulations, including those on type size, since 
DSHEA does not necessitate any changes in type size.  FDA 
requested comment on the requirement for a hairline rule 
between the listings of each dietary ingredient, noting that 
it had received complaints about the hairline rule's effect 
on space and legibility on supplements with a long listing 
of ingredients when this requirement was issued in the 1994 
regulations.  Such comments "will be particularly helpful if 
actual sample labels are included as well as suggestions for 
when relief from such a requirement should be provided," FDA 
said.

The proposal clarified the size of bars that are to be used 
to separate the various headings, FDA said, noting that 
there was confusion about this issue when the 1994 rule was 
published.

A section of the proposal addressing how nutrition 
information is to be presented on products that contain two 
or more separately packaged dietary supplements is analogous 
to the section in the regulations for conventional foods, 
FDA said.

Compliance will be determined using the procedures for 
nutrition labeling of conventional foods, according to the 
proposal.  FDA discussed whether to alter its longstanding 
compliance criterion requiring added vitamins, minerals, 
protein, dietary fiber or potassium to be present in amounts 
at least equal to the value for the declared nutrient, since 
USP monographs for several nutrition products require a 
minimum nutrient content of 90% of the label declaration.  
FDA said any deviation from the criterion that is 
attributable to reasons other than variability of analytical 
methods would be a material fact that would need to be 
disclosed on the label, and 

said such a message could diminish consumer confidence.  The 
agency also confirmed that it is keeping its 80% criterion 
of the declared value for calories, sugars, total fat, 
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium.

FDA requested comments on appropriate analytical methods for 
dietary ingredients for which official methods do not exist, 
and also asked about information on organizations that 
establish such procedures.

Discussing exemptions, FDA noted that it proposed a rule in 
March 1994 to establish a new exemption for low-volume food 
products from manufacturers, packers, distributors and 
retailers that are small businesses, and said it is 
proposing to cross-reference the small business exemption 
already in the nutrition labeling rule along with the 
proposed exemption.  The rule also incorporates the 
exemption for foods shipped in bulk that are not distributed 
to consumers, and cross-references special labeling 
provisions in the nutrition labeling rules for smaller type 
size for supplements in small and intermediate-sized 
containers.

FDA said it has also cross-referenced the special provisions 
to allow the use of 4.5 point type size on packages with 
less than 12 square inches of available label space and the 
use of six-point type on packages with 12 to 40 square 
inches of label space. 

Multi-ingredient products may use smaller type size, FDA 
says

In response to a petition from a trade association, FDA 
proposed to provide additional flexibility for multi-
ingredient dietary supplements in packages with less than 20 
square inches of available label space.

The agency said it was persuaded by the petition that it is 
not feasible to use six-point type on many products 
containing multiple dietary ingredients on such packages, 
and concluded that it is reasonable to require the six-point 
type on packages with 12 to 20 square inches of available 
label space to bear labeling when eight or fewer dietary 
ingredients are used.  The use of a smaller type size of at 
least 4.5 points could be used when there are more than 
eight dietary ingredients.  Without smaller type, more than 
30% of the total surface area of the package would have to 
be devoted to FDA-required information, the agency 
explained.

FDA said the trade association had surveyed its member 
companies, who agreed that eight or 10 would be an 
appropriate cutoff number, triggering the smaller type size 
for multi-nutrient products.

Primary container must bear nutrition labeling, even in 
small type

A special labeling provision was proposed in the rule for 
supplements in packages that have a surface area of 40 or 
less square inches available to bear labeling.  FDA said 
under the provision, when the nutrition information on 
packages of this size is presented on a label panel other 
than the principal display or information panels, the 
ingredient information must move in conjunction with the 
nutrition label.  In addition, for supplements of this size, 
when it is not possible for primary inner containers to 
comply with the type size requirements, the agency proposed 
that type as small as needed may be used in the nutrition 
label as long as the primary container is securely enclosed 
in outer packaging that bears nutrition labeling in the 
required type size.

FDA noted that in the 1994 rule, it "erroneously advised 
that it considered outer packaging that securely encloses a 
primary container and that is not intended to be separated 
from the primary container under conditions of retail sale 
to be the equivalent of the product label."  FDA said these 
statements were inconsistent with the FD&C Act, and 
therefore nutrition labeling is required to appear on the 
label of the primary container.

While cross-referencing current misbranding provisions for 
foods, FDA proposed to delete two provisions currently in 
Section 101.9(k) that conflict with DSHEA.  One provision 
states that a food is misbranded if the labeling suggests or 
implies that a balanced diet of ordinary foods cannot supply 
adequate amounts of nutrients.  FDA acknowledged that 
scientific and consensus groups have agreed that there are 
certain situations in which the use of dietary supplements 
may be needed for persons to obtain adequate nutrient 
intakes, such as pregnant women or the elderly.  

The other provision, which states that a food is misbranded 
when the labeling implies that the food has special dietary 
properties when such properties are of no significant value 
or need in human nutrition, would conflict with DSHEA, which 
permits statements of nutrition support, according to FDA.

FDA says nutrition labeling would cost $52 to $85 million to 
implement

Discussing the economic impact of the rule, FDA said it 
would cost manufacturers between $52 and $85 million to 
implement.  The agency requested comment on whether dietary 
supplement products will undergo analytical testing as a 
result of the regulations, noting that FDA assumes that 
manufacturers of vitamin and mineral supplements are already 
aware of the nutritional content of their products.  It is 
possible, however, that herbal and other botanical products 
may undergo additional testing, FDA noted, estimating that 
between 4,000 and 20,000 products may undergo testing once 
every five years.

If adopted, the rule "will benefit consumers by ensuring 
that nutrition labeling is provided on dietary supplements 
in a manner that will help consumers to follow healthy 
dietary practices," FDA said.

FDA estimated that the majority of manufacturers of dietary 
supplements meet the Small Business Administration definition 
of a small business because they have fewer than 750 
employees. Noting the exemptions from mandatory nutrition 
labeling proposed for small businesses in the rule, FDA said 
some botanical product manufacturers will have unit sales and 
firm sizes low enough to meet the definition for low-volume 
products.  FDA asked for information on the impact of the 
regulation on small firms.  It noted that the estimated cost 
of the nutrition labeling regulations is 1% to 3% of industry 
annual sales, which range from $2.9 to more than $4 billion.  
"In relation to the volume of sales, this amount does not 
appear to represent a significant cost," the agency said.

FDA also solicited comments on whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the agency, under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Comments on information 
collection must be sent "by Jan. 29, 1996, but no later than 
Feb. 26, 1996" to the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget.

FDA SUPPLEMENT PROPOSAL DEFINES 'HIGH POTENCY ANTIOXIDANT' 
TERMS

The Food and Drug Administration's implementation of the 
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act will include 
definitions for the claims "high potency" and "sugar free" 
used in supplement labeling, as well as the term 
"antioxidant" when used in nutrient content claims on labels 
of dietary supplements and conventional foods (See separate 
stories).

In one of three proposals published Dec. 28, the agency chose 
to limit the term "high potency" to supplement labels rather 
than permit the claim to be used in connection with 
conventional foods, noting that the term is rarely used in 
food labeling.  "In contrast, the term 'high potency' was in 
widespread use on the labels of dietary supplements before 
the enactment of the 1990 (nutrition labeling) amendments, 
continues to be used on dietary supplements, and appears to 
convey information to the consumer about the level of 
nutrients in dietary supplements," FDA said.

The agency said it has tentatively concluded that 100% of 
the Reference Daily Intake per serving is a "reasonable 
definition" for the term because that level is high enough 
"to meet the needs of practically all healthy people."  FDA 
emphasized, however, that this does not mean that the agency 
is opposed to the presence of nutrients exceeding the 100% 
of RDI level.  FDA went on:

"Manufacturers can formulate and describe the level of a 
nutrient as multiples of the RDI (e.g., using the terminology 
'Daily Value' to represent RDIs on the label, a vitamin C 
tablet containing 500 mg would declare '833% of the Daily 
Value of vitamin C').  Nonetheless, because the purpose of 
nutrient content claims is to assist consumers in maintaining 
healthy dietary practices, and given the recommendations of 
the NAS (National Academy of Sciences) on which the RDIs are 
based, FDA tentatively concludes that it is appropriate to 
tie a 'high potency' claim to the RDI itself."

In addition to the nutrients for which RDIs have been 
established, FDA proposed to permit "high potency" claims to 
describe protein and fiber, both of which are measured with 
Daily Values.  Those nutrients must be present at 100% of the 
DRV per reference amount customarily consumed in order to 
qualify for the claim.

The agency added that it would not propose to allow the claim 
to be used for nutrients such as total fat, saturated fat, 
sodium, cholesterol, total carbohydrate and potassium.  
Tablets containing 100 mg or more of potassium are considered 
drugs, according to FDA.

Agency sets "two-thirds" standard for multivitamins

Addressing the subject of using the "high potency" claim on 
labels for multivitamins, FDA stated:  "FDA tentatively 
concludes that it is not necessary to prohibit the use of a 
'high potency' claim on multinutrient dietary supplements if 
the supplements do not contain 100% or more of the RDI for 
each vitamin and mineral that is present, or 100% of the DRV 
for protein or dietary fiber when present.  The agency is 
persuaded by the comments that the public will be better 
served from a public health perspective if some nutrients are 
allowed to be present in such products at levels that are 
below 100% of the RDI or DRV."

"Without such an allowance," the agency said, "those 
nutrients that cannot be included at 100% levels because of 
technological difficulties could not be included at all if 
the dietary supplement is to bear a 'high potency' claim.  
The exclusion of these nutrients will not necessarily help 
consumers to engage in healthy dietary practices."

The agency said that out of the 33 nutrients for which RDIs 
and DRVs have been established, there are 11 nutrients 
(calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, dietary fiber, total 
carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, 
chloride and potassium) for which it would be "impracticable 
or imprudent" to require that they adhere to the 100% 
RDI/DRV threshold.  This amounts to one-third of the total 
nutrients, the agency noted.

"Accordingly, the agency believes that it would be 
reasonable to expect that the remaining two-thirds of the 
nutrients for which RDIs and DRVs have been established 
could be present at 100% of the RDI or DRV in a dietary 
supplement product that contained all 33 nutrients for which 
RDIs and DRVs have been established," the agency said.

FDA then agreed to expand the two-thirds standard to include 
products that do not contain all 33 nutrients for which DRIs 
or DRVs have been established.  "FDA tentatively concludes 
that two-thirds represents a reasonable standard; it 
provides flexibility for supplements that do not contain all 
33 nutrients, and it provides a consistent standard for all 
supplement products.  Finally, it is a familiar fraction 
that is easy to use," the agency said, continuing:

"With a two-thirds standard, the manufacturer would have the 
latitude to decide, in formulating a product that will 
qualify to bear a 'high potency' claim, which nutrients to 
include at 100% of the RDI or DRV."

FDA went on:  "The agency recognizes that dietary 
supplements that consist of an assortment of dietary 
ingredients are widely available in the marketplace.  FDA 
agrees with the comment that stated that the presence or 
absence of dietary ingredients for which RDIs or DRVs have 
not been established (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, choline, 
boron) ... should not affect the claim so long as those 
nutrients with RDIs or DRVs are present at levels required 
for the claim."

"It is important to note that because the definition that 
FDA is proposing is based on the presence of a nutrient at 
100% of the RDI or DRV, dietary supplements that do not 
contain nutrients for which RDIs or DRVs have been 
established will not be able to use the term 'high 
potency,'" the agency said.

FDA also requested comment on whether "full potency" or 
similar wording may be used as a synonym for "high potency."

FDA addresses nutrient content claims for antioxidants

The agency also proposed to define the term "antioxidant" as 
a collective term for vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene 
when used in nutrient content claims (such as "good source of 
antioxidants") on labels for supplements or conventional 
foods.

"The levels of vitamin C and vitamin E and the level of 
vitamin A present as beta-carotene in the food that bears 
the claim must all be sufficient to qualify for the claim 
(i.e., for 'high in antioxidants,' the product must contain 
20% or more of the RDI for vitamin C and vitamin E per 
reference amount customarily consumed, and 20% or more of 
the RDI for vitamin A must be present as beta-carotene per 
reference amount customarily consumed)," FDA said, 
continuing:

"The term 'antioxidants' may only be used on the label or in 
labeling of a food that does not contain each of the three 
antioxidants ... in sufficient amounts to qualify for the 
claim if the food contains at least one of these nutrients at 
the requisite level, and the claim discloses which 
antioxidants in the food meet the required level (e.g., 'High 
in antioxidant vitamins C and E)."

The agency added that a "collective claim" about antioxidant 
nutrients -- such as "complete antioxidant formula" or 
"antioxidant complex" -- may be used in labeling provided that 
the vitamins are present at 10% or more of the RDI per 
reference amount customarily consumed.

Agency corrects "sugar free" omission

Finally, FDA corrected an inadvertent regulatory omission that 
barred certain supplement products from making "sugar free" 
and "no sugar" claims.  "Section 101.60(c)(1) states that 
consumers may reasonably be expected to regard terms that 
represent that the food contains no sugars or sweeteners as an 
indication that a product is low in calories or is 
significantly reduced in calories," FDA said.

The agency referred to its 1994 nutrient content claims final 
rule, in which FDA added a paragraph to Section 101.60(a) to 
state that "calorie free" and "low calorie" claims may not be 
made on dietary supplement products, "except when an 
equivalent amount of a dietary supplement that the labeled 
food resembles and for which it substitutes (e.g., another 
protein supplement) normally exceeds the definition for 'low 
calorie' in Section 101.60(b)(2)."  FDA continued:

"This change in Sections 101.13(b)(5) and 101.60(a)(4) had the 
unintended effect of limiting the use of 'sugar free' or 'no 
sugar' claims on dietary supplements that would otherwise meet 
the requirements for 'low calorie' in Section 101.60(b)(2) but 
are not permitted to bear the 

claim because they do not substitute for a similar dietary 
supplement that normally exceeds the definition for 'low 
calorie.'"

"Therefore, FDA is proposing to revise Section 
101.60(c)(1)(iii)(A) to excuse only dietary supplements that 
otherwise meet the definition of 'low calorie' under Section 
101.60(b)(2), but that are prohibited by Sections 101.13(b)(5) 
and 101.60(a)(4) from bearing the claim," the agency said.

The comment deadline is March 13, 1996.  "The agency proposes 
that any final rule that may issue based upon this proposal 
become effective Jan. 1, 1997," FDA said.

WARNING LABEL ON CURED MEATS SOUGHT IN PETITION TO FSIS

Jeremy Rifkin's Foundation on Economic Trends and the 
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine have filed a 
petition with USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service 
seeking removal of the "wholesomeness" seal, stronger language 
on safe handling labels and a warning label on cured meat 
products.

USDA received the petition Oct. 26 but did not place it on 
file in the hearing clerk's office until recently.  The groups 
had been considering suing USDA to stop use of the 
"wholesomeness" seal; the petition cited legal precedents and 
the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) as the basis for the 
groups' claims.

The petition, written by FET's Theodore Waugh and the 
Physicians Committee's Andrew Nicholson, cited the risk to 
consumers from E. coli O157:H7 as the basis for the groups' 
requests.  "The risk of serious permanent physical injury and 
death, USDA's inability to safeguard the meat supply and the 
lack of medical preparedness indicate both the seriousness and 
extent of the E. coli problem," the petition said, adding, 
"Until effective control measures are developed to eliminate 
E. coli contamination, USDA needs to take further actions to 
protect consumers and conform with its statutory obligations."

The petitioners misstated the scope of USDA's declaration that 
E. coli O157:H7 was an adulterant.  The USDA declaration 
applied only to raw ground beef; the petition said that "USDA 
has determined that E. coli-contaminated meats are 
'adulterated.'"

The petition quoted the FMIA as saying, "It is essential in 
the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers 
be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products 
distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated ..."

"Thus, according to USDA's own regulations, only meats lacking 
E. coli contamination can be labeled 'Inspected and Passed,'" 
the petition said, adding, "Because the FMIA prohibits 
misleading and false labeling, the USDA must remove the 
'Inspected and Passed' labels from meat products until it can 
conclusively determine that the meat is uncontaminated with the 
adulterant E. coli."

Nicholson and Waugh said that USDA's baseline survey of steers 
and heifers found that "approximately 15% of all raw beef 
samples contain one or more species of pathogens."

The petition also said that USDA has admitted that its 
sampling program for E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef 
"cannot eliminate E. coli from the food supply."

"It is clear the number of outbreaks has remained high or 
continued to grow, even with USDA's safe care and handling 
labels," the groups said, adding, "In light of the continuing 
number of E. coli outbreaks, it is necessary for USDA to 
improve the current safe handling labels."

The labels should state the consequences of undercooking, 
the petition said, adding:

"How can consumers adapt their behavior to meet the seriousness 
of the health risk when they are uninformed of the potential 
consequences?  For all a purchaser knows, the only illness 
resulting from contamination is an upset stomach.  If 
individuals knew that kidney failure and death were potential 
side effects, they would take the warnings with the degree of 
seriousness that the hazard requires."

The petitioners recommended a new safe handling label that 
would begin:  "WARNING:  This product may contain E. coli 
bacteria, which can cause serious illness, including:  death, 
strokes, seizures, bloody diarrhea, renal failure, red blood 
cell destruction."  Anyone suffering from abdominal cramps or 
diarrhea a few days after consumption should consult a 
physician immediately, the proposed label said.  The proposed 
label also stated that the product should be cooked until no 
red color remains, to a minimum temperature of 155 F.  The 
labels should be bigger and in larger type than the current 
ones, the petitioners said.

They called for a similar warning for cured meat products, 
noting that "it has become clear that E. coli contamination 
can survive the curing process. ... In light of this potential 
danger, USDA should warn consumers of cured meat's potential 
dangers, and at the very least, the agency must remove the 
'Inspected and Passed' labels from cured meat products until 
it can be certain that the meat is not adulterated with E. 
coli."

"If USDA ignores this request, the agency will have acted in an 
arbitrary and capricious manner in violation of the 
Administrative Procedure Act," the petitioners said.  ((6FLN

ORE-IDA DEVELOPS SNACK ZONES FOR MINI-MEALS

01/04/96 - Boise, ID -- Ore-Ida Foods announced that as a consequence
of the busy lifestyles that people today are leading, eating habits are
changing. This is causing more people to eat on the run and consume
several mini-meals throughout the day, creating "the fourth meal"
occasion. This trend is also evident in restaurant settings, where more
and more families are ordering an array of appetizers instead of full
entrees. In order to capitalize on these trends, Ore-Ida Foods has helped
retailers develop a destination shopping section in grocery store frozen
food aisles across the country. This section, known as the "Snack Zone,"
is anchored by Ore-Ida frozen snacks such as Bagel Bites, Cheese Bites
and Dyna Bites. The philosophy underpinning the "Snack Zone" is to
position an assortment of frozen snack items together in one section so
busy shoppers can easily find satisfying and nutritional snacking
solutions for parties, after school or the midnight munchies. Boise, ID
based Ore-Ida Foods is an affiliate of the H.J. Heinz Company and one
of North America's largest frozen food processors.

WENDY'S COMPLETES MERGER WITH TIM HORTONS

01/04/96 - Dublin, OH -- Wendy's International, Inc. has completed the
merger with Tim Hortons, a privately-owned Canadian restaurant chain of
nearly 1,200 units. Wendy's agreed to issue 16.45 million shares of
common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Hortons'
Canadian parent company. The transaction will be treated as a pooling-
of-interests. Tim Hortons has 1,170 company and franchise restaurants,
primarily in Canada. It is Canada's largest national chain in the coffee
and fresh baked goods segment, and second largest in the quick service

combo unit - a freestanding building with a shared dining room and
separate kitchens and staffs. Development costs are about 25% less for
each than traditional units. About 35 combo units are open, with plans for
at least 30 more in 1996.

FOODQUEST TO REVIEW STRATEGIES LEADING TO THE SALE OF
ALL OF ITS KENNY ROGERS ROASTER'S RESTAURANTS

01/02/96 - North Miami, FL -- FOODQUEST, Inc. announced that the
Board of Directors has decided to review various strategies leading to the
sale of all of its Kenny Rogers Roaster's concept restaurants to potential
third parties. FOODQUEST will immediately engage an outside valuation
consultant to determine the potential value of these concept units in the
marketplace. Pursuant to this strategy change, the Company has held
discussions with Roasters Corp., the franchisor of Kenny Rogers
Roasters, and has received indications that Roasters Corp. would be
willing to purchase some or all of the Roasters concept units previously
sold and financed by Roasters for a purchase price equal to net book
value, subject to certain other conditions of closing.  The Board believes
that it is in the best interest of shareholders to offer the assets to third
parties as well, so as to receive the highest potential valuation for these
assets. The Company will continue to aggressively pursue and negotiate
for acquisition or merger candidates, such as the recent Paradise Bakery
acquisition target, that offer the best potential for net income growth and
maximization of shareholder value.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to
authorize the use, on food labels and in food labeling, of health claims on
the association between oat products, i.e., oat bran and oatmeal, and
reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). FDA is proposing this

totality of publicly available scientific evidence, diets high in oatmeal and
oat bran and low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of
CHD.

Corp. (Hershey) to market test products identified, in part, as "white
chocolate" that deviate from the U.S. standards of identity for chocolate
products, e.g., chocolate liquor, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate,
buttermilk chocolate, skim milk chocolate, or mixed dairy product
chocolates. The purpose of the amendment to the extended temporary
permit is to allow Hershey to collect data on consumer acceptance of a
different product, containing white chocolate, that also contains
chocolate cookies, and to identify mass production problems.

REPORT OF THE FLUOROQUINOLONE WORKING GROUP; AVAILABILITY

Volume 61, Number 3
[Notices, Page 353]
[Docket No. 95S-0199]

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Notice.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the
availability of the report of the Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM's)
Fluoroquinolone Working Group (FQWG). The report addresses issues
and contains recommendations regarding policies and procedures
related to approval of fluoroquinolone (FQ) antimicrobial drugs in food
animals. The report of the FQWG is in response to concerns that
approval of FQ drugs for use in food animals may result in increased
development of FQ resistance in zoonotic organisms harbored by food
animals that are transmitted to humans and cause disease.

[Proposed Rules, Page 67489-67492]
[[Page 67489]]
21 CFR Part 71, et al.
Substances Approved for Use in the Preparation of Meat and Poultry
Products; Food Standards of Identity, Quality and Fill of Container;

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to
amend its regulations governing the review of petitions for the approval
of food and color additives and substances generally recognized as safe
(GRAS) to provide for joint review of such petitions by the Food Safety
and Inspection Service (FSIS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
when meat or poultry product uses are proposed. By agreement between
USDA and FDA, such listings would eliminate the need for a separate
FSIS rulemaking to allow the use in meat and poultry products of FDA-
approved substances.

"HIGH POTENCY" CLAIM FOR DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS AND DEFINITION OF
"ANTIOXIDANT" FOR USE IN NUTRIENT CONTENT CLAIMS FOR DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS
AND CONVENTIONAL FOODS

Volume 60, Number 249
[Proposed Rules, Page 67184-67194]
21 CFR Part 101
[Docket No. 95N-0347]
RIN 0910-AA23

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to
amend its regulations to define the term "high potency" as a nutrient
content claim for dietary supplements; define the term "antioxidant"
for use in nutrient content claims on labels or in labeling of dietary
supplements and conventional foods; and correct an omission pertaining
to the use of "sugar free" claims on dietary supplements. FDA is taking
these actions to provide for the use of additional nutrient content claims
in response to provisions of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of
1990. This proposed rule will benefit consumers by providing established
definitions for use in food labeling for the terms "high potency,"
"antioxidant," and "sugar free."

Food Labeling; Final Rule and Proposed Rules
[[Page 67164]]
21 CFR Part 101
[Docket No. 90N-0134]
RIN 0910-AA19

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Final rule.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its
regulations to establish Reference Daily Intakes (RDI's) for vitamin K,
selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and chloride, but not for
fluoride. The agency is also amending its regulations to modify the units
of measure that are used to declare the amount of biotin, folate, calcium,
and phosphorus in food. In addition, the agency is amending its
regulations to make consideration of selenium, chromium, molybdenum,
and chloride optional in making a determination as to whether a food is
nutritionally inferior to a food for which it substitutes and that it
resembles. These actions are intended to assist consumers in
understanding the nutritional significance of foods in the context of a total
daily diet and are in recognition of the fact that the National Academy of
Sciences (NAS) established Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA's)
and Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDI's) for
vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and chloride
either in 1980 or 1989.

Frozen dessert year in review

Tea-flavored ice creams and ice cream pizza pies
proliferated in 1995, but the sudden flurry of
competition in these segments ran second to the
developments in another product category, that of
sorbets, where Ice Cream Reporter's top story for the
year is the decision by Haagen-Dazs to proceed with a
national rollout of its sorbet line.  The move by the
world's leading superpremium frozen dessert marketer is
significant on several levels.  Most importantly, a large-
scale advertising and promotion campaign by Haagen-
Dazs created an awareness of sorbets among masses of
consumers who were previously unaware that this type
of product even existed.  But the Haagen-Dazs blitz also
focused attention on the disparity between the marketing
power of the industry's deep-pocketed leaders and the
precarious position of the smaller frozen dessert
companies that struggle along on a shoe-string to
maintain their hold on hard-won market niches.  Some of
those smaller companies felt the pinch as soon as the
Haagen-Dazs rollout began, losing distribution and shelf
space as retailers opted for the big-name brand.  But
other sorbet marketers argued that the public awareness
created for the category by Haagen-Dazs would help all
participants.  Because of its impact on the market,
Haagen-Dazs Sorbet is not only the story of the year for
1995 but also the product of the year.

Encouraged by the entry of Haagen-Dazs, or at least not
discouraged by it, was The Mattus Group, which
introduced a line of sorbets under the Monterey label
(ICR 11/95).  Admitting to being encouraged by the
Haagen-Dazs entry was International Yogurt, which is
now offering its Sorbet...by Yo Cream to its foodservice
customers (ICR 10/95).  Looking for a slightly different
niche is Lafayette Foods, which introduced Frubet, an
ultra-rich sorbet that is being positioned as an upscale
competitor to single-serve Italian ices rather than going
head-to-head with the pint-packed sorbets (ICR 12/95).

Domestic Moves:  The most important event in the
domestic frozen dessert industry, after the Haagen-Dazs
sorbet rollout, was the decision by Brice Foods to end its
traditional franchise practice and switch to a royalty-free
franchise plan for is 200-unit I Can't Believe It's Yogurt
chain (ICR 11/95).  The progress of the new plan, which
will have franchisees purchase their goods from the
franchisor on an as-needed basis, is sure to be watched
closely by other frozen dessert chain operators.

Also making franchise news was TCBY, which announced
in December that it was planning to trnansform all its
company-owned units to franchisees (ICR 12/95).  The
move was part of an overall reorganization of the frozen
yogurt marketer.  Increasing its presence in the
foodservice arena was Dannon, which launched a turn-
key, modular vending concept under the name Yogurt
Cravings (ICR 4/95).

Other major stories on the domestic front included the
return to the black of Ben & Jerry's, after suffering the
first loss in the company's history in the 3rd quarter of
1994 (ICR 12/95); the agreement by the International
Dairy Foods Association and the Dairy and Food
Industries Supply Association to join forces and create a
new International Food and Dairy Show (ICR 2/95); and
the elimination of package size restrictions on frozen
desserts by the National Conference on Weights and
Measures (ICR 8/95).  Also noteworthy was the decision
by Grand Metropolitan to close Haagen-Dazs' long-term
headquarters in Teaneck, NJ and consolidate the
company's operations with those of Pillsbury in
Minneapolis (ICR 10/95).

Product Trends: Following on the flood of coffee-flavored
frozen desserts that hit the market in 1994 came a slew
of tea-flavored products beginning with a line of Iced Tea
Pops produced by H.P. Hood under a licensing agreement
with the highly popular tea marketer Celestial Seasonings
(ICR 3/95).  Also in March was the announcement of a
Lipton Original Iced Tea Bar from Good Humor-Breyers,
with Unilever synergizing two of its most popular brands.
Next up was Frozfruit, which joined the tea party with a
Lemon Iced Tea fruit bar (ICR 4/95).  In another bit of
synergy, Nestle borrowed from its popular tea brand to
create the Nestea Iced Tea Bar (ICR 9/95).

If three makes a trend, then ice cream pizza became a
trend in 1995.  Good Humor-Breyers kicked off the
movement with its Freeza Pizza novelty (ICR 3/95), then
Dairy Queen upped the ante with a full-sized ice cream
pie which it called the DQ Treatzza Pizza (ICR 5/95).
Baskin-Robbins weighed in a few months later with its
Polar Pizza (ICR 9/95), available in both single slices
and whole pie form.

New Products: The Good Humor-Breyers items
mentioned above were part of a massive 50-product
launch by the company this past spring (ICR 3/95) which
also included Romantica, a follow-up to the company's
Viennetta ice cream cake, and Reese's Peanut Butter Ice
Cream Cups, made under a licensing agreement with
Hershey Food Co.

Eskimo Pie made several new product announcements
that involved licensing agreements, beginning with a deal
with Nabisco to create a line of frozen desserts based on
the four most popular cookie brands in the country (ICR
1/95).  The next licensing deal called for Eskimo Pie to
take over the poduction and marketing of the popular
Weight Watchers frozen desserts (ICR 2/95), and a third
saw Eskimo Pie entering into a long-term agreement to
manufacture, distribute, and market Realfruit Sorbets
(ICR 4/95).

In other new product news, Clarke Ice Cream licensed the
A&W root beer brand for a line of novelties (ICR 11/95);
and Healthy Choice added a superpremium low-fat line
under Special Creations label (ICR 3/95).  Also
noteworthy was the launch of Haagen-Dazs Cordials, a
line of liqueur-flavored ice creams (ICR 1/95).

One other new product of significance announced in 1995,
though not due out on the market until 1996, is the
coffee ice cream from Dreyer's and Starbucks (ICR
11/95).  This launch caps the coffee ice cream trend that
began in 1994 by pairing two market leaders in a joint
venture that goes beyond the usual licensing agreement.

Pricing Down:    Two other product introductions of
interest were the Blue Ribbon line of ice cream cakes
from Carvel (ICR 10/95) and the Chiqui i.i. ice creams and
sorbets from Out of a Flower (ICR 11/95).  The two
launches shared a common importance in that they were
both lower-priced versions of products the companies
were already marketing.  In the case of Carvel, the lower-
priced introduction reflected pressure from competing
products; while Out of a Flower was looking to broaden its
distribution to outlets that would not handle its primary
ultra-high-priced line.

Mergers & Acquisitions:    No deal in 1995 came close
to 1994's story-of-the-year, the acquisition by Nestle of
22% of Dreyer's stock.  But among the more interesting
moves in 1995 were the acquisition of Bresler's
Industries by the Canadian marketer Yogen Fruz World-
Wide (ICR 7/95); the acquisition of the rights to the
Colombo frozen yogurt brand by Integrated Brands
(formerly Steve's Homemade) (ICR 9/95); the
management buyout of Nestle Dairy Sytems, renamed
Norse Dairy Systems (ICR 11/95); and Pfizer's sale of its
Food Science Group to the Finnish ingredient company
Cultor, Ltd. (ICR 11/95).

Following upon its acquisition in 1994 by Kohlberg,
Kravis, & Roberts (ICR 9/94), Borden announced that it
was planning to sell its dairies east of the Mississippi in
order to focus on its western dairy operations (ICR 6/95).
The first sale took place shortly thereafter, with a Borden
unit in West Virginia going to United Dairy, Inc. (ICR
7/95).  Later in the year Borden amended its policy
slightly with the sale of one of its key western units, its
Houston frozen dessert plant, to Dreyer's (ICR 12/95).
The acquisition helped strengthen Dreyer's expansion into
the Southwest.

International News:  U.S. frozen dessert marketers
continued to find room for expansion overseas in 1995.
Bresler's Industries reached two licensing agreements in
China (ICR 1/95 and 5/95), and one in Brazil (ICR 6/95);
Baskin-Robbins opened its first shop in Vietnam (ICR
2/95) and expanded its existing operations in Russia (ICR
12/95); TCBY expanded its franchising into India and the
Cayman Islands (ICR 10/95) and Russia (ICR 11/95); and
Brice Foods licensed manufacturing rights for its products
to companies in Europe, Brazil, and Australia to facilitate
supplying of its overseas ICBIY shops (ICR 12/95).

While not contracting in terms of business, Haagen-Dazs
did shrink its overseas operations, closing its Paris
headquarters and consolidating its management into that
of parent Grand Metropolitan (ICR 1/95).  This
anticipated a similar move noted in the Domestic Moves
section above.

People in the News:    Among the people making news in
the frozen dessert industry in 1995, the most prominent
was Bob Holland, who won the job of replacing company
founder Ben Cohen as CEO of Ben & Jerry's following a
much-publicized search and contest (ICR 2/95).  Holland,
who was also named president of the company, is given
much of the credit for getting Ben & Jerry's back on track
in 1995.

Steve Herrell, one of the founding fathers of the
superpremium movement, was also in the news this past
year as he began to expand his latest chain of ice cream
shops (ICR 3/95).  Making news of a less positive nature
was Robert Peltz, former chairman of Chipwich, who was
accused of using almost $700,000 in company funds for
personal expenses (ICR 10/95).

BST:    The battle over the use of the synthetically-
produced growth hormone bovine somatropin (BST)
continued in 1995.  Early on, the pro-BST forces claimed a
number of victories by blocking legislation in states
across the country (ICR 5/95).  In June, Ben & Jerry's, one
of the most prominent foes of BST use, resigned from the
International Ice Cream Association in protest against the
group's pro-BST stance (ICR 6/95).  Later in the year the
pro-BST movement suffered a setback when a Vermont
judge rejected a request for an injunction against the
state's mandatory BST labeling law (ICR 8/95).

Advertising & Promotions:    With reduced-fat, low-fat,
and fat-free frozen desserts claiming a growing share of
the market in 1995, Unilever introduced a new labeling
format for its Good Humor-Breyers light alternative
products, with logos reminding consumers to "Eat
Healthy, Eat Well" and "Eat Better, Eat Well" (ICR 12/95).

 ...And a look at the year ahead

As with many other facets of American life, legislation
now pending in the 104th Congress could have a
significant impact on the frozen dessert industry in 1996.
As explained in an article further on in this issue, there
could be a major increase in frozen dessert prices if
Congress makes changes in current dairy policy.  But, as
the article also explains, it is simply too early to know
whether the changes will be made and, if they are, how
big they will be.

An increase in frozen dessert prices could have the effect
of making it easier in 1996 for the larger companies in
the industry to use discounting and other forms of price
promotion as competitive weapons against smaller
players.  Price competition has been an ongoing factor,
albeit to a relatively small degree, in the frozen dessert
industry.  But it would not be surprising to see more
companies do what Carvel did this past year, i.e.,
introduce a lower-priced line in the face of price
competition from its rivals.

Something that will definitely be lower in 1996 will be
the fat content of more and more frozen dessert products.
Sales of light alternative products were up significantly in
1995 and the trend will continue into 1996.  More and
more marketers will follow the Good Humor-Breyers
example and add logos or other labeling marks that will
make it easier for consumers to identify these products.
The desire for light alternative frozen desserts, coupled
with the rollout of the Haagen-Dazs line of sorbets, our
1995 story of the year, should lead to increased sales for
the sorbet category.

In last year's look ahead we predicted, for the second
time, that Unilever would make a bid for Haagen-Dazs.
With Grand Metropolitan pulling the reins in on Haagen-
Dazs's management this past year, it seems less likely
than ever that the British comglomerate would be willing
to let the superpremium marketer go.  So instead, we'll
focus on the Nestle-Dreyer's connection and suggest that
if the frozen novelties marketer does not make an
outright move to acquire the Oakland-based Dreyer's, it
will definitely seek to improve on its 22% holding.  And if
it doesn't go for Dreyer's, Nestle could make a bid on
Eskimo Pie, perhaps even finding itself in a bidding war
with Unilever for the Virginia-based novelties marketer.

Haagen-Dazs testing cafe concept


Testing of a broader, cafe-type menu concept is
underway in a handful of Haagen-Dazs shops around the
country.  The shops, all franchise operations, have
expanded their offerings beyond the traditional line of
frozen desserts to include such items as sweet baked
goods, sandwiches, and salads.  A Haagen-Dazs
spokesman told Ice Cream Reporter that Rthe company is
interested in seeing how the extended menu will affect
the shops' business.S  He noted that the test is open-
ended, with no specific time-table as to when or whether
additional units will be converted to the cafe concept,
despite some published reports that 25 out of the 250
Haagen-Dazs shops in the U.S. would eventually be
changed over to cafe.

The testing of the cafe concept began last May with a
single shop in Boulder, CO.  A second franchisee
introduced the concept in October at a single unit in
Coconut Grove, FL.  Conversion of a third unit has just
been completed in Tysons Corner, VA.

The new unit has 1,300 square feet of floor space.  The
Haagen-Dazs spokesman explained that the cafe concept
would only be introduced in shops that were between
1,200 and 1,500 sq. ft.  The aim, he noted, was to create a
Rcozy environment,S but that any shop smaller than than
the 1,200 sq. ft. minimum would not be able to
acommodate any tables comfortably or provide enough
floor space for the self-service customer traffic.

The responsibility for the menu expansion rests with the
franchisees who are testing the cafe concept.  The
Haagen-Dazs spokesman indicated that the company
considered the introduction of baked goods as the top
priority with sandwiches, salads, and other foods
secondary.  He reported that the company has not given
the franchisees strict guidelines as to what foods they can
offer, but would draw the line if someone tried to
introduce a line of fried chicken, to use one example.
RThe main parameter,S he explained, Ris whether it
enhances the Haagen-Dazs concept.S

Dairy legislation remains in turmoil


The new year begins with U.S. dairy policy in a state of
flux.  Efforts to reach a decision on whether to retain,
drop, or in some way alter price supports for dairy
products remain unresolved as the larger issue of the
overall budget continues to be worked out.  Despite the
uncertainty, one strong possibility is that the price of
milk will be allowed to go up, sending the price of other
dairy products, including frozen desserts, up with it.

According to the International Dairy Foods Association
(IDFA), a plan proposed by Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-WI),
and supported by the National Milk Producers Federation,
could Rdramatically increase the prices consumers now
pay for milk and other dairy products by billions of
dollars.S  The Gunderson plan is described as a
RcompromiseS because it allows for both an increase and
decrease of government control of dairy at the same time.

The plan follows the current political trend of reducing
government interference in the marketplace by
eliminating price supports for some dairy products.  But
the IDFA points out that what it takes away with one
hand it gives back with interest with the other by locking
in higher minimum price levels to producers for fluid
milk.  These higher prices would be paid by dairy
processors and food manufacturers and then passed along
to consumers.  The government would also be paying the
higher price when purchasing milk and dairy products
for needy citizens.  With budget allotments fixed, this
would result in smaller purchases and fewer people
helped.

An IDFA representative told Ice Cream Reporter that the
Gunderson plan is on the table as a result of President
Clinton having vetoed the budget passed by Congress in
November.  In that budget, dairy policy was to remain
unchanged, a compromise between those conservative
idealogues who wanted to eliminate all government
agricultural supports, including dairy, and
representatives from dairy-producing regions, led by
Jerry Solomon (R-NY), who were defending the interests
of their constituents.  The presidential veto opened the
door to further legislative discussion and the
development of the Gunderson plan.

The IDFA representative noted that passage of the
Gunderson plan was far from being a certainty.  For one
thing, there are strong regional disagreements, chiefly
between producers in the West and the Northeast over
whether the benefits would be distributed equitably.  In
addition, the loss of price supports might lead to the
"dumping" of some U.S. dairy products on world markets
which could be in violation of U.S. trade agreements.
With so many details such as these to be worked out, it is
possible that the budget compromise plan of November,
i.e., leaving current dairy policies in place, will once again
be chosen.

Baskin-Robbins continues convenience store expansion
drive


Baskin-Robbins has announced that it is expanding its
convenience store operations through an agreement with
H.N. Funkhouser, operator of the Virginia-based Handy
Mart chain.  The franchise co-branding agreement, which
also includes Baskin-Robbins' sister company Dunkin'
Donuts, calls for Funkhouser to retro-fit seven of its 14
units to accomodate the frozen dessert and donut
operations.  The Handy Mart units to be converted are
located in Frederick, Warren, and Clarke counties.  The
first unit is expected to be ready by late February, with a
150-square-foot space devoted to the sale of a full line of
Baskin-Robbins ice creams and frozen yogurts, including
pre-packed and hand-packed items, frozen dessert cakes,
and the fountain items typically available in a Baskin-
Robbins shop.  Table space is included, as well.

The Handy Mart deal is the latest in a series reached by
Baskin-Robbins with regional gas station/convenience
store operators over the last two years.  It also continues
the company's ongoing co-franchising effort with Dunkin'
Donuts.  Each of the two companies, owned by the British
conglomerate Allied Domecq, is the largest franchisor
worldwide in its category.  By teaming up, they offer
convenience store operators and other franchisees the
opportunity to offer products that complement each other
seasonally.  In addition, operators can cross-train
employees for both operations.

Funkhouser president Robert Claytor explained that his
company wants to attract a more diverse clientele to the
convenience stores through the addition of the
nationally-known brand name chains.  The Handy Marts
started out as gas stations when they opened in the
1930s, with auto parts sales added in the 1970s, and the
convenience stores in the 1980s.  The inclusion of the
Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts operations is in
keeping with a national trend that has seen about 2,000
gas stations across the country add some type of fast food
operation in recent years in order to attract more
travelers to stop at their locations.

Pascobel makes U.S. push

Looking to develop a niche in the U.S. market for frozen
dessert ingredients is the Pascobel Corporation.  An
offshoot of the Montreal-based Pascobel, Inc., the
company offers natural, highly functional milk protein
products that are designed to replace non-fat dry milk
and skim milk powders in a variety of processed dairy
products including ice creams and frozen yogurts.

The products, marketed under the Nollibel and Belcover
labels, have been used for many years by over 300 food
manufacturers in Canada and more than a dozen
European nations.  The long-term acceptance of the
products in Europe is due, in part, to the fact that the
technology for producing the dairy proteins was
developed on the continent over 25 years ago by the
French dairy company Bel Cheese.

Ted Fisch, National Sales Manager for the New Jersey-
based Pascobel, explained that the company had launched
a major effort to acquaint American manufacturers with
its products through an appearance at the 1995
MegaShow in Chicago.  At the show, Pascobel conducted a
blind taste test using a 3% low fat vanilla ice cream.  One
sample was made using skim milk powder while in
another, 50% of the skim milk powder was replaced with
the company's Nollibel 1450 functional milk protein
product.  According to Fisch, over 65% of those who tried
the ice creams preferred the one with the Nollibel.

Fisch noted that the particular variety of Nollibel used in
the taste taste, the least functional in the line, sells for
about half the typical price of skim milk powder.  The
top-of-the line products offer savings closer to 10% off
the typical price of skim milk powder.  Fisch pointed out
that in addition to being less expensive than non-fat dry
milk or skim milk powder, the Pascobel milk protein
products, because of their processing, have greater
consistency and more body and texture than the
competing products.

The company makes a variety of standard products
specifically intended for use in economy ice creams,
premium ice creams, and reduced-fat ice creams and
frozen yogurts.  It also reports that it can customize
products at the manufacturer's request to suit them to
specific applications.

Last Licks


o       Borden has released some additional information on
the sale of its Houston ice cream plant to Dreyer's, which
we reported on in the December ICR.  Under the terms of
the agreement, which became effective December 31,
about 100 hourly workers and 29 salaried employees will
be given severance packages and assistance in finding
new work.  Approximately 35 distribution workers will
be retained by Borden and will continue to be involved in
delivering the company's branded frozen desserts which
will be co-packed by Dreyer's.  Borden also reports that it
will supply the distribution area previously served from
the Houston plant with products manufactured at other
Borden plants in the region.

o       Another item from the December ICR, on the
expansion of Baskin-Robbins operations in Russia,
requires amending.  We reported that the company's
production facility in Moscow would not be open until the
spring.  The day after we went to press, we were
informed that the plant had become operational on
December 11th.  In addition, the facility will serve the
company's Russian stores only, although deliveries to
other countries may follow in the future.  ICR had
indicated that the plant would begin serving East
European countries immediately.

o       In another follow-up on our December issue, the
December 4 issue of Crain's Cleveland Business reports
that Pierre's French Ice Cream has followed its Lysteria-
related product recall of late October/early November
with a major coupon campaign intended as a Rthank youS
to loyal customers.  The $2-off coupons appeared on
November 29th in The Plain Dealer, The Beacon-Journal,
and some 20 newspapers throughout northern Ohio and
western Pennsylvania.

o       Back in October, ICR reported that Denver-based
Meadow Gold Dairies was scoring big with its Colorado
Rockies Ice Cream, named for the city's baseball team.
Now it has followed up with another sports-related line,
this time named for the local National Hockey League
team, the Colorado Avalanche.  Individual flavors feature
such rink-related names as Slap Shot Vanilla, Hat Trick
Sundae, and Chocolate Power Play.

o       The December 8 Financial Times reported that
Nestle Philippines would be taking a greater role in the
operations of Magnolia Nestle, its ice cream company joint
venture with San Miguel, the largest food company in the
Philippines.  Magnolia holds a 56% share of the ice cream
market in the Philippines, but that represents a
significant loss from previous years.

o       Catching up on some other overseas news, the
September 12 edition of Euromarketing reported that
Unilever subsidiary GB-Glace Sweden is withdrawing
from the Norwegian market after failing in its efforts to
take share away from frozen dessert market leader Norsk
Iskrem.  GB-Glace has accumulated about $8 million in
losses since entering that market in 1991.  Norsk Iskrem
holds a 49% share of the Norwegian market, with Hennig
Olsen second at 34%, and Drammens Is third with a 13%
share.

o       And catching up on some domestic news from the
same month, the September 22 edition of the
Birmingham News reported that newly-arrived Blue Bell
Ice Cream had taken the lead in that city's ice cream
sales, surpassing Barber Dairies, a hometown favorite for
75 years, by garnering a 32.3% market share.  Texas-
based Blue Bell had expanded distribution into the
Birmingham market only a few months earlier, as
reported in the February 1995 ICR.

o       Jerseymaid Dairies announced on December 14 that
it was recalling half-gallon containers of the Select brand
Light Rocky Road Ice Cream it co-packed for the Safeway
supermarket chain following the discovery of Listeria
contamination during a sampling of the product.  The
containers had been distributed from the company's base
in City of Commerce, CA to stores in northern California,
Arizona, Nevada, and Hawaii.

o       Happier news on that same date of December 14
cmme from TCBY which  announced that its board of
directors had declared a $0.05 per share dividend
payable on January 15 to all shareholders of record as of
December 29.

o       The Sealright Company has announced third quarter
results for the period ending September 30, 1995 with
sales of $76.2 million, down 4.5% from the same period in
1994.  Net income was $1.05 million, down almost 77%,
with income per share down from $0.41 to $0.09.  Charles
F. Marcy, Sealright's President and CEO, describing the
results as Runacceptable,S explained that they reflected
below-plan sales of the company's frozen dessert
packaging business to regional customers who were
losing market share to aggressive national competitors.

o       The International Dairy Foods Association will be
holding its Ice Cream Technology Conference on February
21-23 at the Red Lion's La Posada Resort in Scottsdale,
AZ.  Among the topics to be discussed are frozen dessert
standards and composition, production technologies,
ingredient selection, product safety, and labeling.  For
more information call the IDFA at 202-737-4332 or fax
to 202-331-7820.

DIETARY GUIDELINES OKAY MODERATE DRINKING;
CSPI HEAD CALLS THEM APPROPRIATE


     Last week's release of the 1995 "Dietary Guidelines for
Americans" marked the end of a change in official attitude toward
bev/al.  Where a decade ago, bev/al was the target of a
neo-Prohibitionist crusade, now moderate consumption is viewed as
appropriate.
     Indeed, the attitude in Washington had so changed that
Michael Jacobson, executive director of Center for Science in the Public
Interest and a long-time opponent of the bev/al industry, was overheard
telling a Knight-Ridder reporter:  "I think it's okay to mention alcohol.
The Guidelines clearly don't encourage excessive drinking.  You'd have
to be inebriated to think the Guidelines encourage excessive drinking."
     In a major departure from the 1990 Guidelines, the new version
eliminates previous commentary that alcohol consumption "has no net
health benefit" and "is not recommended."
     They note "current evidence' that suggests moderate drinking is
"associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease."  And in its
advice section, the Guidelines state:  "If you drink alcoholic beverages,
do so in moderation, with meals, and when consumption does not put
you or others at risk."
     The significance of the change was emphasized by Dr. Philip
Lee, assistant secretary of health:  "In my personal view, wine with meals
is beneficial.  There was a significant bias in the past against drinking.
To move from anti-alcohol to health benefits is a big change."
     Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services, added
that the guidelines acknowledge "what most of us have known all along:
food is not just fuel, it is one of life's greatest pleasures."
     Needless to say, publication of the Guidelines brought joy to
John DeLuca, president, Wine Institute, who seven years ago developed
a strategy of dealing with anti-alcohol sentiment by researching
scientific information showing health benefits of moderate consumption.
     He praised the Guidelines for more clearly distinguishing
moderation from abuse, noting harmful effects when alcohol is
"consumed in excess" and listing dangers associated with only "higher
levels of alcohol intake," "too much alcohol" and "heavy drinkers."
     Meanwhile, Fred A. Meister, president/ceo, Distilled Spirits
Council of the U.S., praised the Federal Government for "recognizing
that distilled spirits plays a role in the lifestyle and diet of adult
Americans."
     He said removal of language that drinking has "no net health
benefit" and inclusion of the potential health benefit of moderate
drinking "of distilled spirits or other bev/al is an important
acknowledgment of the growing body of scientific studies on the
subject."

British Study Okays Moderate Drinking, Sets Higher Limits than U.S.


     Less than three weeks before the new Dietary Guidelines were
released in Washington, the British Government's Department of
Health reported that "it is now established that the main specific
pathology which benefits from alcohol consumption is coronary heart
disease."  There is, it said, "very likely" a protective effect from alcohol.
     The report offers daily, rather than the previous weekly,
benchmarks for safe drinking.  The benchmarks are higher than the
U.S. version:  eight to 12 ounces of wine for women 12 to 16 ounces a
day for men.

Budget Impasse Threatens CSAP,
But May Also Imperil Industry Programs


     Industry executives are hardly shedding tears that the Center
for Substance Abuse Prevention has been virtually shut down by the
current budget impasse.  Most executives view CSAP, a unit of the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, as a hotbed of
biased anti-alcohol activity, an agency many view as playing fast and
loose with the facts and the law.
     But we talked last week with a highly respected political
operative who -- while he certainly was shedding no tears for SAMHA
-- warned that the budget battle, which has nearly closed the
Department of Health and Human Services, could hurt the industry too.
     He fears the result will be that every nook and cranny of the
federal budget will be examined, imperiling such things as the Market
Promotion Program, studies on the health effects of alcohol, research
for viticulture, proposed changes in the Internal Revenue Code dealing
with phylloxera and the industry's quest to roll back that big tax increase
five years ago.
     While the House Republicans are widely believed not to want a
budget deal -- unless they get everything they want -- the simple fact is
that a lot of rank and file House Democrats don't want a deal, either.
They believe the current standoff will bolster their changes of regaining
control of the House.

Vermont Adopts a Liquor "Fee"


     Vermont Liquor Control Board imposed a 20 cents a bottle
"fee" on four sizes of distilled spirits, effective Jan. 1.
     The increase, levied without industry or consumer consultation,
applies to 200 ml,  375 ml, 750 ml and 1 liter bottles.
     Fred A. Meister, president/ceo, Distilled Spirits COuncil of the
U.S., said he was "extremely disappointed and puzzled by this ill-advised
and discriminatory price increase on distilled spirits.  This decision was
made without the input of the people who will be most affected --
Vermont consumers and the producers and suppliers of distilled spirits.
We urge them to reconsider."
     State and local taxes paid on a typical purchase in Vermont are
111% greater than in neighboring New Hampshire.
     Monita Fontaine, DISCUS state government relations director,
wondered why, if the Board's goal was to raise additional revenue,
should it focus on distilled spirits, which represent less than 29% of
alcohol purchased in the state.  The revenue burden on distilled spirits
in Vermont is 108% more than the burden per alcohol gallon on beer
and 65% greater than the burden on table wines, Fontaine said.

ship wine for personal use into New York State was vetoed by Gov.
George Pataki.
     Pataki noted that supporters had said the bill would encourage
the sale of wine from New York wineries, benefit the tourism industry,
and enhance New York's reputation as a wine-producing state.
     "I am not convinced the bill would, in fact, benefit New York's
reputation as a wine-producing state.  And I am extremely concerned
about the potentially negative impact this bill, if enacted, would have on
existing, licensed New York State businesses relying on wine sales, as
well as its impact on New York wineries and jobs."
     Indeed, Pataki said he thought the result would be increased
mail-order sales of California wines, leading to lower sales for New
York liquor stores and distributors, a shrunken market share for New
York wineries within the state.
     New York tax authorities estimated the bill would result in the
loss of $1 per case in excise tax revenue, $10 per case in sales tax
revenue and local governments would also lose $10 a case in sales tax
revenue.

BEVERAGES ARE FOOD CATEGORY PURCHASED
MOST OFTEN BY MASS RETAIL SHOPPERS, SURVEY SHOWS

     Carbonated soft drinks and juice are the two food items
consumers are most likely to buy at mass retail stores, according to a
new study published by the International Mass Retail Association
(IMRA). The study was prepared by the Gallup Organization for
IMRA's membership, which includes discount department stores,
warehouse/club stores, specialty discounters, deep discount drug stores,
off-price stores, variety stores, and dollar stores, among others.

     The study, entitled Consumer Shopping Behavior on Food
Merchandise and In-store Food Services, includes the responses of 1,011
adults aged 18 years and older, who were surveyed by telephone in
September 1995. Among the findings of the study were the following
highlights.

Profile of Survey Participants

     * Nearly one-fourth of all respondents (23 percent) said they
visited mass retail or discount stores more than once a week in a typical
month. Thirty-one percent said they visited such stores twice (16
percent) or three times (15 percent) a month. Only seven percent of all
respondents said they never visited mass retail stores.

     * Females  were significantly  more likely to be the primary
shopper  in  the  family  for  clothing  and  household goods (92
percent), and food (89 percent), than  were males (70 percent).

     * Accordingly, females were more frequent visitors to mass
retail stores than males, with 19 percent of the female respondents
saying they went to mass retail stores at least once a week in a typical
month, compared to only 12 percent of males who visited such stores
that often.

     * Older respondents appeared slightly less likely to visit mass
retail stores than were the younger respondents. Only six percent of
those aged 18 to 34 years said they never visited mass retail stores, while
twice as many of those 55 years or older (13 percent) never visited these
stores.

     * Respondents were most likely (73 percent) to express a
preference for shopping at one store that carried a complete selection
of groceries as well as general merchandise.

     * Slightly more than one in six (17 percent) of all respondents
said that they always make some type of packaged food purchase during
a visit to a mass retail store. Another 27 percent said that they
frequently make such purchases. About three in ten respondents said
they rarely (20 percent) or never (nine percent) purchase packaged
foods at mass retail stores.

     * Older respondents appear less likely to purchase packaged
food at mass retail stores than do younger respondents. One third (32
percent) of those respondents age 55 and older said they rarely (21
percent) or never (nine percent) purchased packaged foods at mass
retail stores, compared to only 25 percent of those respondents aged 18
to 34 who rarely (18 percent) or never (seven percent) purchased such
food items.

     There were no significant regional or income differences in
terms of purchase frequency for packaged foods.

Soda and Juice Purchases

     The survey participants were asked how often they bought
these particular food items at mass retail stores: soda; juice; canned or
dried foods; snack foods; cookies; candy; alcoholic beverages; and baby
food.

     * Of all the food products that were specified in the survey,
soda and juice were the two products most often reported to be "very
likely" to be purchased at mass retail stores. Each product was rated
by 39 percent of the respondents to be a product they would be "very
likely" to buy at a mass retail store.

     * Respondents aged 55 years and older (32 percent) and those
respondents in the northeast (33 percent) showed a slightly lower
tendency to purchase soda.

     * Thirty-four percent of the respondents said they would be
somewhat likely to purchase soda; 26 percent said they were not at all
likely to purchase soda. One percent responded "don't know."

     * Respondents aged 35 to 54 years (36 percent) said they were
slightly less likely to purchase juice at a mass retail store, compared to
those respondents aged 55 years and older (42 percent). Respondents in
the south central region of the U.S. (43 percent), and those with
incomes of less than $20,000, were slightly more likely to purchase
juice.

The Decision To Purchase

     When asked to indicate their typical weekly packaged food
expenditures at mass retail stores, respondents indicated their average
expenditure was slightly less than $32 a week. Forty-four percent of all
respondents, however, indicated that they spend $20 or less in a typical
week for packaged food purchases.

     Respondents in the western region of the U.S. had the largest
weekly expenditures for packaged foods, while single respondents, those
55 years and older, and those in the north central region, spent the least
on average.

     Respondents were asked to characterize their food purchases
as either "planned" or "impulse" purchases. In the categories of both
packaged and prepared food, respondents were more likely to make the
decision to purchase after they were at the stores. Respondents were,
however, significantly more likely to view prepared food purchases as
impulse purchases, as opposed to packaged food purchases.

     Respondents were asked to rate various factors they consider
when deciding to buy food at mass retail stores. Quality was rated the
most important factor by 71 percent of respondents; price was second
most important, with 61 percent of participants citing it as a factor.
Selection of brands was third, at 38 percent; followed by
coupons/special promotions, 34 percent; advertised specials, 33 percent;
availability of specialty foods, 31 percent; and availability of store
brands, 21 percent.

     Females (77 percent) and respondents in the northeast (78
percent) were most likely to rate quality as very important, while males
(64 percent) and those in the west (66 percent) and north central (67
percent) regions were least likely to rate quality as very important.

     Price  was  most important to  18-to-34  year-olds (67 percent),
those with household incomes of less than $20,000 a year (67 percent),
and females (65 percent). Respondents aged 55 years  or  older (52
percent),  those  with  household  incomes of $60,000 or greater (52
percent), and males (56 percent), were least likely to rate the price of an
item as extremely important.

Mass Retail Association (IMRA), phone (703) 841-2300.

MORE COMBINATION GROCERY/MERCHANDISE
STORES OPENED IN 1994, FMI STUDY SHOWS

     Although conventional supermarkets continue to account for
the single largest percentage of food stores in operation, the percentage
of combination grocery/merchandise stores rose significantly in 1994,
according to a new study by the Food Marketing Institute (FMI). The
study, entitled 1995 Facts About Store Development, revealed that in
1994, for the first time, conventional stores accounted for less than half
(48.9 percent) of all stores. The number of combination stores, by
contrast, rose seven percentage points to a 21 percent share.
Superstores continued to represent about 25 percent of food stores,
while warehouse and limited assortment stores accounted for less than
five percent.

     Supermarket construction grew at a modest rate during 1994,
when 3.3 percent of stores were new and 3.4 percent were closed --
figures similar to the previous year. According to FMI, this trend
indicates that new stores continue to replace older ones, rather than
gaining a greater share of the U.S. supermarket mix.

     The median size of new stores was 48,200 square feet in 1994,
up from 38,000 square feet the previous year. This increase was
attributed to the growth in construction of larger-sized combination
stores and superstores. More than six percent of stores underwent
major remodeling during the survey period, with competition cited by
three in 10 survey respondents as the primary reason, and half reporting
that the store needed it. Of the stores that were remodeled, four in 10
were also expanded, by an average of about 5,300 square feet.

COCA-COLA SOLD 3.8 BILLION UNIT CASES
IN U.S. LAST YEAR; FOUNTAIN SALES UP, TOO

     Coca-Cola Co. has reported that 1995 was a record-setting year
for the company, which sold 3.8 billion unit cases of soft drinks and
non-carbonated beverages in the U.S. In addition, for the first time,
Coca-Cola Co. sold one billion unit cases more than any other soft drink
competitor in the country.

     Jack L. Stahl, president of Coca-Cola USA, commented that
"the combined strength of our brand portfolio, our contour packaging
and our bottler system has allowed us to grow twice as fast as the
industry in 1995. We intend to build upon that momentum in 1996."

     Fountain sales contributed significantly to the company's robust
results. Coca-Cola Fountain added more than 500 new chain accounts
and 8,000 net new outlets last year, including the conversion of
competitive outlets such as Steak 'N Shake restaurants and Harrah's
Entertainment, as well as the addition of new outlets owned by existing
customers. According to the company, Coca-Cola products are currently
available in 92 of the top 100 fountain accounts in the U.S., outselling
the leading competitor by a 3-to-1 margin in the channel.

     The company also entered a unique agreement with
Blockbuster Entertainment in 1995, which places Coca-Cola products in
5,000 retail outlets worldwide.

     "We are extremely pleased with our 1995 success, even though
we experienced some disappointments -- losing some volume with
customers like Sbarro's, with some Jack-in-the-Box franchisees or with
Circle K, for example," noted Stahl. "We enter 1996 determined to
capture even more of the industry growth and to do all we can to help
our customers profitably build their soft drink businesses."

     Coca-Cola products are also widely available at recreational
facilities across the U.S., including 90 percent of sports venues, theme
parks and amphitheaters, and 85 percent of movie theaters and zoos.
Entertainment accounts that were added or renewed in 1995 included
the Sony movie theater chain, the Houston and Cincinnati zoos, and the
Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas, Nev.

MAINE BOTTLE BILL WOULD IMPOSE FEES,
PAPERWORK, ON BEVERAGE MAKERS

     The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) has
reported that the Maine Bottle Bill Task Force has proposed legislation
that would require all manufacturers to pay an annual $500 registration
fee to the Maine Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural
Resources if their products are packaged in beverage containers subject
to the state's deposit system. The purpose of the bill is to reduce
fraudulent redemption of containers originating in neighboring states.
The annual fee would be used to pay for the department's enforcement
activities related to the administration of the bottle bill.

     But the proposal goes beyond a mere fee -- it would also create
a new paperwork burden. The bill would require manufacturers to
report:

     (1) each product brand name that requires a deposit;

     (2) the name and address of any distributor the manufacturer
uses to sell the products;

     (3) the number of "filled" beverage containers sold to
distributors in Maine;

     (4) the names and addresses of the manufacturer's third-party
"pick-up agents," which is defined as a person who has assumed the
container pick-up responsibility imposed on the deposit initiator; and

     (5) the number of beverage containers redeemed by the
manufacturer.

     To enforce these requirements, the bill provides the agriculture
department with broad powers to refuse to issue, revoke or suspend the
registration of a manufacturer, which would limit its ability to sell
products in Maine. Any manufacturer failing to register would be fined
$100 per day.

WASHINGTON BEVERAGE INSIGHT via NewsNet
January 26, 1996

1996 BEVERAGE INDUSTRY LEGISLATIVE AGENDA WILL BE SHAPED BY ELECTIONS

As the government affairs specialists for the soft drink and alcoholic
beverage industries shape up their legislative priorities for 1996, the
dominant factor will be the upcoming congressional and presidential
elections.

Neither Congress nor the White House will take any action without
considering its November impact, and this is a recipe for continued and
deepening gridlock with even less accomplished legislatively than in
1995.

Nevertheless, the Washington associations representing the beverage
industry, and industry members active in lobbying, will seek
opportunities to advance their causes whenever possible.

The soft drink industry's highest priority goal is to amend farm
legislation to eliminate or greatly modify the current sugar program.
Opportunities to achieve this goal may be presented in this session of
Congress. (See following story)

Other soft drink industry priorities include: reform of the Delaney
clause, streamlining FDA's food additive approval process and achieving
national uniformity in food labeling. NSDA is working with a food
industry coalition on these objectives.

Delaney clause nullification is contained in the dormant balanced budget
legislation, and its chances for passage grow dimmer. Several bills have
been introduced to improve FDA's food additive approval process--but
none meeting the food industry coalition's requirements.

Action on new legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water Act is possible
in this session, and NSDA is monitoring how it could impact on
bottlers' waste water discharge practices and on control of storm water
runoff.

How reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act could affect the
quality of water available to soft drink plants and its cost is also being
studied should this legislation resurface this year.

Legislation to replace the dollar bill with a dollar coin suffered a setback
at the end of the previous session, but the effort continues despite its
unlikely chances for passage in an election year.

Lesser priorities are given to legislative relief in several tax areas
including estate taxes, Subchapter S Corporate taxes and retaining the
Puerto Rican manufacturing tax credit. National forced deposit
legislation did not make the soft drink legislative priority list for the first
time in decades.

The alcoholic beverage industry had a quiet legislative year mostly spent
monitoring developments. Enough industry support could be generated
in Congress to block adverse legislation on taxes and limitations on
advertising, but not enough was available to generate new initiatives.
The same can be expected in 1996.

With election considerations placing a continuing damper on the
progress of legislation in this Congress, the government affairs
specialists may soon turn their attention to the election campaigns and
their candidates.

This year's elections could be the most decisive for American business
in recent memory. It is a rare opportunity for industry-oriented leaders
to control both houses of Congress and the White House.

If the opportunity is muffed and the pendulum begins to swing back, the
gridlock of 1995-96 may be as close as business will come for a long
time to enacting much needed government reforms.

Because of the importance of the 1996 elections, WBI will expand its
coverage during the year beyond beverage industry issues to issues of
importance to industry in general, particularly as they pertain to the
elections.

SUGAR PROGRAM OPPONENTS AWAIT HOUSE ACTION ON FARM BILL

Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), House Agriculture Committee Chairman, has
scheduled a meeting on Tuesday to consider farm legislation for House
floor action on Wednesday. The coalition to kill or amend the sugar
program is ready to have its amendment offered if the opportunity
arises. (See WBI Nov. 10, 1995)

Immediate legislation is needed because federal programs for corn,
wheat and other grains have expired, and farmers have to know what
program they are operating under before they can begin planting.

Rep. Roberts introduced a comprehensive farm bill on January 9,
incorporating "Freedom to Farm" provisions of the farm bill now stalled
in the balanced budget stalemate, but he has no immediate plans to bring
it to the floor because it has many opponents who would offer a raft of
amendments to it.
With Congress scheduled to recess on Thursday, it is unlikely that any
type of farm legislation could be passed next week. Without legislation,
many crop programs will revert to statutes written in 1938 and 1949
which provided high price supports but restricted plantings. This is
unacceptable to the Administration.

Therefore, farm legislation is likely to be considered when Congress
begins work again in March. If Roberts introduces his full-featured
seven-year farm bill, the coalition against the sugar program again will
be poised to act.

If, however, he introduces a bill only to solve the grain growers'
problems for the next one or two years, he may convince the leadership
to restrict amendments in the interest of passing "emergency" legislation.

SUGAR IMPORT QUOTA IS INCREASED 28%, BUT LITTLE AFFECT ON PRICES
SEEN

Heeding requests from the Sweetener Users Association, USDA has
increased the import quota for raw sugar by 400,000 tons to prevent a
shortage and higher prices, but sugar farmers charged there was no need
for the increase.
U.S. cane sugar refiners, who had complained that the U.S. sugar
program was driving companies out of business, will be helped by the
increase. They predict the quota will have to be increased again later in
the year after USDA monitors sugar supplies and import requirements.

While the current increase is not expected to lower sweetener prices to
industrial sugar users, a further increase in the quota could produce price
reductions.

FDA REQUIRES FAT SUBSTITUTE APPROVED FOR SNACK FOODS TO CARRY
WARNING

Diet soft drinks soon will not be the only snack foods displaying health
warnings. Olestra, a substitute for conventional fats developed by
Procter & Gamble and approved for snack food use this week by FDA,
will carry the warning:

"This Product Contains Olestra. Olestra may cause abdominal cramping
and loose stools. Olestra inhibits the absorption of some vitamins and
other nutrients. Vitamins A, D, E, and K have been added."

P&G will use the fat substitute in its Pringle potato chips expected to be
on the market within nine months, and license it under the name
"Olean" to other companies including PepsiCo's Frito-Lay which plans
a test marketing.

Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science in the
Public Interest predicted that olestra "in the short run will certainly
cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal problems, and in the long run almost
certainly will cause cancer, heart disease and blindness for many who
consume it regularly."

The Center can be expected to wage a continuing campaign to reverse
FDA's approval, which came after three decades of development and
testing by P&G at a cost estimated to be more than $200 million.

FDA took the unusual step of requiring the company to conduct more
tests of the product's long-term safety. The agency will review its
approval within 30 months, and could revoke it "if there is no longer a
reasonable certainty of no harm" from olestra's use.

CLINTON'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH GIVES REPUBLICANS WAKE-UP
CALL

If anyone ever bearded the lion in its own den, President Clinton did it
to the Republicans in his State of the Union Message delivered Tuesday
in the House of Representatives, den of the "in-your-face" freshmen.

The President began the speech sounding like an anti-big-government
Republican, ended the speech giving something to everybody like a
Democrat, nailed the Republicans for closing down the government, and
won bi-partisan applause for the job his wife is doing as First Lady.

Forced by Republican budget constraints to avoid promises of significant
new government programs, a staple for Democratic messages, he
advocated only the popularly-rated issues on which Democrats of all
stripes agree.

While the President's speech seemed to unite Democrats, Republican
Candidate Robert Dole's businesslike response to the President drew a
poor second in the ratings, raised again the "charisma" issue, and gave
his Republican presidential opponents ammunition to split the party.

ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES WIN PLACE IN UNITED STATES' DIETARY
GUIDELINES

After considering a barrage of scientific data on alcohol consumption
which suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk of
coronary heart disease, the drafters of the 1995 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans for the first time included a favorable reference to alcoholic
beverages. (See WBI Sept. 8, 1995)

The Guidelines advise moderate alcohol consumption--defined as no
more than one drink a day for women and two a day for men. A drink
is defined as 1.5 ounces of hard liquor, 12 ounces of beer and 5 ounces
of wine. The 1990 Guidelines concluded that alcohol consumption has
no net benefit and "is not recommended."

FAY'S DRUGS: FIT TO BE SWALLOWED?

By:
BY GENE G. MARCIAL

The ``shakeout'' investors--who buy into companies whose industries are in
the throes of consolidation--are convinced that Fay's (FAY), the nation's
13th-largest drugstore chain, is ripe for picking. The shares have dropped
to 7, down from 9 3/8 in late April, partly because of investors'
disappointment that a rumored takeover has not yet materialized. And a
flurry of yearend tax-loss sell-offs may be adding to the downward
pressure.
But the focus, insists one big investor, should be on what's happening to
all drug chains. ``A shakeout in the industry is under way,'' notes analyst
Maurice Levenson of Value Line. This is being fostered, he explains, by the
emergence of managed-health-care plans and stiff competition from giant
discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores and Target Stores. Analysts note the
industry could also shed a lot of duplication and costs by buyouts of
weaker companies. A recent example is Rite Aid's agreement to acquire Revco
for $1.8 billion.
   Fay's--with its sales sluggish, its earnings down, and the stock on the
ropes--is regarded as one of the industry's weak sisters. ``It's similar to
the Revco situation. The likes of such possible suitors as Walgreen's could
swallow it up just like that,'' says investment manager Mike Kicera of MRK
Capital Management.
   Kicera figures that Fay's shares are worth 12 to 15 in a buyout--based
on what Rite Aid agreed to pay for Revco. With 276 outlets in New
Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, Fay's is streamlining its
operations by getting rid of noncore businesses. It sold off Wheels
Discount Auto Supply Div. to Sears Roebuck's Western Auto Supply for $37
million. Management is also expected to unload the 30 Paper Cutter
discount-office-supply stores.
   ``Without Wheels and Paper Cutter, Fay's would be a much more attractive
takeover target,'' says one money manager accumulating shares.
   Providing added inducement for Fay's to sell: Management and directors
own about 31% of the stock--including the holdings of the family of
Chairman Henry Panasci Jr. Fay's didn't return calls.

THE WAY THE OLD RUBBER CRUMBLES

By:
BY GENE G. MARCIAL

Not everything in today's hot IPO market is Internet-related. One issue
that some pros like--GreenMan Technologies (GMTI)--is nowhere near
cyberspace: It's in tire recycling. GreenMan went public on Oct. 3 at 5 a
share. On opening day, the stock jumped to more than 8 and stayed there for
eight trading days--until profit-taking spoiled some of the fun. But some
money managers still think it's worth loading up on GreenMan--now at 6.
   What's the allure of tire recycling? GreenMan uses a patented cryogenic
(low-temperature) technology to make used tires brittle, thus yielding
crumb-rubber granules. These granules are a low-cost source of rubber and
plastic waste, according to one money manager who has a sizable stake.
GreenMan's chief product is a proprietary thermoplastic rubber material
that uses crumbs from discarded tires. GreenMan uses it to produce water
filters, pumps, stereo components, and computer accessories.
   On Dec. 14, Browning-Ferris Industries, a major player in solid-waste
collection and recycling, signed an exclusive contract for GreenMan to
build and operate a crumb-rubber processing facility on Browning's site in
Jackson, Ga. It will convert a minimum of 32,000 tons a year of shredded
tires into high quality crumb rubber. Browning-Ferris may buy an equity
stake in GreenMan, speculates one analyst.
   Revenues for the year ending May 31, 1996, are expected to be $7 million
to $10 million, in part from a $2 million contract with Coca-Cola--for
GreenMan to make display racks of recycled rubber. One analyst sees
GreenMan going into the black in 1996.

CHINA TIRE MAY BE UNDULY DEFLATED

By:
BY GENE G. MARCIAL

On the Big Board, China Tire Holdings (TIR) behaves as if it were a
retread. In early summer, shares of this major Chinese tiremaker were
around 12. They're now at 6, and even Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating
in November to ``neutral'' from an earlier ``buy.'' That's quite a blow:
Morgan Stanley was one of China Tire's major underwriters when it went
public--in July, 1993, at 17 a share. And it owns 5.7% of the stock.
Constantly shifting U.S.-China relations are part of the Street's aversion
to the stock. And there has been concern about China Tire's earnings
predictability.
   But not everyone is down on the stock. Investment manager Bill Harnisch
has been buying since the stock hit 8 in September--and bought even more
when it dropped to 6. How come?
   ``For a company with an estimated book value of more than $15 a share,
the stock is very cheap,'' says Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff, a
New York investment firm managing about $3 billion. And in spite of the
poor performance of most other Chinese tire biggies--caused in part by a
drop in car sales--China Tire's revenues in most of 1995 jumped by more
than 33%, and its earnings grew by 10%, he notes. Harnisch estimates 1995
earnings at 50 cents a share. For 1996, he foresees earnings of 75 cents.
   And then, there is the ``bonanza that we expect China Tire could win
from its lawsuit filed against Goodyear in the U.S.,'' says Harnisch. China
Tire claims that Goodyear interfered with its contract to buy a radial-tire
factory in China owned by Dalian General Rubber Factory: Goodyear bought
the factory instead. Some analysts believe Goodyear Tire & Rubber faces a
$3 billion penalty if it loses the legal fight.

A TOUGH YEAR TO FOLLOW

By:
Edited by Mark N. Vamos

Executives at America's largest public companies see the economy cooling a
bit in the coming year. They're a tad less optimistic than they were this
time last year. Fewer expect growth in gross domestic product to pick up in
1996, and the number anticipating rising unemployment has doubled. But
managers cheer the Fed: Their inflation fears have all but vanished, and
few worry about rising interest rates. A remarkable 91% give Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan high marks, compared with the 26% who applaud Clinton's
handling of the economy.

Survey of 401 senior executives drawn from the BUSINESS WEEK 1000.
Interviews were conducted for BUSINESS WEEK Nov. 30-Dec. 15, 1995 by Louis
Harris & Associates Inc. Previous surveys cited were of 400 senior
executives on Nov. 28-Dec. 5, 1994 and of 402 senior executives Dec. 10-20,
1993.



Optimistic Voices

Overall, how would you characterize your outlook for the U.S. economy in
the next 12 months--would you say you are very optimistic, somewhat
optimistic, somewhat pessimistic, or very pessimistic?

                       1995    1994    1993
Very optimistic          8%     13%      3%
Somewhat optimistic     78%     76%     80%
Somewhat pessimistic    13%     11%     16%
Very pessimistic         0%      0%      1%
Not sure                 1%      0%      0%



Growth Factor

Compared with the last 12 months, do you think the rate of growth of the
gross domestic product will go up, go down, or stay the same over the next
12 months?

                1995    1994    1993
Go up           30%     38%    25%

Stay the same   45%     36%    65%
Not sure         0%      0%     1%



What About Inflation?

Compared with the last 12 months, do you think the rate of inflation, based
on the CPI, will go up, go down, or stay the same over the next 12 months?

               1995    1994    1993
Go up           12%     53%    40%
Go down         15%      6%     5%
Stay the same   73%     40%    55%
Not sure         0%      1%     0%



Tracking Treasuries

Compared with where it is right now, do you think the 30-year Treasury rate
will go up, go down, or stay the same over the next 12 months?

               1995    1994    1993
Go up           24%     57%     67%
Go down         47%     18%      5%
Stay the same   25%     24%     27%
Not sure         4%      1%      1%



The Jobless Rate

Compared with the last 12 months, do you think the unemployment rate will
go up, go down, or stay the same over the next 12 months?

               1995    1994    1993
Go up           35%     17%     21%
Go down         15%     33%     34%
Stay the same   49%     50%    44%
Not sure         1%      0%     1%



The Company Way

And now some questions about your expectations for your company over the
next 12 months. Please give your best estimate. Do you think each of the
following will increase or decrease between now and December, 1996?

                          INCREASE  DECREASE    SAME  NOT SURE
Sales                        89%       4%        5%     2%
Wage and salary rates        85%       3%       10%     2%
Investment in plant

CRUISE CONTROL?
Car sales should remain strong, though high sticker prices are worrisome

By:
By Kathleen Kerwin and Keith Naughton in Detroit


Peter Dirisamer may not drive home a new car in 1996. Dirisamer, 37, an
Elmhurst (Ill.) technical writer, wants to replace his family's 1988
Plymouth Horizon subcompact. But with average new-car prices pushing
$20,000, he's not finding much he can afford. ``Detroit expects me to pay
$20,000 for the average four-door sedan?'' he sniffs. ``I don't think so.''
Instead, he may settle for a used car.
   Consumers such as Dirisamer are the reason Detroit is cautious about its
prospects for the new year. ``Price is the issue with customers,'' says
Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Joseph Phillippi. And with a flood of two- and
three-year-old cars and trucks coming back on the market as their leases
expire--2.3 million in 1996 alone, according to Art Spinella of CNW
Marketing/Research in Bandon, Ore.--consumers are finding plenty of
alternatives to pricey new wheels.
   So Detroit is prepared to idle along at about the same rate as the
overall economy. Auto executives are looking for only a modest improvement
of less than 2% over 1995's U.S. sales of 14.8 million cars and light
trucks. Says General Motors Corp. Chairman John F. Smith Jr.: ``1996 looks
like a good year, not spectacular.''
   Perhaps, too, Detroit is a bit cautious about predicting rosy sales. A
year ago, its optimism had reached fever pitch. But by mid-January,
consumers began to cool on auto buying as they felt the cumulative effect
of interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Sales revived by fits and
starts through 1995, ending about 2.6% behind 1994's pace.
GOOD AS IT GETS? Auto sales should be helped in 1996 by low interest rates,
which make auto loans and lease terms more attractive. A continuing
appetite for American-made trucks, including minivans and sport utilities,
also is in Detroit's favor. And the Big Three are introducing a host of new
models, notably Ford's Escort small car and F-series pickup, GM's new
midsize cars and minivans, and Chrysler's Dodge Dakota pickup.
   Still, other worries loom. PaineWebber Inc. analyst Michael Ward frets
about unsold cars and trucks on dealer lots, which reached a 75-day average
supply late in 1995, 14% above year-ago levels. Ward predicts little change
in sales for 1996: ``This is as good as it's going to get for Detroit.''
   While most on Wall Street predict slightly stronger sales ahead, they
don't expect them to flow straight to the bottom line. Customers are
demanding cash rebates and sweet lease terms on all but the hottest-selling
trucks. Flemington (N.J.) car dealer Steve Kalafer, who owns 23
dealerships, says the only thing selling these days is bargains: ``In a
world full of wonderful products, the consumer is buying the deal.''
   That squeezes auto makers' profit margins. ``The industry's margins are
a disaster for an expansion,'' says Paul Ballew, chief economist for J.D.
Power & Associates Inc. Adding to the uncertainty, Detroit's contracts with
the United Auto Workers expire in September. A spirited debate is expected
about the auto makers' shifting jobs to outside suppliers (box). And
Japanese competitors are hard on Detroit's bumper: introducing snazzy new
vehicles while keeping price increases small.
   Ford's costs of launching its many new vehicles will continue to drag
down profits during the first half of the year, company executives say.
Stockholders remain anxious about the company's strategy of loading on
features to lure import-loving baby boomers at a time when consumers shun
higher sticker prices. Ford also will expand its ambitious global
reorganization--dubbed Ford 2000--by folding South America, New Zealand,
Australia, and Taiwan into its combined North American and European
operations in 1996. J.P. Morgan & Co. analyst David Bradley expects Ford to
earn $3.6 billion, unchanged from 1995, on sales of $123 billion.
   General Motors Corp., which sat out most of 1995 without new models,
launches a series of important vehicles this year. After bungling several
car launches in recent years, it has been working on debugging its
manufacturing process to prepare for the launches. GM is counting on such
entries as the new Chevy Venture minivan, Buick Regal, and Pontiac Grand
Prix to help it regain its footing in crucial market segments. The company
is hoping its falling market share finally has bottomed. Late in the year,
its share edged above 34%, up from lows near 32%. GM will earn $7 billion,
up 17%, on $160 billion of sales, Bradley calculates.
``IDEAL SITUATION.'' Chrysler Corp. management, which just successfully
introduced a new generation of its bread-and-butter minivans, is likely to
spend plenty of time planning for a spring showdown with billionaire
investor Kirk Kerkorian. If Chrysler balks at giving Kerkorian aide Jerome
B. York a board seat, a nasty proxy battle will ensue. Back on the plant
floor, Chrysler is standardizing manufacturing processes and modernizing
older factories. Bradley estimates 1996 Chrysler earnings of $3.1 billion,
up 58% from the depressed 1995 level, on sales of $54 billion.
   Even as Detroit rolls out spiffy new models, its Japanese rivals will
unveil their own new designs. And while a sky-high yen forced them to boost
sticker prices, putting them at a $2,000 to $3,000 per-car price
disadvantage, they've been slashing costs. The 1997 Toyota Camry midsize
sedan is expected to cost as much as $1,000 less than the current car.
``The Japanese manufacturers have not gone away,'' says GM's Smith. ``They
are tough competitors, and they will continue to be.''
   Japan also is expanding its lower-cost U.S. production--and even
stepping up shipments of American-built cars to Japan. ``We are importing,
not only to Japan but to 38 countries, from the U.S.,'' says Nobuhiko
Kawamoto, Honda Motor Co. president and chief executive. ``We intend to
reinforce this plan.'' Even softening in the yen last fall isn't likely to
cause Japan to back off from cost-cutting. Says Ford Chairman Alexander J.
Trotman: ``I doubt very much that they will take their foot off the pedal
just because the yen has slipped back.''
   There is a silver lining to the slackening of 1994's breakneck pace.
Back then, factories were running at maximum overtime, some key parts ran
short, and demand for raw materials renewed some inflationary pressures.
Says Kenneth L. Way, chairman and CEO of Lear Seating Corp. in Southfield,
Mich.: ``I think it's an advantage not to have deep troughs and big
peaks.''
   Instead, the industry may be bumping along on a plateau of 14.5 million
to 15.5 million unit sales annually. ``It's actually an ideal situation,''
says Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton. ``It allows you to get your plants
running at maximum efficiency, get your material flowing nice and evenly,
and really focus on costs and quality.''
   And when it comes to expansion opportunities, the Big Three are casting
their eyes toward the Asia-Pacific region, where they can still turn out
basic cars on a shoestring. ``That is where most of our growth focus will
be in the next 20 years,'' says Ford's Trotman. Chrysler, which has lagged
its Detroit peers abroad, is likely to make some major international moves
this year. The company is talking with a half-dozen potential partners in
India, South America, and Southeast Asia. An alliance with a European auto
maker could also be in the cards.
   Overseas horizons may indeed appear the brightest to Detroit. Especially
if American consumers, such as Illinois car shopper Dirisamer, remain
convinced that new cars cost too much.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Lower interest rates make auto loan and lease payments more
affordable.
   -- A flood of products--Ford's Escort and new pickup and GM's family
sedans--should whet consumer appetites.

Negatives
   -- Cost-cutting and a weaker yen are making the Japanese tougher
competitors than ever.
   -- Price-conscious consumers are demanding deals.

A SHRINKING SUPPLY OF SUPPLIERS

By:
By Kathleen Kerwin and Bill Vlasic in Detroit

American auto makers will rely on fewer parts suppliers in 1996. Ford Motor
Co., for example, has reduced its stable from 10,000 to 2,300--and aims for
1,150 by decade's end. At the same time, Detroit has suppliers building a
larger percentage of the content of its cars than ever.
   What gives? The consolidation is driven by auto makers who lean on
suppliers to provide entire systems for vehicles--an entire dashboard, for
instance, instead of just the ashtray that goes into it. Detroit is handing
off more development responsibility to suppliers, too. This favors those
companies with plentiful capacity, capital, and skills. Smaller players
must merge or lose the business. Some become second- or third-tier
suppliers to the remaining giants.
   The Big Three want global supply networks. A supplier who aspires to
U.S. business in 1996 may have to be able to deliver the same parts to
factories in Germany or Brazil. Among those that analysts say may grow by
acquisition in 1996: Borg-Warner Automotive, Dana, and Lear Seating. Says
TRW Inc. Chairman Joseph T. Gorman: ``There will continue to be massive
[supplier] consolidation as markets that were once national or regional
become global.''
   Big suppliers will end up with some extra burdens. ``The cost pressures
on suppliers are still tremendous,'' says Kenneth L. Way, chairman of Lear
Seating Corp. in Southfield, Mich. ``You have to share engineering costs
and design costs if you're a tier-one [supplier].'' And auto makers keep
demanding price reductions. The focus of supplier ire for 1996 is Ford
purchasing chief Carlos E. Mazzorin, who wants suppliers to cut their
prices by 5% a year.
   Even so, Morgan Stanley & Co. analyst Stephen Volkmann projects
suppliers' earnings will rise 15% to 20% in 1996. Price increases for raw
materials have eased lately, he notes. Suppliers of car parts may suffer
spotty slowdowns, but business in truck components should remain robust.
And Japanese car companies' expansion in the U.S. provides new market
opportunities for the best U.S. suppliers.

THEY'RE HAVING A CAPITAL TIME
Savoring solid demand here, machine makers also are expanding abroad

By:
By Zachary Schiller in Cleveland


Business investment has powered the U.S. economic expansion, and that has
made machinery executives a bunch of happy campers. Shipments of industrial
machinery and equipment were up 12% through October, 1995, from a year
earlier, according to the U.S. Census, surging toward a likely record.
Their plump backlogs almost guarantee another strong year. Says Jeffery T.
Grade, chairman of Milwaukee's Harnischfeger Industries Inc., which makes
equipment for papermaking and mining: ``1996, when all is said and done,
will be a very good year for most industrial manufacturers.''
   While growth and profits won't climb much in 1996, the gains come on top
of a strong base. That's because U.S. manufacturing is itself in good
shape--and companies are convinced that they must invest to stay that way.
``All in all, people are concerned about productivity and being competitive
globally,'' says Daniel J. Meyer, chairman of Cincinnati Milacron Inc.
   A healthy U.S. market should be supplemented by faster market growth
abroad. ``Our biggest opportunity for [profit] leverage is the continued
accelerated growth overseas,'' says Thomas F. McBride, chief financial
officer at Ingersoll-Rand Co. He's especially hopeful for Asia and the
Pacific. Ingersoll is looking to add three joint ventures in China to the
three it already has there, including one that makes industrial air
compressors and another producing rock drills for mining and road-clearing.
ITT Industries Inc.'s Fluid Transfer Div. is putting a warehouse for its
pumps in Santiago, Chile. Milacron, which just started making small
injection-molding machines in a joint venture with an outfit based in
India, hopes to be producing 600 there annually within a few years.
MASS APPEAL. More machinery makers are realizing they have to intensify
global activities to keep their U.S. customers happy. ``When a DuPont or a
Dow says, `I'm building my next plant in China--I need you to step up your
capabilities,' you've got to have mass to cover the world,'' says William
M. Jordan, president of Duriron Co., a Dayton (Ohio) pump and valve maker. 
Partly with that in mind, Duriron recently bought seal maker Durametallic
Corp.
   Also fueling mergers--including Ingersoll-Rand's 1995 takeover of Clark
Equipment Co.--is that stronger balance sheets have left more machinery
makers in a position to make purchases. Indeed, there even have been some
initial public offerings in the once beleaguered machine-tool business,
such as a 1995 IPO by Hardinge Brothers Inc., a fast-growing Elmira (N.Y.)
producer of lathes and machining centers.
   Such has been the strength of machine-tool sales that the average age of
U.S. metalworking equipment began falling in 1994 for the first time in 14
years. The rejuvenation should continue into 1996.
   Even if demand dips next year for a number of machinery makers, existing
orders will provide a cushion. For instance, Alton J. Brann, chairman and
CEO of Western Atlas Inc., notes that an ``exceptional year'' of bookings
means a good outlook for 1996 sales of its Industrial Automation Group. Its
backlog for machining and other systems is up about 50% from the $415
million of a year ago.
   There are some streaks of weakness in this rosy-hued picture. The same
globalization that has U.S. executives rushing to expand abroad means
they're facing more competition. And the same modernization that makes
American manufacturers world-beaters in productivity often has led to
increases in capacity that put a damper on prices.
BUYING MOOD. What's more, there are spotty signs of a slowdown in demand.
Manufacturers' use of their factory capacity fell from 85.1% a year ago to
83.1% in November, 1995. Orders for forklift trucks, industrial air
compressors, and large plastic-molding machines have slowed in recent
months. Demand from the auto industry may taper off, and 1995's sluggish
housing market will probably mean at best a flat market for construction
equipment this year.
   Still, most machinery customers are in a buying mood. Such businesses as
chemicals, paper, metals, and food should still spend smartly. Aerospace
demand is finally rebounding. And one of the biggest stars is likely to be
farm machinery. ``The underlying fundamentals for farm equipment have never
been stronger,'' says Ted French, chief financial officer of Case Corp.,
citing strong farm income and the lowest carryover of grain stocks in 30
years. For machinery makers, the wheels are turning for a solid 1996.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Outsourcing by big companies means job shops will be buying
equipment.
   -- With manufacturers concerned about global competition, they will
continue placing orders for machinery.

Negatives
   -- There's still too much worldwide capacity in sectors such as pumps
and machine tools, keeping prices down.
   -- Automotive capital spending will flatten out in 1996.

METALS NEED A FEW SUPPORT BEAMS
For steelmakers, falling prices and labor issues loom large in '96

By:
By Stephen Baker in Pittsburgh


At the dawn of 1995, Matthew Botsford, chairman of World Class Steel, was
confidently raising money to build a $450 million minimill near Pittsburgh.
If anyone epitomized America's resurgence in the steel industry, it was
Botsford, an entrepreneur who had built a successful $20 million
steel-finishing business and was following in the footsteps of Andrew
Carnegie.
   These days, Botsford is an ex-executive. He's suing his old
company--after being ousted during a November board meeting and whisked
from the building by a security guard. His project had the backing of
banks, suppliers, and the state government. But Botsford had trouble
convincing equity investors--and ultimately his board--that a new minimill
could make money in a climate of falling steel prices.
   In the end, Botsford fell with a tumbling steel market. In 1995, as
demand dropped from 114 million to 110 million tons, prices plummeted, too:
Flat-rolled steel plunged from $440 to $355 per ton. Other products, such
as structural beams, thrived. But because flat-rolled is widely used in
cars, appliances, and other products, it accounts for half of steel sales
and defined the year. ``When we cut flat-rolled prices, it was on page A1
[of the paper],'' laments Nucor Corp. President John D. Correnti. ``When we
raised prices of structurals, it was on C4.''
WILD CARD. The industry could wind up on page one again this year, with
even worse news. Executives see unchanging demand in 1996. A lower level of
inventories to start the year will help avoid a replay of 1995's heavy
price-cutting. But new steelmaking capacity coming onstream will put
further downward pressure on prices, especially in the commodity grades of
steel. ``The low end of the market is going to be tough for a while,'' says
Roy G. Dorrence, vice-president for operations at U.S. Steel Group.
   The wild card this year is overseas. U.S. producers hope strong growth
in China will translate into a buying binge reminiscent of 1993. But the
key factor for 1996 will be Europe. It was a vital prop under American
steel during the first half of 1995--but then buckled at midyear. If a weak
European economy prompts producers there to step up exports, cheap European
steel could undercut U.S. producers' prices and lead to fresh trade
squabbles.
   The biggest problem for U.S. producers is homegrown, however. Before
last year's price drop, a minimill-building boom was well under way. The
new mills could add 12 million tons of low-cost flat-rolled steel to
production capacity in 1996 and 1997 combined. That's nearly five times the
capacity added in 1995. If flat-rolled could crash last year in a
relatively strong economy, what will happen to the market in a downturn,
especially when new mills come onstream? ``That's when we'll have our death
spiral,'' predicts PaineWebber Inc.'s Peter Marcus, who expects lower
profits in 1996 and an even greater crash later this decade.
STRIKE BAN. As if economic prospects weren't intimidating enough, labor
questions loom. Most integrated companies face mid-contract
wage-and-benefit negotiations in 1996. Strikes or lockouts are prohibited.
But concessions granted by arbitrators could eat into earnings.
Job-security clauses in these contracts limit the big mills' power to cut
labor costs. Instead, the producers improve yields by tweaking the
technology. In the past three years, they have added 4 million tons--the
equivalent of Nucor's entire flat-rolled production--through this so-called
capacity creep. Log one more factor in an eventual glut.
   With a world oversupply, steel faces a dilemma just like the one U.S.
aluminum makers wrestled with early in the decade. But aluminum companies,
swamped with cheap Russian metal, shuttered 30% of production and
negotiated an OPEC-style allotment plan. Prices recovered smartly in 1995,
as massive world inventories shrank by 75%. U.S. demand rose 5%, with sales
rising to 15.5 billion pounds. Aluminum looks strong again in 1996, led by
a recovery in aerospace demand. But can prices remain firm if aluminum
makers reopen shuttered smelters? For now, executives don't even mention
the possibility, for fear of spooking the market.
   In the face of such difficult markets, metal industries are more and
more battling to take business away from one another. Auto hoods,
tailpipes, and even beer cans are among the contentious areas. And if
unexpectedly slow growth in China, Europe, or the U.S. brings about a steel
glut ahead of schedule, the metal wars could grow very nasty.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Demand for steel remains hearty.
   -- World inventories of aluminum have fallen 80% in the past 1 1/2
years.
   -- China may return as a big customer of American steel.

Negatives
   -- New steel capacity coming onstream is undermining prices.
   -- With higher aluminum prices, producers may restart idle smelters.
   -- Labor concessions could hurt steel earnings.

READY-ALL JOIN ARMS
Cash-Rich and eager to merge, defense companies are thriving

By:
By Eric Schine in Los Angeles


Financially speaking, small has been beautiful for the defense industry.
For two years, defense companies have produced record profits and soaring
stock prices while merging into a smaller, more efficient industry with
fewer, bigger players. Year three of Operation Consolidation will bring
even more mergers. ``Everybody is talking to everybody,'' says C. Michael
Armstrong, chief executive of GM Hughes Electronics Corp.
   Driving the consolidation is a persistent squeeze by the Pentagon. In
1996, procurement outlays should shrink an additional 9%, to $49.7
billion--a drop of nearly 50% from the 1987 peak spending year. And despite
years of contraction, the industry must still reduce capacity by as much as
40% over the next several years, according to Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst
with BT Securities Corp. Arms exports will help, as the industry's share of
the world market, now about 52%, should grow modestly. But the biggest
gains may be logged by companies pushing forward in promising commercial
ventures, some based on defense technology.
   Leading the consolidation charge will be a handful of large contractors.
Analysts predict at least one more merger on the scale of last year's
Lockheed Martin Corp. marriage, which created a $23 billion giant.
Companies have built cash hoards as a result of cutting costs even faster
than the Pentagon reduced spending, leaving GM Hughes, Litton, Loral, and
others poised to buy.
MARRIAGE-MINDED. Makers of missiles, electronics, and airframes are in
demand. Raytheon Co. purchased the fast-growing E-Systems last year for
$2.3 billion and could easily spend an additional $1 billion in 1996. GM
Hughes, with some $5 billion in buying power, could swallow the defense
portfolio of a TRW or a Rockwell International, each accounting for about
$3 billion in annual sales. But virtually every industry sector will
attract shoppers. In 1995, General Dynamics Corp. paid just $300 million
for Bath Iron Works Corp. and its $2 billion shipbuilding backlog.
   One megadeal, sources say, could combine Boeing Co. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp. That would be a potent combination: McDonnell's $10.1 billion
in government sales with Boeing's 58% stake in the world commercial plane
market. It would solve each company's perennial weakness: Boeing covets
military orders, such as McDonnell's recent $18 billion award for C-17
transport planes. And McDonnell needs a commercial partner to counter
Europe's Airbus Industrie and a likely threat from upstart Asian
competitors. Neither company will comment publicly.
   While the big companies attract most of the attention, the
mergers-and-acquisitions market among smaller suppliers is likely to be no
less lively. ``The action is moving down the food chain,'' says Jon Kutler,
principal of the Los Angeles-based Quarterdeck Investments.
HIGH RESOLUTION. Unfortunately for thousands of aerospace and defense
workers, mergers will mean more layoffs. Even after cutting some 1.3
million jobs since the late 1980s, the industry will shrink its workforce
by an additional 30% over the next several years, says Robert D. Paulson, a
consultant with McKinsey & Co. Most of the layoffs will come as second-tier
players bail out or get bought. Two likely candidates: United Technologies
Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft and Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter unit.
   Conglomerates will take advantage of high defense prices to unload
businesses to move in new directions. Westinghouse Electric Corp., for
instance, announced in December that it will sell off its defense
businesses to help finance its recent $5.4 billion acquisition of CBS Inc.
   Entertainment and communications are fueling the defense industry's
greatest commercial success: After surpassing 1 million subscribers in its
first year of operation, Hughes' DirecTV unit has announced plans to expand
its satellite-TV service globally. And a consortium that includes Lockheed
Martin and Raytheon has invested more than $500 million to provide
high-resolution satellite images to real estate agents and farmers,
potentially a $2 billion-plus market.
   Such reassuring signs, together with the consolidation craze, have Wall
Street predicting another year of bulging profits. BT Securities' Demisch
expects defense and aerospace profits to rise at least 15% in 1996, to
about $5 billion. Downsizing is painful, but for those who hang on, the
rewards can be formidable.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Consolidation moves forward: Look for at least one more mega-merger
and continued capacity reduction.
   -- Modest growth in the Pentagon's procurement budget is likely, while
overseas sales could strengthen.

Negatives
   -- Profit margins will be squeezed as stingier contracts kick in. The
lucrative B-2 bomber and F-22 fighter programs may be stretched or killed.

`UNEXCITING MIGHT BE GOOD'
Few surprises in the oil patch. but with profits so healthy, who cares?

By:
By Gary McWilliams in Houston


The oil patch has made its peace with low prices. Relentless restructuring
and cost-cutting are delivering strong cash flow and higher profits despite
anemic pricing. Even in today's oil market, initial public offerings and
secondary stock sales are letting small independents fund new production
and property acquisitions without incurring debt.
   Executives are prepared for more of the same in 1996. ``We don't see
many things out there that look any different to us than 1995,'' says
Timothy C. Headington, chief executive of Headington Oil Co. in Dallas, a
small crude-oil producer that has been steadily expanding with cast-offs
from Exxon, Texaco, and others.
   Most important, there's little evidence that prices will take a spill.
Oil averaged $18.40 a barrel in 1995, and many forecasters expect it to
remain there. ``I see no reason for the 1996 numbers to change by more than
25 cents a barrel,'' insists Robert Gillon, senior analyst at market
watcher John S. Herold Inc. What little encouragement exists is in U.S.
natural-gas prices, which should recover to about $1.80 per thousand cubic
feet--up from $1.48 in 1995. That would put them back around 1994 levels.
STEADY AS SHE GOES. The major oil companies should see their earnings rise
a modest 6% in 1996, thanks to a healthy economy's thirst for more oil,
says Frederick P. Leuffer, senior energy analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co. He
foresees demand growing next year by about 2%. While hardly as robust as
high tech, oils look like a safe haven. ``It's lackluster and sort of
unexciting right now,'' says Leuffer. ``But unexciting might be good'' were
the Dow to reverse course.
   There are a couple of iffy assumptions in this steady-as-she-goes
outlook. The biggest is that OPEC, which has suffered a steady loss of
world oil market share, continues to accept the losses. Some analysts are
concerned that OPEC countries may attempt to regain share by boosting their
production. Or that Iraq may return with significant new supplies. For now,
neither seems likely.
   Even if prices were to drop, restructuring and new technology have made
U.S. oil companies more able to cope. The best are finding fresh ways of
exploring and managing. A money-saving technique pioneered by Amoco Corp.
and Royal Dutch/Shell Group: pooling their assets in low-profit production
regions. The two are forming a joint company to merge West Texas and New
Mexico operations--and slash overlapping costs.
3-D IMAGING. Technology continues to lower costs, too (chart). Vastar
Resources Inc., a 1993 spin-off of Arco's U.S. oil and gas operations, says
its exploratory wells now hit pay dirt 60% of the time--as a result of
technologies such as three-dimensional seismic imaging--compared with only
47% of the time using older techniques. What's more, says CEO Michael E.
Wiley, ``I think there will be some creative ways [cost-cutting] can
continue.''
   With expenses falling, prices don't have to rise much for production
increases to flow straight to the bottom line. Next year's outlook is for a
solid 7% rise in crude-oil production--with even higher increases for
Texaco, Amoco, and Shell. Texaco, which hasn't boosted production for
nearly a decade, predicts a 40% production rise within five years, thanks
to rich prospects in the North Sea, Latin America, and China.
   While petrochemicals were the big contributor to last year's heady
profits at Phillips Petroleum Co. and Amoco, prices have softened--as
supply has caught up with demand. The question now: Will China, a huge
buyer that withdrew from the market in 1995, return in 1996? Bob Gower,
chief executive at chemical maker Lyondell Petrochemical Co., predicts
China's return could mean a second leg to the chemical boom. ``All the
information we have suggests we're not at the end of the cycle, but in a
transition period,'' he says.
   Retailing should continue to deliver profits, too. Continued reshuffling
of gasoline outlets--as companies concentrate on specific markets--has
turned the cyclical business into a reliable profit center. ``We're seeing
retail margins better than any time in history,'' says James E. Acridge,
CEO of Giant Industries Inc., a Scottsdale (Ariz.) refiner and
Southwest-area retailer. For years, stock analysts urged Giant to quit the
business. No longer. ``We're smart guys all of a sudden,'' he says. Stable
prices and lower costs are making a lot of people look smart these days.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Firmer gas pricing and savings from corporate restructurings should
produce stable profits.
   -- Advances in technology are lowering costs for exploration and
drilling.
   -- Gasoline retailing profit margins are at historic highs.

Negatives
   -- Petrochemical profits may soften further, cutting refining margins.
   -- OPEC could seek to recoup markets from non-OPEC suppliers.

A TIME TO REAP GLOBAL REWARDS
With demand and output growing, the U.S. could again dominate world
markets

By:
By Greg Burns in Chicago


Corn and soybean farmer Robert Mullins doesn't get excited too easily. But
from where he sits on an 1,800-acre spread in rural Shabbona, Ill., the
export outlook is cause for celebration: ``Spectacular,'' he says. ``It's
really coming alive.''
   The next year could bring an export bonanza for Mullins and other
farmers, as U.S. agriculture begins dominating world markets again. The
U.S. share of agricultural trade will rise to about 21% in 1996 after
falling as low as 16.7% in 1986. The value of U.S. exports will push up to
nearly $60 billion (chart), thanks to booming demand, reduced global trade
barriers, and a more competitive U.S. Farm Belt. U.S. farmers have long
considered exports the missing link in their pursuit of higher prices: ``If
Mother Nature cooperates, and we get a good crop, we could have the full
package for a change,'' says Mullins.
   In 1995, Mother Nature had other ideas. Heavy rains delayed spring
planting through much of the Midwest grain belt. Two months later, a summer
heat wave baked the earth rock hard. Then a killing frost in late September
put a chill on the autumn harvest. With the crop stunted and plagued by
disease, production of corn plunged from 10 billion bushels in 1994 to 7.3
billion in '95, sending U.S. corn stockpiles to 20-year lows. For the year,
corn futures prices had soared 51% as of Dec. 14, soybeans 31%, and wheat
25%. Big rewards went to farmers who produced decent crops in spite of the
weather, then held out for the best prices late in the year. But predicting
such explosive rallies can be tricky: ``With our reserves of feed grains at
historic lows, it makes the markets more volatile,'' says Patrick H. Arbor,
chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade.
SHRINKING SET-ASIDES. Still, the near-term trend is positive: Supplies have
tightened at a time of heavy demand, especially from Asia. Spending by the
Japanese, the largest importers of U.S. agricultural products, will reach
$11.3 billion in 1996, up from $10.5 billion in 1995, according to
projections from the U.S. Agriculture Dept. South Korea and China,
benefiting from robust economies, will increase imports as well. U.S. red
meat, fruit, and vegetables, along with grain, will be sought-after
commodities. ``We have tremendous export-market potential,'' says analyst
David C. Nelson of NatWest Securities Corp. in New York.
   U.S. farmers will be planting fence post to fence post this year. As of
mid-December, the government appeared to be all for it: Proposed reforms
would eliminate annual set-aside programs that support prices by idling
cropland. Instead of paying farmers not to farm, the government would
provide fixed payments, shrinking each year, based on how much they
received in the past. With this change, the amount of corn, wheat, and
soybean acreage in production should jump by about 10% in the coming
season, analysts estimate. As the reforms stood at the end of '95, they
would have little effect on cotton, rice, sugar, peanut, and dairy farmers,
who would retain key subsidies.
   The additional land for grain crops will be a modest plus for fertilizer
companies such as IMC Global, Freeport-McMoRan, and Potash. But the biggest
potential for those companies lies overseas. In China, for example, average
grain yields run about 50% behind those of the U.S. Yet rapid economic
growth has the huge Chinese population clamoring for a better diet. The
simplest way to boost yields: more fertilizer. The less developed world
will be pouring on the potash, says Wendell F. Bueche, chief executive
officer of IMC. ``There's nothing more dangerous than hungry people. You've
got to keep your population well-fed,'' he says.
   Other nations' efforts to improve farming techniques won't threaten U.S.
market share right away. Greater use of fertilizer, pesticide, and hybrid
seed, as well as increased mechanization, could level the playing field
someday. But the U.S. retains a big advantage in low-cost production. And
the demand is huge. China's consumption is projected to grow even faster
than its yields. And the former Soviet Union--a potentially huge
competitor--has seen its output crash along with the rest of its economy
over the past five years, with no comeback in sight.
   Even if the U.S. produces a bumper crop in 1996, many bins will remain
empty: ``We're not going to be flush with supply for at least several
growing seasons,'' predicts Daniel W. Basse of the AgResource consultancy
in Chicago. For the rest of this decade, the world will be depending on
U.S. farmers.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- With world grain supplies at record lows and a farm bill that
encourages greater production, U.S. farmers will plant fence post to fence
post.
   -- Export demand for agricultural products will soar.

Negatives
   -- With less government protection, farmers will be vulnerable to trade
problems.
   -- Uncertainty over the Farm Bill could complicate planting plans.

IT'S A GOOD YEAR TO GET HITCHED
'96 could be tough, so papermakers will continue to merge

By:
By Seanna Browder in Seattle


For a few crazy months early in 1995, making paper was akin to printing
money. As demand outran supply, prices for white paper took their most
dramatic leap since World War II. The jump of 38% per ton in Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.'s paper and paperboard composite index drove up profits an
estimated 180% for 1995 at the 19 largest wood and paper companies. As
paper executives tell it, the temptation to add new capacity was almost
unbearable. But remembering a binge that turned to bust earlier in the
decade, they resisted. ``The memories are still fresh of what it feels like
in a down cycle with too much capacity,'' says Lynn Michaelis, Weyerhaeuser
Co.'s director of marketing and economic research.
   Good thing. Fearing ever-higher prices, customers stockpiled paper. By
summer, the bloated inventories undermined the sky-high prices, and they
tumbled an average of 11%. Even without big new investments, the American
Forest & Paper Assn. expects production capacity for pulp and paper to rise
3% in 1996, largely because of efficiency improvements. And that may be
enough to push prices down, says Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Sherman Chao.
Chao predicts that prices of pulp and paper could decline as much as 19% in
1996 on steady volume. This spells lower profits, though nothing resembling
the industry's dive in the early '90s.
   Without any hope for booming demand, expect paper and pulp companies to
spend 1996 cleaning up balance sheets or plowing ahead with industry
consolidation. ``In our business, it is more favorable to buy assets than
build new plants,'' says John A. Georges, International Paper Co.'s chief
executive.
ELECTION YEAR. Acquisitions already are rolling. Kimberly-Clark Corp.
gobbled up Scott Paper Co. for $9.4 billion in December. Earlier in the
year, International Paper agreed to buy Federal Paper Board for $3.5
billion, and paid $1.15 billion for a controlling stake in Carter Holt
Harvey, New Zealand's largest timber-plantation owner. Boise Cascade sold
its Rainy River Forest Products unit to Canada's Stone-Consolidated and
acquired a 6.4% interest in Stone. In 1996, look for plenty more deals, as
the powerhouses buy slices of global markets and extend their reach over
raw materials.
   As the year begins, demand for white paper is lolling at 7% below
year-ago levels. Demand should recover smartly in 1996, especially in
coated papers used in glossy advertising, which should be bolstered by a
Presidential election and the Atlanta Olympics. ``The coated grades are
holding their own,'' says Paul C. Latta, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie in
Seattle. Newsprint, though, which climbed 40% in price from 1994 to 1995,
could be headed for a fall. Inventories are at record levels, and high
prices are dampening demand.
   Recycling should continue to attract much of the growth in the pulp
industries. Minimills, which convert old cardboard into pulp, are
proliferating as such companies as Weyerhaeuser and Boise Cascade Corp.
expand. Recycled materials should jump 26% in 1996, while production of
marketwood pulp--the product of virgin wood chips--rises just 0.3%,
according to the American Forest & Paper Assn. The extra pulp will go into
producing more linerboard, kraft paper, and corrugated paper, creating a
plentiful supply of those products and damping their prices, says Larry
Katz of Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore.
HOUSEBOUND. The lumber industry, meanwhile, is struggling against competing
materials and a surge of imports. Canadian lumber now accounts for around
35% of the U.S. market, up from 28% in 1989. At the same time, growing
numbers of builders are substituting steel for wood, with steel-frame
housing growing from 500 to 80,000 houses in the past four years. And total
housing starts will rise only modestly in 1996, to around 1.4 million. All
that should spell a continued slump in lumber prices.
   Meanwhile, the wood industry will press ahead with such promising
engineered products as oriented strand board, a cheap new kind of
fiberboard. By 1998, there should be over 7 billion feet of oriented strand
board capacity, up from zero in 1988, estimates L. Pendleton Siegel, CEO of
Potlatch Corp., based in San Francisco. This should claim fully 50% of the
fiberboard capacity, prompting a brawl. ``There's going to be a bloody
market for the next two years,'' says Siegel. So don't be surprised to see
a few of the losers get gobbled up by the industry giants.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Demand for coated paper used in advertising should be bolstered by
the Presidential election and Olympic Games.
   -- Producers avoided bringing on fresh capacity when prices soared.

Negatives
   -- Mills making cheap, new engineered wood products will prompt a brawl
in the fiberboard market.
   -- The lumber industry faces intense competition from Canadian
producers.

THE WEB KEEPS SPREADING
The new market should grow 100% and create even greater opportunities

By:
By Neil Gross, with Amy Cortese, in New York


Netscape Navigator. Java. Yahoo. These pioneering products and services for
using the World Wide Web--and their creators--stole the headlines in 1995.
But Web software is still just a blip on the software radar screen. In
1996, Web-related programs--from browsers such as the Navigator to
``firewalls'' that protect corporate data--will be worth less than 1% of
the $100 billion-plus global software market, says Hambrecht & Quist Inc.
analyst J. Neil Weintraut (chart).
   What the numbers don't show, however, is the subterranean shock wave the
Web has sent across the software industry. Not only is the potential
huge--with annual growth of 100%, sales of Internet programs could hit $4
billion in 2000, Weintraut reckons--but the rush of millions of PC users
into cyberspace could change every aspect of the software business. The
race to cater to cybernauts has unleashed the biggest epidemic of startup
fever seen in years. And companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle are
now scrambling to make the Internet part of their core strategies.
   Once again, the software industry is exuberantly reinventing itself.
Indeed, the Internet revolution comes as growth in other software
categories is slowing. Sales of mainframe programs have been bumping along
at single-digit growth rates, and Anthony Picardi, a group vice-president
at International Data Corp., figures the $19.3 billion mainframe software
market will grow less than 2% over the next four years, to $19.6 billion in
1999.
READY TO JUMP. The huge market for personal computer office
``suites''--collections of programs that include spreadsheets, word
processing, and presentation graphics programs--is also reaching
saturation. But sales are poised for a 20% cyclical jump in 1996, as
millions of PC users upgrade to Windows 95, predicts Goldman, Sachs & Co.
analyst Rick G. Sherlund. The hottest market will remain software for
so-called client-server computing--which should grow at 40%, he figures.
   All told, says IDC's Picardi, the global market for packaged
software--about 75% of it made in America--will grow 10% in 1996, to $102
billion. The number would be bigger if not for mainframe software, which
makes up nearly 20% of worldwide sales. ``Other industries would die for a
similar growth rate,'' Picardi says.
   And what about the new ``Webware''? In 1995, businesses set up Web sites
like periscopes, to see what was going on. This year, as they toy with the
idea of electronic commerce across the Net, many companies will start using
internal Web sites as windows into their own networks--creating
``intranets.'' Says analyst Rich Edwards at Robertson, Stephens & Co. in
San Francisco: ``Every software company will have to participate.''
   No question, intranets are coming. Corporate computer managers
increasingly see Web pages as a means to inexpensively publish and share
information internally. This is very much what Lotus Development Corp. had
in mind with Notes, a ``groupware'' program that helps teams of employees
share documents or business applications simultaneously over a network. On
the Net, much of this can be done on shared Web ``pages''--for a fraction
of what it costs to buy, install, and customize Notes. Lotus, acquired by
IBM for $3 billion last summer, is furiously rejiggering Notes for the
Net.
   Meanwhile, Web software startups--including Netscape Communications
Corp.--can cash in. Companies such as Cambridge (Mass.)-based Vermeer
Technologies Inc. and OpenMarket Inc. should do a brisk business selling
software that helps companies build and maintain Web sites.
   The Web is also driving demand for new programming tools such as
object-oriented software languages. Versant Object Technology in Menlo
Park, Calif., ParcPlace-Digitalk in Sunnyvale, Calif., and Steven P. Jobs's
NeXT Computer are tailoring their programs--which let programmers build
software from reusable chunks of code--to run across the Internet. The
upshot: Sales of object-oriented programs should double from this year's
$300 million, according to IDC.
   This explosion of Web activity has forced most software giants to
rethink their game plans. Microsoft Corp. is building Internet links into
all of its software products, from office suites to operating systems, and
the software giant is licensing Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming
language. IBM has also made the Internet a priority: Big Blue has created
an Internet software unit. Oracle is offering a family of Web programs,
including a ``browser'' and Web versions of its database software.
   One reason industry executives and analysts gush over cyberspace: It is
one of the few domains where Microsoft is not dominant. A quick look at the
packaged software market explains why that matters. Most of this year's
growth in office suites will go directly to Microsoft, which owns about 90%
of the $3 billion market. In addition, a large portion of multimedia
CD-ROMs sold this year will be Microsoft titles. Goldman's Sherlund figures
Microsoft's net will hit $2.2 billion in calendar 1996--up 20% over last
year--on sales of $8.7 billion, up 16%.
SOUPED UP. Another place where Microsoft has not been able to dominate is
client-server computing. In 1996, big corporations will continue to
downsize their computer operations from mainframes to networks of
servers--usually souped-up PCs or Unix workstations--and PC ``clients.'' In
the process, they'll pump billions of dollars into client-server databases
from Sybase, Informix, and industry leader Oracle, whose sales will jump
40% in 1996, to $4.9 billion, predicts Sherlund.
   Microsoft is far from discouraged in client-server software. A server
version of Windows NT is replacing Unix on many corporate networks and the
software giant expects strong sales in 1996 from its long-awaited
relational database upgrade, called SQL Server 6.0. It is expected to sell
for a fraction of the price of Oracle, Sybase, and Informix programs. And,
Microsoft plans to package SQL Server with other server programs, such as
systems management packages, and offer the bundles at steep discounts.
   Mainframe software vendors have also hopped on the client-server
bandwagon. Take Computer Associates International Inc. The Islandia (N.Y.)
software maker's revenue from client-server software grew 79% in the first
half of 1995 from a year earlier, while mainframe software sales--still 70%
of the company--grew just 18%.
   Continued corporate downsizing is another boon to software makers.
Having already stripped away layers of middle managers, many large
companies are trying to squeeze out further efficiencies. One way is to
junk disparate computer systems that run various operating units.
``Integrated enterprise software,'' supplied by the likes of SAP, Baan, and
Oracle, does the job (box). Another way to boost efficiency: automating
customer support. Newly public companies such as Vantive, Clarify, and
Remedy have software that creates electronic files, or ``cases,'' from each
customer query or complaint. Later, anyone in sales, marketing, or customer
support can call up the entire history of the transaction. Hambrecht &
Quist's Weintraut figures sales of such ``customer interaction systems,''
roughly $400 million in 1995, could grow to $3 billion by 2000.
   Merger mania swept through software in 1995 and is likely to continue in
1996. Computer Associates bought Legent, IBM bought Lotus and, in December,
SoftKey International Inc. pulled off a hostile deal to take over Learning
Co. On Dec. 20, Informix Corp. bid for Illustra Information Technologies.
But, with the Net spawning new startups every day, for every company that
gets merged out of existence, two new ones are bound to appear.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Windows 95 will spark demand for educational, entertainment, and
business software.
   -- Businesses are rushing onto the Web, spawning markets such as digital
commerce.

Negatives
   -- Diversity in desktop software will shrink as Microsoft's clout grows
and Apple's shrinks.
   -- Heavy discounting of software suites--and growing development
costs--will make life harder for small players.

YOUR DATA SHOULD MEET MY DATA

By:
By Neil Gross in New York, with Gail Edmondson in Paris

Hark back to the old days in the computer industry--about two years ago. A
salesperson at Digital Equipment Corp. could drill down in a company
database to fish out technical specs for a customer. But the data produced
might not match what a Digital inventory manager kept separately on her
desktop computer, resulting in annoying delays while users cross-checked
their information.
   That's why Digital and dozens of other companies are hot on so-called
``integrated enterprise software.'' The idea is to junk all the old
``legacy'' systems that separately handle a large company's customer
orders, inventory, shipping, and logistical information, and replace them
with a single set of programs to run the company. That way, all the data
look the same, regardless of who's tapping in or where they work.
   Large multinationals already have installed billions of dollars' worth
of these systems. This has flooded the coffers of industry leaders SAP in
Germany and Baan in Holland. Americans missed the first wave, but now
Oracle Corp., Microsoft Corp., and others are plunging in. The sector is
poised to grow 14% worldwide, to $11.1 billion in 1996, according to
International Data Corp.
   The market for related services is a gold mine, too. Deloitte & Touche's
consulting arm rakes in $200 million a year advising SAP customers. It's
``a phenomenal success,'' says Darvis Cormier, a D&T international
director.
   Such services don't come cheap: A switchover can cost a large
manufacturer $100 million, making it ``the most expensive systems decision
a company has ever made,'' says Dick J. Fishburn, chief information officer
of Digital, which is installing SAP software.
    And if your company buys such a system, your integration problems
aren't instantly solved, warns Vinnie Mirchandani, an analyst with Gartner
Group, based in Stamford, Conn. He calls enterprise systems ``a 40%
solution masquerading as a 100% solution.'' Still, a 40% solution is better
than none. And that should put plenty of wind underneath the wings of
software and services companies in this hot niche.

THIS YEAR, SERVERS WILL BE KING
PCs are everywhere. Now the spotlight is on machines that can link them

By:
By John W. Verity in New York


For more than a decade now, the computer industry has been driven by a
vision of giving everyone his or her own computer. Large organizations have
rushed to put a PC onto every desktop and stopped expanding their budgets
for mainframes. Engineers switched in droves from sharing minicomputers to
running their own workstations. Families have scooped up millions of PCs,
too, for use in home offices and to entertain the kids.
   Now, with personal computers seemingly everywhere, the spotlight is
shifting back to larger computers--the kind that can do work for many
different people at once. Collectively known as network servers--everything
from souped-up PCs selling for $10,000 to mainframes and
supercomputer-class systems costing millions--big iron will be in for the
most technical change and competitive action during 1996 and the following
few years. ``Servers are regaining their place as the fulcrum of business
computing,'' says Gregory Garry, analyst at Dataquest Inc. ``They're the
centerpiece of the network.''
   Servers also remain the sweet spot of the computer market, offering
gross margins of 30% to 50%, vs. the 15% or less seen in PCs. ``Servers are
clearly the healthiest segment of the computer industry,'' says Laura
Conigliaro, computer analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. In corporations,
small servers store files and move E-mail for departments. Giant servers
can act as data warehouses--massive libraries of detailed product, sales,
and financial information gathered from across an organization's many other
computers. The World Wide Web, with close to 100,000 servers in place and
hundreds more being attached every week, is also a major contributor to
server demand.
PRICE-CUTTING. All told, International Data Corp. (IDC) estimates that
shipments of servers based on PCs--machines using Intel chips or souped-up
versions of Apple's Macintosh--will grow 35%, to 1.05 million units, from
777,000 in 1995. Shipments of servers based on proprietary hardware
designs, from companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Sun Microsystems
Inc., will increase about 15% in 1996.
   At the same time, PC sales will remain strong. Dataquest estimates that
U.S. consumption of PCs in 1996 will hit 25.6 million units, up 16% from
1995 (chart). Worldwide consumption will grow by 19%, to 68.7 million
units. Price-cutting will stunt growth in dollar terms: IDC reckons total
U.S. spending on PCs will be up only 12.6% over 1995.
   The news in other categories is mixed. Workstation shipments are
projected to grow from 847,000 units in 1995 to 982,500 units in 1996.
Sales of IBM-compatible mainframes will fall, from $7.5 billion in 1995 to
$7.1 billion in 1996, as a line of cheaper machines based on
microprocessors grows more popular.
THE PREFAB FOUR. Although booming, the server market may be in for some
jarring changes in 1996, thanks to Intel Corp. Along with its new
top-of-the-line P6, or Pentium Pro, microprocessor, Intel has launched a
complete circuit board containing four P6 chips. This Quad P6 board is
designed specifically as a building block for low-cost servers. Like the
prefabricated motherboards from Intel that helped relatively small Packard
Bell and Gateway 2000 beat IBM and Compaq to market with the first
Pentium-based PCs, the Quad P6 board could put lots of new players into the
server business overnight and change the market's economics. Bottom line:
Margins will begin to resemble those of the cookie-cutter desktop-PC
market.
   Intel's Quad P6 won't just affect the low end of the server business.
Companies such as Sequent Computer, Chen Systems, and Data General plan to
gang as many as a dozen of the boards together to produce systems that can
outperform traditional mainframe computers for a fraction of the cost.
PaineWebber Inc. computer analyst Stephen K. Smith figures that P6-based
servers will sell for less than half the price of proprietary servers at
the same performance level. It's ``one of the most significant hardware
developments to impact the computer industry since Compaq cloned the IBM
PC,'' he says.
   Luckily for HP, Sun, and other companies making non-Intel-based servers,
Quad P6-based machines won't start shipping in volume until late 1996, and
there will be a lag before software can be readied to take advantage of
them. But the warning shots have been fired for another major battle in an
industry that seems to thrive on turmoil.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- As computers get cheaper, they will become even more central to the
economy.
   -- Electronic commerce is fueling demand for high-capacity Web servers.

Negatives
   -- Standardized parts and designs will gnawat the profitability of
midrange and large computers.
   -- Personal-computer makers will feel more pressure from Intel's gradual
entry into PC manufacturing.

SILICON GOES FROM PEAK TO PEAK
In a boom that could last a decade, turning out enough chips is the big
problem

For the companies that plant those teensy transistors on the silicon chips
from which personal computers and other electronic gadgets sprout, 1996
shapes up as the fourth consecutive year of 20%-plus growth--26%, according
to the Semiconductor Industry Assn. That's remarkable. Chipmaking has long
gyrated through boom-and-bust cycles every three years or so. And while
growth in 1996 won't match 1995's spectacular 40% sales jump, analysts
still look for chipmakers to post per-share earnings gains averaging 29%.
   The outlook is for steady growth until 2000, and perhaps beyond.
``There's going to be a black hole for computing power for at least a
decade,'' says Gordon A. Campbell, chairman of startup 3Dfx Interactive
Inc., which makes chips that accelerate onscreen graphics for multimedia
PCs. The optimism isn't limited to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Vladi
Catto, chief economist at Texas Instruments Inc., says the industry might
expand by 20% a year for the next two decades. By comparison, since TI made
the world's first microchip 36 years ago, the industry has averaged 15%
annual gains.
OFF THE ROLLER COASTER? To be sure, not every sector is booming. The growth
rate for multimedia PCs seems to be slowing, for example. No matter. Most
chipmakers won't be able to satisfy demand anyhow unless the whole PC
business falters. ``The rate at which semiconductors are going into [a
widening profusion of products] has just skyrocketed,'' says G. Dan
Hutcheson, president of chip watcher VLSI Research Inc. This ever-expanding
base of customers means producers are becoming less vulnerable to a hiccup
in any one market, adds Jean-Philippe Dauvin, chief economist at European
chipmaker SGS-Thomson Microelectronics. That's a key reason why the
industry believes its roller-coaster cycles are a thing of the past. While
chipmakers can't escape broad economic swings, these ups and downs will be
a merry-go-round ride by comparison.
   Because PCs remain the main engine boosting silicon's rocket for now,
the immediate beneficiaries will be the makers of dynamic random-access
memory (DRAM) chips and, of course, Intel Corp. New PCs gobble two to four
times as much memory as older models, so DRAM shipments could soar 40% this
year. As for Intel, look for the microprocessor king to sell 25% more
``brain'' chips this year than in 1995.
   Despite fatter sales, Intel cautions that its incredible 55% gross
margins could shrink, because of its rapidly growing business in PC
motherboards and plug-in boards. On the other hand, some analysts say
Intel's profits could actually improve. Its chip sales are shifting
dramatically from 486 microprocessors to higher-priced Pentium models
(chart), and Intel may pare prices less aggressively. That's because
up-and-coming microprocessor rivals such as Cyrix and NexGen--soon to
become a division of Advanced Micro Devices--aren't cranking out enough
chips to cramp Intel's style. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. recently said its
fourth-quarter profits would fall short because it isn't grabbing as much
486 business from Intel as it hoped.
   NexGen Inc. and Cyrix Corp. are hardly the only companies facing a
capacity squeeze. In fact, lack of capacity will rob the chip industry of
several percentage points of potential growth this year. ``Everybody's
straining just to get enough fabs out,'' says Ray Stata, chairman of Analog
Devices Inc. ``Fab'' is chip-speak for wafer-fabrication plant, the
squeaky-clean factories that make semiconductors.
   Scarce capacity means continuing pain for the fabless companies that
often design the industry's leapfrog chips. To guarantee production of
their next wonder circuits, several fabless companies are buying into chip
producers. Cirrus Logic Inc., the biggest fabless company, plans to spend
$2 billion over the next five years. Part of the money will go for a 15%
stake in United Silicon, a new chip factory in Taiwan.
   Wafer fabs now cost as much as $1.3 billion each, and the industry will
need to pour the foundation for a new one every week, figures TI's Catto,
if chips are to reach the $331 billion level predicted for 2000 by market
researcher Dataquest Inc. However, until investors share the industry's
newfound confidence that chips have outgrown their boom-and-bust days, the
stock market could gum up Dataquest's long-range timetable. Absent that,
the silicon horizon has a bright golden glow.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- PCs continue to boom, driving sales of memory chips and Intel's
Pentium microprocessors.
   -- Use of chips in a growing variety of products will smooth the
traditional boom-and-bust cycles.

Negatives
   -- Capacity shortages could hurt producers of memory chips and
chipmakers that contract out.
   -- Investor jitters about possible market slowdowns could sink stocks
and limit chipmakers' investing in new plants.

THE NOT-SO-CALM BEFORE THE STORM
All hell will break loose when deregulation hits. For now, business is
strong

By:
By Catherine Arnst in New York


The telecommunications industry is setting off on a great adventure in
1996: The forces of competition are being unleashed in all parts of the
business for the first time. However, most of the year will be a
profit-boosting calm before the storm--``the last good year before
competition starts in earnest,'' says Simon W. Flannery, an analyst at J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. ``The cable companies rolling out telephones, the
Bells getting into cable, PCS [wireless] systems being switched on--all the
things we're just guessing at at the moment will start coming into focus in
'96.''
   Congress had tried for two decades to pass legislation that would
overhaul the 1934 rules regulating telecommunications. Finally, at the tail
end of 1995, Congress was able to write a sweeping telecom-deregulation
bill that allows long-distance carriers, local phone companies, and
cable-TV operators to enter one another's markets. And even without
Congress, about half the states are freeing up local phone markets. By next
January, competition should be busting out all over.
   The telecom legislation allows long-distance and cable-TV operators into
the local phone market immediately. Local monopolies can offer long
distance and cable TV outside their regions at once, and in-region as soon
as competition is established. If there are no hitches, Bell Atlantic Corp.
Vice-Chairman James G. Cullen predicts that consumers in some parts of the
country will be able to choose a local phone company by the end of 1996.
GRAB A PARTNER. As all the industry's players scramble to ready themselves
for this brave new world, expect to see a flurry of alliances,
partnerships, and outright acquisitions. Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex
Corp., which have teamed up in three wireless and entertainment
partnerships already, are likely to offer long- distance together as well.
Analysts say other such pairings are probable. And look for buyouts of
small long-distance and alternative-access companies such as WorldCom and
MFS Communications.
   In the meantime, business is booming. Demand for Internet access, the
growth of telecommuting, the huge popularity of cellular phones, and a
surge in data transmission all make telephony a growth business.
Long-distance calling traffic accelerated by 8% in 1995 and is expected to
grow another 8% this year. Local phone companies should add access lines at
a rate of 3% this year, compared with 1% to 2% earlier in the decade.
   The result: Phone companies are bringing in money like never before.
Steven R. Yanis of Oppenheimer & Co. expects revenues for the three biggest
long-distance carriers--AT&T, MCI Communications, and Sprint--to grow by
8.2% in 1996, to $118 billion, while the seven Baby Bells should see 3.2%
growth in revenues, to $96 billion.
   Once competition starts, price wars will break out and margins will be
under pressure. Plus, the phone companies have to start getting ready for
competition now, an expensive task. Market researcher Forrester Research
Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that the top local and long-distance
carriers will need to spend $30 billion over the next three years to
bankroll their competitive strategies. J.P. Morgan estimates that capital
spending is expected to increase to $130 per phone line, from $120 per line
in 1995.
   The local phone monopolies in particular must develop a competitive
mindset. ``They really need to get much more focused on customer service,''
says Larry R. Levitan, managing partner for Andersen Consulting's
communications group. For proof, just look at a new study from Deloitte &
Touche: Nearly 40% of corporate telecom managers say they would be likely
to switch from their traditional local-service provider if given a choice
of comparable quality. That's why industry analysts think phone companies
with large rural territories and few corporate customers, such as SBC
Communications Inc. and U S West Inc., are best positioned for the
deregulated world, since they are the least likely to face competition.
   With the Bells freed to enter new markets such as long distance and
cable, deregulation should be a ``win-win'' for everyone in the long run,
says Yanis. ``I truly believe that competition will increase the size of
the whole market. This will not be a zero-sum game. It's a positive-sum
game.'' And the starting gun is about to go off.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Deregulation will unleash a wave of investment and creativity.
   -- Demand is booming. Long-distance usage keeps rising, and households
are adding second lines in record numbers.

Negatives
   -- While deregulation is in sight, state and federal agencies must work
out hundreds of details first.
   -- Carriers will have to spend billions of dollars to get into one
another's markets.

ROBUST AND READY TO BRAWL
Drugmakers are flush, so more mergers--even hostile ones--may be on the
horizon

By:
By Joseph Weber in Philadelphia


With stock prices setting records and earnings climbing at double-digit
rates again, pharmaceutical executives are heading for maybe their best
year since the roaring '80s. More unit sales, more freedom to raise prices,
and savings from restructurings are hypercharging growth. ``We're not in
the doldrums of the early '90s anymore,'' says Robert L. Andrews, a
Deloitte & Touche managing director.
   Heavy margin pressure, sharp staff cuts, and deep discounting are fading
as fast as memories of President Clinton's election-year attacks on
drugmaker price-gouging. For 10 leading U.S. and European drugmakers, net
income this year may rise as much as 12%, to $18.6 billion, while sales
climb 8%, to $106.2 billion, estimates Cowen & Co. analyst Stephen Scala.
The healthiest companies could repeat 1995's 20% earnings gains.
   Yet execs can't afford to be complacent. Mergers have reshaped the
industry, and more may be on the way. The biggest companies gain an edge in
funding research and development, bargaining with managed-care buyers, and
competing globally. By mid-December, the industry had tallied $41.2 billion
in deals, up from 1994's record $36.1 billion, according to Windhover's
directory, 1995 Health Care Strategist.
TWISTED ARMS. Foreign buyers set the pace in 1995, led by Glaxo Holdings'
record-breaking $14 billion purchase of Burroughs Wellcome, Hoechst's $7.1
billion acquisition of Marion Merrell Dow, and the stock-for-stock merger
of Upjohn and Pharmacia, valued at $7 billion. Hostile deals, such as
Johnson & Johnson's $1.8 billion takeover of Cordis, a maker of cardiology
devices, could bring an unwilling partner or two to the altar this year.
Says Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. analyst Neil B. Sweig: ``The white
gloves are off.''
   Who's next? Industry titans Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.
figure prominently in Wall Street speculation as potential acquirers of the
midsize likes of Monsanto Co.'s Searle & Co. unit or perennial merger
target Warner-Lambert Co. Well-heeled Swiss drugmakers Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and
Sandoz Ltd. also make likely buyer lists. Japanese drugmakers, whose
stockholders are wrestling with tough times generally, could be alluring to
global buyers.
   Acquisitions aren't always the right tonic. Merck, SmithKline Beecham,
and Lilly are still chasing a payoff from pharmacy-benefit managers, the
distribution operations for which they together have paid $13 billion since
1993. At the same time, Rite Aid Corp. and other drugstore chains are
building competing units. After shelling out $6.6 billion in 1993 for Medco
Containment Services Inc., a big benefit manager, Merck & Co. has turned
cool toward all kinds of mergers. Says CEO Raymond V. Gilmartin: ``Major
acquisitions would be a diversion for us.''
STICKER SHOCK. Acquisition fever may be tempered, too, by slightly more
pricing freedom. ``Companies are less inclined to give discounts and reduce
prices,'' says Wayne P. Yetter, chief executive of Astra Merck Inc. Indeed,
some prices--chiefly to retail drugstore buyers not covered by insurance
plans--have been climbing faster than inflation.
   The industry's financial health conceals a shortfall of novel
blockbusters. While drugmakers squeeze ever more sales out of big producers
such as cholesterol-fighters and antidepressants, few have offered truly
new potential $1 billion sellers recently. One likely exception: the
osteoporosis treatment Fosamax, a drug from Italy's Istituto Gentili being
marketed by Merck in the U.S. Another potential big winner is J&J's
Risperdal, a schizophrenia treatment.
   Drugmakers aren't helping their cause by limiting R&D. The
Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America says the 8% growth in
industry R&D spending in 1995 was the lowest in more than two decades. ``I
worry that by reducing the rate of increase in research, we are going to
reduce the opportunities'' for new drugs, says Schering-Plough CEO Richard
J. Kogan. He says his company will outpace its peers in 1996, boosting its
$650 million in R&D spending by more than 10%.
   R&D cannot be neglected. Pfizer Inc. credits new drugs for boosting its
net income an estimated 20% last year, to about $1.6 billion, on a 23% rise
in sales, to $10.2 billion. This year, analysts expect Pfizer to nearly
match that growth. Luckily for Pfizer's competitors, this won't be the year
they'll have to pay for underinvestment. There's enough right with the drug
business that there will be plenty of gains to go around.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- More providers are using medicine instead of surgery or
psychotherapy.
   -- Pressure against price hikes is easing, helping broaden profit
margins.
   -- Wider uses are being found for big sellers such as
cholesterol-reducers.

Negatives
   -- With few new blockbusters, drugmakers will battle to sell more of
what's already in the medicine cabinet.
   -- Merging companies are jeopardizing their futures by cutting R&D.

THE MEDIA CIRCUS IS STILL IN TOWN
Thrills and chills as global demand keeps the buying frenzy going

By:
By Ronald Grover in Los Angeles


It has been more than a decade since television host Monty Hall looked
behind that curtain for the last time. But in the frenzied media world,
every day seems to be a rerun of Let's Make a Deal. Walt Disney Co. plunked
down $19 billion in stock and cash to buy Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
Westinghouse Electric Corp. bought CBS Inc. News Corp. Chairman Rupert
Murdoch jumped on the Internet, launched a sports channel to rival ESPN,
and then made plans to beam TV signals to Latin America. And in cable? Last
year, a staggering $25 billion in deals were struck, as nearly one in five
subscribers saw their cable companies change hands.
   In 1996, the media dealmaking won't be confined to the TV and movie
businesses. USA Today publisher Gannett Co. is still on the prowl after
completing its $1.7 billion purchase of Multimedia Inc. Other publishing
deals may be in the offing. Spurring on the activity is an unquenchable
worldwide thirst for American-made movies and TV programs--and a surprising
rebound in Americans' appetite for the printed word.
   Programming and distribution entities will keep getting married in
1996--programmers to ensure an outlet for their works, distributors to fill
their pipelines. General Electric Co. is likely to go shopping for partners
again this year, after failing in 1995 to persuade Disney to buy a
half-interest in its NBC Inc. unit. Possible candidates: Seagram's MCA
subsidiary, which includes Universal Pictures, or Sony's Hollywood-based
studios. Microsoft Corp., a partner with NBC in an on-line news channel,
could also be a bidder. After buying CBS, Westinghouse is still looking to
bolster its programming and could strike an alliance with a Hollywood
studio as well. ``The idea is to protect yourself from being shut out as
the big get bigger,'' says Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Jessica Reif.
NET GAINS. Propelling the movement toward bigness in 1996 is the expected
passage of the long-awaited federal telecommunications bill. Among other
things, the legislation would immediately allow cable and telephone
companies to compete in one another's markets and gradually raise ceilings
on the number of radio and TV stations a company can own. That should
prompt a new wave of acquisitions, says Gene F. Jankowski, managing
director at Veronis, Suhler & Associates Inc., a New York investment bank.
Among those rumored ready to sell is billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, whose
New World Entertainment Inc. broadcast and production company is loaded
with debt.
   Media companies will benefit in 1996 from a robust advertising market
that for the third year running should outperform the overall economy.
Boosted by the Olympic Games in Atlanta and U.S. political campaigns,
domestic advertising in all media should grow by 7.8%, to $174 billion,
predicts Robert J. Coen, a senior vice-president at ad agency
McCann-Erickson Worldwide. The four major broadcast networks will be among
the biggest winners, with a projected 12.5% increase, to $13 billion.
NEW SYSTEMS. The ad increase isn't the only good news for network
television. After losing audiences to cable and syndicated programming for
years, the number of sets tuned into the networks will stabilize in 1996 at
roughly 64% of those viewing TV, predicts Veronis Suhler. But not every
network will survive. Time Warner Inc.'s struggling Warner Bros. network
will likely seek a merger with startup UPN, a joint venture of United
Broadcasting and Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp.
   Cable television, meanwhile, will seek growth by adding services rather
than subscribers. After adding 9 million subscribers over the previous five
years, the industry's customer base will grow by roughly 1 million in 1996,
according to Veronis Suhler. To maintain the cash-flow growth, cable
companies will need to build systems to battle the telcos, and many cable
companies will introduce modem services for high-speed data transfer later
in 1996. Other companies, such as Tele-Communications Inc., will move
aggressively overseas into markets with greater potential to add
subscribers.
   Foreign companies--which have sat on the sidelines since the disastrous
foray of Japanese companies in Hollywood--will also reemerge on the
American media scene. The sale of Tur-ner Broadcasting System Inc. to Time
Warner alerted many of them to the dwindling number of companies available
to fill the Information Superhighway with films and TV shows. Dutch
electronics giant Philips' PolyGram entertainment unit will aggressively
seek an acquisition. So might German media powerhouse Bertelsmann, which
recently opened a flashy Los Angeles headquarters. One likely target is
MGM/UA, which is rising from the ashes with such films as GoldenEye and Get
Shorty. The studio's owner, French bank Credit Lyonnais, recently hired
investment bankers Lazard Freres & Co. to sell off the studio.
PAPER PROFITS. Other bidding wars will feature Sony Corp.'s Los Angeles
film unit and Thorn EMI's record division. Murdoch is a possible bidder for
EMI. So is Disney, which has a small record company with few stars. The
biggest bidding war, however, could center on Sony. After parting ways with
U.S. CEO Michael P. Schulhof, Sony is likely to try unloading a piece of
its film company. Sony insiders say Murdoch has expressed interest.
Investment bankers say GE is eager to line up more content for
broadcasting. And, despite his frequent denials, Microsoft Chairman William
H. Gates III may also be interested.
   Hollywood production will increase in 1996 to satisfy the booming
foreign market and domestic cable operators. The year will feature more
than the usual numbers of retreaded oldies. Universal Pictures, with fresh
capital from new owner Seagram, will churn out films based on old TV shows
McHale's Navy, Flipper, and Sergeant Bilko. Tom Cruise will headline a film
version of Mission: Impossible from Viacom's Paramount Pictures unit.
   The newspaper business lacks Hollywood's glitz but had a marquee year in
1995, with earnings gains of 14.8% at 11 big newspaper publishing
companies, according to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ) Securities Corp.
McCann-Erickson's Coen says that in 1996, advertising revenue will increase
by a modest 5.5%, to $4.25 billion, down from an 11% rise through the first
nine months of 1995. That will dampen industry earnings growth to an
average of 6.5% in 1996, DLJ says.
   Those kinds of returns don't satisfy many newspaper publishers, who say
they need to make drastic cost reductions to ensure their long-term health.
``We're starting to see a little breathing room, but not an awful lot,''
says Mark H. Willes, Times Mirror Co.'s new CEO. In 1995, Willes cut
hundreds of jobs at the flagship Los Angeles Times and closed the New York
City edition of Long Island-based Newsday.
   Still, newspaper companies are hardly turning their backs on their
printing presses--high paper prices and the Info Highway notwithstanding.
Evidence of that is Gannett's purchase of Multimedia. Also, in 1996, The
New York Times will launch a Northeastern edition, while the Los Angeles
Times will revive plans to distribute its paper in Washington, D.C.
   Why the newfound optimism? For one thing, readership of newspapers is up
as the number of Americans 35 and over expands. Those demographics will
also help book and magazine publishers. In 1996, a slew of new specialty
magazines will likely hit the newsstands. Century 21 Real Estate Corp., for
instance, will launch a new home magazine with Hachette Filipacchi
Magazines Inc. Book publishers intend to expand their lines to fill the
shelves of book superstores and discount chains. Hearst Corp. will soon
launch its first hardcover line for adults. Even MTV will have its own book
line, geared to the under-35 crowd.
   Which media companies will strike the audience's fancy in 1996? That's
hard to say. But these days, if you can't produce a hit you can always buy
the hitmaker.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The Olympics, the election, and a revived economy should increase TV
ad revenue by about 8%.
   -- Telecom deregulation will spur a burst of investment by phone
companies in cable TV.
   -- Foreign demand for U.S. entertainment remains strong.

Negatives
   -- Technology disappointments will slow adoption of interactive TV.
   -- Smaller players may be shunted aside.

THE BABY BELLS TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS IN TINSELTOWN

By:
By Ronald Grover in Los Angeles

As he stood before his shareholders at Ameritech Corp.'s annual meeting,
chatting via a video hookup with Mickey Mouse, Chief Executive Richard C.
Notebaert left little doubt that the telephone companies' pin-striped world
had definitely gone Hollywood. In 1996, in a wide swath of head-to-head
confrontations from San Diego to Chicago, the Baby Bells intend finally to
launch their attack on the cable-television industry.
   The sweeping telecommunications bill in Congress would allow phone
companies to challenge cable operators outside their home markets
immediately, and within their regions once they prove their phone business
faces competition. At first, phone-company offerings won't look all that
different from what TV viewers get now by handing over $40 to $50 each
month to their local cable companies. Down the road, however, the phone
companies hope to beat the cable companies to the interactive market with
such features as home shopping and games. ``The idea is to outdo the cable
companies, not just match them,'' says Howard Stringer, chairman of the
Tele-TV venture that includes three of the seven Baby Bells.
   First off, the telcos plan to offer more channels. In Glendale Heights,
Ill., Ameritech's network of optical fiber and copper cable will offer 90
channels, compared with the local cable operator's current 60. In
Riverside, Calif., where the 90 channels will be delivered over the air
through a system called wireless cable, the reception is expected to be
sharper. With only 15% of Riverside County receiving cable, Pacific Telesis
Group expects to make inroads by stuffing marketing literature into the
weekly phone bills it sends in the area.
   The telcos won't lack programming firepower, either. Walt Disney Co., a
partner with three of the Baby Bells and GTE Corp. in another joint
venture, has assigned top animators to work on tailor-made programming,
including a souped-up on-screen guide. As for Tele-TV, Stringer says it has
a production facility ready for action. For phone companies, Hollywood will
be quite a change from selling call-waiting service.

THE PATIENT IS STABLE-FOR NOW
Health-care costs are in check, but the industry's upheaval isn't over

By:
By Keith H. Hammonds in New York


A deceptive peace has descended on the nation's $750 billion health-care
industry. There has been no word of a major health-maintenance organization
merger for months. Hospital giant Columbia/HCA appears too occupied
digesting the acquisitions of years past to indulge its unrelenting
appetite. And once again, reform sits deadlocked on Capitol Hill.
   But just wait: Beneath the surface, a revolution rages on. ``The pace of
change is stunning,'' says Dr. W. Allen Schaffer, head of managed care at
CIGNA Healthcare Inc. ``We have to reevaluate our strategic assumptions
every six months.'' Managed-care plans snatched some 5 million Americans
from their traditional health insurers in 1995, bringing total enrollment
in HMOs to 56 million. Those are powerful numbers, and managed care now
calls the shots. This year, it likely will force more consolidation than
ever.
   The industry, still fragmented and unwieldy, remains eminently ripe for
restructuring. Even though health-care inflation has slowed, spending
continues to edge upward as a share of the nation's economy (chart).
Massive overhead associated with excess capacity remains, and ``the only
way to slow growth in health-care spending is to debloat the system,'' says
John F. Hindelong, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corp.
   That process is under way. Indeed, employers saw their health-care costs
drop in 1994 and remain flat in 1995 as millions of workers moved into
cheaper managed-care plans. Employers' costs will probably rise slightly on
average in 1996 as fewer additional employees switch to managed care,
according to Foster & Higgins consultant John Erb.
TEAMING UP. The cost squeeze means more upheaval for doctors and hospitals.
``The market works, but it is very painful,'' says Robert L. Montgomery,
chief executive at Alta Bates Health System in Berkeley, Calif. Alta Bates,
forced to hold managed-care charges flat for a third straight year, has
joined a hospital consortium to amass a total of 600,000 managed-care
patients--the better to negotiate with ever-larger HMOs. Even big,
for-profit chains are looking at admissions increases of only 1% to 3% in
1996, says DLJ's Hindelong, though consolidation will help the sector lift
earnings by 15% to 20% next year.
   The motivation is irresistible: As of Dec. 15, 1995, the industry had
seen a record 433 mergers and acquisitions, according to Securities Data
Co. Increasingly, those mergers are crossing industry boundaries--producing
new ``integrated delivery systems'' that put hospitals, doctors, nursing
homes, and others under the same corporate roof. The object: one-stop
shopping for managed-care companies, who require access to a broad array of
services, says Coopers & Lybrand consultant Glenn A. Shively.
CRAWLING REFORM. At the same time, HMOs are themselves driving for size,
market penetration, and efficiency. Growth certainly won't come from rate
hikes: Even the better HMOs will win premium increases of just 1% to 2%
this year, says analyst Kenneth Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Rather, the HMOs need new bodies. Many will see big revenue gains this year
as more Medicare recipients move into managed-care plans--a shift that
would accelerate if health-care reform succeeds.
   And what of reform? Republicans and Democrats alike want to cut back on
payments to Medicare service providers. And doctors and hospitals face an
enormous hit from a proposed provision requiring payment reductions if
total Medicare spending exceeds budget. The outlook for Medicaid is
particularly cloudy--one reason many insurers are staying away from the
business.
   In any case, governmental change will prove, as always, far less
powerful than the market-driven charge for critical mass and market muscle.
The resulting shakeout will be dramatic. Industry executives suspect that
Aetna Life & Casualty and CIGNA, both on the verge of shedding hunks of
their property-and-casualty businesses, could spend huge sums to turn their
middling health businesses into national HMOs.
   Such new players, if well-conceived and adequately funded, could
transform a compartmentalized industry that until now has fought its
battles largely within cities or regions. ``By the end of the decade, we
will begin to see the endgame appear,'' says Gennaro J. Vasile, a longtime
hospital executive who recently became head of Gemini Consulting Inc.'s
North American health-care practice. And some fair hints should come even
sooner.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- For-profit hospitals should continue to gain market share and see
admissions rise modestly.
   -- Well-managed nursing homes will pick up business as hospital stays
continue to shrink.

Negatives
   -- Rising cost pressure from managed care, plus lower Medicare and
Medicaid rates, will keep a squeeze on margins.
   -- Health-care reform hasn't addressed the uninsured, who will put an
even greater strain on the system.

PICKING UP SPEED
Airlines are finally in the clear--and railroads may link up

By:
By Wendy Zellner in Dallas


Transportation services expect modest growth in 1996, with airlines and
railroads faring best and truckers bringing up the rear. All three sectors
are focusing on improving productivity--and keeping a close eye on the
merger scene.
   Airline executives are happiest: After five years of losses and
retrenchment, the industry has finally recovered. Net profits in 1995
totaled about $2 billion, vs. a $279 million loss in 1994. In a sentiment
widely echoed by his peers, Continental Airlines Chief Executive Gordon M.
Bethune says: ``It's a pretty rosy-looking '96.''
   With traffic expected to grow only about 3% in 1996, airline profits
will hinge on keeping costs in check and capacity usage up. That won't be
easy. Unit costs will rise 1.5% to 2% for the major carriers, after holding
steady in 1995, says analyst Samuel Buttrick of PaineWebber Inc. ``We've
picked the low-hanging fruit,'' agrees Delta Air Lines Inc. CEO Ronald W.
Allen. ``It's going to get tougher from here on out.''
   The good news for airlines is that capacity should grow more slowly than
traffic, meaning fuller planes and higher fares. Systemwide capacity for
U.S. airlines grew about 2.5% last year, and it's likely to show a similar
increase in '96, estimates David A. Swierenga, chief economist for the Air
Transport Assn. That bodes well for fares. True, the rapid expansion of
such low-cost carriers as Southwest Airlines Co. and ValuJet Airlines Inc.
will help to hold fares down. But Edward P. Gilligan, executive
vice-president for American Express Co.'s Travel Management Services,
predicts that airfares will rise an average of 3% to 4% this year, with
only limited and carefully targeted discounting.
BOLD COMBINATIONS. The airlines' discipline is expected to translate into
higher profits. A bullish Steve Lewins of Gruntal & Co. figures major
airlines' earnings will soar 56% from 1995's modest level. The rising
profits complicate carriers' efforts to wrest major concessions from their
pilots so they can better compete with lower-cost carriers. Still, pilots
at American and Delta have recently announced a willingness to consider
wage and work-rule changes on short-haul routes that airlines have been
farming out to other carriers.
   There's still one unsettling question as the industry reaches cruising
altitude: Will airline mergers mar the flight plan? A new round of
dealmaking could distract execs from rebuilding balance sheets and
improving service. United Airlines Inc. decided last year not to pursue a
marriage with USAir Inc. And American says it won't strike first. Still, no
one rules out a new wave of merger mania in 1996.
   Railroads, in contrast, are already pursuing bold combinations. Union
Pacific Corp. is seeking government approval for its $3.9 billion
acquisition of Southern Pacific Rail Corp. Its deal comes in response to
Burlington Northern Inc.'s $4 billion purchase last year of Santa Fe
Pacific Corp., creating, at least for now, the nation's largest railroad.
And takeover rumors continue to swirl around companies such as Conrail Inc.
Meanwhile, U.S. railroads are expected to be bidders this year in the
privatization of Mexico's railroads.
   Even without such deals, investors have much to cheer about. Merrill
Lynch & Co. analyst Michael H. Lloyd expects modest revenue gains of 4% to
5% this year for the major railroads, but operating profits should grow at
double that pace, thanks to productivity increases and cost-cutting. The
new Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., for example, has already slashed
jobs and has also identified almost $1 billion in operating cost savings
over the next few years.
   Labor remains a wild card as the railroad industry bargains with about a
dozen unions to reach new contracts. But bargaining is off to a strong
start with a tentative accord with the United Transportation Union,
representing 25% of workers.
   Truckers are hoping simply to bounce back from a bleak 1995. The
industry has been hammered by a slowing of U.S. economic growth, a downturn
in exports to Mexico, and excess capacity. After a banner 1994, bullish
trucking companies rapidly expanded their fleets with bigger trucks. Now,
with softer demand and lackluster earnings, analysts expect a shakeout.
Swift Transportation Co., for one, is hoping to benefit: The company has
made four acquisitions since 1991 and is prowling for more. Truckers will
have to satisfy themselves with such hardscrabbling while railroads and
airlines enjoy a relatively smooth ride.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Airline capacity should grow more slowly than traffic, meaning fuller
planes and higher fares.
   -- Railroads are boosting productivity with computerization and faster
locomotives.

Negatives
   -- Airlines will be hard-pressed to win cost reductions from labor when
profits are soaring.
   -- The trucking industry is suffering from excess capacity.
   -- Railroads have yet to sign contracts with about a dozen unions.

WHERE THERE'S A WILL, THERE ARE MISTAKES

By:
EDITED BY AMY DUNKIN
Grace Weinstein

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis made the right moves when it came to estate
planning. Many people do not, deterred either by the thought of dying or by
the seeming complexity of well-made plans.
   Don't be put off. After all, you can't take it with you. If you're not
careful, however, you can sure make a mess of leaving it behind, making
Uncle Sam richer and your family poorer in the process. ``It'' is your
hard-earned property. The mess is what happens if you make one of these
all-too-common estate planning mistakes:
-- Ignoring the whole thing. Seven out of 10 Americans reportedly die
without making a will. ``The single most important thing you can do,'' says
Stephan Leimberg, professor of taxation and estate planning at The American
College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., ``is get your papers in order and figure out
what you want to do.''
   Then, follow through. Remember, if you die without a will, you're
leaving it up to your state to decide who gets what. If you're married,
your assets may be split among your spouse and children. If your children
are minors, your spouse would then have to get permission from the court to
spend ``their'' money on their behalf. If you're not married, your closest
blood relatives would inherit your worldly possessions--even if you have a
close friend you would prefer.
   Living trusts, pushed in some quarters as a probate-free substitute for
a will, have advantages and disadvantages. A living trust, which is
revocable and takes assets out of your name, can be helpful if you live in
one of the few states, such as California, with high probate fees or if you
want backup should you become incapacitated. A living trust is a good
``standby vehicle,'' says Bill Knox, a trust attorney with Neuberger &
Berman in New York, because the trustees you have named can manage your
affairs if you cannot. But you won't save on income taxes with a living
trust. And, unless all of your assets are owned by the trust, you won't
avoid probate. You'll still need a will to take care of any assets not
sheltered by the trust at the time of your death.
   You can prepare a legal will yourself, using software programs such as
Nolo's WillMaker (about $40, 800 992-6656). But if your affairs are
complicated--if you have remarried or own investment real estate--you would
be better off consulting an attorney experienced in estate planning.
   Once you draft it, don't file your will and forget it. Make a list of
all your assets and liabilities, so that your family won't flounder in
ignorance when you're gone. Then keep this list current and review your
will every few years, more often if there are changes in tax law or your
own family circumstances. Marriage, divorce, newborn children or
grandchildren, or a move to another state should all be triggers for
updating your will.
-- Using the $600,000 exemption from federal estate taxes only once. Joint
ownership can undermine good estate planning by wasting the second $600,000
estate exemption otherwise available to the surviving spouse. So can using
what Ralph Engel, an attorney with Rosen & Reade in New York, calls a
``sweetheart will,'' in which you leave everything to your spouse.
Solution: Divide assets so that each spouse separately owns at least
$600,000, then leave the first $600,000 in each estate in a bypass or
credit shelter trust. The survivor can receive income from the trust, and
tap principal, but after the second spouse dies the remainder goes to the
children or other designated beneficiaries free from estate tax.
-- Failing to plan specifically for substantial retirement assets.
Accumulated retirement funds--individual retirement account, 401(k), or
profit-sharing--make up a large portion of the estate for many
middle-income Americans. In fact, it can be difficult for some couples to
divvy up asset ownership if one spouse has a sizable retirement plan. If
you don't recognize the potential tax bite on large plan accumulations, you
could wind up losing as much as 85% of your retirement money to a
combination of estate, income, and excise taxes.
   Estate taxes start at 37% and go up to as much as 60%. An excise tax of
15% applies to so-called excess accumulations at death of $1.5 million or
so as well as to excess distributions during life of more than about
$150,000 a year (the specific amount is a moving target because it depends
on your age at the time of death and current Internal Revenue Service
interest rate assumptions). Income tax kicks in if your beneficiaries must
pull money out of your ira to pay any estate taxes that may be due.
   You won't solve the problem by putting retirement money in trust. Engel
cites an instance in which a trust was named beneficiary of a six-figure
retirement plan. Because of that setup, the surviving wife, who could
otherwise have left the money untouched until she reached retirement age,
couldn't do an ira rollover, so the money was immediately subject to income
and estate tax.
   One approach is to begin withdrawing your own retirement money early.
Don't wait until the mandated withdrawal age of 70 1/2 if you will be
accumulating so much money that you'll be subject to excise tax. Steven
Lockwood, president of Lockwood Pension Services in New York, suggests that
if you have other assets you can pass to your heirs, you should ``plan to
deplete your ira by age 90'' rather than leaving it in your taxable
estate.
-- Holding on to more money than you need. Successful people sometimes
don't realize until late in life that the government may get half of what
they leave behind. By then, says Knox, ``it's too late to make much of a
dent in the looming tax losses.''
   There are multiple solutions here. Start by making what Knox calls
``invisible lifetime gifts.'' These are grants of up to $10,000 per person
per year, as well as direct payments of tuition or medical bills, that are
not subject to gift tax. Giving these gifts to your family members while
you're alive removes the money--and its subsequent appreciation--from your
taxable estate. By helping your children buy a house or your grandchildren
attend summer camp, such gifts also let you enjoy the fruits of your
generosity along with the recipients.
   If your estate is sizable, you may want to consider making larger gifts
as well. Giving appreciating assets is the idea here, so that future growth
is removed from your taxable estate. The cost basis for determining capital
gains on inherited assets is fixed at the time of death, or ``stepped up''
from the original purchase price, while the cost basis of assets you give
during your life is what you paid. Hold on to assets that have already
appreciated significantly, otherwise your heirs will lose the benefit of
this stepped-up basis at death and owe capital gains when they sell on the
entire appreciation from your date of purchase.
   Gifts of up to $10,000 per year ($20,000 for a married couple) are never
subject to tax. On larger gifts, a gift tax return will have to be filed,
but the tax itself will not be due until your death. That's when the
unified gift and estate tax kicks in on amounts (whether given during life
or after death) in excess of approximately $600,000.
   Charitable gifts can also reap large rewards. The American College's
Leimberg makes reference to Jacqueline Onassis, who may have sheltered as
much as $90 million out of a $100 million estate by setting up a charitable
lead trust. No one knows exactly how much was in the Onassis estate, but
attorneys recognize the astute estate planning.
   With a charitable lead trust, a specific sum is set aside. The charities
of your choice receive a fixed amount each year, typically based on a
percentage of the original amount, for the period of time you specify. At
the end of that period, your children or other beneficiaries receive the
principal. Because the gift to the children has been deferred, Knox
explains, it is discounted for tax purposes. Furthermore, if the trust's
return on investments is higher than anticipated, the excess goes to the
children without tax.
   Charitable lead trusts are most often used by the very wealthy. Their
mirror image, charitable remainder trusts, are more common. With a crt, you
receive both an immediate tax deduction and income during your lifetime
(and, if you wish, that of your spouse), with the principal then going to
charity. No estate taxes are due on amounts left to charity through the
trust.
-- Insisting on simplicity, at the expense of what could be significant tax
savings. Knox points out that people who have built successful businesses
or professional practices are often ``impatient with, or even distrustful
of, estate planning techniques they can't easily understand.'' Used to
making and controlling their destiny, ``they can't bring themselves to do
something complicated that doesn't make complete sense to them, no matter
how great the tax savings for their families,'' he says.
   One approach is to search out good advisers and then rely on their
recommendations. You don't have to understand the technicalities, so long
as you understand the consequences in terms of tax savings and your control
over your assets.
-- Failing to read documents. No matter how good the recommendations from
your advisers, you really do need to peruse all the documents and have your
attorney answer any questions that you may have. Mistakes can creep in if
you're not paying close attention. Michael Allmon, chairman of the
California Society of cpa's estate planning committee in Los Angeles, cites
a client who made several specific bequests of property, but never noticed
that their addresses were incorrectly listed. ``We think we can take care
of his intent,'' Allmon says, ``but we will have to get the court involved
to do so.''
-- Thinking that estate planning is only for the rich. If anything, says
Leimberg, preparing your will is much more critical for the middle
class--or those people with estates under $1 million. ``If a wealthy person
loses $100,000 because of poor or no estate planning, the world won't come
to an end,'' he says. ``But it's tough when you have a smaller estate.'' In
other words, most of us can't afford to make any mistakes.



Five Rules of Estate Planning

MAKE A WILL
This might seem obvious, yet 7 of 10 Americans die without one. If you
neglect this important piece of business, you're essentially granting your
state the right to decide who gets what.

USE A BYPASS TRUST IF MARRIED
For sizable estates, the couple divides the assets and each spouse puts up
to $600,000 in a trust. This ensures that both get to use a $600,000
federal estate tax exemption.

WATCH RETIREMENT ACCUMULATIONS
If your IRA or qualified plan amounts to more than $1.5 million, you may
want to start withdrawals early so you don't bump up against the excise tax
on excess accumulations.

FIND EXPERT HELP
Refer to self-help software and books. But if your affairs are at all
complicated, use an attorney experienced in estate planning. Read
everything and ask questions--even experts make mistakes.

START ``GIFTING'' EARLY
If you have enough to live comfortably, giving up to $10,000 a year
($20,000 for a married couple) to each child and grandchild can greatly
reduce your taxable estate.

STEERING CLEAR OF TITLE TROUBLE

By:
Richard Korman

When stage great Helen Hayes died in 1993, her son, James MacArthur,
inherited her Victorian mansion overlooking the Hudson River in Nyack, N.Y.
MacArthur arranged to sell the house for $730,000 to Christopher and
Georgine Chalsen, who planned to live there with their five children. A few
weeks before the scheduled closing last June, a title researcher found
buried in the public records a 29-year-old right of first refusal that
Hayes had granted to a neighbor. After much frustration and weighing of
legal options, MacArthur honored the agreement, and the neighbors bought
the house. They removed a strip of land connecting the Hayes property and
their own to the river bank and put the house back on the market at
$849,000. With the river access gone, the Chalsens declined to pursue a
deal.
   The fiasco over the Hayes mansion, known as Pretty Penny, is an example
of how a defective title can kill a real estate deal that both parties
badly want to complete. No matter how much you feel that you've finally
found your dream home, don't get in too deep unless you're sure the house
clearly belongs to the seller or that you won't get involved in a
bottomless legal pit. Refusal rights, liens, easements, or boundary
disputes are the type of problems to watch out for.
   But even the seller doesn't always know. MacArthur was unaware that the
refusal right existed, much less that it had passed to the couple next door
when they bought their house from his mother's original neighbors a few
years ago. Hayes had granted an unlimited right to all ``heirs, executors,
administrators, successors, and assigns'' of the neighbors. Says Alan
Wayte, a Los Angeles attorney: ``That's a mistake, and a very common one.''
What Hayes should have done is restrict the refusal right to her original
neighbors or limit its duration.
   The broader issue is that title searches are often left until it's too
late to prevent both parties from spending a lot of money and effort
getting ready to close. A title is evidence that an owner has the right to
possession. Mortgage lenders require a search to assure that the property's
title is free and clear of claims or any other problems. The search may
show that the seller has a former spouse who is a co-owner but knows
nothing of the sale; a trucking company has an easement that allows it to
drive through the property during the night; or that the toolshed was built
two feet over the boundary of a neighbor's lot and the problem needs to be
resolved. It should also show any liens for unpaid taxes or mortgages.
EARLY REQUEST. The key is not to let the title check wait until after you
have completed other aspects of the deal, such as mortgage approval and
arranging to move. If possible, obtain a pre-approved mortgage before going
out to shop for a house, suggests Gary W. Eldred, author of The 106 Common
Mistakes Homebuyers Make (And How to Avoid Them) (John Wiley & Sons,
$14.95). Getting mortgage approval out of the way allows everyone involved
to concentrate on the title and other matters, he says.
   The minute your bid on a house is accepted, start researching the title.
Ask the seller's lawyer or broker to send a copy of the title report from
the property's most recent sale and the proposed contract, says Eric
Gonchar, MacArthur's attorney. Also ask for the most recent property survey
and certificate of occupancy.
   Before the contracts are signed, make sure you or your bank orders the
search from the company that will issue your title insurance. Also get a
copy of the summary report. It shouldn't take longer than two weeks. Don't
wait until the property is appraised or until your loan is approved. If
possible, have the abstract of the title and property survey before your
closing or moving dates are made. That way, if there are problems that will
take weeks or months to resolve, you won't have to undo preparations to
move from your current residence and inconvenience your buyer or tenant.
   Title searches and reports cost $150 to $500 and, if the deal closes,
that cost is rolled into the title-insurance bill. If the title report
turns up information that makes closing impossible, most home-sale
contracts require the seller to pay the buyer's title-search fee and
related title-examination costs.
   Although MacArthur picked up the tab for $1,000 of title-research costs,
Christopher Chalsen says he still spent $700 on the inspection. Chalsen
recalls that he told his lawyer to hurry to get the title information, but
he and his wife signed the contract before the data were in hand. Luckily,
the Chalsens eventually found another house. It hadn't belonged to a famous
actress, but its title was free of anything that could have turned the
purchase of the home into a tragedy.



Before You Seal the Deal...
-- Get the title search done as early as possible, well in advance of
closing and arranging to move. Press lenders, real estate agents, and
attorneys not to neglect this part of the deal. Try to get a mortgage
approved early so you can concentrate on the title.
-- Seek the title data from previous sales and refinancings prior to
signing a contract. Ask for copies of the survey and certificate of
occupancy as a tip-off to trouble involving boundaries or illegal
structures.
-- Always buy title insurance. Be sure the policy covers the owner, not
just the mortgage lender. Try for a policy that insures the full equity in
addition to the mortgage amount.

A PANGLOSS FOR THE MILLENNIUM

By:
BY MICHAEL J. MANDEL

THE STATE OF HUMANITY
Edited by Julian L. Simon
Blackwell 694pp $54.95

No one can accuse Julian L. Simon of thinking small. In his new book, he
tackles nothing less than the fate of all mankind. The State of Humanity, a
massive new volume of essays assembled and edited by Simon, is an attack on
the fashionable notion that human progress has stalled. ``Just about every
important long-run measure of human welfare shows improvement over the
decades and centuries, in the United States as well as in the rest of the
world,'' claims Simon in his introductory essay. ``There is no persuasive
reason to believe that these trends will not continue indefinitely.''
   This happy assessment is no surprise. In previous books, Simon, an
economist at the University of Maryland, has argued the benefits of
population growth and immigration, giving him a well-deserved reputation as
perhaps the most optimistic economist alive. His argument that humanity is
still on an upward trend is backed up by almost 700 pages of hard data and
numerous charts and graphs. Simon and his co-authors, including Nobel
prize-winning economist Robert W. Fogel, have put together what is probably
the single most concentrated mass of upbeat statistics ever assembled,
covering virtually every aspect of the human condition, from child
mortality to air pollution, from housing and food to natural resources and
ozone depletion.
   For the most part, the arguments are convincing. We have been warned
that the world is about to run out of oil. Not so, Simon points out: Global
crude-oil reserves have soared over the past 15 years, as higher prices
have stimulated exploration and new technology for exploiting existing
fields. In 1980, the world had about a 30-year supply of crude oil at
current rates of consumption. By the early 1990s, though, the world had
about 45 years' worth. Notes Simon: ``Metals, foods, and other natural
resources have become more available rather than more scarce.''
   The perspective of Simon and his co-authors is decidedly global. While
developed economies such as the U.S. have struggled in recent years,
developing countries such as China, Taiwan, and Malaysia have seen
explosive income growth, making this the greatest period of wealth creation
in history. These economic gains have been accompanied by other advances,
as well. Over the past 30 years, life expectancy in poor countries has
soared, from 46 to 63 years. The spread of education in developing
countries has been equally spectacular: The proportion of children aged 6
to 11 enrolled in school has risen from less than 50% in 1960 to about 70%
today.
   Interestingly, Simon's upbeat view does not depend on new technology.
The State of Humanity barely takes notice of computers. There is no mention
of the Internet, virtual reality, gene splicing, cellular telephones, or
any of the other marvels that are supposed to be boosting productivity and
improving the modern standard of living.
   Instead, Simon bases his forecasts on a simple principle: Assume that
long-term trends will continue, in the absence of convincing evidence to
the contrary. So if the steady accumulation of knowledge has produced a
rising standard of living for the past 200 years, there's no reason to
believe that things will suddenly change.
   Of course, many would consider Simon's view of the world to be naive.
The conventional wisdom is that global overpopulation is inexorably leading
to ecological and economic disaster--a modern version of Malthusian misery.
``For those who think the future may be a simple extrapolation of the past,
there may be some surprises ahead,'' observes Lester R. Brown, president of
Worldwatch Institute, in the forthcoming book State of the World 1996
(Norton). Brown, as committed a pessimist as Simon is an optimist, argues
that the ``spiraling human demands for resources are beginning to outgrow
the capacity of the earth's natural systems.''
   Food, especially, will be in short supply, in part because the people of
China and other growing nations will demand better diets as they become
richer. Notes Brown: ``Oil can be replaced with other energy sources, but
there is no replacement for food.''
   The State of Humanity tries to answer each of these negative arguments.
Despite the fears, Simon cites statistics from the Environmental Protection
Agency to assert that ``the air in the U.S. and in other rich countries is
irrefutably safer to breathe now than in decades past.'' Moreover, there is
no sign of any widespread food shortages yet. Crop yields have risen as
fast as world population. The price of food, like that of other natural
resources, is still falling compared with other goods and services.
   Simon points out that in every era, there have been doomsayers who see
the imminent end of civilization. For example, in the mid-1800s, the
British began to worry about running out of coal. Writes Simon: ``The great
English economist, Stanley Jevons, calculated that a shortage of coal would
bring England's industry to a standstill by 1900; he carefully assessed
that oil could never make a decisive difference.''
   Despite the power of its arguments, The State of Humanity does have some
flaws. The essays are of uneven quality--Simon's own contributions,
especially the introduction, are pointed and well-written, but some of the
other chapters are confusing and less than helpful. The book also suffers
from overkill. One grows weary of being told over and over how everything
is getting better all the time.
   Moreover, while whining about how the pessimists get more attention than
he does, Simon does not acknowledge that scaremongers are often responsible
for much of the improvement he cites. The death rate from all accidents,
for example, dropped by more than 20% over the past 10 years--thanks in no
small part to the consumer-safety advocates Simon professes to deplore.
Indeed, it may very well be that alarmism is the only way to stimulate an
effective response to large-scale problems, such as global warming and
ozone depletion, that require concerted multinational action.
   Still, The State of Humanity will become essential reading for anyone
who wants to put today's policy debates into a larger context. At a time
when politicians are locked in a bloody stalemate in Washington and many
Americans are disappointed with their lot, it's worth remembering the
progress that the human species has already made--and pondering the
potential for gains to come.

INTERNET 101 FOR BUSINESS

By:
BY IRA SAGER

THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence
By Don Tapscott
McGraw-Hill 342pp $24.95

Surf the Net these days and you'll soon find, alongside the obscure 'zines
and hip cyber hangouts, some of the biggest names in business. Kodak,
Aetna, AT&T, Eli Lilly, IBM--each has a home page on the World Wide Web.
They and scores of other companies hope online networks can provide a
direct link to the customer and a whole new realm of electronic commerce.
   Today, however, most are sputtering along the Information Highway,
offering little more than electronic brochures. To get beyond that, argues
Don Tapscott in The Digital Economy, businesses must build fundamentally
new strategies for competing in the electronic marketplace. ``When
information becomes digital and networked, walls fall and no business is
safe,'' Tapscott writes. On the other hand, companies that understand the
Net will blossom.
   Tapscott's mission is not to tell executives how to craft I-way
strategies but to help them grasp the changes the Net will bring so they
can start planning. This isn't uncharted territory: Tapscott, a consultant
who has written often on information technology, follows countless magazine
and book writers in predicting how the computing, telecommunications, and
media industries will converge. While he points out the possibilities, he
offers few fresh insights. He cites other consultants and quotes liberally
from business publications. Also, many of the companies Tapscott hails as
pioneers--Federal Express, Wal-Mart, Levi Strauss--are already well known
for their online strategies.
   Tapscott does well weaving into one tome the business, social, and
educational implications of networks. He lays out privacy and censorship
issues, and explores the Net's potential to change the way people interact
with the government. He also raises important questions about inequality
and the need to extend the Net to a broad base of citizens. The Digital
Economy doesn't offer solutions, but it can help executives contemplating
cyberspace to ask the right questions.

`I WANT BLOOD FOR BLOOD'

By:
JAMES DRAKE

In the north Albanian village of Bluji, deep in the Dukagjin highlands,
women and children do most of the work. Grandmothers scrub laundry on the
doorsteps of stone cottages. Young wives--some heavily pregnant--lug pails
of water along the rutted cart track from the communal well. Five-year-olds
spend long days in the fields tending scrawny livestock.
   Bluji's menfolk hold antiquated notions of gender roles, but it's fear
that keeps most of them from showing their faces: This is the land of the
blood feud, a centuries-old tradition. Kept in check during the communists'
rule, it reemerged three years ago, forcing some 10,000 able-bodied
breadwinners, out of a population of 3 million, into hiding.
SHAMEFUL. ``I want blood for blood,'' spits Nasi Gjini, polishing the
pre-1914 Lee Enfield rifle that has been his constant companion since his
two sons were shot to death by a neighbor in February. The deaths followed
an exchange of drunken insults. Now, the teenage assassin, his three
brothers, and his father stay indoors, thwarting Gjini's quest for revenge.
A murderer's male kin are fair game, but gunning them down in their own
house is more shameful than the original offense. ``Here I am safe,'' says
the Gjinis' killer, peering through the bars on his window. ``But this is
no kind of life. Only Allah knows how long I'll have to stay here.'' He
spends his days smoking, sleeping, and playing cards.
   The blood feud goes back to the 12th century and was a means of meting
out summary justice. After World War II, under dictator Enver Hoxha, the
practice was suppressed, with murderers executed and their families
ostracized. But with the fall of the regime, old ways quickly returned.
   The circle of violence is taking an economic toll among the hot-tempered
subsistence farmers. When Albania opened its doors for business, some
multinationals came courting the highlanders, bringing hard currency.
Leisure giants such as Club Med talked of opening ski resorts and hiking
lodges on the country's game-packed slopes and sending whitewater rafts
down its salmon rivers.
   ``But even if they had found local partners they could trust, there
would be no guarantee those partners would be alive the next morning,''
says Adnan Rama of the Albanian Tourist Ministry. Potential investors
backed off, taking their dollars and Deutschemarks with them. Most folks
run livestock on land too poor for farming. Some make a better living
smuggling oil, weapons, liquor and cigarettes to Serbia and Bosnia. But the
average income is just $30 per month.
   The Dukagjin district has seen some 350 revenge killings since 1993, and
the problem is spreading: Hill people who migrate to the cities in search
of work take their quarrels with them. ``I'd say around 20% of our murders
this year were connected to the feuds,'' estimates Shkelqim Merdani, police
chief in Tirana, the capital.
   In a bid to stop the madness, Islamic cleric Ndrek Pjetri formed the
Missionaries of Reconciliation, a group of holy men dedicated to ending
feuds. Its members act as go-betweens, often persuading the aggrieved party
to accept cash in place of blood. The mullah has even traveled to Turkey
and Germany to settle quarrels between expatriate Albanians, and in 1994,
he successfully petitioned the U.S. Embassy in Tirana to cancel a visa
granted to a man bound for New York to carry out a killing.
   For many here, honor means more than anything. Last year, on his 16th
birthday, a boy traveled to nearby Kopliku to avenge the killing of his
grandfather 40 years ago by a brutal police captain. Reaching Kopliku, he
found the killer had died. So he called out the captain's cousin, bade him
greet the grandfather, and dispatched him with a single bullet, thereby
removing a stain on his family's honor. The boy himself was killed before
he turned 17.
   The 68-year-old Pjetri claims to have resolved more than 170 disputes,
but new ones crop up too fast for the pack mules he uses to travel to
isolated villages. By the time he arrives, another murder may have taken
place. So he has applied for a government grant to buy a four-wheel-drive
vehicle. ``They say there isn't money,'' he says. ``I've told them they
should see it as an investment.''

IT'S FOR YOU--ON THE PC
Voice calling via the Internet is here and it's cheap-but don't toss your
phone yet

By:
BY JOHN W. VERITY

There's little, it seems, that the Internet doesn't provide: low-cost
electronic publishing, global E-mail delivery, instant access to every kind
of digital information and service. Now, it's promising ``free'' phone
calls between any two Net computers, more or less, and for no more money
than the usual connection fee.
   As it turns out, this is another one of those Internet concepts that
seem to offer exciting potential if not high-quality results just yet. It's
sort of like the idea of finding whatever information you need on the Net.
Sure, its computers are crammed with information, but as all Web surfers
soon discover, much of it is trivial.
MEETING PLACE. Likewise, the Internet can transmit speech cheaply, but not
in a satisfying or easy way. Right now, an Internet voice call has little
of the tone or intimacy of a regular phone call. It's more like talking
over CB radio. Still, it costs little to try, and when they work well,
Internet voice calls can be entertaining and useful. Besides saving money
on long-distance communications--even across oceans--Internet phoning can
enhance computer games. Eventually, phoning via the Internet may serve as
an inexpensive method for training and conference calls.
   How to get started? First, you'll need basic Internet knowhow and some
patience. For hardware, you'll need a Windows-compatible computer with a
50-megahertz 486 processor, a sound card, a speaker, and a microphone.
(Most Internet phone-software packages work only with Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows, but there are programs available for Apple Computer Inc.'s
Macintoshes and for Unix computers.) A 28.8-kilobits-per-second modem is
best, though some packages can work with 14.4-kbs models. Also required is
a SLIP/PPP connection to the Internet.
   There's already a choice of software. Trial versions are available at no
charge directly from the Web sites of several suppliers (table). Even in
compressed form, these lengthy programs can take 15 minutes or more to
download into your machine. Also, each is programmed to work only for a
limited time. VocalTec Inc.'s Internet Phone allows just 60 seconds of
calling time, for instance. You're free to take more than one copy--or pay
$49.95 for a limitless version. Internet Telephone Co.'s WebPhone program,
which was available free prior to Jan. 1, 1996, now costs $49.95.
   Each program does essentially the same thing--make your PC's sound card
convert the microphone's analog signals into a string of digital packets of
data that move separately across the Net like envelopes in a postal system.
Depending on the Net's traffic conditions at any given moment, consecutive
packets may take different routes through the Net and arrive out of order.
At the receiving end, telephony software will try to compensate, but it's
often impossible for the program to reconstruct the original signal
completely.
   None of this software is simple to install or use. There are numerous
network and computer parameters to set, and you'll need to plug in
specifics about your Internet addressing, for instance. It took me and a
friend more than an hour to get VocalTec's package to work. For WebPhone, I
sought the supplier's assistance.
TOUGH TALK. Once we had the software installed, we found out just how
different from conventional telephone calling Internet phone setups are.
The sound is choppy, syllables drop out of words, and it can take several
seconds for voices to traverse the Net. Each party must take turns
speaking--and they must be using the same brand of software. You must
either arrange a time to converse or scan your supplier's online directory
to find others around the world who are online and looking for
conversation. Directories often list people's preferred topics of
conversation, which range from the personal to lofty technical matters.
   Which software to choose? As the first to market, VocalTec's package has
become the most popular. Internet Telephone's WebPhone looks the best--like
a futuristic telephone with lots of point-and-click buttons. Quarterdeck
Corp. plans to enhance its WebTalk with a variety of multimedia tools to
help people collaborate over the Internet. You can keep up with the
technology's rapid evolution by seeing what enthusiasts post to the
independently run Voice on the Net E-mail list: Send the message,
``subscribe von-digest,'' to majordomo@pulver.com.
   For now, Internet telephony reminds me of the dancing elephant in a
circus: One is more impressed that it can dance at all than with the dance
itself. But at this stage, teaching the Internet new dances is really what
it's all about.

WHY IS THE U.S. SETTLING FOR STUNTED GROWTH?

By:
BY PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS

Economic growth has fallen on hard times. The budget struggle between
Congress and the Clinton Administration has been partly over whether the
economy will grow 2.3% annually or 2.5%. Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan has hinted that even this slow growth might not be possible
without a balanced budget.
   It was not always so. In the postwar era, growth was a liberal mantra.
Not even inflation-shy Republican Administrations could withstand its
imperative. The Ford Administration, for example, forecast a growth rate of
5.98% in average annual real gross national product for the 1976-80 period.
The Carter Administration brought us into the 1980s with a 4.7% average
annual real GNP growth projection for 1979-83.
   The attitude toward growth changed remarkably in 1981, when the Reagan
Administration forecast a 3.8% annual rate of real GNP growth from 1981 to
1985. The forecast was paltry compared with those for earlier periods and
was no higher than what the economy achieved from 1976 to 1980. But the
hyperbole flew fast. Reagan's forecast was denounced as a ``rosy scenario''
that ``lies far beyond the limits of any past experience in this country or
any other industrial democracy'' (The Washington Post, Mar. 9, 1981).
COOLED PASSION. What happened in such a short time span to make modest
economic-growth projections unwelcome? Environmental hysteria connecting
growth with pollution took a toll, as did the rising inflation that had
accompanied growth in the 1970s. But among macroeconomists themselves, the
cooled passion for growth may have reflected the change in the way it was
being pursued.
   In the postwar era, prosperity-peddling Keynesians connected economic
growth with the growth of government. True, in the Keynesian model, a tax
cut that increased the deficit would raise aggregate demand and economic
growth, but the tax cut multiplier was less than the government-spending
multiplier. That is, if economic growth was the goal, more government
spending was the efficient way to achieve it. Keynesian economics was a
political success because it merged economic growth with liberal compassion
and the propensity of politicians to build spending constituencies.
Moreover, the Keynesian model relied on a proactive government to manage
aggregate demand and produce full employment. Policymakers found this to be
a more gratifying approach than laissez-faire.
   Reagan's growth program was unpopular with macroeconomists because it
was not premised on the growth of government. Indeed, Reagan wanted to
curtail the growth of government, while increasing economic incentives to
individuals. This cut to the emotional core, and liberals who couldn't get
enough ``Keynesian'' growth were horrified at the prospect of
``supply-side'' growth.
   For many, supply-side economics has an even worse strike against it. It
maintains that fiscal policy works not by increasing aggregate demand, but
by raising aftertax rewards for work and investment. Supply-side economics
not only tolerates market-based income differences--it also links tax
policy with productivity growth and shows the high cost of using taxes to
level incomes.
   Liberal economists have responded not by resurrecting Keynesian demand
management--an impossible task--but by deemphasizing growth. One way of
doing this is to argue that regardless of policy, the economy cannot grow
any faster than its long-term average of 2.5% annually. Liberals then
narrowly limit economics to ``fairness'' issues. For example, Paul R.
Krugman, an economist at Stanford University, says that with a long-term
growth potential of 2.5%, it is pointless to increase incentives when the
only effect is more economic inequality.
   A downsizing of growth ambitions requires harsher cutbacks in welfare
and entitlements in order to contain the deficit or balance the budget. It
also means that policymakers cannot rely on income growth to compensate for
the slower growth in government programs or on job growth to absorb the
inflow of legal and illegal immigrants. The social and political
implications of slow growth may well prove more unpalatable than
``greed.''
   From 1982 to 1989, the U.S. economy grew at an average annual rate of
3.7%. The new ``2.5% inevitable growth school'' may argue either that these
seven years of above-inevitable growth occurred at the expense of future
growth or compensated for below-inevitable growth in the past. But the fact
remains that people experienced 3.7%, not the long-run average. The
electorate liked it, and the Washington policymakers who took it away are
history.

FED FEAR OF THE JOBLESS RATE
It may be a faulty inflation signal


By:
BY GENE KORETZ

Though they welcome the Federal Reserve's latest cut in short-term interest
rates, economists Mickey D. Levy of NationsBanc Capital Markets Inc. and
Joseph Carson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. both believe that Fed policy
remains far too restrictive in the face of growing economic weakness. As
they see it, the largest roadblock to a substantial easing of monetary
policy may well be the Fed's unjustified concern regarding the low
unemployment rate.
   Fed officials, says Levy, tend to believe in a so-called natural rate of
unemployment--that is, a rate at which labor markets are so tight that
further declines would spark rising inflation. Though estimates of that
rate have varied from 4% in the 1960s to 6.5% in the 1970s, the current
level is presumed to be just below 6%--placing November's 5.6% jobless rate
in the danger zone.
   Levy argues, however, that productivity progress by U.S. business
combined with the Fed's enhanced inflation-fighting credibility have
effectively lowered the natural rate of unemployment well below the
5.5%-to-6% range. By reaping productivity gains from restructuring and more
flexible use of labor (including contingent workers), as well as from
increased investment in technology, says Levy, business has improved its
resiliency in labor markets and boosted its leverage in wage bargaining.
   Meanwhile, growing job insecurity has made employees more docile. And
the Fed's tough anti-inflation stance has curbed employers' ability to pay
for wage hikes by raising prices. All of which, says Levy, suggests that
today's 5.6% jobless rate is far from a danger signal of impending
inflation.
   For his part, Carson notes that the meager 607,000 rise in employment
over the past 12 months (as measured by the Labor Dept.'s survey of
households) was matched by unusually sluggish labor force growth of just
724,000 people. This is only half of the 1.1% growth in the labor force in
1994 (chart), which was right in line with Labor Dept. projections.
   Carson attributes this sharp drop in labor force growth to declines in
labor force participation by 20-to-24-year-old and 55-to-64-year-old males.
He speculates that poor job prospects in 1995 inspired more young workers
to stay in school, while continued downsizing eroded the ranks of older
workers. In any case, he says, ``the thing to remember is that the
unemployment rate would be a half a percentage point higher if the labor
force had expanded at its trend rate.''
   Either Levy's or Carson's analysis may explain why inflation has stayed
so low with 5.6% unemployment. If, as seems likely, they are both right,
the Fed has more than ample room to ease aggressively in the months ahead.

WHAT'S STALLING MONETARY UNION
Europe's economies are out of sync


By:
BY GENE KORETZ

At first blush, the wave of European interest-rate cuts touched off by the
Bundesbank's latest move would seem to suggest that economic convergence is
growing. Christopher Widness of Chemical Securities Inc. points out,
however, that despite the synchronous rate cuts, the differences between
inflation rates (and interest rates) have actually widened. A year ago, for
example, French inflation was nearly a percentage point lower than German
inflation. Today it is higher. And the gaps between German inflation and
inflation in Spain and Italy have grown (chart).
   The irony, says Widness, is that in many countries, such as Italy and
Spain, fiscal restraint could boost inflation as sales tax hikes feed into
the price indexes and inspire wage pressures. And that spells increased
political strains that could short-circuit progress toward economic
convergence and monetary union.

A MILESTONE FOR BLACK FAMILIES
Fewer out-of-wedlock births

By:
BY GENE KORETZ

As reported by The Numbers News newsletter, black families in America have
made significant progress in at least one key area in recent years:
Birthrates among unmarried black women--including teenagers--declined in
1993 for the fourth year in a row. The birthrate fell from 90.7 per 1,000
unmarried black women age 15 to 44 in 1989 to 84.0 in 1993. By contrast,
the birthrate among unmarried white women, though far below that of blacks,
continues to rise sharply--from 30.2 in 1989 to 35.9 in 1993.

WHEN LAWYERS ARE LOOKERS
Attractiveness boosts earnings

By:
BY GENE KORETZ

Other things being equal, better-looking lawyers make more money than their
unattractive colleagues. That's the implication of a new study that looks
at how law school graduates of the 1970s fared in labor markets in
subsequent years. In the study, economists Jeff E. Biddle of Michigan State
University and Daniel S. Hamermesh of the University of Texas developed
attractiveness ratings based on class photos of students of a top law
school and then used survey data to gauge their career progress five and 15
years after graduation.
   The results indicated that attractive male attorneys (there were few
women in the group studied) made more money than plain or homely attorneys
after five years of practice, and the gap widened over time. Further, more
of the attractive group tended to become litigators, a specialty where good
looks are a likely asset, and to work in the higher-paying private sector,
where client relationships have a larger effect on earnings.
   Interestingly enough, the researchers found little payoff to
attractiveness among law school graduates of the 1980s. And while good
looks boosted the chances of males grads of both the 1970s and 1980s being
offered a law firm partnership after only five years of practice, they
actually lowered the chances of early partnership for young female
lawyers.

YOU MADE THE CALL

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

THE THIRD ANNUAL UP FRONT Reader Survey is gleaned from 288 responses to
our questionnaire, almost half via E-mail. It shows a sober group that's
cautiously optimistic and doesn't expect miracles.
   We asked about job security for the second year in a row. And the
answers were pretty close to last year's. In a time of corporate
downsizing, the share of those feeling less secure at work rose slightly,
from 32% to 36%, while people who are more secure was virtually unchanged.
Yet, despite all the gloom and doom we hear about how too few are saving
enough for old age, two-thirds project their old-age standard of living to
remain as is or get better.
   About the stock market, the consensus is for continued good times, with
an average prediction of 5754 for the Dow's 1996 high. Most
prognostications clustered in the 5251-6000 range. There's no consensus on
a favorite stock, though, with names scattered all over. The No.1 pick is a
tie between Microsoft and Intel, with 14 responses each.
   On matters not affecting them directly, namely the federal budget,
readers go for the conventional wisdom. Most name 2002 as the best target
date to balance the budget. Newt Gingrich wants to do the deed by then.
Now, so does Bill Clinton. There's a tempered optimism on the much
ballyhooed Information Highway. While a majority sees the Infobahn as the
driving force of tomorrow's economy, skeptics abound: To more than 40%,
it's just hype.

A FEW NEW BLOTS ON THE LEDGER
Delinquent consumer loans and skinny margins may temper an otherwise bully
year

By:
By Kelley Holland in New York, with Amy Barrett in Washington


It was beginning to look as if the good times would never end for U.S.
banks. Since 1991, profits have set record after record, asset quality has
sharply improved, and bank stocks have seemed headed for the moon. But now,
a few clouds are dotting the horizon. Consumers are beginning to have
trouble with heavy debt burdens. And the narrow gap between short- and
long-term rates bodes ill for banks' profit margins on loans and
investments. Although Merrill Lynch & Co. predicts that profits for 56 top
banks should grow 9.8% in 1996 (chart), pan in for a closeup and the
picture is murkier.
   The biggest potential problem is related to the ongoing growth in
lending. Consumer installment credit grew roughly 14% in 1995, according to
DRI/McGraw-Hill. While banks profit initially by providing that credit,
heavy consumer debt burdens mean more loan delinquencies down the road.
Indeed, the American Bankers Assn. says that late payments on bank-card
accounts have risen for four quarters in a row and are currently at their
second-highest level in 10 years. ``Consumer credit quality is, I think, a
very big short-term issue, potentially a big minefield,'' says Judah
Kraushaar, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch.
HARD TO FUDGE. Corporate lending is also expanding rapidly, raising
additional concerns about loan quality in 1996. James B. Lee, vice-chairman
at Chemical Banking Corp., the top bank in loan syndications, says
corporate lending will increase through 1996, but ``certain [industry]
sectors will continue to deteriorate.'' That will prompt some borrowers to
fall behind on payments or default. Lee says lending standards are far
higher than they were in the late 1980s. However, the intense competition
to make many loans suggests that some banks are willing to offer loan terms
that leave little room for error.
   Then there is the problem of profit margins. Today, there's less than
one percentage point between the short-term rates at which banks borrow and
the longer-term rates at which they typically lend. That means room for
profits is scarce. A 1995 study by Merrill Lynch shows that bank stocks
have been poor performers nearly every year following periods when short-
and long-term interest rates are close together. ``This is a hard yield
curve to work with,'' says Jeffrey C. Keil, president of Republic New York
Corp.
   Luckily, banks still have plenty of wind at their backs. While loan
delinquencies are rising, they are still relatively scarce, and banks need
to use only small portions of their earnings as reserves for bad credits.
Moreover, new businesses are expanding for some of the biggest banks. At
J.P. Morgan & Co., Thomas B. Ketchum, head of investment banking for the
Americas, expects corporate-finance fees for services such as advising on
mergers to increase 40% in 1996.
   Expect many banks to be intensely cost-conscious in the coming year.
Bank mergers will likely continue at gale force: Gerard Smith, managing
director in the financial institutions group of UBS Securities Inc.,
predicts that by 2000, the top 50 banks will control 80% of the assets in
the U.S. banking industry, up from 56% today. And many deals will be
predicated on massive cost savings.
REFORM DELAY. Spending on technology will grow in 1996. Most bankers, eager
to see their customers reduce their use of high-cost branches and step up
use of electronic banking outlets, are placing large bets on systems for
banking by phone or personal computer. Edward E. Crutchfield Jr., chairman
and CEO of First Union Corp. and one of the country's most acquisitive
bankers, plans to stop buying banks for five years while he invests in
electronic retail banking. ``As soon as we really do have a choice for the
customer to make that's realistic, then he will move away from branches,''
he says.
   Changes will be harder to come by on the regulatory front. Banks have
been stymied on the big revisions they sought in 1995, such as an end to
the barriers between commercial and investment banking, and they could well
be frustrated again. Banks and insurance agents need to agree on provisions
to limit the forays of banks into the insurance business before such
banking law reform can move forward.
   Having waited this long for deregulation, bank executives aren't holding
their breath. However, for those who keep a sharp eye on operations, pay
close attention to the creditworthiness of borrowers, and plan for
electronic banking, 1996 could be a very good year indeed.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The financial condition of banks is excellent and leaves them well
prepared to weather any economic slowdown.
   -- Managed properly, the ongoing consolidation in the industry will make
it more efficient.

Negatives
   -- Consumers have been loading up on debt, and consumer loan
delinquencies are rising.
   -- Profit margins on consumer and corporate loans could decline, hurting
bank earnings.

JOHN DEWEY, MEET PETER DRUCKER

By:
By Paul Magnusson in Washington


Your revenues are rising, but not as fast as the cost of serving customers.
Labor costs are climbing, but antiquated work rules and poor morale limit
your flexibility. Your overseas competitors pay more, spend lavishly on
training, and get far better results. Your physical plant is crumbling.
Computers are scarce. And your customers are dissatisfied.
   Welcome to America's public school system. Its problems are so profound
and its disorganization so pervasive that it would be a challenge to the
savviest of America's business managers. Just for starters: There is no
central management--only 16,000 local school districts run by amateur
boards pursuing their own agendas: football, creationism, condom
distribution.
   The school-board situation isn't going to change anytime soon, since
local control is considered an inalienable right in America. But some help
for what ails the schools is on the way, thanks to contemporary management
theory. Two related movements--toward school choice and school
standards--have far more to do with Peter F. Drucker than with John Dewey.
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. School-choice advocates hope to foster competition
among schools. That way, the weakest schools will lose students and either
improve or fold. The strongest schools will prosper and expand. One plan
would offer vouchers for purchasing education from existing private and
public schools. Vouchers are strongly opposed by teachers' unions and the
Clinton Administration. They argue that some kids will be left in bad
schools and some schools will use the wrong lures--such as lavish spending
on sports. Still, Republicans will give school choice a boost if their
numbers increase in state legislatures this year.
   Other reformers favor charter schools that contract to provide education
to willing public-school students. Often operating out of storefronts or
underused public buildings and free of bureaucracy, charter schools are
generally cost-effective. These schools must demonstrate results or lose
their charters. There are some 245 of them in 19 states. ``This is just
applying America's entrepreneurial spirit to the school,'' says Joseph
Nathan, director of the Center for School Change, a research group in
Minnesota that is tracking the trend.
   Curriculum reform based on setting universal standards of knowledge is
progressing much faster. It is based on sound business principles: First
you decide what students should learn, and then you hold teachers and
administrators accountable. ``In states where they take standards
seriously, they have seemed to make a difference,'' says Marc Tucker,
president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, which helps
schools in the standards effort. Critics complain that teachers will
concentrate on drilling students to pass tests instead of pursuing broader
educational objectives. Still, parents seem to like the results. In their
second year of a standards-based curriculum, Maryland students boosted
their scores by 25%.
   Pressure for schools to become more efficient is intense. Immigration is
swelling enrollments. The number of students with limited proficiency in
English jumped by 26% during the 1980s. And children who require special
education increased by 15% over the past decade. ``We've got a whole influx
of kids who have been exposed to alcohol and drugs, hurt by environmental
contaminants, or diagnosed with learning difficulties,'' says Kathy
Christie, a Denver-area school board member and an analyst at the Education
Commission of the States.
FALLING BEHIND. All this is happening as an unpaid bill for neglect of
school buildings is coming due. One-third of America's schools, serving
some 14 million students, require extensive repair or replacement,
according to a 1995 report by the General Accounting Office. A quarter of
all public schools lack sufficient computers, and 42% have inadequate
science laboratories, says the GAO.
   That is a lot for local school boards to deal with. Without a clear
focus on educational goals, they tend to ``pay too much attention to
asbestos and not enough to training teachers and developing curriculum,''
says Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences. American
science scholarship in grade school is falling behind because much of the
industrialized world pays ``enormously more attention to teacher refresher
courses and to professional development,'' says Alberts.
   America's management gurus may not have the whole solution. But the
notion that schools must measure and improve their output--graduates who
can read and do math--can only help.

INDUSTRY OUTLOOK

By:
By Mike McNamee in Washington, with Richard A. Melcher in Chicago,
Elisabeth Malkin in Mexico City, Wendy Zellner in Dallas, and bureau
reports


On medieval maps, the terra incognita around the borders was festooned with
whirlpools, dragons, and dire warnings: ``Here there be monsters!'' In
1996, as the U.S. economy sails into uncharted waters, its map might well
be decorated with cherubs and zephyrs. Refreshed after 1995's slowdown and
wafted along by falling interest rates, American business should glide into
1996, leaving in its wake steady if not sparkling growth through the sixth
year of expansion.
   Favorable portents abound. Congress and the White House seem certain to
deliver a plan to whack hundreds of billions out of federal deficits over
the last half of the '90s. Even with the budget unresolved, the Federal
Reserve cut short-term interest rates on Dec. 19 from 5.75% to 5.5%--the
first of three 25-basis-point cuts that Fed-watchers expect by the end of
1996. That's welcome news: ``We'll see growth in '96, but I think we'll see
more of it if the Fed keeps lowering rates,'' says Ross J. Centanni,
president of air-compressor maker Gardner Denver Machinery Inc.
   Coupled with continued low inflation, the Fed's easing will ratify the
remarkable rally in bond prices, keeping crucial long-term rates down. That
will provide a lift to housing and commercial real estate. And America's
top trading partners should struggle out of their 1995 doldrums and buy
more from U.S. manufacturers.
SCROOGES GALORE. That's not to say that business will sail effortlessly
through the year. The 23 industries profiled by BUSINESS WEEK in this
year's Industry Outlook will need skillful navigation to steer through
shifting currents. The sectors that will lead the way through 1996 will
either enjoy continuing strong demand--such as semiconductor makers or Wall
Street's securities houses--or, like defense manufacturers, will continue
to squeeze more profits out of shrinking sales.
   Laggards will find themselves on the wrong side of 1996's negative
trends: slower growth in capital spending, pressure on pricing, and
tight-fisted consumers. After a three-year modernization binge with
12%-plus growth rates in capital spending, investment in producers' durable
equipment will rise only 6% in 1996, after adjustment for inflation. Even
computer makers will lose some altitude, with inflation-adjusted sales
rising 18% in 1996, vs. 27.1% growth in 1995, according to forecasts by
DRI/McGraw-Hill.
   The '90s efficiency boom will spell trouble for any producer trying to
raise prices in 1996. In a BUSINESS WEEK/Harris Executive Poll in December
(page 76), only 40% of the executives surveyed predict they will raise
prices in 1996, down from the 63% who were confident of price hikes before
1995 began. ``We're in a buyer's market,'' says Bradford W. Hildebrandt, a
management consultant to law firms. And carmakers, restaurateurs,
retailers, and other businesses catering to consumers will find they're
dealing with wary customers, thanks to debt burdens that have hit a record
19% of disposable income. ``Debt is putting a lot of pressure on
households, particularly the under-$50,000 families'' who are the core of
the mass market, says economist Mark M. Zandi of forecasters Regional
Financial Associates.
   But even careful consumers will spend enough to keep the economy
growing. Jobs and income will keep rising, and inflation will stay low,
with consumer prices up about 2.9%. That will help keep long-term interest
rates near their low 1995 levels, with yields on the 30-year Treasury bond
averaging 6.3% for 1996. All told, BUSINESS WEEK expects the economy to
turn in a better performance in 1996 than 1995: The gross domestic product
will grow about 2.3%, after inflation, from the fourth quarter of 1995 to
the end of 1996. That's up from the 2% expected when the books are closed
on 1995 (charts, pages 74, 74A).
   That 2.3% growth may not sound like much, but, remember, the scale for
measuring the economy is changing. The Commerce Dept. is adjusting the way
it calculates growth in GDP--in particular, how much of growth represents a
real increase in output vs. how much results from inflation. The old system
tended to overemphasize growth in surging industries with falling prices,
primarily computers, thus ballooning the economy's overall growth rate.
   The new ``chain-weighted'' measures will reflect price changes more
quickly, resulting in less exaggeration of fast-growing sectors. So while
the old scale measured GDP growing at a respectable 2.8% in 1995, the
Commerce Dept. will probably report a 2% gain by the new measures--forcing
business and economists to recalibrate notions of what constitutes a
``weak'' or ``strong'' economy. BUSINESS WEEK uses the chain-weighted
system in this report.
GROWING SEASON. However you measure it, the 1996 economy will feature some
familiar trends, such as downsizing. Outplacement specialists Challenger
Gray & Christmas Inc. predict that corporate layoffs will total 420,000 in
1996, matching 1995's level. Payroll-shedding will be most common in
industries where the government's role, either as a purchaser or a
regulator, is shrinking: defense, aerospace, telecommunications, banking,
and utilities.
   Slash-and-burn alone, however, will no longer dominate strategy
sessions. ``Very few companies have created sustainable advantages through
shrinking,'' says Thomas J. Tierney, managing director of consultants Bain
& Co. More companies say they're focusing on growth strategies designed to
increase sales, boost market share, and expand overseas. In a September
survey of senior planning executives at 100 large U.S. corporations, 73%
said that boosting revenues would be more important than cutting costs over
the next three years, according to the Futures Group Inc., strategic
planning consultants. Only 18% of the executives surveyed emphasized
belt-tightening.
   One of the fastest routes to growth is acquisition. The 1995 merger boom
will keep rolling--whether it's telephone and media giants scrambling for
stronger positions in explosive communications markets or doctors banding
together for clout to deal with insurers. Defense contractors, electric
utilities, drugmakers, and banks are all feeling the heat. ``People realize
they need scale to compete--and it's easier to buy than to build,'' says
mergers and acquisitions expert Kim Fennebresque, managing director of
Union Bank of Switzerland. ``If you have scale, you can reduce costs.''
   Take Union Pacific Corp., awaiting government approval for its $3.9
billion purchase of Southern Pacific Rail Corp. Ronald J. Burns, CEO of
Union Pacific Railroad Co., figures the combined lines will reap nearly
$700 million a year in cost savings and increased revenues when the deal is
digested. With economies like that within reach, Securities Data Co.
expects 1996's M&A activity to top the record $442 billion in 1995 deals
reported as of Dec. 18.
   Internal investment will remain heavy, too. For some industries, even a
three-year boom in capital spending hasn't satisfied the need for more
production capacity: Semiconductor makers are scrambling to build enough
clean rooms to keep up with 20%-plus growth in chip demand. Even sectors
with plenty of new facilities must upgrade for global competition. ``When
you're in a harsh, competitive environment, you can't stop modernizing,''
says Roger E. Brinner, DRI chief economist. Pharmaceutical firms, which
boosted research spending by a relatively low 8% in 1995, plan to beef up
budgets in search of blockbuster drugs.
   Steel is an example of the modernization drive. Despite 1995's collapse
in prices, steelmakers are rushing to build minimills. While each new
minimill wreaks havoc on existing producers, cheaper production gives steel
an edge over other materials: Builders, for example, are using more steel
and less concrete. ``People say steel demand is inelastic,'' says Nucor
Corp. Chairman F. Kenneth Iverson. ``But when you drop the price, you
expand the market.''
   Many industries will be looking abroad to expand their markets in 1996.
``We're not planning on the U.S. economy to carry us in 1996,'' says Daniel
J. Meyer, CEO of Cincinnati Milacron Inc. Outfits such as Milacron looking
to expand sales abroad can count two strong pluses in 1996: American
industry is now ranked the world's most competitive, according to the
Swiss-based World Economic Forum. And America's top trading partners, after
a poor-to-disastrous 1995, see better economies ahead.
   The biggest surprise may be Japan. After a 33% surge in the Nikkei stock
index, coupled with the Bank of Japan's success at stabilizing the yen at
around 100 to the dollar, Tokyo pundits are hopeful that economic
stagnation will finally end after four flat years. Forecasters expect
Japan's GDP to grow by 1.2% or more in 1996, after inflation.
   That growth should open up possibilities for U.S. exporters. American
brands are increasingly popular in Tokyo's Ginza, where Gap Inc. recently
opened a store to push its low-key apparel. U.S. computer makers hold about
30% of Japan's $9 billion PC market, with Compaq Computer Corp. and IBM
expecting to reap even more sales from the recent rollout of a Japanese
version of Windows 95. Even American carmakers are pushing at the gates in
hopes of capitalizing on last summer's U.S.-Japan trade deal: Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. unveiled right-hand-drive models of the Taurus and
Neon at this fall's Tokyo auto show.
RECOVERING PESO. The other sick economy of 1995--Mexico--will also show
signs of health. Following last winter's peso crisis, the Mexican economy
has shrunk by at least 7%. U.S. exports to Mexico fell by 9% in 1995, while
the cheap peso powered a sharp 30% rise in Mexican sales to El Norte. Now,
Mexico seems set for a slow recovery, with 1.5% to 2% growth in 1996
followed by 4% or more in 1997. That won't ignite a boom in U.S. export
sales, but pressure on the trade imbalance could ease if the peso gains
strength against the dollar.
   U.S. companies account for the bulk of the $6.3 billion in direct
investments in Mexico pledged for 1996. AT&T, MCI Communications, and Bell
Atlantic are spending heavily to prepare for the 1997 opening of
telecommunications. Privatization will spread to petrochemical plants and
railroads in 1996, and Mexico is encouraging foreigners to invest in
natural-gas distribution and power plants. U.S. corporations increasingly
see Mexico as an attractive production base for sales to the rest of Latin
America. ``We can tie together manufacturing in the U.S. and Mexico and go
after markets in South America,'' says Kenneth C. Brown, president of GE de
Mexico.
   Forecasters don't expect much help with the trade balance from Canada's
rebounding economy, which the Bank of Montreal predicts will grow 3.5% in
1996. With the weak Canadian dollar (trading at around U.S. 73 cents) and
with shaky Canadian consumers holding on to their wallets, Canada's
southbound exports may grow faster than the flow of goods northward. That
could push Canada's merchandise trade surplus with the U.S. to a record $27
billion in 1996, says Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Toronto brokerage
Nesbitt Burns.
   Europe may not do much for the U.S. trade balance in 1996, either. While
members of the European Union recently unveiled their proposed unified
currency, the Euro, the recent French strikes to protest budget-cutting in
Paris highlight the difficulty that EU members will have in meeting the
stringent fiscal requirements for monetary union. French forecasters expect
growth of only 1% in 1996. Germany is healthier, but business there is
struggling to remain competitive in the face of high wages and taxes.
``Europe still has the pain and agony of downsizing and restructuring ahead
of it,'' says Nariman Behravesh, DRI's chief international economist, who
predicts 2.3% growth for the EU in 1996.
   For fast growth, U.S. exporters will once again have to turn to Asia.
The economies of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan,
and Thailand will grow at rates between 5% and 9% in 1996, down just
slightly from 1995. Texas Instruments Inc., for instance, has an Asian
export winner in its high-end digital-signal processing chips, made in
America and sold for use in interactive toys, telecom gear, and video
devices. TI's Asian sales rose 50% in 1996, says Victor Koh, managing
director for Hong Kong and China, in part because Asians are buying more
electronics for their own use. ``We're benefiting from the higher affluence
in Asia,'' he says.
   Global crosscurrents will make 1996 the third strong year for American
exports, which should grow a further 9% after adjustment for inflation. At
the same time, subdued U.S. consumers may cut down on their purchases of
goods made abroad. So while the U.S. will still run a trade deficit, the
improved trade balance should add some $18 billion to GDP in 1996, says
Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Inc., marking ``the first
time this decade that net exports have been a plus for U.S. growth rather
than a drag.''
BETTER THINGS TO DO. Export gains, continued capital spending, low
inflation, and falling interest rates--what could go wrong with this
picture? The biggest threat to the serene economy of 1996 may lie in
Washington. In their struggle over balancing the budget, President Clinton
and congressional Republicans have already shut down major portions of the
federal government twice and spooked the markets.
   Still, neither the White House nor Capitol Hill has much to gain from a
budget stalemate. For both sides, the best course is to strike a deal and
move on to matters closer to politicians' hearts--such as campaigning for
November's elections. If Washington's dragons and sea serpents will just
get out of the way, the U.S. economy could enjoy fair winds in 1996.

TEA LEAVES, ANYONE?

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

Once again, Up Front bravely predicts the future. We undertake this
foolhardy venture on the basis of what we know about the past. That often
can lead one astray, but it's the best we've got.
THE '96 ELECTION. It's Bill Clinton, the Comeback Kid, for four more years.
Vilified for much of his first term, he still will outshine his dour GOP
challenger, Bob Dole. Right-wing Republicans, uneasy about deal-cutter
Dole, will stay home. Ross Perot will mount a third-party foray and skim
off more GOP voters. Public dismay over Gingrichian harshness will give the
Dems back the House but not the Senate.
STOCK MARKET. Funny thing how the economy and the market usually go up in
an election year. Aided by lowering interest rates and ebbing inflation,
the Dow should rise moderately, to 5600, by Election Day. Nothing like
1995's performance, however, since that's hard to top.
INTEREST RATES. An eventual federal budget accord--neither party wants to
be accused of gridlock--should give the Federal Reserve all the ammo it
needs to lower rates some more. Look for the Fed, satisfied that inflation
is under control, to reduce the federal-funds rate by a half-point, to 5%,
by spring. Then it will lay off, so as not to get tangled up in electoral
politics.
MONETARY UNION. The much heralded European Monetary Union will be shelved
during a summit this summer. Other than Germany, no European country is
close to hitting fiscal targets set up by the Maastricht Treaty for a
single currency. These require cutting budget deficits and debt by 1997. As
the strikes in France show, the necessary austerity is not popular. Plus,
Europe's economies are weakening, which will make achieving the treaty's
goals even harder.
APPLE. Woebegone Apple Computer will sell off chunks of its business, since
no buyer wants the whole thing. Look for Oracle's Larry Ellison, Sun
Microsystems, or IBM to acquire software. Japan's Canon could be a buyer
for the hardware.
DISNEY. Mickey's run of smash animated films will end with this summer's
release of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. While not a bust, this flick will
do nowhere near the box office of The Lion King blockbuster or even the
moderate hit Pocahontas. In a bid to lure boys and teens, Disney chose
Quasimodo's unlovely tale. This downbeat story, though, will turn off
traditional Disney fans. Plus, the movie has few of the soaring musical
numbers that punctuated earlier efforts.
CHRYSLER. A nasty proxy fight erupts as Kirk Kerkorian challenges Chrysler.
His goal is to name his lieutenant Jerome York to the board, launch a huge
stock buyback, and double the dividend. Result: CEO Robert Eaton fends off
the billionaire. Eaton shunts some of the company's $6.4 billion in spare
cash--which Kerkorian wanted to use for dividends and buybacks--into the
more productive pursuit of a joint venture with a foreign auto maker.
THE INTERNET. Net fever will cool off a notch or two. With scads of
companies already on the Net but profits scarce, new offerings will taper
off. Look for consolidation among the companies providing Net services.
Most likely winners: America Online, Netscape, Microsoft.

SMARTEST MOVES OF 1995

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

1. AT&T focused its energies on the booming telecom market by forging plans
to spin off its manufacturing arm and its problem-plagued computer unit
(the former NCR). The stock has soared since, wiping out all the NCR
losses.
2. Early investors in the Netscape public offering profited outrageously.
Since going public at 28 last summer, it topped 150 by early December.
3. Colin Powell adroitly managed his public persona with his book tour. By
then ruling out a Presidential bid, he avoids the mud of the 1996
primaries. So he's free to be crowned the GOP Vice-Presidential nominee.
4. Kirk Kerkorian advanced his battle to win more influence at Chrysler by
hiring its former CFO, Jerome York. York's baleful analyses of the
carmaker's finances grabbed investor attention.
5. Caterpillar hung tough and got the United Auto Workers to come back from
their 18-month strike, accepting terms they rejected at the outset.

DUMBEST MOVES OF 1995

By:
EDITED BY LARRY LIGHT, WITH PAUL ENG

1. Daiwa Bank let a U.S.-based trader run up $1.1 billion in losses. A key
regulator at Japan's Ministry of Finance knew about the mess but let it
slide.
2. Barings collapsed because it didn't know until too late that
Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson ran up $1.4 billion in losses.
3. Newt Gingrich's abrasiveness and vainglory blunted his message. Big
example: He said he favored shutting down the government in November partly
out of pique that Bill Clinton made him sit in the back of Air Force One.
4. Calvin Klein was forced to withdraw his jeans ads, which used teen
models in suggestive poses. Critics accused him of purveying kiddie porn.
5. ABC knuckled under to Philip Morris' $10 billion libel suit over a
program about cigarettes' nicotine content that contained one defensible
error.

FROM CHRISTMAS BLAHS TO NEW YEAR'S EASE

By:
BY JAMES C. COOPER & KATHLEEN MADIGAN

While Congress and the White House play their political games over the
budget, they seem oblivious to the dangers of testing the patience of the
financial markets. With so much anticipation for deficit reduction already
priced into the markets, Wall Street had better get some good news from
Washington fast, or another 102-point tumble in stock prices and a sharp
sell-off in bonds like those of Dec. 18 could be in the making.
   For now, at least, the markets have taken solace from elsewhere in
Washington: the Federal Reserve. The Fed's Dec. 19 quarter-point cut in
short-term interest rates has soothed the markets' edginess, not so much
because of that one snip but because it now looks as though more policy
easing is on the way.
   The strongest hint of that is the reason given by the Fed for its latest
cut. Chairman Alan Greenspan cited not a soft economy but inflation that
was ``somewhat more favorable than anticipated.'' More important, he noted
``an associated moderation in inflation expectations.'' The two-point drop
during the past year in long-term bond yields, which incorporate
anticipated inflation, bears that out.
   If such expectations are indeed down, the Fed cannot justify holding its
overnight federal funds rate nearly three full points above the rate of
inflation, in light of an historical average of only about 1 3/4%. What
Greenspan is saying is this: Against a more sanguine attitude toward future
inflation, real short-term rates are simply too high.
   Moreover, these expectations of lower inflation are not fleeting. They
are set to stay down amid continued modest economic growth, an eventual
budget deal, a stronger dollar, and a new order of technology-driven
competitiveness in Corporate America.

THE IMPACT of these structural forces is clear in the November consumer
price index, which was flat for the first time since the end of the last
recession in March, 1991. The core index, which excludes the volatile
energy and food sectors, rose a scant 0.1%.
   Through November, annual CPI inflation was running at 2.6%, the same as
in 1994, and it seems likely to have ended 1995 very near that pace. Back
in July, the Fed's own forecast projected that inflation for the year would
be much higher, between 3.1% and 3.4%.
   Even service inflation, widely anticipated to be the first area to
register a speedup, has remained modest, at about 3.4% for most of the
year. Meanwhile, goods inflation, at 1.5% in November, is hardly on the
radar (chart). However, that low rate is the result of deep discounting by
many retailers, which threatens their profits--and for some, their very
existence.
   Retailers' dreary little Christmas provides additional support for a
winter rate cut. Despite the expected last-minute surge, stores still
reported pretty dismal sales in December. Rampant price promotions to lure
shoppers subtracted from dollar revenues. The early winter weather in some
parts of the nation only added to the problem. The Johnson Redbook Report
said December sales at department and discount stores through Dec. 23 were
2.4% below November sales.
   Lifeless sales mean that yearend profits will be a disaster for many
retailers, and the consolidation process already wracking the industry will
accelerate. More chains, especially regional discounters and apparel
stores, are likely to seek bankruptcy protection.
   The resulting liquidations could well lead to further downward pressure
on goods prices. If so, an actual decline in the monthly CPI in any of the
coming months cannot be ruled out.
   This lack of price pressure should bolster the strong low-inflation
sentiment in the bond market. And given the Fed's statement on inflationary
expectations, low long-term rates will give the central bank even more room
for another rate cut.

DO THE RETAIL WOES mean that the economy is tanking? Not necessarily. Much
of the profits decline stemmed from price cutting, so sales on an
inflation-adjusted basis should look somewhat better. Also, consumer
confidence, while down slightly in December, remains at the level it has
held for most of 1995 (chart).
   Moreover, according to one top Fed official, the central bank is aware
that the reports from individual retailers do not match the data used to
calculate the Commerce Dept.'s retail sales figures. And those retail
numbers do not include service purchases, which have remained healthy in
recent months.
   But while consumer buying is not as dramatically weak as the dour
reports from retailers would suggest, demand will still be no better than
modest. One reason is that in early 1996 consumers will have to contend
with their holiday credit-card bills.

THE RESULT WILL BE continued pressure on industrial output and employment,
as businesses adjust their inventories to more desirable levels. That
scenario should translate into unexciting economic growth in the new
year--another reason the Fed will have room to ease policy further.
   In October, inventories held by manufacturers, wholesalers, and
retailers rose 0.6%, but sales tumbled 0.4%. During the past year, the
annual growth rates of both inventories and sales have been slowing, but
the pace of sales has slowed faster (chart).
   That disparity is the chief reason for the continued sluggishness in the
industrial sector. Industrial production in November rose a tepid 0.2%,
following a decline in October. Output for the fourth quarter is on track
to rise even more slowly than the lackluster 3.2% annual rate posted in the
third quarter.
   The international economic climate is also conducive to rate cutting.
Even before the Fed's Dec. 19 move, the British Treasury and the German
Bundesbank had trimmed rates in the face of slower economic growth. And
following the Fed, the Bank of Canada eased monetary policy as well.
   Other European central banks followed the German lead, as growth
throughout Europe appears to be slowing, leading most private forecasters
to cut their projections for 1996 European growth. Almost all
industrialized nations reported weak holiday sales.
   Consequently, the dollar should be able to maintain its recent trend of
appreciation against the German mark and the Japanese yen, even in the face
of further rate reductions by the Fed. The greenback will get some added
support when a budget deal rolls in from Washington--whenever that may take
place.
   That delay, however, will not hamstring monetary policy. In the recently
released minutes of the Fed's Nov. 15 meeting, the central bankers agreed
that the Fed ``could not freeze its policy options while it awaited the
outcome of a prolonged federal budget debate.''
   Now that Shutdown II has stretched to record length, the Fed's refusal
to be tied to the political wrangling means that economic and inflationary
forces will set the course of monetary policy in early 1996. And right now,
those forces point to further easing ahead.

A HARD-WON VICTORY IN A SOFT ECONOMY

By:
BY JAMES C. COOPER & KATHLEEN MADIGAN

After a dismal 1995, Argentina is poised for an expansionary 1996. And that
growth will pave the way for fiscal improvement and a stable currency.
   The latest sign that Argentina is coming out of recession came from the
Latin America Research Fund. The private agency reported that demand for
industrial goods rose again in November. Purchases have been increasing
since hitting a three-year low in August, with capital goods leading the
gain. In addition, in its semiannual survey the government said that the
unemployment rate slipped to 16.4% in October, from a record high of 18.4%
in May. However, only part of the drop is the result of job growth of
40,000 new slots. The rest came from workers dropping out of the labor
force.
   Argentina's economy likely fell by 2.5% in 1995, but the government is
forecasting growth of 5% in 1996. Private economists expect a more
realistic 3% advance this year. Economic growth should be fueled by lower
interest rates, a stronger peso--thanks to its link to the rising U.S.
dollar and low inflation--and inflows of foreign funds. Already, prospects
of better corporate profits have lifted the stock market in recent weeks.
   Economic growth will keep the markets rising. And it will help the
government balance the budget in 1996, after Argentina's $2.4 billion
deficit in 1995. To raise revenues, Congress hiked the cigarette tax by 7%
on Dec. 21.
   Argentina's slump was the result of an austerity program to fight
hyperinflation--a battle that has succeeded so far. Consumer prices were up
1.7% from a year ago in November (chart). Inflation is on track to rise
between 1.5% and 1.7% for 1995, the lowest rate on record. In 1989,
Argentine inflation ran at a stunning 5,000%.
   The International Monetary Fund has blessed Argentina's economic and
fiscal progress, saying it would lend Argentina $380 million this year.
That influx of funds--along with private money attracted by the rising
stock market--is added insurance that Argentina's economy will grow in
1996.

HERE COMES GRIDLOCK '96
Dug-in liberals and GOP zealots spell election-year paralysis

By:
By Richard S. Dunham, with Lee Walczak, in Washington

Citing irreconcilable differences with his Republican foes, President
Clinton vetoes appropriations bill after appropriations bill, leaving large
chunks of the government to run on fumes. A bitter budget impasse shutters
the federal bureaucracy for the longest stretch in history, forcing the
Treasury to resort to creative accounting to fund essential arms of
government. Voters increasingly dismiss the capital caterwauling as the
latest example of Washington's childishness. Actually, there's another way
to describe the capital's escalating political brawl: dress rehearsal.
   As the 1995 legislative season draws to a rancorous close with the fate
of a budget-balancing accord, welfare reform, and other key legislation
unresolved, the tone is being set for next year's policy struggles. In the
best of times, an election-year Congress can be expected to elevate
political theatrics over substance. But the ideological differences between
dug-in Democratic liberals, GOP hardliners, and a President obsessed by
reelection will ensure that next year's Congress--and any chance business
had for advancing the solid legislative gains of '95--will be stymied by
paralyzing political gamesmanship.
   Even as GOP and Administration budget negotiators warily convened for a
round of post-Christmas talks, the realization was growing that after
months of Republican dominance, Washington has once again become Gridlock
City. ``We're ready to kill each other already,'' laments a Democratic
leadership aide. ``It can't get any worse--can it?''
   Actually, it can, and it will. Bolstered by his success at using the
Medicare debate to paint Republicans as extremists, President Clinton plans
to continue his political jiu-jitsu in 1996. The new target: a GOP flat-tax
proposal that the Administration will cast as a boondoggle for wealthy
investors. Says a Clinton adviser: ``Medicare was just a dress rehearsal
for what Republicans are in for when Democrats start in on the `tax
giveaway for the rich.'''
HANGING TOUGH. If Clinton is spoiling for another fight along class lines,
he's sure to find one with a combative group of Hill conservatives who are
not letting House Speaker Newt Gingrich's plunging popularity cool their
fervor. The freshmen have hardened GOP resistance to a budget-balancing
accord and promise to make more trouble next year by redoubling attacks on
the welfare state.
   The hang-tough tactics ``haven't been marching orders from Newt
Gingrich,'' says rookie Representative Steve Largent (R-Okla.). ``We came
in here with our name on the dotted line.'' Adds freshman Representative
Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.): ``We've been called radical and extreme, but I think
we're right out of the heart of America.'' Still, business leaders worry
that the freshmen's all-or-nothing approach is overly antagonistic. ``The
war is worth fighting,'' says Amway President Dick DeVos. ``But it
shouldn't be done stupidly.''
   To appreciate just how complicated 1996's legislative equation will be,
take a short stroll across the Capitol from the foxholes of House GOP
guerrillas to the placid quarters of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. The
Republican front-runner will pursue his own agenda--and none of it includes
riling potential voters, Gingrich-style. Dole plans a light Senate schedule
for the first three months of '96, which will give him lots of time to wrap
up the nomination. Concedes one senior House staffer: ``All we're going to
get done around here is the minimum must-pass agenda.''
   Even a minimal Hill agenda could fall victim to gridlock. Aside from
monitoring preliminary hearings on radical simplification of the tax code,
business is keenest on winning regulatory relief from nuisance lawsuits,
environmental mandates, and overeager regulators who don't weigh the
potential economic impact of new rules. The outlook for sweeping change is
even gloomier. For starters, Dems will continue to score political points
by portraying GOP reformers as too cozy with polluters and overly beholden
to corporate benefactors. And House and Senate Republican moderates will
continue to line up with Dems against GOP radicals. The bottom line for
business: little progress in '96.
   On another front of interest to business lobbyists--political
reform--bipartisan attempts to limit the role of organized giving in
political campaigns seem likely to be thwarted by the leaders of both
parties. Newly triumphant Republican leaders are shaking the corporate
money tree hard and don't want to give up their advantage. Democrats,
meanwhile, remain hooked on reforms that include taxpayer subsidies
vehemently opposed by Republicans. The prospect: Look for superficial
reforms, at best, and torrents of pious rhetoric.
DEEP BELIEFS. GOP plans to dismantle New Deal social programs by returning
responsibility to the states will face tough sledding, too. Already, GOP
moderates have quashed reformers' efforts to turn food stamps and the
school lunch program into state-run block grants. And Clinton's attack on
GOP schemes to shift Medicaid to state capitals is just a preview of a '96
Democratic assault that charges Republicans aim to shred the social safety
net. The outlook: Although Clinton may yet cut a deal on a proposal to end
the federal guarantee of open-ended welfare benefits, other GOP
``devolution'' initiatives will languish.
   At bottom, deeply held partisan beliefs frame this running debate about
the role of government. But the tactics of the combatants are disturbing
the American electorate. In December, the Harris Poll's annual ``alienation
index'' hit a 30-year high. And an Associated Press poll released on Dec.
26 found that 29% of those surveyed said neither political party addresses
their top concerns. That's why the return of Washington gridlock will spur
demands for new political options--whether it's Ross Perot's infant Reform
Party or another movement.
   ``People are concerned by all the posturing and shifting of blame,''
says New Hampshire pollster Richard Bennett. ``All politicians are going to
pay the price.'' Perhaps. But until a resurgent Bill Clinton, unrepentant
Gingrichites, and comeback-minded Democratic liberals pause to assess the
long-term costs of their scorched-earth tactics, don't look for any break
from gridlock politics. All sides are having too much fun gumming up the
gears of the American political machinery to stop now.



If you liked the partisan battles of '95, you'll love what's in store for
'96

TAX REFORM
Expect early skirmishing over GOP plans to overhaul taxes. Republicans will
push competing plans for a flatter income tax. The Democrats want reform
that retains progressive tax rates and closes corporate loopholes.

REG-SLASHING
Republicans will renew calls for legislation that gives companies relief
from lawsuits and environmental mandates. The Democrats, allied with
Republican moderates, will again attack reform proposals as extreme.

WELFARE REFORM
Clinton's likely veto of the GOP welfare bill will send everyone back to
the table. In '96, Republicans hope to cast Clinton as a defender of
welfare deadbeats. Democrats will hold out for better work incentives and a
safety net for mothers.

POWER TO THE STATES
Republicans who failed in '95 to end entitlements for food stamps and other
programs will try to shift the programs to states. Democrats will argue
that states lack the resources to fund income-support plans during economic
downturns.

THE RIGHT'S AGENDA
Under heavy pressure from conservative freshmen, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich will allow votes on new abortion restrictions and a repeal of the
assault-weapons ban. Democrats will try to thwart both measures.

THE ECONOMY THAT FELL TO EARTH
Germany's slowdown is scaring its neighbors

By:
By John Templeman in Bonn, with Heidi Dawley in London, Silvia Sansoni in
Rome, and bureau reports


Germany is supposed to be Europe's locomotive. But thanks in part to recent
French strikes holding up shipments of German goods, gross domestic product
probably will show no growth in the fourth quarter, the second stagnant
quarter in a row. Unemployment, rising since last spring, is now at 9.3%.
Exports are weakening. Capital spending is slumping. And corporate profits
are falling. Says Ian Harwood, head of strategy and economics at London's
Kleinwort Benson Group PLC: ``Fears of a hard landing are growing.''
   Indeed, while a tax cut, a recent Bundesbank interest-rate reduction,
and a widely expected decline in the German mark may produce a brief
rebound in the first half, the year ahead looks grim. Unless consumers
unzip their pocketbooks in a hurry--and that looks doubtful--Germany will
have a hard time even reaching the anemic 2% growth rate it achieved in
1995 (chart).
   Such downbeat forecasts scare Germany's neighbors. ``If Germany slows
down, everyone else winds down with it,'' says Sergio De Nardis, senior
economist at Confindustria, the Italian industrialists' federation. That
could spell the end of Europe's grand plans for a single currency and
monetary union by the start of 1999. European Union nations, led by France
(box), already are struggling to cut budget deficits and cap government
debt levels to bring them in line with the Maastricht Treaty. But a serious
growth setback starting from Germany would lower tax revenues, raise
government borrowing, and bloat deficits across the EU, putting monetary
union out of reach and blowing further European unification out of the
water.
   To a great degree, Germans have themselves to blame for their
predicament. Economics Minister Gunter Rexrodt blames the current slowdown
on a high mark, big wage hikes, and rising taxes. Add overregulation of
business and rigid work rules, and it's no surprise that German companies
made some $26 billion in direct investments outside the country in the
first nine months of 1995, double the 1994 rate. The money is flowing to
Eastern Europe, Asia, and even Britain, whose manufacturing costs are 40%
lower than Germany's.
   The huge gap prompted Siemens, for example, to choose Britain as the
site for a $1.7 billion semiconductor plant. Consumer-products maker
Procter & Gamble Co., meanwhile, has stopped making new investments in
Germany. Its high business costs, warns Harald Einsmann, P&G regional
president, risk turning the country into the ``hole in the doughnut'' in
Europe's industrial landscape.
   As manufacturers rethink their commitment to Germany, hollowing out is
becoming a growth business. Two-thirds of management consultant McKinsey &
Co.'s German trade now consists of helping manufacturers expand production
in other parts of the world. Says Senior Partner Herbert Henzler:
``Germany's present export model--design it, make it, and export it from
here--is no longer viable.''
WARY CONSUMERS. With more companies adopting that mantra, workforce cuts
will continue. Germany has already lost 1 million jobs since 1992, mostly
in manufacturing. But employers' organizations warn that another 500,000 to
1 million jobs are at risk unless wage costs, particularly welfare taxes,
fall. Little wonder that in one recent poll, two-thirds of eastern
Germans--and half of those in the west--told the Allensbach-based
Demoskopie Institut that the risk of losing their jobs is now their biggest
worry.
   That's bad news for policymakers who are counting on a revival of
consumer demand. Many expect further Bundesbank rate cuts, and an $11
billion income tax reduction kicks in on Jan. 1. Will that money find its
way into stores? Some analysts are skeptical, noting that after months of
belt-tightening to pay higher taxes, many consumers aren't about to loosen
up with the economy slowing. ``We went without so much this year, that we
might consider spending [the tax rebate],'' says Gabi Lewin, a mother of
two whose husband works in an accountant's office. ``But if things get
worse over the short term, we might just sock it away and wait.''
   Reflecting that caution, retail sales fell 2.5% in 1995, the third
straight decline, and a hoped-for late spurt in Christmas buying failed to
materialize. And forget about 1996. Walter Deuss, chief executive officer
of the Karstadt department-store chain, notes that recent surveys ``don't
point to any durable improvement in consumer confidence.''
   While Germany waits for consumer spending to revive, the economy
continues to flag. If the U.S. is any guide, German restructuring efforts
could start bearing fruit around the time the EU plans to get its monetary
union into motion. That could leave Germany stronger and more competitive
than ever. Until then, expect anxiety levels to keep rising--in Germany and
across Europe.

NOW JUPPE HAS TO PICK UP THE PIECES

By:
By Bill Javetski in Paris


As Paris buses and subways began running again in late December after
France's worst strikes in three decades, drivers and token-booth clerks
cheerfully welcomed commuters back by letting them ride free of charge. It
was a smart public-relations move--but it was also unauthorized, showing
just how feisty France's public-sector unions are feeling after paralyzing
the country for 24 days. In forcing Prime Minister Alain Juppe to back away
from several key reforms, labor leaders have set the stage for a perilous
New Year as France tries to curb spending, revive growth, and prepare for
monetary union. Without a strong government in charge, achieving any of
those goals may be impossible.
   It is true that Juppe did not lose everything in his struggle with the
unions. In late December, a ``social summit'' with labor and industry left
intact a core plan to eliminate France's $12 billion health-care deficit.
But the realization is sinking in that ``Juppe is storing up problems for
the future,'' figures Christopher Potts, economist at Paris brokerage
Chevreux De Virieu.
BATTERED ECONOMY. For starters, Juppe's health-care plan probably marks the
limits of the reforms that his government will achieve. Tackling the costs
of France's civil service now seems impossible, since to end the strikes,
Juppe caved on the key points of reforming the loss-ridden national
railroad and aligning public-sector pensions with more restrictive
private-sector ones. And with his autocratic style, Juppe has failed to
build any kind of consensus for further cuts, even though government
spending is fast pushing up debt levels to dangerous heights (chart).
   Yet Germany, France's key European partner, is insisting on even deeper
French budgetary austerity for a possible monetary union. For a single
currency to work, France must meet the German demands. Even a vigorous
economic upturn won't be enough to keep Juppe from needing additional
spending cuts to shrink the deficit from its current 5% of gross domestic
product to 3% by the end of 1997. That's when France and other aspiring
candidates must prove they qualify for the currency union.
   France's economy enters 1996 badly battered from the strikes, which may
resume at the end of January. Estimates of the strikes' costs in lost
economic activity range as high as $4 billion. The crippling job action,
which dried up holiday shopping, put some 50,000 small businesses at risk
of failing, according to Conseil National du Patronat Francais, the French
employers' association. ``We're in recession now, and we'll enter 1996
slowing down further,'' says CNPF Vice-President Denis Kessler.
Unemployment, which recently began rising again, will top 12% by June, the
national statistics office estimates. Morgan Stanley Group Inc. economist
Eric Chaney sees France's economy growing just 1.3% next year. For 1997,
the critical year for picking nations that will be eligible for monetary
union, he sees France's budget deficit hovering above 4%, a full percentage
point off the target.
THIN GRUEL.. Boxed in by the unions, Juppe hopes to stimulate moribund
consumer activity by granting tax breaks to investors selling stakes in
money-market funds. To tackle 20% youth unemployment, he is looking to
persuade companies to fill half their job vacancies with people under the
age of 25. And he is calling on business and labor to speed up negotiations
over part-time work and other ways to make French industry more flexible.
   But that's thin gruel considering France's budgetary plight. The strikes
may be over for now. But their repercussions on France and all of Europe
will be felt through 1996 and beyond.

FROM BLUEPRINTS TO GRAND DESIGN
Ex-engineer John Correnti now must recast Nucor

By:
By Stephen Baker in Pittsburgh


As a young engineer, John D. Correnti built factories for a living. The job
kept him moving about as often as a traveling salesman. He built blast
furnaces in Ohio, a tire-cord factory in Georgia, a uranium plant in Texas.
He was usually hundreds of miles away, he now jokes, by the time any
glitches appeared. In 1983, Correnti was finishing up a steel mill in Utah
for Nucor Corp. when he got a surprise phone call from Chairman F. Kenneth
Iverson ordering him to run the plant. Correnti was stunned. ``You didn't
tell me I'd have to live with my mistakes,'' he protested.
   Iverson just called Correnti again--and this time he's turning the whole
shebang over to him. On Jan. 1, the 48-year-old executive will take over as
CEO of the Charlotte (N.C.) minimill giant, which is poised to pass
Bethlehem Steel Corp. as the second-biggest steel company in America,
trailing only the U.S. Steel Group of USX Corp. The transition shouldn't be
bumpy for the compact, silver-templed Correnti: Since 1991, he has been
Nucor's chief operating officer. What's more, Iverson is sticking around as
chairman. Still, taking over for a CEO who led Nucor to 30 years of strong
sales growth and solid profits is daunting. ``He's an icon,'' Correnti
says.
ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED. Correnti's promotion comes at a trying time for Nucor.
For a decade, it has been the high-flying Wal-Mart of the steel industry,
keeping costs down on basic products and passing the savings on to
customers. But as imitators spring up, also offering cheap, basic steel,
Nucor finds itself under pressure to revamp its product mix and get into
higher-margin steels. Meanwhile, it's still struggling with new technology
at its iron carbide plant in Trinidad. Worried investors have traded the
stock down to about $54, vs. last year's high of $72.
   Correnti admits Nucor has some adjusting to do. To compete in premium
markets, it must improve product quality. Customers in those markets, such
as auto and appliance makers, also demand lots of customized attention, a
specialty of the integrated steel companies.
   Yet Correnti takes over a strong, nearly debt-free company. As new
challengers grapple with startups in Kentucky and Indiana, Nucor already is
experimenting with making upscale stainless steel and ultrathin gauges in
its Indiana and Arkansas plants. Plus, it's busy building a third
flat-rolled steel mill, a $500 million behemoth in South Carolina. Correnti
expects Nucor's sales this year to jump 13%, to $3.35 billion, and earnings
to top 1994's record $227 million. He's looking for 15% to 20% sales growth
for the next five years. Even if Nucor stumbles, it likely will eclipse
U.S. Steel as the No.1 steelmaker by the year 2000. ``After South Carolina,
it would just take one more mill,'' he says.
FRIEND OF BILL. The question is whether Nucor under Correnti can stay
nimble. He says he will keep the 22-person headquarters small and continue
delegating great powers to the plant managers. His job? To oversee new
projects, stay in touch with Wall Street, and visit the 19 divisions two or
three times a year. Except for all the flying time--spent reading mystery
novels--Nucor's rapid growth rate won't be much of a drain on its CEO, he
says; ``What's the difference between 15 divisions and 30 divisions? It's
just a few more lines on the page.''
   Correnti is regarded as harder-driving than the genial Iverson, and he
preens a bit more in the limelight. He made friends with then-Governor Bill
Clinton when the company was negotiating plant sites in Arkansas. And he
continues to meet with Clinton, talking steel and politics at the White
House--or, more recently, chatting at a Little Rock banquet for retiring
Democratic Senator David H. Pryor. ``I'm one of the Republican Friends of
Bill,'' he says.
   He's also quicker than Iverson to make enemies. Speaking at Robert
Morris College in Pittsburgh, Correnti bulled into a subject most
executives sidestep, saying matter-of-factly that he would ``never dream of
building a mill'' in a union town like Pittsburgh. But as competition heats
up for Nucor, Correnti's combative ways might be just what the company
needs.

SHE IS THE NRA
Its first female chief is out to oust Clinton and lure women

By:
By Paul Magnusson in Washington


Marion P. Hammer was working late one night in Tallahassee when a carload
of thugs followed her into a parking garage and threatened her. ``I reached
into my purse, pulled out my gun, brought it up through the headlights, and
aimed right at the driver,'' she recalls. ``He put it in reverse, the tires
started smoking, and they were gone.''
   That was a decade ago, when Hammer was lobbying the Florida legislature
to relax restrictions on handguns. Her success there helped kick off a
28-state movement to ease restrictions on carrying concealed weapons. In
December, her record as a winning lobbyist and hard-line opponent of gun
control helped her become the first female president of the 3.3
million-member National Rifle Assn. after her predecessor, Thomas L.
Washington, died of a heart attack. Hammer, who had been vice-president, is
expected to run unopposed in April for a one-year term of her own.
   Now, the 56-year-old Hammer has her adversaries firmly in her sights.
She wants Congress to overturn the federal assault weapons ban.
``Restrictions on gun ownership are just a form of harassment,'' she says.
Next up is the defeat of pro-gun-control politicians--starting with the
President. ``The one thing we definitely plan to do is to work to beat Bill
Clinton,'' says Hammer.
   Hammer's confrontational style may be just right for today's embattled
NRA, which has image and money problems, has recently lost 200,000 members,
and is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service for allegedly
commingling funds. To boost membership again, Hammer plans to step up the
NRA's appeal to women and families using two time-honored NRA programs: the
``Refuse to be a Victim'' educational campaign for women, emphasizing crime
prevention and self-defense while promoting gun ownership; and the ``Eddie
Eagle'' gun-safety campaign for children, which is Hammer's personal
creation.
``WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.'' Under Hammer, the NRA won't neglect politics at the
statehouse either. She spent 20 years lobbying in Florida on behalf of gun
owners and proudly points to Florida's first concealed-weapons permit,
which allows her to pack her .38 caliber Colt Detective Special or her 9-mm
Beretta semiautomatic. ``During the past three years, the NRA has been
wildly successful in the states, and Hammer is the poster child for the
conceal-and-carry issue,'' laments Josh Sugarmann, director of the Violence
Policy Center, a gun-control group.
   Hammer, a grandmother of three, likes to unwind at the target range
after a day of hard lobbying. On the range or at the office, her opponents
say, she seldom misses her mark.

TELECOM: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WALLS FALL
Once reform passes, a frenzy of pair-ups is sure to follow

By:
By Joseph Weber in Philadelphia, with John Carey in Washington


They might as well be ringing a starting bell on the Capitol steps.
Washington's long revamp of telecommunications law is just about finished.
The message most telecom companies hear ringing loud and clear: Let the
deals begin.
   On Dec. 20, House and Senate conferees finally hammered out a compromise
that would allow Baby Bells, cable-TV operators, and long-distance
companies to invade one another's turf. It would also permit companies to
own more radio and TV stations than is now permitted. Thorny details, such
as how much to relax curbs on foreign ownership of U.S. companies, remain
to be determined. But says Representative Rick Boucher (D-Va.): ``All the
core issues have been settled. This will be landmark legislation.''
   Once the bill is passed, probably by early 1996, a swarm of mergers,
alliances, and joint ventures seems inevitable. That's because most of the
rigid regulatory barriers between segments of the industry will be gone.
Now, says Robert Barada, chief strategist for San Francisco-based Baby Bell
Pacific Telesis Group: ``Technology and customer demand are going to break
down the walls.''
``LOOKING.'' Which companies are likely to pair up? Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Nynex Corp. may be among the first, either through a complete merger
or--more probable--a joint venture on long-distance service. Bell Atlantic
CEO Raymond W. Smith and Nynex chief Ivan Seidenberg already have joint
ventures going to provide cellular phone service and, with PacTel, develop
programming for cable TV. Indeed, a Bell Atlantic spokesman calls a
long-distance joint venture with Nynex ``a real option.'' Adds Nynex
Telecom Group President Richard A. Jalkut: ``We are looking at all possible
combinations.''
   Teaming up to challenge AT&T, MCI Communications, and Sprint in the
long-distance market would make good business sense for the two Northeast
Baby Bells. The Bell Atlantic and Nynex regions account for $20.5 billion
of the nation's annual $73 billion long-distance bill (charts). A merger
would give the two Bells the marketing and technical firepower needed to
compete for customers. Just pooling their ad budgets--Bell Atlantic alone
spends about $105 million yearly on all advertising--would challenge the $1
billion the Big Three long-distance carriers spend promoting their phone
services.
   Who's next? Analysts expect each Baby Bell to eventually link up with at
least one other. Among the predicted pairings: Pactel and US West, San
Antonio-based SBC Communications and BellSouth, and, perhaps, Chicago-based
Ameritech with Bell Atlantic and Nynex. GTE Corp., with phone lines
scattered around the country, is expected to find allies, too. Among other
things, partnerships would help the Bells better tap international markets.
Team-ups of Southern Baby Bells, for instance, could move into Latin
America, while Western outfits could target the Pacific Rim.
CULTURE CLASH. Long-distance providers, too, should find dealmaking
irresistible. Pacts with the Baby Bells would eliminate the need to
duplicate local networks while providing potent marketing partners.
Analysts say MCI Communications Corp. is a natural ally for a Bell
Atlantic-Nynex team, for instance. But long-distance carriers are looking
further afield as well. Since late 1994, Sprint Corp. and cable operators
Tele-Communications, Cox Cable, and Comcast have been exploring ways to
leverage phone and cable-TV operations into advanced communications
systems. One caveat: A couple of years ago, Bell Atlantic sought to merge
with TCI in a failed deal that confirmed Smith's empire-building
aspirations. That failure showed how tough it can be to join the go-go
cable world with the more conservative Bells.
   Another caveat: Analysts figure AT&T will probably avoid cutting deals
with Baby Bells because it won't want to be accused of recreating Ma Bell.
It may team up instead with, say, Time Warner Inc.--already a rumored
negotiating partner--to use cable lines for local phone service. That would
dramatically blur the old lines between segments of the telecom
industry--and set the stage for even more radical change. The deals to come
will be ``complex, multifaceted, multidimensional things,'' says Tony
Ferrugia, a telecom analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   In the end, the rewired telecom biz probably will include far fewer
players who will deliver better service and offer bold innovations. Ma Bell
won't exactly be coming back together after 12 years, but some of her
offspring almost certainly will.

ALL TOGETHER NOW: `MAKE THAT TO GO'
Insatiable demand for convenient, ready-to-eat meals has the food biz
scrambling

By:
By Greg Burns in Chicago


Boston Chicken Inc. didn't expect much when it tested ready-made holiday
meals this past Thanksgiving. But customers flocked in, gobbling down
hundreds of roast turkeys with all the fixin's. Why? ``People don't even
have time to cook Thanksgiving turkey dinner,'' says Saad J. Nadhir,
co-chairman of the take-out chain.
   In 1996, the nation's $900 billion food industry will be at the mercy of
customers who don't have time. Shoppers who can barely steal a few moments
to shop--let alone whip up home-cooked feasts--will set the pace of growth
for food processors, retailers, and food-service chains. The edge will go
to big, dominant companies that can use marketing clout to expand ``share
of stomach'' at the expense of weaker competitors. Other winners will be
innovators of all sizes that find new ways to ease the hunger pangs of a
harried populace.
   Inevitably, the time squeeze on shoppers will create losers, too,
especially among traditional full-line supermarkets. Their strong cash
flows give them enviable staying power, so an immediate shakeout is
unlikely. But erosion will continue as supermarkets face off against
up-and-comers such as Nadhir, who estimates that half the customers at his
fast-growing Boston Chicken chain would otherwise have cooked at home.
``You have too many retailers competing for too few food dollars and
appealing to consumers who have less time to deal with it,'' says
consultant Neil Z. Stern of Chicago's McMillan & Doolittle.
IDLE OVENS. Food processors and restaurant chains will see 5% to 6% revenue
growth in 1996, Stern estimates. Supermarkets will eke out 2% to 3% growth,
barely even with inflation. As U.S. households prepare fewer meals at home,
the percentage of food dollars spent at food retail stores--as opposed to
restaurants, cafeterias, convenience stores, and the like--will dip to 48%
in '96 from 55% a decade ago (chart). ``It's a great threat to
supermarkets,'' warns John H. Bryan, chief executive officer for Sara Lee
Corp.
   Consumers clamoring for ready-to-eat meals have made deli sales the one
supermarket bright spot. Supermarket chains such as Byerly's in Edina,
Minn., and Dominick's Finer Foods in Northlake, Ill., have pioneered new
in-store formats. In '96, expanded deli departments will attract at least 8
cents of each food dollar, up from 4 cents in 1986. And watch for more
supermarkets to introduce mall-style food courts featuring proven operators
such as McDonald's Corp., which is testing outlets at a Farmer Jacks
supermarket in Michigan and a Kroger in Tennessee. Food processors will
join in, too: Sara Lee has 17 sandwich shops serving its premium deli meats
inside Kroger supermarkets in Texas and Ohio.
   Among restaurant chains, cost control will be crucial. McDonald's has
cut the cost of opening a new restaurant by 30% over the past five years
through standardization and more reliance on drive-thru layouts. That has
helped McDonald's step up its U.S. growth fivefold, including joint
ventures that have put Golden Arches in Wal-Mart Stores, Home Depots,
Incredible Universe home-electronics stores, and Amoco gas stations.
FAR AND AWAY. With so many more outlets at hand, busy shoppers visit more
often, leaving less on the plate for the competition. Says McDonald's
Vice-Chairman Jack M. Greenberg: ``If you can dominate a trading area, it's
much more difficult and expensive for competitors to take customers away
from you.''
   Dominance matters to food processors, too. They're struggling to
increase scale and efficiency to satisfy the likes of supercenters, which
combine cut-rate supermarkets and discount stores under one roof. Food
processors also hope to give their ho-hum U.S. results a boost by pursuing
fast-growth markets overseas. And sharp operators such as H.J. Heinz, CPC
International, Campbell Soup, and others will be trying to lock in
relationships with fast-growing food-service operators. ``Everybody has the
same three strategies--lower domestic costs, grow internationally, and push
into food service,'' says analyst John M. McMillin at Prudential Securities
Inc.
   With all hands reaching for the same brass ring, the strongest brands
rule. As in 1995, industry players will sell off weak units to more
dominant competitors and buy businesses that enhance existing strengths.
The goal? Be No.1. ``I'm not even sure being No.2 is enough anymore,''
McMillin says. For investors, the message is clear: In the scrap over
``share of stomach,'' bet on the top dogs.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- With more consumers eating on the run, companies emphasizing
convenience will find eager customers.
   -- Food-service operators will grow by opening outlets in stores,
supermarkets, and gas stations.

Negatives
   -- Value-conscious shoppers will resist price increases.
   -- Supermarkets will continue to lose ``share of stomach'' to sharper
food-service operators, such as Boston Chicken.

MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER REARRANGERS
Deregulation will transform the industry--and continue to pinch profits

By:
By Mark Maremont in Boston


`Exciting, intense, and fun'': That's how a prominent electric-utility
executive describes his job these days. Surprised? If you thought
electricity was about as thrilling as dentistry, look again. A
three-year-old drive toward deregulation is causing new upheavals, from
cut-rate pricing to an unprecedented surge in mergers.
   On the regulatory front, the action in 1996 is likely to get a jump
start from an innovative plan approved by California's Public Utilities
Commission at the end of 1995. The plan, subject to change, would let some
customers shop for electricity from rival suppliers starting in 1998. The
long-awaited decision is another sign that the economic and political
forces propelling deregulation are too powerful to halt. Even American
Electric Power Co., the nation's second-largest investor-owned utility--and
at one time a staunch opponent of competition--proposed its own
far-reaching deregulation plan in 1995. Rather than fight the tide, says
Charles A. Falcone, an AEP senior vice-president, ``we have decided we want
to help shape the industry's new structure.''
SMOOTH SHIFT. AEP and other utilities had little choice. Profits will be
boosted or ravaged for years depending on how the industry and regulators
resolve some vexing questions. One big one is how far competition should
go. The most radical approach would let customers choose an electricity
supplier just as they choose a long-distance phone carrier, with power
flowing over still regulated lines maintained by the local utility. A more
moderate approach would retain today's basic structure but require
utilities to set rates based on prices in a wholesale power pool, which
proponents say would cut down on confusion. Muddying the waters, California
regulators decided to let both approaches coexist.
   Then there's the issue of the billions of dollars in uneconomical power
plants and long-term power contracts on the books of many utilities. These
will become millstones in a world where the cheapest power suppliers will
prevail. Big customers and some low-cost utilities contend that overly
expensive power plants and contracts should be written off, forcing
shareholders to bear the brunt of utilities' past poor decisions. But most
utilities argue that their costs are largely a legacy of poor regulations,
so customers should continue to foot the bill for a period. Allowing
customers to disregard their obligations ``is like asking your bank to let
you walk away from half your mortgage just because you want a new house,''
argues Thomas J. May, CEO of Boston Edison Co.
READY TO BID. More states will grapple with these and other contentious
issues in 1996, starting with Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Meanwhile,
utilities are shedding costs and their monopolistic mind-sets. Boston
Edison dumped one-fifth of its managers in 1995 and tried to spur new
thinking by reassigning most of those remaining to new jobs. WPL Holdings
Inc., a low-cost Wisconsin utility, has offered to show rivals' big
customers how much they could save by switching to WPL. It can't wrest away
the customers now, but it hopes to have the chance soon. ``Nobody owns
customers,'' says Erroll B. Davis Jr., WPL's aggressive CEO.
   Despite cost-cutting, profit margins aren't likely to improve much after
a five-year slide. Why? To stop defections, many utilities are cutting
prices to big customers 10% to 40% in return for long-term commitments.
Average aftertax profit margins declined to 17.2% in 1995, from 18.9% in
1991, says Daniel Scotto, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co.
   Moreover, some high-cost utilities are carrying artificial assets on
their books, such as payments due from customers over the next 20 to 30
years. If deregulation proceeds far enough, utilities may have to switch to
industrial accounting standards that don't recognize such assets. The
resulting megawrite-offs ``could get very ugly,'' says analyst Scotto, who
cites Centerior Energy Corp. as a prime candidate. Some utilities could be
forced into a restructuring or even bankruptcy.
   Also on tap for 1996 are more dividend cuts by an industry where
dividends once provided almost the only investment appeal. And mergers,
which reached a record $11.9 billion in 1995, are likely to keep surging,
especially if stock prices start to plummet as competition takes hold. No
question about it: The electric-utility industry isn't boring anymore.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Low interest rates have lightened debt loads.
   -- Delay in deregulation is allowing utilities more time to prepare.
   -- Demand for power is rising, and capacity is ample, so there's no need
for costly construction.

Negatives
   -- Demands by big customers for lower prices are hurting margins.
   -- High-cost utilities face a bleak future in
   -- deregulated world.

WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T FIND GOOD HELP?
Business-service firms boom as companies around the globe retool

By:
By Richard A. Melcher in Chicago


On some recent continent-hopping business trips, George T. Shaheen,
managing partner for Andersen Consulting, became thoroughly convinced that
change knows no boundaries. The rage in China was all about restructuring
and developing new markets. A Brazilian TV company was worried about how to
compete in foreign countries. ``It doesn't matter where you're doing
business,'' says Shaheen, ``everyone is going through a massive
retooling.'' While that may be wrenching to many, for Andersen and other
providers of business services, upheaval is a boon.
   Business services--a new category in BUSINESS WEEK's Industry
Outlook--encompasses legal services, advertising, personnel supply,
research and consulting, accounting, engineering, architecture, and
miscellaneous others, such as equipment rental and leasing. While their
growth rates vary, all of these industries to some degree cash in on the
continuing global trend toward seeking outside help. In 1996, predicts
DRI/McGraw-Hill, business services will grow 3.5% after inflation, to $806
billion in 1995 dollars.
   Consultants such as $4 billion Andersen should do far better than that.
Andersen, which specializes in providing advice on systems and so-called
change management, expects business to rise 20% for a second year and to
add as many as 8,000 people to its workforce of 37,000. Meantime, Bain &
Co. figures its business will jump 30% this year on the back of its
``growth'' consulting, which advises once shrinking clients how to grab
market share and find new customers overseas.
TEMP FEVER. Business-service providers will take on jobs of increasing
sophistication. Corporate layoffs will remain in the range of last year's
420,000 or so, figures outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, so
companies will continue to off-load everything from public relations to
computer services. That will ensure a fourth year of strong growth for the
temporary-help sector, which the National Association of Temporary &
Staffing Services estimates has annual revenues of $40 billion (chart).
``Temporary help used to be for emergency needs,'' says Manpower
International Inc. Chairman Mitchell S. Fromstein. ``Now, it's part of a
company's ongoing workforce strategy.'' Fromstein expects Manpower revenues
to be up some 15%--even higher than the industry's healthy 9% rise.
   At Manpower, as at scores of other companies, growth is being fueled by
demands for special skills. Today, Manpower is supplying computer
programmers and systems integrators as well as clerical workers.
Industrial-design specialists such as Boston's Design Continuum Inc. are
working with clients from research to final production. In advertising,
efforts to commercialize the Internet are providing golden opportunities
for nimble upstarts. ``The Internet will pose a major challenge for the big
agencies,'' says analyst James D. Dougherty of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
WORK, WORK. Generally, though, size seems to be an advantage. As industries
consolidate, companies turn to providers that can handle business globally.
In the advertising business, where growth is expected to be nearly 8%
thanks to election and Olympics spending, ``it's increasingly difficult for
midsize [advertising] agencies to compete,'' says Rochelle Lazarus, CEO of
giant Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide Inc.
   So look for the fragmented business-services sector to spawn plenty of
mergers. Last year, EDS Corp. purchased A.T. Kearney for $600 million,
marrying computer systems and engineering knowhow. This year, law firms are
ripe for combination, says consultant Bradford W. Hildebrandt. While law
firms are recovering from the depressed early '90s, Hildebrandt expects
revenues to rise 10% in 1996, so regional, national, and even international
mergers should be on the uptick. ``We'll see global consolidation like we
began seeing in accounting 10 years ago,'' predicts Hildebrandt.
   Other forces driving the mergers: difficulty in finding top
professionals and pricing pressure from customers. More and more companies
are demanding fixed fees from law firms. The outplacement industry has seen
commissions on large contracts drop from as much as 17% per individual to
about 10%, according to John A. Challenger. Yet across most of the growing
services sector, ``the No.1 risk and temptation'' is to take on more work
than firms have the ability to handle, say Bain's worldwide managing
director, Thomas J. Tierney. For now, that's a hurdle most service
providers are eager to attempt.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Continued industry restructuring favors a variety of services, from
temporary help to consulting and engineering.
   -- Booming economies in Asia and other markets offer new work to U.S.
architects, engineers, and advertisers.

Negatives
   -- A shortage of quality staff looms as businesses demand more
sophisticated services.
   -- Consolidation among clients adds price pressures and kills smaller or
less specialized firms.

WILL WALL STREET HIT A WALL?
It will be tough to match '95, but low rates could keep the market robust

By:
By Leah Nathans Spiro in New York


Wall Street should get another gift from the Federal Reserve in 1996:
continued low interest rates. DRI/McGraw-Hill predicts that 30-year
Treasury bonds will end the year at 6.26%, up just a tad from 6% at yearend
1995. Rock-bottom rates mean another super year for the securities
industry, since investors will keep deserting bank certificates of deposits
to seek higher returns in the stock market, boosting the market and Wall
Street commissions. ``From everything we see, it's going to be another good
year,'' declares John J. Mack, president of Morgan Stanley & Co.
   After a slow start, 1995 blossomed into a very good year for the
securities industry. New York Stock Exchange firms reaped an estimated $6.5
billion in pretax profits. That's the second-best year ever after 1993's
$8.6 billion blow-out. Fueling the industry was record stock-market volume,
thanks to a Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that soared 37% and strong
underwriting and mutual-fund sales.
   For 1996, the BUSINESS WEEK profit estimate is just $5.5 billion,
though. That's because it would be tough for rates to decline in 1996 as
much as they did in 1995, when they fell from 8% to about 6%. Declining
rates are Wall Street's dream environment, since they boost corporate
refinancing as well as the stock market.
TAKEOVER RUMORS. The new year is starting off with lots of momentum.
Mergers and acquisitions were red-hot in 1995, racking up $450 billion in
deals, topping the previous record of $355 billion in 1994, according to
Securities Data Co. ``There is no reason to believe the robust M&A market
won't continue,'' says Kim Fennebresque, a managing director at UBS
Securities Inc. Initial public offerings were another winner, with an
estimated $29 billion in new issues in 1995, almost reaching the 1993
record of $34 billion.
   Wall Street is notoriously cyclical, though, so the gold rush could slow
in '96. The stock market is unlikely to sustain its record performance for
two years in a row. The securities industry also faces excess capacity: Too
many firms are fighting for the same business. Aggressive up-and-comers
range from Germany's Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of Switzerland to U.S.
commercial banks. ``It's a difficult challenge to continue to maintain high
margins,'' says Jerome P. Kenney, a Merrill Lynch executive
vice-president.
   With so much competition, consolidation is expected to continue in 1996.
Rumors constantly have firms dressing themselves up for sale. Some of them,
such as Lehman Brothers Inc., PaineWebber Inc., and Prudential Securities,
are medium-size firms that are finding it expensive to compete
internationally. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan
Stanley are spending heavily to position themselves as global competitors
that can remain independent. ``In 1996, the large will get larger, small
boutiques will prosper, and those in the middle will get squeezed,'' says
Bruce S. Foerster, president of South Beach Capital Markets Advisory Corp.
in Miami.
   Whether large or small, brokerage stocks are due for a correction.
Analysts aren't as hot on them, since they had a spectacular rise in 1995.
Merrill Lynch & Co. shares rose 51% through mid-December, and Charles
Schwab & Co. was up 86%. Mergers and acquisitions, hottest in banking and
media, might lose some steam.
   There are bright spots. Merrill Lynch, the biggest brokerage, sees
continued growth in its retail business. Its equity assets under management
have grown significantly in 1995 simply because the stock market was up
37%. This increase means more asset-management fee income in 1996, even if
the growth of assets slows. And following a dismal 1995 in many emerging
markets, Merrill is looking for an improvement in 1996.
   The entire industry may get a boost from Washington. A capital-gains tax
cut and a restoration of tax deductibility for individual retirement
accounts look likely in 1996, says Marc E. Lackritz, president of the
Securities Industry Assn., since ``there is broad agreement among the
House, the Senate, and the Administration that this is a good idea.'' The
SIA estimates the IRA change alone could earn the industry as much as $200
million a year in additional IRA mutual-fund fees.
   Of course, it's the unexpected that hurts markets the most, as in the
last big market plunge with the gulf war in 1991. A recession or sharply
higher rates are constant worries. But it now looks as if Wall Street can
spend another happy year looking forward to bonus time.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The soaring stock market is boosting the brokerage business.
   -- Mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs should remain strong.
   -- Congress may cut capital-gains taxes and restore deductibility of
IRAs.

Negatives
   -- Brokerage stocks are due for a correction after their big 1995
runup.
   -- Overcapacity in the industry will keep restraining margins.

A YEAR OF HIGH-RISE EXPECTATIONS
The office market expects a banner year, while other markets look less
robust

By:
By Amy Barrett in Washington


For much of the past two years, the real estate and construction industry
celebrated the return of growth. Having survived the dark days of the early
1990s, investors savored the recovery of apartment and retail properties,
followed by offices and hotels. But 1996 will be more of a mixed bag. On
the downside, there are early signs of overheating in some markets for
construction of apartment and retail space. On the upside, a stronger
housing market should help pick up the slack. And with office occupancy and
rents improving, 1996 will mark the return of one fixture of the 1980s:
high-rise office projects.
   The generally good news for real estate stems largely from the continued
decline of interest rates. Lower rates helped spark homebuilding in the
second half of 1995. And National Association of Home Builders Chief
Economist David F. Seiders figures moderate economic growth will lead to
even lower mortgage rates in 1996, averaging about 7.3% for 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages. That should nudge multi- and single-family housing
starts up about 3%, to nearly 1.4 million. The days of speculative boom and
bust are gone: ``People look at houses as shelter rather than as an
investment strategy, and frankly that's pretty healthy,'' says Bruce E.
Karatz, chairman of Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad Home Corp.
   Apartment construction continues to pick up steam. According to the
NAHB, construction will begin on 290,000 apartments in 1996, up a bit from
1995's 274,000. While that is still less than half the 1985 frenzied peak
of nearly 670,000 units, industry pros are warning that some Sunbelt
markets, such as Phoenix and Las Vegas, may already be overbuilt.
BANNER YEAR. In retail construction, megamerchants such as Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and Circuit City Stores Inc. are aggressively expanding. But it
doesn't appear that the market is headed for a repeat of the overbuilding
binge of the 1980s. Retail construction should fall 10% in 1996, according
to The McGraw-Hill Companies' F.W. Dodge unit. One reason: Aside from the
retail giants that can finance their own expansion, ``capital is pretty
well cut off to that sector,'' says Douglas A. Tibbetts, president of
Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc.
   Players in the office market expect 1996 to be a banner year. Thanks in
no small part to the explosive growth of high-technology companies, office
vacancy rates continue to slide. And the strength of the market is sparking
not only build-to-suit construction but some partially speculative building
in tight markets. Arthur J. Mirante II, chief executive officer of Cushman
& Wakefield Inc., says some cities will see construction with as little as
50% of the project pre-leased. ``The fundamentals for office haven't been
this good in 10 years,'' says Thomas A. Carr, president of Carr Realty
Corp. in Washington, D.C.
   Still, not all markets are booming. Los Angeles and downtown Dallas,
which has a staggering vacancy rate of 35%, are still struggling. And
Arthur Andersen & Co. Managing Director Barry D. Libert warns that better
and cheaper telecommunications will allow more tenants in the future to
avoid downtown locations. As a result, office operators will be forced to
beef up their marketing and improve the flexibility of lease packages.
   Perhaps the best buys around remain high-end hotel properties. Outside
of Las Vegas, there is little new construction of luxury hotels. And
Japanese investors who overpaid for such properties in the 1980s continue
to sell. A Japanese bank recently sold the 539-room Ritz Carlton Hotel,
Mauna Lani, in Hawaii, built for $180 million, for just $75 million.
SMALL FAVORS. While the Japanese are selling, U.S. real estate continues to
attract U.S. pension funds, which should cautiously expand their holdings
in 1996, as well as foreign investors, from such places as Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and Germany. Real estate investment trusts aren't raising a lot of
money through public offerings--investment dollars have gone into the
booming stock market instead--but they're discovering that private
placements can work, too. For instance, Carr Realty struck a deal in
November that will result in a $250 million investment in the REIT by
Security Capital U.S. Realty. Carr plans to use the capital to build and
buy offices across the country.
   1996 won't see a return to the glory days of leaping prices. But these
days, most real estate executives are thankful for slow but steady
progress.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- The office sector will continue to recover, thanks in part to strong
demand by high-tech companies.
   -- Upscale hotels should enjoy rising room rates and healthy occupancy
levels.

Negatives
   -- Some shopping centers will feel the squeeze from a sluggish retail
market.
   -- With apartment construction still picking up steam, some Sunbelt
markets may already be overbuilt.

LOOKING FOR SAFETY IN NUMBERS
Consolidation--and competition from other investments--are changing the
business

By:
By Tim Smart in New Haven


If there is one word that sums up prospects for the insurance industry in
1996, it's consolidation. Last year saw a record $18 billion worth of
insurance-company mergers and acquisitions, and there's no letup in sight.
``There are too many players competing for too little return in a crowded
marketplace,'' says Eric Simpson, a vice-president at rating agency A.M.
Best Co.
   The late November announcement of Travelers Inc.'s $4 billion purchase
of Aetna Life & Casualty's property-casualty unit capped a year in which
CNA Financial swallowed Continental Insurance for $1.1 billion and Zurich
Insurance took over Home Insurance. The same pressures that forced these
deals--weak returns, large exposures to environmental claims, and lack of
sufficient capital to keep ratings up--are expected to continue in 1996.
While the companies have said nothing publicly, analysts believe that CIGNA
Corp. and Prudential Insurance Co. are among the big-name companies
considering selling their property and casualty units.
CUTTING OVERHEAD. For property-casualty insurers, two big helpers are low
inflation and low interest rates. The benign operating environment in 1995
led to a doubling of net income, to $22.3 billion from $10.9 billion in
1994.
   In 1996, however, property-casualty insurers should see only a modest
uptick in their business. A survey of Wall Street analysts by Insurance
Information Institute found them expecting growth in premium dollar volume
of about 4.6% in 1996. While that would be better than the 3.9% rate of
growth in 1995, it will still lag behind the growth of the early 1990s. The
problem: continued price pressures from overcapacity, especially in
commercial lines, such as general business liability and workers'
compensation. ``There has been no fundamental improvement in underlying
performance during the last five years,'' says Robert Stein, director of
Ernst & Young's insurance-industry practice.
   With paltry premium growth, property- casualty insurers will have to cut
overhead, now a quarter on every dollar of premium. Travelers hopes to trim
$300 million from operating expenses and cut 3,000 jobs when it takes over
the Aetna unit.
   The consolidation trend affecting property-casualty writers is no less
dramatic in life insurance. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and New England
Mutual Life Insurance Co. have announced plans to merge, while several
operators, such as General Electric Capital Services Inc., went on buying
sprees. Here, the motivation is increasing assets under management to
compete with gargantuan mutual-fund houses and other financial-services
conglomerates.
EXPENSIVE DISTRIBUTION. Life insurers enter 1996 facing continued weakness
in their core business as more Americans turn away from traditional life
insurance to investment products such as mutual funds. While mutual funds
are sold through low-cost, consumer-oriented direct marketing such as
television, life insurers still sell their products mainly face-to-face
through an expensive network of agents.
   A survey by consultant Towers Perrin found that the No.1 issue of
concern for life-insurance chief executive officers is improving their
distribution system. Towers Perrin consultant Rick Berry estimates that
distribution makes up two-thirds of the cost of a life-insurance policy.
``Traditional life companies have delegated to their agents decisions like
what mix of products to sell, what markets to pick, and how to promote the
products,'' says Berry. Many life insurers have begun striking deals with
banks to sell their products, a trend that is likely to accelerate in
1996.
   Insurers have had good results selling annuities, which typically offer
income or capital gains as well as life insurance. The 13% rate of growth
for annuities is four times the rate for traditional life insurance
products. But competition is getting fierce. ``It's a changing landscape,''
says CNA Chairman and CEO Dennis H. Chookaszian. ``Banks will be a much
more significant seller of these products in the future.'' A positive for
life insurers is that their mortgage and real estate problems of the early
1990s have largely dissipated, while strong financial markets have helped
investment returns.
   A couple of years back, few would have imagined alliances such as
Travelers' bold deal with Aetna or life insurance companies allowing their
competitors in banking to sell their products. But as the historically
underperforming insurance industry tries to catch up to the new world order
in financial services, it is learning to adapt.



Prognosis '96

Positives
   -- Life insurers are holding on to their share of retirement assets.
   -- Property-casualty writers are increasing reserves for environmental
claims.
   -- Losses from claims are moderating.

Negatives
   -- Much of the industry's increased capital is coming from investment
gains, not core earnings.
   -- With 2,400 competitors, the business is ripe for consolidation.

THE TOP MANAGERS OF 1995
What did it take for an executive to succeed in the past year?

Good managers know how to cut: They trim costs, reengineer, and
restructure. Great managers know how to grow: They realize you can't shrink
your way to greatness. In 1995, the best managers in the world grew their
way to greatness.
   The men and women of BUSINESS WEEK's Top 25 Managers of the
Year--Americans, Europeans, Asians--all rode the tiger of growth to
spectacular success. In a global economy of vast technological change,
intense competition, and political upheaval, these managers cranked out
annual increases of 20%, 30%, sometimes even 40% in profits and
sales--while other corporate ``titans'' were still trimming their sails and
eking out marginal gains.
   What did it take for an executive to make it into BUSINESS WEEK's Top
25? Begin with product innovation--the hot strategy of the year for
managers who had already wrung out their corporate inefficiencies. When the
bureaucratic layers are gone, when the marginal competencies are dumped,
the only strategic assets left to corporations are the products they sell
in the global marketplace. This was proved in 1995, when the most reliable
path to fast growth was to bring out new products adored by lots of
consumers.
   Riding the technological currents was the favorite tactic used by
managers in bringing out their innovations in 1995. But managers also had
to take risks, especially the risk of cannibalizing old models with new
products. There was new software for personal computers and the Internet,
color copier/printers for the home office, and even new first-class seats
that fold out into beds. All were smash hits.
   BUSINESS WEEK's top managers used corporate alliances to drive their
growth. American and European managers divvied up the incredibly successful
DBS launch--direct broadcast satellite transmission of TV and stereo music.
A French-owned company built the 12-inch satellite dishes for the home, and
the Americans developed the satellites and software to close the loop.
Nearly two million homes in the U.S. now have DBS. This global cooperation
generated tremendous growth for all concerned. So did alliances between
industries: One software giant linked up with a corporation running a TV
network to provide new information products over the wire.
   Top managers used globalization strategies wisely to boost growth. Asian
territories outside Japan proved once again to be the fastest-growing
markets in the world in 1995. Every smart manager wanted a bigger piece of
the Asian pie. Some succeeded, as did one investment banker who was able to
cut a deal enabling his firm to do business inside China. Another American
manager reversed strategy and revitalized his heavy capital equipment
company by focusing on new opportunities in Europe.
   Then there were Asian managers using the global markets to move outside
their region into other parts of the world. One computer maker divided his
operation into 21 smaller companies so that each could list on the stock
market where it did most of its business.
   Of course, reengineering remained important as a catalyst for growth for
some top managers. One new Japanese manager quietly restructured ingrown
business practices of his company and led it to a projected doubling of net
profit and a record year. An American continued to reshape a traditional
defense-base conglomerate into a tough market-oriented competitor.
   How did BUSINESS WEEK come up with its Top 25 Managers of the Year? The
magazine polled its 220 editors around the world, including its large
foreign bureau system, the largest of any global business magazine. The
methodology was deceptively simple: screening the financial figures,
questioning the best analytical minds, and talking to the leading corporate
managers around the world. The bureaus asked: Who was the best in 1995?
Here's the collective reply.

RALPH S. LARSEN

Johnson & Johnson Chief RALPH S. LARSEN doesn't shrink from a fight. In
1995, he won J&J's first-ever hostile takeover battle, snaring Cordis.
Using ads that slammed a rival's product, Larsen also turned an obscure
Merck prescription drug, Pepcid AC, into an over-the-counter heartburn
powerhouse. J&J had one of its most profitable years on the 57-year-old
CEO's watch. Net income is expected to be up 19%.

GEORGE A. DAVID

For GEORGE A. DAVID, an ocean sailboat racer, 1995 was the year his company
finally delivered. United Technologies saw earnings and margins rise
despite falling defense spending and modest revenue growth. The 53-year-old
CEO galvanized the $21 billion conglomerate to capitalize on its great name
franchises--Otis, Carrier, Sikorsky, and Pratt & Whitney. Wall Street
cheered: The stock rose about 48%.

CASEY G. COWELL

He's chairman of the hottest U.S. modem manufacturer. Thanks to the
explosion of computer networks, CASEY G. COWELL's U.S. Robotics saw
revenues explode to $889 million in 1995, up from $378.6 million in '94.
Cowell, 43, built new plants and designed faster modems. He also bid for
bankrupt Hayes Microcomputer Products, once the country's largest modem
maker. Cowell is shooting for a $5 billion company by 2000.

LEWIS E. PLATT

How do you make a huge company grow 20% a year? In 1995, Hewlett-Packard
CEO LEWIS E. PLATT showed 'em how again. Sales are up 26%, to $31.5
billion; profits are up 52%, to $2.4 billion. Platt, 54, tapped RICHARD E.
BELLUZZO, 42, to merge the retail-minded PC and printer division with the
old Big Iron business. Platt believes corporations want one-stop shopping
for information technology, and he's giving it to them.

MANAGERS TO WATCH IN 1996

Abigail Johnson, 34, is heir very apparent at Fidelity Investments. The
boss's daughter owns 24.5% of Fidelity. That makes her a billionaire, but
is she a manager capable of taking over from Dad, Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson
III, who is 65? So far, Abby has dodged a role in senior management to
manage money. Will she become chairwoman and leave day-to-day management to
others?

Eric A. Benhamou, chief executive officer of 3Com, loves to manage--other
businesses, that is. He is Silicon Valley's gentlest takeover artist. His
3Com pulled off 10 acquisitions worth $1 billion in three years. Now he's
trying to persuade Wall Street that he can make money in the expanding
market for lower-end networking gear and PC network cards for small
business and the home. Tired of slowpoke modems? Call Benhamou.

Ford Chairman Alex Trotman probably has the toughest job in Detroit in
1996. Customers aren't stampeding to his newly styled Taurus. Ford is
overhauling 40% of its entire U.S. product line and 35% of its European
offerings. Trotman is under pressure to find a way to move all these new,
more expensive models in a market that is interested only in bargains. Will
lower rates give Trotman some breathing room by cutting leasing costs?

In April, 1995, Nobuyuki Idei, 58, became the first nonengineer to lead
Sony, replacing Norio Ohga. He quickly dumped Mickey Shulhoff, Sony's
high-profile U.S. head. Idei speaks fluent English and French, but it has
yet to be seen whether he can speak Hollywoodese.

Bill Gates faces his biggest challenge in years. While the 40-year-old
chairman of Microsoft has the PC software market sewn up--not so the
mushrooming Internet world. In December, Gates mapped out an ambitious
Internet strategy. Then he licensed Java, the hot Internet software. Is
this a new beginning or the end of his hegemony?

For as long as Jerry Levin has been chairman of Time Warner, investors have
wondered if he had the ``it'' of leadership. This fall he acted boldly and
acquired Turner Broadcasting System. But now he has to stir up that magic
synergy, something he couldn't do between Time Inc. and Warner. Is this his
last shot?

Gerhardt Schulmeyer, chief executive at German computer and telecom company
Siemens Nixdorf Informations Systems, is aiming to topple Big Blue in
Europe. But can he break the great resistance to change within Germany's
telecom industry? If Schulmeyer can't do it in 1996, Germany will only fall
further behind.

Whoever thought an obscure animal-feed ingredient could lead to so much
fuss? But for Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, lysine
could be his Waterloo. Federal antitrust investigators are reviewing hours
of taped conversations provided by a former employee, Mark Whitacre, who
claims ADM fixed lysine prices. Meantime, under fire from shareholders,
Andreas, 77, has appointed a committee of outside directors to put ADM
corporate governance under a microscope. Can he survive another year?

Ditto for Michael H. Spindler. With first-quarter results ending Dec. 31 in
the red, following a year of takeover rumors and boardroom turmoil, Apple
Computer's embattled CEO is hanging on by a thread. The board is backing
him for now.

Insiders says W. James McNerney Jr., a 46-year-old Yale graduate and
Harvard MBA, is a front-runner in the race to succeed Jack Welch as CEO of
General Electric. In October, Welch pulled McNerney away from a critical
post as head of GE's Asia operations to take over management of the $3
billion lighting unit.

Lester M. Alberthal Jr. may soon find himself running an independent
Electronic Data Systems, the information services giant in Plano, Tex. EDS
has been part of General Motors since 1984, when it was sold by famous
founder Ross Perot. GM announced in August, 1995, that it planned to spin
off EDS if it can get the Internal Revenue Service's approval for a
tax-free deal. Analysts expect EDS's independence day to come by the
spring.

When you're running for your life, do you reach for a Snapple or a
Gatorade? William D. Smithburg, CEO of the Quaker Oats, has his hands full
with both. His dominant Gatorade franchise faces a terrific challenge in
'96 as Coca-Cola promotes its rival sports drink, Powerade, at the 1996
Olympics. He has even knottier problems with his Snapple franchise.

Can Hiroshi Okuda cure Toyota's big-company disease? In August, the
63-year-old finance man became president of Japan's largest auto maker, the
first non-Toyoda family member to run the company. Many see the bold
executive as the best hope for a fresh breeze at Toyota.

Can a power-tool marketing whiz finally put some drive back into Polaroid?
On Dec. 1, 44-year-old Gary T. DiCamillo took the reins as the new CEO.
Given credit for reviving Black & Decker's consumer power tool business,
he's now charged with resurrecting a company that has been drifting
sideways for years.

Journalists recoiled in 1995 as new Times Mirror CEO Mark H. Willes closed
New York Newsday and ordered layoffs at the flagship Los Angeles Times.
Willes, a 15-year veteran of General Mills, was brought in to repair years
of sluggish profits at Times Mirror. His goal: boost earnings per share by
50% in 1996.

THE BEST ENTREPRENEURS

An amazing year for entrepreneurs! A new club was formed:
double-billionaire winners. Jim Clark did it once with Silicon Graphics and
came back with Netscape. Steve Jobs hit it big with Apple-took a long
break-and won again with Pixar. The hurdle was certainly raised in '95.

STEVE JOBS

How sweet it is. STEVE JOBS, co-founder of Apple Computer, has been trying
to come up with a second hit for a decade. No such luck--until Nov. 29.
That's when his company, Pixar Animation Studios, makers of the smash hit
movie Toy Story, went public with a bang. The stock, priced at 22, zoomed
to 49 before falling back to 24. Jobs's 80% stake was briefly worth $1.1
billion. What's next? His other company, NeXT, is making Web software, and
Jobs may see his third IPO in early 1996.

DOUBLE-DUTY DRIVER

The Taylor Made Burner Bubble is one of the hottest drivers on the golf
course. Taylor Made Golf shifted weight on the shaft from under the grip a
couple of inches toward the head. That hikes centrifugal force and clubhead
speed during the swing. A low center of gravity moves the ball into the air
fast and allows the driver to double as a jazzy fairway wood. Price: $299
for steel, $499 for titanium.

PRODUCTS TO WATCH IN 1996

Cadillac is counting on its new German-engineered, entry-level Catera sedan
to entice boomers away from the Lexus and the Beemer. Price: $33,000.
-- With its Pentium chips, Intel cemented its dominance of the
personal-computer market. Now, with the next-generation Pentium Pro, Intel
goes for the server and workstation market.
-- Can the revamped Ford Taurus get it in gear in 1996? The sedan's
undulating styling and stiff price (close to $20,000) scared off lots of
tire kickers in 1995. Will Ford Motors make it worth their while to give
the new Taurus a try?

HAS CADDY TURNED THE CORNER?

   I have received numerous inquiries from your readership concerning ``A
Caddy that's not for Daddy'' (The Corporation, Dec. 18). Despite
considerable disclosure of facts and open discussion, your author chose to
include her opinions and the clearly biased opinions of our competitors
without including any of our perspective.
   With regard to our reduction in sales volume: Cadillac's planned and
profitable reduction of daily rental fleet sales accounts for much of the
reduction in the division's sales from 1989 to 1995. While we chose not to
foreshadow our 1995 calendar year forecasts to competitors by providing
them for this story, we did provide a yearly accounting of our daily rental
fleet reduction statistics (from 32% of total sales in 1991 to 18% in
1994). We expected that disclosure of this plan and accompanying
performance would not be omitted from your review of our sales
performance.
   As for our dealers, you characterized the perception of them as
``salesmen in white belts and plaid sport coats'' and continued to
perpetrate a disservice to our very professional dealer personnel. Our
dealers consistently earn high customer-satisfaction scores and were once
again rated No.1 domestic luxury nameplate in a recent J.D. Power &
Associates Inc. Sales Satisfaction Survey, second only to Infiniti and
ahead of Lexus, Mercedes, Lincoln, BMW, and all other luxury brands.
   You also raise questions about our customer demographics. Fundamental
changes in our owner demographic profile have resulted from the
introduction of the 1992 Seville, Seville Touring Sedan, and Eldorado
models. The author accurately quoted the average age of ``some model''
owners at nearly 70. Specifically, this model is the Fleetwood, which we
are eliminating from the model line this year. A fair accounting of our
progress would also have noted that the average age of Seville STS owners
is 52 years, an average age that has been reduced by six years since the
introduction of this model in 1991.
   Regarding side air bags, we were disappointed to note that your author
chose to omit the rollout of air bags in the 1997 DeVille model, mentioning
only the introduction for Catera in mid-1997 and again creating the
appearance that Cadillac was behind other luxury manufacturers in the
implementation of this technology. The introduction of the side air bags at
the beginning of the 1997 model year on the DeVille was made very clear in
our interview.
   Finally, you refer to us as ``an industry joke.'' In spite of the fact
that nine new models have been added to the luxury market from two all-new
manufacturers (Lexus and Infiniti) since 1989, Cadillac continues as volume
leader in the U.S. luxury market--a title held for the last 46 years. The
DeVille remains America's most-purchased luxury sedan--a title held for the
past nine years. The Northstar-powered Seville STS is a recognized
technology tour de force among automotive critics and enthusiastic owners.
The all-new Catera has been reviewed favorably by all of the author's
colleagues.
   The above-listed facts and many other positive points concerning
Cadillac's overall performance were omitted from your story. Our market
leadership and product leadership makes preposterous the notion that
Cadillac is the brunt of jokes in the industry. To the contrary, our
product technology and large loyal owner base are the envy of the
industry.
John O. Grettenberger
General Manager
Cadillac Motor Car Div.
Warren, Mich.

Editor's note: Cadillac supplied numbers on fleet sales only through 1994
and acknowledged that it expected total sales to decline by 15% in 1995.
Our description of the negative perception of Cadillac dealers focused on
younger buyers it hopes to attract with the Catera and matches the Catera
team's own characterization of its consumer research.

   Your story on the Catera missed the mark. As I see it, Catera is yet
another encouraging step as Cadillac transforms itself. Why keep harping on
the Cimarron, unquestionably a Stone Age disaster? Cadillac left the Stone
Age long ago. Why not mention the Seville Touring Sedan, Detroit's most
exciting world car? What about the national Baldrige Quality Award Cadillac
received in recognition of quality and changes in culture? And what about
the Northstar system? You're much too bleak. At 57, I am most certainly a
Daddy. But Catera just may be the Caddy I've been waiting for--and my
boomer son, too.
Dan Panshin
St. Paul, Minn.

   Regarding General Motors Corp.'s plans for the new Catera, your article
left out a few more mistakes that the Cadillac Div. has made in past years
besides the Cimarron and the Allante. How about the 8-6-4 engines and the
early model Sevilles?
   Cadillac had better be satisfied with its grandfather image, because any
middle-aged luxury-car buff worth his salt would not even think about a new
Cadillac, considering the company's track record for the past 15 years.
Especially with introductory models.

`TERRORISTS SHOULD NEVER BE CONFUSED WITH DISSIDENTS'

   I must take exception to your story about Saudi Arabia in your Nov. 27
issue (``A dangerous spark in the oil fields,'' International Business).
BUSINESS WEEK played into the hands of terrorists by trying to create a
link between the terrorist car bombing in Riyadh that claimed the lives of
five Americans and the internal situation in our country.
   Even though no one knows yet who committed this act of murder, your
article stated that the car bombing ``suggests once again that internal
enemies, not external ones, may now be the biggest threats'' to states on
the Arabian Peninsula.
   Whether in the U.S., Israel, France, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia, people may
disagree about internal policies. But terrorists should never be confused
with dissidents. Terrorists kill because they are criminals and murderers.
They do not need an ``excuse,'' especially feeble ones such as ``belt
tightening,'' as cited in your article.
   The ``internal situation'' that you described did not cause the car
bombing any more than the U.S. budget crisis caused the Oklahoma City
bombing. Terrorism is a meaningless act. As your story revealed, if you
search for ``reasons,'' you will only be led astray.

EXPORT DIVERSION, MAYBE. DUMPING, ABSOLUTELY

   Regarding ``Exports that aren't going anywhere'' (Legal Affairs, Dec.
4), I'd feel sorrier for companies whose low-priced exports are being
diverted back to the U.S. if they weren't meeting the classic definition of
dumping: selling at a lower price in a foreign country than they do
domestically.
   When a foreign manufacturer sells at a lower cost in the U.S. than it
does in its own country, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is all over
them. Are American companies claiming injury when their dumping activities
result in the obvious economic consequences? Wait until the other
countries' FTC equivalents get through with them.
   The reality is that price differentials are extremely difficult to
maintain in the global economy. If the law doesn't get you, economics
will.

TRAVELERS DOESN'T TRAFFIC IN HARD SELLING

   Your recent article on ``How Travelers got moving again'' (Finance, Dec.
4) stated that CEO Robert I. Lipp ``began pushing Travelers homeowners' and
auto policies through the PFS network of 100,000 hard-sell part-time
agents, who work for commissions far below the typical 15% paid...'' The
article was great, but the connotation that PFS agents employ hard-sell
tactics is incorrect. Roughly 80% of the sales force is in fact part-time
and does not rely on commissions to make a living. Thus, the basic PFS
approach is educational, not confrontational. Part-time PFS agents do not
have to make the sale to put food on the table. Hard sell? Nothing could be
further from the truth.

A WINNING NUMBER FOR THE LABORITES?
The national lottery flap may further undermine the Tories

By:
By Julia Flynn in London


`Scamalot.'' That's what critics are now calling Camelot Group PLC, the
for-profit, Anglo-American consortium running Britain's national lottery.
After barely a year of operation, Camelot Group is weathering a storm of
controversy. Among the allegations are offering bribes, cozying up to
government regulators, and paying top executives unseemly salaries for the
low-risk chore of peddling lottery tickets to wager-loving Britons.
   The consortium denies any impropriety, and no one at Camelot has been
formally charged with any wrongdoing. No matter. The Labor Party is turning
Scamalot into a referendum on the ruling Tories' laissez-faire approach to
business. With elections just a year away, Labor will do everything to keep
the issue hot. Pressure already is mounting to revamp government oversight
of the lottery and to turn the operation over to a not-for-profit group
when Camelot's license expires in 2001.
   The Conservatives had reasoned that a for-profit business would operate
a lottery more efficiently than a state-run firm. So after reviewing both
for-profit and not-for-profit bids, the government went with Camelot. It's
composed of four British companies--candy and soft-drinks giant Cadbury
Schweppes, computer maker ICL, Racal Electronics, and banknote printer De
La Rue--and one U.S. company, lottery operator GTech Corp. A new government
agency--the Office of the National Lottery, or Oflot--oversees Camelot.
``SMELL FACTOR.'' By December, Camelot was estimating it would sell $7
billion worth of tickets and scratch cards in its first year, making the
lottery one of the world's biggest. Then controversy flared. On a BBC
investigative program, Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways,
alleged that Guy B. Snowden, GTech's co-chairman and a Camelot director,
had offered him a bribe to withdraw his group's bid for the lottery.
Branson said he informed Oflot's director general, Peter Davis, of the
alleged bribe, but Davis denies being told. Snowden labels the charges
``beneath contempt'' and is considering a libel suit against Branson, who
is already suing GTech for libel. On Dec. 20, Davis said an investigation
would begin in January.
   The same day as the BBC broadcast, Davis admitted to a House of Commons
committee that he had accepted rides in GTech's jets, helicopters, and
limousines while touring state lotteries in the U.S. Davis also has
acknowledged a close friendship with GTech board member Carl B. Menges. In
a heated debate, Labor member Donald Anderson argued that the ``smell
factor'' prevents Davis from having ``the credibility necessary for the
performance of his functions.'' The government so far has refused to sack
Davis.
SCRUTINIZED. Labor MPs also are raising questions about whether Oflot let
Camelot profit at the expense of the good causes it is supposed to fund.
Camelot made a $37 million profit on revenues of $3.9 billion during the
half-year ended in September and paid out a $14.6 million dividend to its
five shareholders, the maximum payout allowed under its license. Yet in a
September 1994 letter to an MP, Oflot's Davis wrote that based on the
consortium's forecast he expected it would be ``over four years before
Camelot shows a cash return on its investment.'' Camelot says it did not
``deliberately understate'' its expected returns.
   Meanwhile, Camelot's pay packets are raising eyebrows, too. Camelot
Chief Executive Tim Holley received $682,785 for 1995, including a $184,800
bonus. Holley declines to comment. Oflot says it doesn't regulate the pay
at Camelot, but in a country where high salaries arouse ire, this argument
is hardly convincing. Says Denis Vaughan, an orchestra conductor who
started the move for a lottery to help the arts: ``Oflot is more of a
lapdog than a watchdog.''
   GTech merits far closer watching as well, Camelot's critics say. The
Rhode Island-based company, which operates 74 lotteries for governments and
other public authorities, has endured scrutiny for its methods of winning
contracts in the U.S. Its former national sales manager, J. David Smith,
has been charged by federal prosecutors with taking kickbacks in New
Jersey. GTech has never been charged with a crime and says it was
victimized by Smith, who is vigorously defending himself. Nonetheless,
critics are calling for a reexamination of GTech's role in Camelot.
   Scamalot will make even more headlines when the inquiry starts probing
Branson's allegations. The way things are going, Camelot's partners may
come to regret that they ever bet on this business.

TOSSING A LIFELINE TO MEXICO'S BIGGEST BANKS
Even Banamex and Bancomer are getting a state bailout

By:
By Geri Smith in Mexico City


Mexico's yearlong economic crisis has been murder on the country's banking
system. The government has been forced to take over six banks and bail out
nine others. But the prevailing wisdom was always that the system's crown
jewels, Banamex and Bancomer, would easily weather the storm. Now they,
too, are in sufficient distress that the government is preparing to assume
chunks of their troubled loan portfolios--and those of two other banks. The
cost: More than $4 billion on top of the $11 billion the government has
already spent on bailouts. The government effort has already grown so
massive that some critics are saying that the banks are being
renationalized.
   It's a stunning reversal. Just four years ago, the government made $13.5
billion selling off the state-controlled banks to some of Mexico's cockiest
entrepreneurs. They plunked down an average of three times book value for
18 banks, figuring that the economic reforms of then President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, coupled with free trade with the U.S., would guarantee
vigorous economic growth and handsome profits.
SICK SYSTEM. Instead, the new owners have seen the value of their holdings
devastated by the high interest rates and bad loans that are the hallmarks
of the financial crisis. With borrowers unable to pay, past-due loans now
exceed $17 billion--18% of the system's portfolio. If tougher U.S.
accounting standards were applied, the figure would be as high as
35%--meaning the system is very sick. One big loser is financier Agustin
Legoretta III, whose investor group has lost nearly all the $1.4 billion it
paid for Grupo Financiero Inverlat--now a ward of the state.
   The banks' problems present a big threat to President Ernesto Zedillo
Ponce de Leon's pledges that the economy will recover in 1996. The country
needs healthy banks to finance any recovery. Yet, Standard & Poor's Corp.
says Mexican banks won't start to turn around until the third quarter of
1996 because banks and borrowers are still being hit by 50% interest
rates.
   The worry is that Mexico's banking problems will be a drag on the
economy for years. Moody's Investors Service warns that the bank bailout
could cost 10% to 15% of GDP, or up to $40 billion. That would slow growth
and suck Mexican and international funding away from other uses. With many
economists expecting the economy to shrink in early 1996, the government
may have to step in with more money soon. ``The government is providing
Band-Aids to the banks as they come for help, but the real cancer--the
past-due loans--has not been eliminated,'' says economist Rogelio Ramirez
de la O.
   The government doesn't have any easy way out of this mess. Confidence in
Mexico is so low that if the government tries to help the banks by bringing
rates down, the markets will likely pummel the peso and Mexican securities.
That's what happened last fall when market jitters forced an upward spike
in rates, producing a flurry of new defaults.
WARY INVESTORS. In October, Standard & Poor's downgraded Banamex' peso debt
to BBB-, S&P's lowest investment-grade rating. In response, the loan-buyout
program, previously used to help smaller banks, was extended to Banamex and
Bancomer, which together control 39% of the system's assets. ``Banamex and
Bancomer are the most important banks in Mexico, and we simply can't run
the risk that their finances might deteriorate,'' says Eduardo Fernandez,
president of Mexico's Banking & Securities Commission.
   The banks' troubles present a buying opportunity for foreign
banks--though most are wary of getting entangled in a Mexican bank now. But
Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya paid $340 million to buy control of troubled
Mercantil Probursa in July. Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia is negotiating to
assume control of Inverlat. And Bancomer is shopping around for a foreign
minority investor to inject fresh capital.
   As they grapple with the banks' problems, Mexican officials now concede
that they mishandled the bank sell-off in the early 1990s. Too much
emphasis was placed on obtaining high prices and too little emphasis on the
banking skills of the buyers. ``In retrospect, I would have applied some of
the purchase price to better capitalization of the banks,'' says Finance
Secretary Guillermo Ortiz, who was in charge of the privatization program
then and is responsible for bailing the banks out now. He is probably
doomed to spend a long time correcting his mistake.

APPLE: ANOTHER BOUT OF BAD TIDINGS
Profit pressure may bring layoffs and suitors

By:
By Peter Burrows, with Kathy Rebello, in San Francisco and Steve Brull in
Tokyo


Mike Spindler just can't get a break. Instead of celebrating the blowout
sales he expected this Christmas quarter, Apple Computer Inc.'s CEO is
bracing for a very rough ride. In mid-December, the company warned of a
possible loss during the period, and analysts fear the worst--layoffs,
projects killed, maybe more losses. Some even say Apple will have little
choice but to sell off parts, if not all, of the business. And there are
again rumors that Spindler's job is in jeopardy. Says Robertson, Stephens &
Co. analyst John T. Rossi, who doesn't foresee profits again until next
fall: ``Apple is in a tougher spot than it's been in for a long time.''
   The reason? Banking on a strong season, Apple pumped up production by
about 30%. To move its many Macintosh models, the company slashed prices.
Simultaneously, it faced a shortage of profitable high-end models. To make
matters worse, Apple was slammed by a vicious price war in Japan. The net
result: On Dec. 15, Apple announced that its unit sales and revenue for the
Christmas quarter were running above last year's level but below internal
forecasts. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst Eugene G. Glazer now expects
Apple to report a $5 million loss for the quarter, down from a $178 million
profit on sales of $2.8 billion for the same quarter a year ago. Glazer
figures Apple's gross margins for the period slipped to a tiny 18.2%.
CREDIT WATCH. Apple has gained market share worldwide, hitting 9.3% of the
PC market this fall, up from 7.9% at midyear, figures New York-based
researcher Link/IDC. Apple execs see the share improvement as critical,
maintaining that software developers--and then customers--will abandon the
Mac if it loses more ground to PC rivals. But to make its market-share
gains, Apple sacrificed profitability--and its long-held tenet that
consumers are willing to pay a premium for its computers. Recent price cuts
narrowed the gap between Macs and PCs from $1,000-plus in 1994 to $320, IDC
figures.
   Apple isn't giving up on its strategy. It recently sweetened discounts
to big resellers with $20 million worth of Mac sales a year. And dealers
say Apple will cut prices 10% again in January on some PowerBook laptops
and high-end 9500 Power Macs. But outsiders worry that Apple can't afford
its crusade. Analysts figure Apple's cash balance is down to $200 million.
Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services started reviews of Apple's
credit on Dec. 18.
   That makes internal cost-cutting crucial. Insiders say between 1,000 and
2,000 employees--7% to 15% of the workforce--could be let go before
quarterly results come out on Jan. 17. More manufacturing also may be
outsourced, and nascent businesses--such as multimedia set-top boxes--may
be sold or axed.
   Some outsiders contend even that won't do it. Glazer says slashing 1,500
jobs translates into $100 million in yearly savings, vs the $450 million he
thinks Apple needs to reach Compaq Computer Corp.'s 23.5% gross margins and
earn its 10% net. To fuel development of the Mac alone, Apple spends about
5.6% of sales on R&D, vs. 1.8% for Compaq.
   Spindler engineered Apple out of a similar crisis in 1993, when he laid
off 13% of the workforce and took a one-time quarterly loss of $188
million. Can he do it again? With gross margins way down, he has less room
to maneuver. Thanks to a bloody price war started by Fujitsu Ltd., Apple's
Japanese unit, normally the source of 30% of the company's profits, will be
lucky to break even this quarter, analysts in Japan say.
   Despite rumors, insiders think it's unlikely Spindler will get the boot
at Apple's scheduled board meeting in mid-January. ``The board stands
behind the statement in October in support of Michael Spindler,'' says a
director.
TROIKA TALES. Apple's troubles, meanwhile, have lowered its share price by
34% since mid-July, to about $32--not far above the company's book value of
$23.50. That has made Apple takeover bait. Two new suitors said to be
sniffing around: Sun Microsystems and a three-way partnership of Apple
co-founder Steve Jobs, who left in 1985; Lawrence Ellison, CEO of software
giant Oracle; and Jim Manzi, former chief of Lotus Development, the
software company recently taken over by IBM.
   Sun execs won't comment on rumors, though Eric E. Schmidt, its chief
technology officer, calls Apple ``a strong brand.'' As for the troika? No
way, says Jobs: ``The rumor ain't true. Though there might be romance in
the idea, I'm afraid one can't go home again.'' The question: How much
breathing room does Spindler have left?

THE COMEBACK KID OF RUSSIA?
Yeltsin has no charismatic rival, and the economy looks better

By:
By Peter Galuszka in Moscow


On election day, voters thronged to the brick school building that served
as the voting place in precinct 1465--a working-class Moscow neighborhood.
One of the voters favoring the Communists--the big winners--was 83-year-old
Maria Artshenava. In her youth, the Communists brought stability and pride,
she said. Today's market reformers have brought only pain. With a pension
of only $45 a month, ``all I can buy is bread,'' she complained.
   For the second time in two years, Russian voters have given President
Boris Yeltsin the same message: Reforms have enriched just a sliver of
Russian society while impoverishing the rest. At the same time, Russia's
superpower status, achieved under the old regime, has collapsed. That's why
voters made the revived Communist Party the leaders, with 22% of the
parliamentary vote. Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's misnamed
Liberal Democratic Party did better than predicted, coming in second.
   It is certainly a disappointing outcome for Yeltsin and the whole reform
camp. But it is not quite a disaster. Indeed, Yeltsin will even find some
encouraging nuggets in the results as he ponders his strategy for the far
more important June presidential elections. Yeltsin hasn't yet declared
whether he will be a candidate in that crucial vote, which will choose a
leader for a five-year term.
FALLING FLAT. As he mulls his options, the Russian President will note with
satisfaction that the parliamentary elections have not produced a
charismatic challenger for the presidency. Grigory Yavlinski, the only
reformer with much popularity, gained just 9% of the votes. Yeltsin's most
feared rival, Alexander Lebed, the nationalist former general, fell flat on
his face. His party received less than the 5% minimum for parliamentary
representation.
   While Yeltsin will face a strong campaign from the resurgent Communists,
their leader, Gennady Zyuganov, is a bumbling-professor type who lacks
charisma. Says Nikolai Petrov, a senior analyst at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace in Moscow: ``This does improve Yeltsin's chances.
There's danger from the Communists and nationalists, but he'll get a chance
to mobilize the democratic electorate.''
   The big question is Yeltsin's health. If he is able to run in June, he
will likely enjoy the heavy backing of the financial and business groups
his policies have enriched as well as the old military and industrial
elite. But if he takes himself out of the race, the reformers could
split--opening the way for Zyuganov or Zhirinovsky.
   There is also concern that the Communist resurgence may frighten Yeltsin
into abandoning his relatively austere economic program. Such a move could
be self-defeating if inflation, which he has chopped from 2,000% in 1992 to
around 170% for 1995, shoots up again.
   But Yeltsin should be able to hold the line on reform. Although the
Communists are likely to pick up at least 150 of the Duma's 450 seats and
Zhirinovsky did surprisingly well, with more than 50 members, the
President's powers are much greater than those of the Duma. Moreover, any
Communist effort to roll back reform will be hurt by the poor showing of
their allies, the Agrarians, a group led by collective farm managers, who
dread privatization of agriculture. They only won about 20 seats. Finally,
the Communists and Zhirinovsky disagree on economics. The otherwise erratic
Zhirinovsky tends to support sound fiscal policies.
   Yeltsin is not acting as if he's going to cave in to his rivals. Moscow
insiders say he will likely ditch unpopular Foreign Minister Andrey V.
Kozyrev. But key aides such as Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and
privatization chief Anatoly Chubais are likely to stay on.
   If Yeltsin can hang on until June, he may be helped by real economic
improvement. With inflation down and the ruble relatively stable, the
indications are that economic output is likely to rise in 1996 for the
first time in six years. Russians are no longer seeing their savings eaten
away to the degree they were two years ago. By June, they may see more
Russian goods on the shelves and perhaps more competitive pricing. While
such changes may not win the votes of big losers such as Maria Artshenava,
they could be enough to gain Yeltsin another five years.

NO SMOKE, BUT PLENTY OF HEAT
Why the smokeless tobacco biz is starting to hack

By:
By Tim Smart, with Ed Brown, in New Haven


For years, UST Inc. has chewed up the competition and spit out pure gold.
Partly because the Greenwich (Conn.) maker of Skoal and Copenhagen brand
snuffs has avoided the political and legal hassles that have plagued
cigarette companies, it has posted profit numbers most consumer-products
outfits can only dream about. Earnings have doubled in five years, to $387
million last year--enough to generate a hefty 32% net margin on $1.2
billion in sales.
   Now, UST may be about to get chewed up. A study released on Dec. 18 by
the American Health Foundation, a Valhalla (N.Y.) organization that focuses
on research about the health hazards of tobacco, found that a single can of
smokeless tobacco contains three times the dosage of cancer-causing
chemicals found in a pack of cigarettes. (The average user of smokeless
tobacco consumes three cans per week.) In Kansas, a team of lawyers is
preparing a nationwide class action alleging that UST and others have known
for years that their products are addictive and harmful. Meanwhile, tobacco
has until Jan. 2 to respond to Food & Drug Administration proposals that
would sharply curtail marketing of smokeless tobacco.
TRIPLE WHAMMY. Perhaps more ominously, UST's fundamental business is
changing for the worse. Analysts expect profits to increase by 11% in 1996,
but much of the rise will come from higher prices. Unit-sales growth for
UST's smokeless tobacco through the first nine months of this year was a
paltry 0.5%--after increases of 2.6% in 1994 and 2.3% in 1993 and twice
those rates in the 1980s. From about 90% in the late 1980s, UST's market
share has fallen to about 84%.
   The problem: UST's traditional market of mostly young blue-collar males
isn't expanding. Attempts to lure new buyers to smokeless tobacco--mainly
former cigarette smokers or younger users--have failed. Competitors,
meanwhile, have begun chipping away at UST. Swisher International Inc.'s
Helme unit offers its Silver Creek brand in a two-for-one package, while
Conwood Co. is selling its new Cougar brand for about half the price of
UST's Skoal.
   UST is fighting back, but slowly. It recently unveiled Skoal Flavor
Packs, a pouch-like version of Skoal designed as an alternative to
cigarettes. But similar products have had only limited success with their
target market: cigarette smokers. Meanwhile, Joseph R. Taddeo, head of
UST's tobacco unit, resigned in June after a dispute with CEO Vincent A.
Gierer Jr.--analysts say over the course of new-product initiatives.
Taddeo's replacement is marketing executive Robert D. Rothenberg. Gierer,
Rothenberg, and other company executives refused interview requests.
   Analysts expect Rothenberg to further shift UST's advertising emphasis
away from stock-car racing and rodeo audiences to rock concerts and college
campuses. Advertising spending is going up, too. One splashy promotion is
UST's Rock The Smokies campaign, which offers a drawing for free tickets to
a country-music concert to be held on Fourth of July weekend in Newport,
Tenn. Anyone who sends in a coupon can ask for free samples of UST
products.
   But aggressive marketing could easily ignite more opposition from
activists and regulators. ``Statistics show that it's young people that
start using tobacco, not adults,'' says Mitchell R. Zeller, a deputy
associate commissioner at the FDA. ``It's the President's goal that the
next generation grow up without becoming addicted to tobacco.'' The new FDA
rules would limit marketing efforts such as sponsorships and the handing
out of free samples. The agency also is likely to pressure UST and stores
to ensure that they don't sell to minors.
I.D., PLEASE? Some states aren't waiting for Washington. In October,
Massachusetts forced UST to consent to stringent restrictions on the use of
mail-order samples there, including checking driver's licenses to verify
the age of those writing in for samples. This came after a six-month sting
in which the state had minors clip coupons in Rolling Stone and other
magazines, then write for free samples after claiming to be adults. ``If
you could fill out a coupon and sign something without showing any proof of
age and get a six-pack of beer in the mail, people would be outraged,''
says Assistant Attorney General George Weber.
   Diversification would seem prudent at this point. UST got into
winemaking in the mid-1980s under the Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia
Crest labels, but wine still only accounts for 7% of sales and 1.3% of
operating profits, hardly enough to offset pressures on its main business.
UST may have to come up with something else--or endure some bites into its
peerless financial record.

WILL FLIPPER PLAY IN ESTONIA?
Why John Kluge is on a buying binge in Hollywood

By:
By Ronald Grover in Los Angeles


John W. Kluge didn't get to be one of the richest men in America by being
stupid. A onetime Ford assembly-line worker, he invested in a Washington
radio station in 1946 and later a string of TV stations. That made his
fortune in a big way in 1984, when he sold the TV stations to Rupert
Murdoch for $2 billion. He was among the first to jump into cellular,
too--picking up a cell-phone operation in 1983, which he sold three years
later for a cool $1.6 billion.
   Yet for all his lucrative dealmaking, the 81-year-old Kluge has never
managed to conquer Hollywood. He has lost an estimated $275 million on
Orion Pictures Corp., the production outfit he began investing in during
the mid-1980s--only to see it sink into bankruptcy. Orion emerged from
Chapter 11 in 1992, but it still gushes red ink. So why would Kluge's
Metromedia International Group Inc. swoop in on Dec. 21 to bid $115 million
for debt-plagued Samuel Goldwyn Co.? Or, among other apparently oddball
deals, agree on Nov. 30 to pay an estimated $533 million for Alliance
Entertainment Corp., a distributor of golden-oldie music by the likes of
Mel Torme and Rosemary Clooney? The answer: Eastern Europe.
PICK OF SHOWS. Since the Berlin Wall came down, Kluge and his aides have
been aggressively buying up licenses to provide wireless cable TV, radio,
and telephones in such places as Riga, Tallinn, and Nizhny Novgorod. Now,
Kluge's troops are hustling to line up the programming they intend to sell
to these new customers. If it outbids Dutch media giant Polygram for the
Samuel Goldwyn studio, Metromedia will gain the rights to a library of
1,100 films, including such classics as Guys and Dolls and Pride of the
Yankees, as well as some 700 episodes of TV programs such as Flipper and
Gentle Ben.
   Will they line up in Estonia to see Flipper? Hard to say. But Kluge and
company certainly think so. In a flurry of deals since August, 1994,
Metromedia has also snapped up two smallish film companies. If you add in
Orion and Goldwyn, the deals would give Metromedia rights to more than
2,100 films and television shows.
   One problem: Much of Kluge's new empire isn't making any money. In a
recent filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission, Metromedia
acknowledged that its collection of companies lost $51.2 million in the
first six months of 1995, on sales of $179.9 million. Moreover, the company
is clogged with $399 million in short-term and long-term debt.
   Kluge isn't talking about how he intends to turn his money-losers
around. And he shows no sign of altering his strategy. Associates say
Metromedia continues to bid for licenses not only in Eastern Europe but
also in Asia. The company already ships such U.S. programs as MTV, Country
Music Television, and the Discovery Channel to wireless cable-TV
subscribers in such cities as Moscow, Bucharest, and Tashkent. It also owns
radio stations in Moscow, Budapest, and elsewhere, and is building wireless
phone systems in other regions.
   Looking for financial stability, last April Kluge merged Metromedia with
Actava Group Inc., a mishmash of companies formerly known as Fuqua
Industries. Its chairman, John D. Phillips, is a 52-year-old turnaround
specialist who has sold off everything but Actava's Snapper Power Equipment
unit. An executive whose tastes run to denim and Harley Davidsons, Phillips
will act as CEO of Kluge's entertainment companies from from Actava's
Atlanta headquarters.
   As a source of new programming, Kluge is counting on Motion Picture
Corp. of America (MPCA), a production house he agreed on Nov. 27 to buy for
$32.5 million in stock and cash. MPCA, which produced such low-budget hits
as Dumb and Dumber and Threesome, plans to turn out 14 to 16 films next
year for Metromedia. If Metromedia wins Goldwyn, which specializes in art
films such as The Madness of King George, it would get ownership of a dozen
other films in the works, including American Buffalo with Dustin Hoffman.
   Can a library of movies and some startup production help put Kluge's
entertainment biz in the black? Possibly. More likely, they will keep him
in the game long enough to make back the losses from his Orion debacle--and
find another, bigger company to buy him out. After all, some of John
Kluge's shrewdest moves have come from knowing when to sell.



KLUGE'S MEDIA EMPIRE

ORION PICTURES Has a film library of 1,200 movies, including Platoon,
Terminator, and Silence of the Lambs. Emerged from bankruptcy in late 1992.
Lost $18.9 million on $73 million in revenues for the six months ended Aug.
31.

METROMEDIA INTERNATIONAL Provides wireless cable TV, paging, and telephone
services to Eastern Europe and former Soviet-bloc nations. Lost $13.1
million on $3.3 million in sales for the first six months of fiscal 1996.

SAMUEL GOLDWYN* Owns a 52-theater chain and a library of 1,100 films,
including Pride of the Yankees and Guys and Dolls, and 700 TV episodes. It
also has film production and distribution. Lost $12.3 million on sales of
$53.5 million in the six months ended Sept. 30.

THE NAACP BETS ON A NEW BREADWINNER
Kweisi Mfume hopes to show donors the crisis is over

By:
By Susan B. Garland in Washington


Last March, officials of the scandal-plagued National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People asked members of the AT&T Foundation to lunch
at Manhattan's Remi restaurant. Myrlie Evers-Williams, who had just taken
over as NAACP chair, quickly got down to business. What could the nation's
venerable civil rights organization do to persuade the foundation to renew
a three-year, $225,000 education grant that had expired in 1993? AT&T's
answer: Put your house in order. ``We were looking for strong leadership,
strong financial controls, and a strong mission,'' recalls Milton J.
Little, an AT&T Foundation vice-president who was at the meeting.
   Enter Representative Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.). On Feb. 15, Mfume will leave
Congress to become president and CEO of the NAACP, a move that figures to
bolster its clout--and its bottom line. Already, his appointment may have
won over one big donor: On Dec. 28, Nissan Motor Corp. USA is expected to
announce it will donate $100,000 to the NAACP. The organization's backers
hope others will follow. ``We wanted someone whose integrity was
first-rate,'' says Nancy L. Lane, director of corporate affairs for Johnson
& Johnson, who served on the NAACP's search committee.
DAUNTING TASK. Mfume's challenges are twofold: He must attract young blacks
now drawn to militant leaders like Louis Farrakhan while reassuring
Corporate America that the NAACP is worthy of support. ``We need to change
the hearts, minds, and direction of young people so that they see
appreciation of work, respect for elders, and individual responsibility as
bedrock principles,'' he says.
   Mfume thinks this message of self-reliance will appeal to donors. ``I
hope corporate partners who have not shied away will say to others that
it's all right to come home to the NAACP,'' he says. The task is daunting.
The 87-year-old organization has been reeling since August, 1994, when it
ousted Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. after discovering he had
paid $300,000 to settle a sexual-harassment suit. Auditors found other
evidence of gross financial mismanagement. The scandal led to longtime
Chairman William F. Gibson's defeat last February to Evers-Williams.
   Mfume is meeting with auditors to come up with fiscal controls for the
group, which is $3.8 million in debt. He hopes to build a $150 million
endowment by 2001, improve efficiencies by merging regional offices, and
ask some suppliers to restructure or forgive debt.
   Business, which contributed almost half of the NAACP's 1995 budget of
$8.5 million, is key to his efforts. Despite financial disarray, many
companies, including Procter & Gamble, Sears, Quaker Oats, and IBM, have
kept up support. Companies argue that business has an interest in backing
groups that promote minority opportunities. ``It's important we have a
skilled and qualified workforce,'' says Eric R. Graves, manager of
constituency affairs at Texaco Inc.
   Other corporate donors couldn't ignore the disorder. In 1995, corporate
giving declined some 30% from 1994. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc. withheld
its annual $50,000 grant in 1994 and 1995. Seagram spokeswoman Patsy Glazer
says the company had been waiting to see who would head the organization.
Now, she wants to meet with Mfume. Merrill Lynch & Co. also is withholding
support until it sees how the NAACP's game plan shapes up. AT&T is waiting,
too, but Little is hopeful: ``We believe Mr. Mfume's leadership is what is
needed.''
SALES TOUR. Backers say Mfume proved his leadership mettle as a member of
the House Banking Committee. There, he emerged as a consensus-builder,
mediating disputes among the banking, insurance, and securities industries.
Says Banking Committee Chairman James A. Leach (R-Iowa): ``There are some
people who think that what's good for the free market is bad for
lower-income people. Kweisi believes the reverse--that what makes the
market work will be better for lower-income people.''
   That philosophy is behind Mfume's plans to set up NAACP mentoring
programs to match students with corporate volunteers. He also wants to work
with companies to set up apprenticeship programs and with officials to
improve public schools. He may also push for incentives to encourage
corporations to work with small minority companies.
   Over the next few weeks, Mfume intends to embark on a nationwide tour to
meet with corporate leaders. But with the NAACP's programs barely
functioning, many branch offices virtually closed, and one-third of its
staff on furlough, the organization could be a tough sell. It will take all
of Mfume's skills as bridge-builder to convince Corporate America that the
NAACP won't be just another bad investment on corporate books.

REPACKAGING THE POST OFFICE
Facilities are getting face-lifts, clerks are getting friendlier

By:
By Mark Lewyn in Washington


When retired CIA analyst William R. Dodge stopped at Furr's supermarket in
Albuquerque on Dec. 22, his shopping list included butter, chocolate chips,
nuts, and postage stamps. Stamps? Sure. Overnight delivery, too. The
Albuquerque facility is one of eight that the U.S. Postal Service recently
has tucked inside popular retail outlets around the country.
   The new offices are just one sign that the USPS is trying to reinvent
itself. Aside from opening facilities in outlets such as Furr's and Kmart,
it is sprucing up old offices and improving customer service.
Stamps--including new, self-adhesive ones--can now be purchased at ATMs, by
phone, and with credit cards. During the holidays, sales clerks directed
traffic and branch hours were extended. Workers even dressed as Santa to
deliver Express Mail.
   Why the changes? After all, the agency is flush from last year's rate
hike, higher mail volume, and better cost controls and cash management.
Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon says he ended fiscal 1995 with a record
surplus of $1.77 billion on revenue of $54.3 billion. But in many markets,
the Postal Service is losing out to private carriers and new technologies
such as fax machines (chart). ``We just can't sit here and say to people,
`Here are our hours and, if you feel like it, bring your mail to us,'''
says Runyon. ``We need to get [market share] back.''
   The new approach was evident over the holidays. Runyon hired 40,000
part-time workers to sort mail, leased 116 planes to carry it, and set up a
command center in Washington to make sure it got through. The effort seems
to have worked: On Dec. 20, 1995's busiest mail day, the service delivered
a record 725 million pieces of mail, up 6% from 1994.
   To publicize the reforms, Runyon hiked his ad budget 50% in 1995, to
$143 million. Last fall, he also hired Loren E. Smith, a former Citibank
executive who did stints at Kraft General Foods Inc. and Colgate-Palmolive
Co., to oversee marketing.
   At the heart of the new strategy are the new postal ``stores.'' So far,
200 of the 40,000 local offices have had face-lifts that include attractive
lighting and salesclerks trained to be friendly and helpful. It's looking
good: On average, the new shops have posted 20% sales gains over the
offices they replaced. Now, Smith is stepping up the pace--all postal
facilities in Albuquerque and Atlanta are getting makeovers. Philadelphia;
Columbus, Ohio; Boston; and Richmond, Va., are next. New services include
phone debit cards and a ``Pack-and-Send'' wrapping service.
   Shoppers who endured surly postal service and long lines over the
holidays likely are skeptical of such reforms. But Runyon knows he has to
make the strategy work--or see a lot less mail with a USPS postmark.

A HEAVYWEIGHT CONTENDER
This breakthrough may be the key to a fat pill

By:
By Geoffrey Smith in Boston

Last July, Amgen Inc. looked like it had a lock on one of the drug
industry's most heated races: the search for a ``fat drug.'' In a
much-heralded study whose announcement boosted Amgen's stock by $900
million, researchers disclosed that a protein called leptin, produced by
the newly discovered OB gene, stripped away body fat when injected into
obese mice.
   Barely five months later, an Amgen rival may have taken the lead: On
Dec. 28, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., was to
announce that it had found the ``receptor'' for leptin--the structure on
cell walls that is a crucial part of regulating leptin's function.
Receptors don't make anyone skinny, but many drugs target receptors to
inhibit or stimulate a bodily function. While Amgen is testing an
injectable drug, Millennium says its receptor may be the key to an
antiobesity pill, which would be far more lucrative.
MIND-SET. Researchers had hoped a shortage of leptin--the protein that
signals the brain to stop eating--was a big factor in obesity. But studies
now show that obese people often have high leptin levels. Millennium
believes the receptor it found will lead it to another obesity gene, called
DB, that determines whether the brain can recognize leptin's stop-eating
signal. ``The receptor may lead to drugs for potentially the most prevalent
form of human obesity--one resulting from the brain's resistance to leptin
rather than the lack of leptin,'' says Millennium CEO Mark Levin.
   Weight-watchers shouldn't rethink New Year's resolutions yet:
Researchers say a wonder drug is years away.

EXHALE BLOWS 'EM AWAY

By:
EDITED BY THANE PETERSON
By Ronald Grover

Call it a Christmas miracle. No one was more surprised than execs at
Twentieth Century Fox when its Waiting to Exhale opened on Dec. 22 and
immediately became the unexpected hit of the holidays. Fox had targeted its
marketing for the film, starring singer Whitney Houston and three other
black actresses, heavily at black women. Exhale opened primarily in large
cities; the studio hardly even opened the movie in the 'burbs until after
Christmas.
Hollywood isn't sure why, but despite its segmented marketing and limited
distribution, Exhale is knocking 'em dead. The film, based on a novel by
Terry McMillan, was made on a budget of $15 million, about half the
Hollywood average. In its opening weekend, the movie had a huge $14.3
million box office, beating out six other new films, including Warner
Bros.' Grumpier Old Men and Universal Pictures' Sudden Death. Being one of
the few women-oriented films helped. Whatever other reasons for Exhale's
success, Hollywood won't ignore the lesson: Look for a wave of black-female
buddy movies --glitzier, big-budget ones.

A TRUNKFUL OF PINK SLIPS AT BUDGET

By:
EDITED BY THANE PETERSON

WITH THE RENTAL CAR BUSIness wrapping up one of its worst years ever,
Budget Rent a Car's new chairman, Jack Frazee, had a Grinch-like holiday
message for 500 salaried employees: Your services are no longer needed.
Frazee hopes to save $20 million annually by cutting 20% of the salaried
workforce. The cuts are part of a massive shakeup at Budget, the No.3
rental agency with estimated 1995 U.S. revenues of $1.5 billion. Frazee
also showed the door to his CFO and two senior vice-presidents and closed
40 unprofitable offices. Handing out pink slips over the holidays was ``not
fun,'' Frazee says. ``But I try to remind the people who are left that the
company is a lot more stable as a result of the actions we've taken.''

CHIPMAKER CYRIX IS SPUTtering. On Dec. 22, the company warned that it may
lose $8 million or more in the fourth quarter. A price collapse forced
Cyrix to write down its inventory of chips compatible with Intel's 486.
Cyrix said the loss could force a default on $88 million in loans used to
purchase production equipment to build its newest chip, which is designed
to rival Intel's new Pentium Pro. The company hopes to get a waiver from
creditor IBM, which manufactures Cyrix' newest chip.

A DESERT DEAL FOR BRITISH PETROLEUM

By:

DESPITE A BLOODY INSURgency by Islamic militants in Algeria, British
Petroleum on Dec. 23 signed a five-year deal with Sonatrach, Algeria's
state-owned oil company, to explore and develop gas fields in the remote
I-n-Salah region of the Sahara desert. BP will foot 65% of the $3.5 billion
cost of the project and will get one-third of the gas's sales
value--enough, it figures, to boost its worldwide gas production by up to
30%. A spokesman says BP is hoping that energy installations, which account
for 95% of Algeria's foreign earnings, won't be targeted by the insurgents.
Exxon and Atlantic Richfield also are mulling deals in Algeria.

IN THE MAYBE-IT-DOESN'T-PAY to-stick-your-neck-out category: House Minority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt and 45 fellow Democrats are challenging more
than 90 executives to detail business tax breaks they would be willing to
sacrifice to help balance the federal budget. The challenge, in letters
mailed Dec. 22, was prompted by national newspaper ads signed by the
business leaders imploring Congress to put ``everything on the table'' to
reach a budget deal. Among others, the letter went to Paul Allaire of
Xerox, Lou Gerstner of IBM, Bob Allen of AT&T, and Joe Dionne of The

THE JOBS MARKET

By:
EDITED BY THANE PETERSON

Good thing Steve Jobs knows the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. His
company, Pixar Animation Studios, maker of Toy Story, went public on Nov.
29, sending the stock to 39. Then Pixar fell to 23 on worries that the bulk
of Toy Story's earnings will go to partner Walt Disney. But just after
Christmas, Pixar shares edged back up, to $28, after several analysts rated
the stock a ``buy.'' The current value of Jobs's 80% stake: $840 million.

ARTHUR LEVITT SPEAKS SOFTLY AND CARRIES A LITTLE STICK

By:
EDITED BY DOUGLAS HARBRECHT
By Amy Barrett, with Michael Schroeder

When President Clinton unexpectedly vetoed a securities-litigation reform
bill on Dec. 19, it marked a setback for Securities & Exchange Commission
Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. The SEC chief had toiled for months to forge a
compromise that satisfied Republicans' desire to curb nuisance suits and
the Administration's insistence on protection for small investors. Congress
overrode the veto, but the debacle dealt a blow to Levitt's dream of
becoming a consensus-builder able to bridge the gulf on Capitol Hill.
   Because the veto blindsided GOP lawmakers, Levitt comes off looking
ineffectual. White House pols seeking favor with the trial lawyers' lobby
swayed the President, rather than Levitt. And Levitt's O.K. of a
``safe-harbor'' section of the bill that protects companies from suits over
false projections riled consumer groups. ``Levitt's credibility has been
deeply wounded by playing politics,'' says Michael A. Calabrese, a director
of Congress Watch and an opponent of the bill.
BIT PLAYER? Levitt, 64, former chairman of the American Stock Exchange, was
viewed as a savvy regulator when Clinton appointed him in 1993. Since the
Republican takeover of Congress, he has skillfully courted GOP legislators.
His modus operandi: seizing chances to get with the Republicans'
deregulatory program. For example, after winning GOP concessions on the
safe-harbor provision of the securities-reform measure--including the
exclusion of such protection for initial public offerings--Levitt signed
off on that portion of the bill. High-tech companies with volatile stock
prices had sought the change to reduce their exposure to costly lawsuits.
   While Levitt contends he would have opposed the legislation if the
safe-harbor provision had not been modified, critics grumble that he chose
to blink rather than duke it out with Republicans. ``I was stunned,'' says
former SEC Commissioner Richard Y. Roberts, a Republican, of Levitt's
position.
   More surprising, though, was Levitt's nonrole in the President's veto
decision. Clinton relied mainly on longtime Arkansas adviser Bruce Lindsey
and Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes in arriving at his no-go decision.
Levitt, for his part, insists his views were well known to the White
House.
   The perception that Levitt was a bit player in the affair could hurt
next year when the House will consider paring back securities regulations.
Rather than mounting an all-out assault on the bill's objectionable
provisions, the SEC chief is trying to win a place at the negotiating table
while pushing to eliminate overlapping state and federal regulations. Yet
with Levitt's White House clout now in question, the bill's sponsors may be
less inclined to make concessions.
   Levitt's efforts to protect his agency's funding could also take a hit.
So far, his accommodating approach has paid off. Republicans who have
savaged other regulatory agencies are expected to hold the SEC budget
steady at $300 million in 1996. But Congress could well make another run at
the regulator's budget next year, while Levitt appears weakened.
   Despite his recent wounding, Levitt shows no signs of a retreat from his
agenda. He still intends to pressure the National Association of Securities
Dealers to reform the NASDAQ market and make it more equitable for small
investors. And the SEC chief is about to unveil a proposal to require more
disclosure of derivative holdings, which could greatly complicate
companies' public filings. ``I expect flak from all quarters,'' Levitt says
serenely. But his success in dodging the next round of artillery shells may
determine the legacy Levitt leaves behind at an embattled SEC.

WHAT'S BUGGING THE FEDS

By:
EDITED BY DOUGLAS HARBRECHT

-- It seemed like farce to many foreigners, but it's no laughing matter at
the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Both agencies have launched probes to find the source of press reports last
fall that the CIA snooped on the phone calls of Japanese officials during
U.S.-Japan auto trade talks. And they're aiming high: They interviewed
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and other economic officials.
Summers, who says he played no role in the auto talks, denied involvement.
The CIA no longer considers him a suspect, but investigation continues.

BUDGET SLOW BOAT

By:
EDITED BY DOUGLAS HARBRECHT

-- Protracted wrangling over the fiscal 1996 budget has dashed any chance
that President Clinton will send Congress a fiscal 1997 budget by Feb. 5,
the statutory deadline. After two government shutdowns and marathon budget
talks, the Office of Management & Budget is two months behind in its review
of agency spending proposals for the next fiscal year. The most likely
outcome: The White House may send just a letter to Congress explaining the
delay.

JAPAN'S SHADOW KINGMAKER IS BIDDING FOR THE SPOTLIGHT

By:
EDITED BY STANLEY REED
By Brian Bremner in Tokyo

Ichiro Ozawa has always preferred the role of shadow kingmaker in Japanese
politics. Back in 1993, the brash political heavyweight helped lead a mass
defection from the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party, snapping its
38-year reign. When his reformist government collapsed in 1994, Ozawa
pulled off an improbable merger of nine parties into an opposition bloc
called the New Frontier Party but didn't take the top leadership post.
   Now, Ozawa, 53, has emerged from the shadows. In mid-December, he
announced a surprise bid to challenge longtime colleague Tsutomu Hata to
lead New Frontier. And when the results were tallied on Dec. 27, Ozawa won
by more than 2 to 1. The stage is now set for an epic battle between Ozawa
and LDP President and International Trade & Industry Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto in a general election sometime in 1996. At stake will be control
of the Diet's 511-seat lower house and the Prime Minister's chair.
``AS VAGUE AS POSSIBLE.'' Ozawa's bid for the spotlight is timely. After
four years of economic stagnation and a string of bank failures, the
Japanese public is fed up with the Socialist-LDP government's dysfunctional
management of the economy. Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's
coalition is coming under withering attack for a plan to use $6.6 billion
in public money to bail out seven insolvent housing-loan corporations,
which made reckless real estate loans in the 1980s. ``The intent is to be
as vague as possible about the assignment of blame,'' Ozawa told BUSINESS
WEEK. ``This is the kind of society Japan has become.''
   Ozawa wants to remake the Japanese system. He champions sweeping
deregulation. He also wants to give the now weak Prime Minister's office
enough power to set clear policy directions. Japan's glacial
consensus-style decision-making threatens to consign the nation to decline,
he warns. ``No leader has come up with a strong vision of how to go
forward,'' he says.
   Ozawa's biggest liability aside from heart problems is his association
with the money politics he says he wants to clean up. After all, he was a
key LDP fund-raiser and power broker for years. He is taking heat right now
for his ties to a Buddhist organization that turned out 6 million votes to
support Ozawa candidates in last July's Upper House elections. Ozawa's rise
could also bust up New Frontier if he can't keep Hata on board.
   Hashimoto, who made a big splash by staring down Washington in last
summer's auto talks, is much more popular than Ozawa. Still, there is
growing sentiment in Japan that Ozawa may be the only leader who can
produce significant change. ``He's very determined, and the time left for
Japan to pull out of this stagnation is limited,'' figures Masaya Miyoshi,
president of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, or Keidanren.
   Indeed, Ozawa has won plaudits from some economists for his proposal to
halve income and corporate taxes, wipe out special-interest loopholes, and
eventually make up some of the difference by hiking Japan's sales tax from
3% to 10%. But with Japan's budget deficit projected to hit 4.2% of gross
domestic product in 1996, vs. 2.0% in the U.S., Ozawa has to be careful not
to lead Japan into a fiscal mess.
   Ozawa could also help heal strained ties with the U.S. He is a
pragmatist on trade who is well regarded in Washington. Ozawa says he is
worried that Washington has started to lose interest in Japan. He finds it
regrettable that there is a tendency in Washington ``to treat the
U.S.-Japan alliance more lightly than before.'' If Ozawa becomes Prime
Minister, that would certainly command American attention.

PRIVATIZING A BRAZILIAN GIANT

By:
EDITED BY STANLEY REED
By Ian Katz in Sao Paulo

-- Brazil's slow-moving free-market reforms are getting a fresh impetus
from the sale of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled mining
giant. In what's likely to be Latin America's biggest privatization, Brazil
on Dec. 20 picked a group headed by Merrill Lynch & Co. and Rothschild Inc.
from a star-studded field of competitors to manage the sale of the
government's 51% share in CVRD. The sale, set for late 1996, should fatten
state coffers by at least $5 billion.
   Privatization of CVRD will mark ``the point of no return'' for Brazil's
move away from decades of statism, says Amaury Bier, chief economist of
Citibank in Sao Paulo. Recently, investors had been growing uneasy over the
slow pace of free-market legislation in Brazil's Congress. The naming of
the sale managers shows the government ``is serious about moving ahead,''
says Ricardo Gallo, vice-president for capital markets at Bank of Boston in
Sao Paulo.
   The Merrill Lynch group will earn a 1.9% commission on CVRD's sale
price. The lucrative job drew bids from such heavyweights as Citibank, J.P.
Morgan, and Salomon Brothers. A key issue is whether to sell the
government's shares in a global public offering or auction off operations
such as mining, forestry, and transport separately. But the choice of
Merrill Lynch, which joined with CS First Boston to manage a $3 billion
stock sale of Argentine oil company YPF in 1993, indicates that Brazil
favors privatizing CVRD through a similar high-profile public offering.

HOW TO EVALUATE TAX REFORM

This is shaping up as the year of America's great tax debate. About time.
The U.S. tax system is a mess, riddled with exemptions, deductions, and
credits that serve little purpose beyond rewarding favored constituents.
The tax system is expensive for individuals and corporations to comply
with, too.
   Tax reform is already an issue in the Presidential race. A GOP
commission headed by former Representative Jack F. Kemp will soon issue
recommendations. All the main tax-writing committees plan to hold hearings
on tax reform this year. To evaluate all the competing proposals for
overhauling the byzantine tax code, ranging from a single income-tax rate
to a national sales tax, we suggest a guide that's over 200 years old: The
Wealth of Nations. Adam Smith laid out four maxims with regard to taxes in
general: certainty, convenience of payment, economy in collection--and
equality.
   The flat tax is in the forefront of tax reform, and three of Smith's
maxims--certainty, convenience of payment, and economy in collection--would
be well served by a one-rate structure. The leading proponents of a flat
tax are Hoover Institution economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, and
their ideas powerfully shaped the flat-rate tax legislation of House
Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.). Hall and Rabushka would levy a
single 19% flat rate on wages and salaries; Armey wants to get the rate as
low as 17%. There would be no deductions, though to keep the system
somewhat progressive Hall and Rabushka exempt from income taxes $16,500 for
a married couple and $4,500 a child. Capital gains, interest, and dividends
would be exempt from taxes. Businesses would lose many deductions, although
investment spending would get an immediate 100% first-year tax write-off.
Business would pay a 19% rate on total income (17% for Armey), after
deducting wages, salaries, pensions, and costs of goods and materials.
Bottom line: a highly simplified and more efficient system where income
gets taxed only once as close as possible to its source.
   Still, even with generous up-front exemptions, an all-or-nothing
one-rate tax is less progressive. In the past decade, global economic
forces have increased income inequality. Most Americans have only one major
asset to their name: the home they bought using generous tax incentives.
Losing the mortgage-interest deduction would squeeze the middle class. A
flat tax raises other questions, such as ditching charitable deductions and
the deductibility of state and local taxes while the federal government
asks charities and local governments to assume more responsibilities.
Perhaps a ``modified,'' streamlined tax approach is called for, one based
on two or three rates and allowing for a few of the most justifiable
deductions, such as charitable contributions and home-mortgage interest.
   The good news: The gale winds of creative tax reform are sweeping
Washington. Radical simplification would go a long way toward creating a
less intrusive government and a more efficient economy. But some equity
must be preserved.

DON'T TREAD ON FREE TRADE

What will the new year bring? An agreement between the White House and
Congress to slash federal deficits for the rest of the century. Inflation
will remain subdued, and since inflation powerfully influences the stock
and bond markets, investors should enjoy decent returns. And, as our 1996
Industry Outlook makes clear (page 72), the U.S. economic expansion that
began in 1991 should continue.
   Of course, as in any forecast, a lot could go wrong. One particularly
disturbing threat to continued growth lies with the virulent voices of
economic reaction--protectionists such as Pat Buchanan and the rapidly
expanding number of politicians who know better but make sympathetic noises
to garner votes. The rallying cry of today's isolationists and their fellow
travelers may be, ``no more free-trade agreements''--not with Chile nor
with anyone else. But what they are calling for, if heeded, would lead only
to slower growth. Instead, policymakers should push hard for fewer trade
barriers--and faster economic growth.
   True enough, there are losers as well as winners from freer trade. But
trade is not a zero-sum business. It's freer trade that helped slay the
inflation dragon that terrorized the U.S. economy for much of the '70s and
'80s. White-hot foreign competition is a key reason for disinflation fast
becoming the norm in the once inflation-prone U.S. economy. Trade spurs
growth by offering entrepreneurs and companies bigger markets. U.S.
companies are getting more and more of their sales overseas. Perhaps most
important, freer trade encourages the creation and spread of new
technologies and commercial ideas. In sharp contrast, steep trade barriers
can leave an economy stagnant. Look at Latin America for much of the period
after World War II--or the former Soviet Union, for that matter.
   Isolationists are far more powerful in Europe and Japan than they are in
the U.S. Many developing nations are still maneuvering to boost exports
while protecting their home market, too. It is more important than ever
that the world's remaining superpower provide free-trade leadership. In the
tumultuous period following the end of the cold war, the most important
decision made by the Bush and Clinton Administrations and Congress was to
continue the free-trade policies America has championed since 1945. This
bet has paid enormous economic dividends in the 1990s. The bounty from
trade and stronger economic ties among nations is plentiful indeed.

NEWBORN BABIES, BAWLING MOMS
They want laws to make insurers pay for longer hospital stays

By:
By Keith H. Hammonds in New York, with bureau reports


It is likely the most reviled fiat in recent medical history: 24 hours
after childbirth, mother and baby are out the hospital door, cut off by
their insurer. ``So negligent,'' says Kathy Sargent, an expectant mother in
Westport, Conn. ``Appalling,'' says Randi Curran of San Francisco, who will
give birth this spring. ``It must be men who made up this policy.''
   Managed care has met the masses--and the masses aren't happy. Perhaps
40% of newborns currently are discharged after one day, say hospitals,
twice the number in 1990. The economics driving that shrinkage are
compelling: Childbirth is by far the most common reason Americans enter
hospitals, and reducing stays would save insurers hundreds of millions of
dollars a year. Most mothers, though, would rather stay put, and doctors
don't want medical decisions taken out of their hands. The result is ``a
rallying point for people who have bad feelings about managed care,'' says
Michael A. Maffetone, CEO of University Hospital at Stony Brook, N.Y.
STATEHOUSE ACTION. The outrage has found an outlet: In 1996, 25 states are
expected to introduce legislation that would require insurers to pay for a
48-hour inpatient stay for normal deliveries when a physician prescribes
it. Five already have passed such laws. In California, where
health-maintenance organizations pioneered the one-day stay years ago,
insurer pressure to reduce postpartum stays to 12 hours has legislators
promising a bill on Governor Pete Wilson's desk in January. Senator Bill
Bradley (D-N.J.) is amassing support for similar federal legislation.
   In this debate, pure medicine may be on the insurers' side. While some
doctors and hospitals say they're seeing more cases of jaundice and
dehydration in newborns, the hospital readmission rate for babies remains
around its traditional 2%. Several studies have found no link between
one-day stays and consequent complications. ``There is virtually no
clinical evidence that there's a technical medical necessity for an acute
medical stay of more than 24 hours,'' says A. Bruce Campbell, chief medical
officer at Aetna Health Plans.
   Insurers and HMOs have joined with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
groups such as the American College of Nurse-Midwives to battle
minimum-stay legislation. Many hospitals, too, worry that government
remedies, while intended to give doctors and patients decision-making
power, risk setting a precedent for wide-ranging regulation of medical
practices--or simply will force insurers to cut compensation elsewhere.
   Some hospitals have devised an alternative solution: A growing number
are offering to absorb the cost of a second night's stay for mothers whose
insurers don't pay. Hospital executives say they're motivated primarily by
safety concerns, but they admit the attending publicity doesn't hurt. ``I
will not lie,'' says T.J. Padden, administrator at Box Butte General
Hospital, a 44-bed facility in rural Alliance, Neb. ``It's not a bad
marketing thing.'' Incremental costs for additional nights are low--rarely
more than $200 a night, and far lower at Box Butte. Stony Brook, the first
hospital to underwrite longer stays, says its maternity admissions are up
8% in the past six months.
FLAT FEES? The downside to this approach, say other hospital executives, is
that it ultimately could weaken their negotiating power with insurers:
Eating the cost on one procedure could encourage HMOs to cut back on
others. For now, though, the commotion may be gaining the desired effect.
Hospitals that pay for a second night say some insurers have quietly agreed
to foot the bill when patients so desire--although just one company,
Independence Blue Cross and Pennsylvania Blue Shield, has publicly
announced such a retreat.
   Ultimately, managed care likely will offer a different solution.
Insurers are starting to compensate hospitals on a flat-fee basis for many
procedures, much as Medicare does, rather than negotiating per diem rates.
As that happens, providers will take on some of the financial risk of
giving care--but also much of the decision-making power. The 24-hour stay
may yet survive, but it won't be on managed care's head.

The production index edged up during the week ended Dec. 16. Before
calculation of the four-week moving average, the index rose to 129.8, from
128.5. Increases in the seasonally adjusted output of autos, trucks, and
electric power led the advance.

The leading index was up slightly in the latest week. The unaveraged index
dropped to 262.4, from 263.1 in the previous week. Higher stock prices and
lower bond yields are signaling solid economic growth ahead.

THE WEEK AHEAD

Due to the prolonged Washington shutdown, all government release dates are
certain to be postponed.

NAPM SURVEY
Tuesday, Jan. 2, 10 a.m. -- The National Association of Purchasing
Management's business activity index probably rose to 47.8% in December,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by MMS
International, one of The McGraw-Hill Companies. That low reading suggests
that the industrial sector was struggling in December. For the previous
four months, the NAPM index slid below the 50% mark that signals a
shrinking factory sector. The index was 46.5% in November.

CONSTRUCTION SPENDING
Tuesday, Jan. 2, 10 a.m. -- The MMS survey expects that construction
outlays probably dropped by about 0.5% in November, after jumping 2.7% in
October. Following a surge in October, spending on public-works projects
likely fell back in November.

NEW HOME SALES
Wednesday, Jan. 3, 10 a.m. -- New single-family homes probably sold at an
annual rate of 675,000 in November, little changed from the 673,000 sales
rate in October, says the MMS report. Home buying has declined for three
consecutive months, but lower mortgage rates in 1996 could stabilize home
sales in the first quarter.

FACTORY INVENTORIES
Thursday, Jan. 4, 10 a.m. -- Factory inventories probably grew by about
0.3% in November, after a 0.4% gain in October. That's suggested by the
small increase in factory output for the month.

EMPLOYMENT
Friday, Jan. 5, 8:30 a.m. -- The MMS median forecast calls for a gain of
125,000 new nonfarm jobs in December, less than the 166,000 added in
November. However, the survey also calls for manufacturing jobs to rise by
15,000, the first increase since August. The unemployment rate probably
stood at 5.6% last month, unchanged from November's rate.

HEALING THE SOIL IN A LUSH VALLEY...BUT JUST IN TIME FOR AN URBAN FLOOD?

By:
EDITED BY HARRY MAURER
By Susan Jackson in Los Andes

Arturo Turesca likes what he sees--nothing--as he walks among his grape
arbors, peeling off dead bark and looking underneath. During the spring,
Turesca released test tubes of mealybug parasites among the 20 hectares of
vineyards he farms. He'll probably save money by using parasites instead of
pesticides to combat mealybugs, which are the worst enemies of grape
plants. And he'll make the Aconcagua Valley a healthier place.
   Why is Turesca phasing out pesticides when neither chemical-free diets
nor environmentalism are exactly at the forefront of national debate in
Chile? His agricultural muse is Maria Helena Moreira, an exuberant
51-year-old Brazilian economist who put a successful academic career on
hold to start Aconcagua Verde, an ambitious project that aims to minimize
pollution while maximizing production in this lush valley 100 kilometers
east of Santiago. Moreira, with backing from the MacArthur Foundation in
the U.S., is looking to spark a mini-revolution in the Aconcagua. ``If we
succeed, this will be the only valley in Chile that will be able to produce
large-scale in an environmentally friendly way,'' says Moreira.
   Fruit is big business in Chile. Exports equaled 18% of gross domestic
product in 1994 and have been rising in 1995. The Aconcagua, always an
agricultural area, really started booming some 20 years ago, when Chile
tore down its trade barriers. Now, nearly 70% of the valley's irrigable
land--some 35,000 hectares--is devoted to export fruit production, more
than half of it in table grapes.
   But while exports have skyrocketed, the soil has suffered, admits
Claudio Garcia, Aconcagua Valley manager for Chiquita Exportadoras Ltda.
``There's a lot of natural degradation--the soil is heavily worked by
machines and people, so it has become much less porous.'' Then there are
pesticides. Like most grape farmers, Turesca has to abide by exporters'
rules. The exporters are in turn bound by the rules of importers--mostly
the U.S.--which require that fruit be 100% pest-free. Many farmers spray
fruit with twice as many pesticides as necessary just to make sure.
   The ravages of grape monoculture began to bother Moreira during a visit
she made to Chile in 1990. Late that year, she applied, along with
sociologists and scientists from the University of California and the
University of Rio, to the MacArthur Foundation for an
international-cooperation grant. The project: to study the effects of
monoculture on the valley and figure out how to grow fruit with less damage
to the soil. A tall order for $500,000, but that's how much Moreira was
awarded in 1991, when she and a team of professors began surveying local
farmers and exporters. In November, 1995, the project was handed over to
the town of Los Andes, but Moreira has stayed on.
   So far, only a handful of producers are using Aconcagua Verde's methods,
but this is just the first year. Garcia expects the numbers to grow: ``I
would imagine that costs will drop as productivity rises,'' which happens
as soil regains its health.
   Moreira and her crew recommend that farmers let certain weeds grow under
their arbors to prevent erosion. What controls the weeds? Geese. ``They do
the mowing--and we plan to start a side business selling down for sleeping
bags and quilts,'' she says.
   When a Basque dandy bought the Aconcagua Valley in the 19th century, his
plan was to cut a mule route to Argentina through the middle of it. The
plan didn't take hold, but a century and a half later the concept of the
valley as a throughway is coming back. The main road from Santiago is going
to be widened, which will halve travel time to 45 minutes, a tempting
thought for smog-sick city dwellers longing to escape. Residential plots
are now selling for four times as much as they would as farmland.
   A proposed tunnel from Argentina could also threaten the valley's
agricultural future. Chile's congress is considering carving a tunnel
through the Andes that would serve as a bridge between the Pacific and the
Atlantic. The resulting commercial and residential development ``would doom
the valley in terms of agriculture,'' says Moreira. Cars, not
contamination, could be the valley's biggest threat.

INVESTMENT FIGURES OF THE WEEK

COMMENTARY
As the stock market's best year in two decades drew to a close, investors
took profits. After reaching a high of 5216.5 on Dec. 13, the Dow
industrials fell as low as 5059 and then rebounded to 5106 on Dec. 27. As
expected, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates, but that
didn't count for much with bond buyers, who instead focused on the budget
impasse between President Clinton and the GOP-controlled Congress. Looking
abroad, the long-ailing Japanese and Mexican stock markets staged yearend
rallies.

GLOOMY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN
DEPARTMENT STORES SHOW PROMISE, BUT SLUGGISH SALES COULD SINK MANY
MERCHANTS

By:
By Susan Chandler in Chicago

Consumer confidence is up, and the stock market is at record highs. But
instead of merchants expect a Darwinian shakeout in 1996. "The strong are
getting stronger. The weak are disappearing or consolidating," says Arthur
C. Martinez, chairman and chief executive of Sears, Roebuck & Co.
   Many retailers have reason to be gloomy. Retail sales rose only 4.5%
during 1995, far below the 7% annual growth common during the roaring
1980s. They're expected to rise by the same 4.5% in 1996, while profits
will remain restrained by heavy discounting.
   Roughly 15,000 retail companies sought protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court by late 1995, pushing Chapter 11 filings up 20% from 1994.
Retail economists expect even more in 1996 (chart). That's because this
latest round of financial troubles isn't just from taking on too much debt.
It's concentrated among regional retailers with outdated computer systems,
yesterday's merchandise, and aging stores. For many, liquidation may be the
only answer, says Carl E. Steidtmann, chief economist of Management
Horizons, a consulting unit of Price Waterhouse based in Columbus, Ohio.
   The trouble is, consumers just aren't spending much. Incomes are fairly
stagnant, and consumers' non-mortgage debt-to-income ratio hit an all-time
high of 19% in late 1995. What's more, baby boomers are paying more for
services, from child- to elder-care leaving them less for shopping. And
consumers have discovered that they can get hefty discounts by waiting for
sales. "Now that we've taught them to do that, we shouldn't sit around and
wonder why," says John Ronzetti vice-president of the National Retail
Federation.
KMARTS CONSTRACTION. Discounters are feeing a lot of pain. A raft of
regional chains, including Bradlees Inc, and Caldors Corp., sought Chapter
11 protection in 1995 as competition from fast-growing Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
and Target Stores intensified. The shakeout many even claim Kmart Corp.,
the nation's third-largest retailer, retail expects say. Kmart CEO Floyd
Hall, who replaced the ousted Joseph E. Antonini in June, says he will
close 70 stores in 1996, cut $300 million in costs, and continue to unload
inventory. 'The best answer to Chapter 11 [talk] is to have a solid
performance under our belt," he says.
   Easier said than done. Just ask specialty retailers, who are expecting
another drab year for apparel sales. Clothing sales are expected to grow
only 3.5% in 1996 after a 2.5% increase in 1995. St. Louis-based Edison
Brothers Stores Inc. filed for Chapter 11 in November and plans to close
500 of its 2,700 mall-based shops. Ann-Taylor Stores Corp. is heading for a
makeover after suffering a double-digit tumble in same-store sales in
1995--the result of fashion and pricing miscues in an unforgiving market,
says retail consultant Alan Millstein, who publishes the New York-based
Fashion Network Report.
HITTING THE GAS. For beleaguered catalog companies, 1996 may spell a bit of
relief. Hit by higher paper and postage costs, catalogers saw their bottom
line take a beating in 1995; Lands' End Inc. profits throught October
dropped 61%. A survey of U.S. catalogers by consultant A.T. Kearney Inc.
found 62% expect sales to increase in 1996.
   Department stores should continue to slowly regain maket share from
outlet stores and off-price retailers. Lower prices--and thinner
margins--are the key. "We've had to get our costs down to offer fashion
that's also a value," says Allan Questrom, CEO of Cincinnati-based
Federated Department Stores Inc., parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's.
   Consumer-electronics stores are ecxpected to have another hot year, as
shoppers snap up computers and related items. That means strong revenue
growth for category killers--high-volume specialty chains such as Best Buy
Co. and Circuit City Stores Inc. But they, too, must settle for the
slimmest of margins.
   Sears seems to be getting the formula right. It's one of the last
department stores with a broad array of hard goods, such as appliances and
computers. With these products going gang-busters and its apparel share
expanding, Sears is winning market share. Says CEO Martinez: "When that
happens, you push the accelerator a little harder." But in what looks like
a treacherous 1996, many other retailers will be satisfied just to stay in
the road.



Prognosis '96

Positives
  -- Housing purchases should continue to help sales of home-related
goods.
  -- Consumer confidence is rising, and that bodes well for sales of
big-ticket items such as home computers.

Negatives
  -- Apparel sales will continue to slow as consumers focus on home-related
purchases.
  -- Retail bankruptcies will increase as the shakeout among discounters
and off-price retailers continues.

JETSKI SURVIVORS CAN SEEK
STATE LAW DAMAGES,
HIGH COURT CONCLUDES

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 9 unanimously affirmed the
Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' November 1994 determination
that the damages recoverable by a jetski accident victim's
survivors are not limited to those available under the general
maritime cause of action for wrongful death.  Yamaha Motor Corp.
U.S.A. et al. v. Calhoun et al., No. 94-1387 (U.S.); see Consumer
Product Litigation Reporter, September 1995.

     In an opinion authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the
high court agreed that the cause of action established in Moragne
v. States Marine Lines (U.S. 1970) does not displace state
remedies in maritime wrongful death actions where no applicable
federal statute controls and the decedent was not a seaman or
otherwise engaged in the maritime trade.

     Twelve-year-old Natalie Calhoun was killed in a 1989
accident while piloting a "Wavejammer" jetski manufactured by the
petitioner Yamaha Motor Corp. U.S.A.  Natalie had rented the
product while vacationing in Puerto Rico, and died when the
vehicle struck a vessel anchored off her hotel's frontage.

     Her parents brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania the following year, basing their
claims in Pennsylvania's wrongful death and survival statutes and
demanding damages including lost future earnings, loss of
society, loss of support and services and punitive damages.
Yamaha sought partial summary judgment, arguing that Moragne
displaced state frameworks for awarding maritime wrongful death
damages.

     The trial court agreed, but held that the Calhouns could
still viably make demand for loss of society and loss of support
and services.  The parties cross-appealed; the Third Circuit
ruled on Nov. 2 that Moragne would not preempt state wrongful
death statutes on claims over non-seamen within territorial
waters.  The high court agreed to review the decision in
May 1995.

     In its affirmance, the Supreme Court stated that
"[t]raditionally, state remedies have been applied in accident
cases of this order " maritime wrongful death cases in which no
federal statute specifies the appropriate relief and the decedent
was not a seaman, longshore worker, or person otherwise engaged
in a maritime trade.  We hold, in accord with the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that state remedies
remain applicable in such cases and have not been displaced by
the federal maritime wrongful death action recognized in
Moragne."

     As a preliminary matter, the high court held that the
federal appellate courts have jurisdiction in an interlocutory
appeal "over any question that is included within the order that
contains the controlling question of law identified by the
district court."  Justice Ginsburg found the text of 28 U.S.C.
Section 1292(b) to indicate that "appellate jurisdiction applies
to the order certified to the court of appeals, and is not tied
to the particular question formulated by the district court."

     In turning to the substantive issue, the Supreme Court found
that "[t]he exercise of admiralty [jurisdiction] 'does not result
in automatic displacement of state law'....  Indeed, prior to
Moragne, federal admiralty courts routinely applied state
wrongful death and survival statutes in maritime accident cases."

     The court engaged in a review of wrongful death claims under
maritime law that reached back to its 1886 decision in The
Harrisburg.  The court had then concluded that general maritime
law did not recognize a cause of action for wrongful death;
subsequently, Justice Ginsburg wrote, "[f]ederal admiralty courts
tempered the harshness of The Harrisburg's rule by allowing
recovery under state wrongful death statutes."

     With the publication of Moragne in 1970, the high court
overruled The Harrisburg and concluded that an action "lie[s]
under general maritime law for death caused by violation of
maritime duties."

     Here, the high court found Yamaha's contention that Moragne
encompasses all deaths in state territorial waters to be "not
without force; in several contexts, we have recognized that
vindication of maritime policies demanded uniform adherence to a
federal rule of decision, with no leeway for variation or
supplementation by state law."

     Ultimately, the high court wrote, the concerns for
uniformity that prompted the scuttling of The Harrisburg "were of
a different order than those invoked by Yamaha.  Moragne did not
reexamine the soundness of The Harrisburg out of concern that
state damage awards in maritime wrongful death cases were
excessive, or that variations in the remedies afforded by the
States threatened to interfere with the harmonious operation of
maritime law."

               The inconsistencies in maritime law that prompted the
Moragne court, Justice Ginsburg concluded, "relate to ships and
the workers who serve them, and to a distinctly maritime
substantive concept " the unseaworthiness doctrine."  The court
concluded that Moragne "centered on the extension of relief, not
on the contraction of remedies.  The decision recalled that 'it
better becomes the humane and liberal character of proceedings in
admiralty to give than to withhold the remedy, when not required
to withhold it by established and inflexible rules.'"

     The opinion lastly cited at length to the reasoning below of
the Third Circuit, which had noted that "Congress has not
prescribed remedies for the wrongful deaths of nonseafarers in
territorial waters."

IN SUPREME CT.: AIRBAG
NEGLIGENCE CLAIM NOT
PREEMPTED BY SAFETY ACT

     The Indiana Supreme Court on Dec. 28 overturned a lower
court's grant of summary judgment favoring General Motors and
determined that the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act
does not preempt a common law negligence claim based on failure
to install airbags.  Wilson et al. v. Pleasant et al., No. 64S03-
9506-CV-693 (IN Sup. Ct.).

     The lawsuit was lodged by the estate of James Wilson, who
died in a 1988 head-on collision while driving a 1986 Chevrolet.
Wilson had not been wearing a seat belt at the time of the
accident.  The suit, which named the driver of the other vehicle
as well as GM, alleged that the manufacturer was negligent in
designing, manufacturing and selling a car that wasn't
crashworthy due to the lack of an airbag passive restraint
system.

     GM sought summary judgment from the Porter County Superior
Court, arguing that the estate's common law claims were federally
preempted by the Safety Act and certain safety regulations
promulgated thereunder.  The trial court granted the motion; the
Indiana Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed, declaring that
while the Safety Act did not expressly preempt the negligence
claim, implied preemption could be found.

               In its review, the state high court preliminarily noted the
language of the Safety Act's preemption clause (Section 1392[d])
and state common law savings clause (Section 1397[k]); the panel
also observed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, which
gave the manufacturer three options for providing passenger crash
protection.  The court acknowledged that the manual seat belt
system in Wilson's car fully complied with the third option.

     The court agreed with the Court of Appeals' assessment that
the Safety Act did not expressly preempt the estate's claim.
"The pre-emption clause found in the Safety Act explicitly
refers, with respect to 'any motor vehicle or item of motor
vehicle equipment,' only to state 'safety standard[s] applicable
to the same aspect of performance of such vehicle or item of
equipment which is not identical to the federal standard,'" the
panel wrote.

     As to the finding of implied preemption, however, the court
observed that the "clear weight of authority prior to 1992
supported General Motors's view that the Safety Act impliedly
pre-empts state common law claims like the one asserted by
Wilson."  The panel then engaged in a review of the alterations
to the federal preemption analysis wrought by the U.S. Supreme
Court's rulings in Cipollone v. Liggett Group (1992) and
Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick (1995).

     "[W]e cannot help observing that Myrick did not overrule
Cipollone," the court concluded.  "Rather, the Supreme Court held
that interpretations of Cipollone to the effect that implied
pre-emption cannot exist when Congress has chosen to include an
express pre-emption clause were incorrect interpretations."

     The court read Cipollone/Myrick to establish the following
analysis in order to establish implied preemption:  "First, if
the federal statute at issue contains pre-emption language, we
determine whether that provision alone provides a reliable
indication of congressional intent with respect to its
pre-emptive effect," the panel wrote.  Such determination would
be made, the court stated, "by employing canons of statutory
construction and by examining the other provisions of the statute
" and the statute as a whole " to see if they offer any cause to
look beyond the express pre-emption language."

     If a reliable indication of congressional intent is found,
the panel wrote, there is no need to look beyond the preemption
language itself.  Otherwise, the court continued, "we must
determine whether the state law in question is in actual conflict
with federal law, [i.e.,] (1) whether it is impossible for a
private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,
or (2) whether the state law stands as an obstacle to the
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives
of Congress."

     In turning to the facts at hand, the court found it
"immediately obvious that the Section 1392(d) pre-emption clause
in the Safety Act, taken alone, does not provide a reliable
indication of congressional intent with respect to its
pre-emptive effect."  The panel also found that the language of
the Section 1397(k) savings clause indicated that the Safety
Act's preemptive scope is not governed entirely by the Act's
preemption language.

     The court concluded, however, that the language of Section
1392(d) and Section 1397(k) read together foreclosed an
application of an implied preemption analysis.  "[W]e see only a
prohibition on state motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment
safety standards not identical to federal safety standards
applicable to the same aspect of performance of the motor vehicle
or item of motor vehicle equipment," the court wrote.

     Although the panel determined a full implied preemption
analysis to be unnecessary, it engaged in such a review and still
found no preemption of the claims.  "[W]e conclude that there is
no conflict between state common law in this case and the choices
presented by Rule 208," the panel wrote.  "Assuming, arguendo,
that Indiana common law requires airbags, there would be no
conflict with Rule 208 because Rule 208 does not prohibit airbags
" it only permits some other alternatives."

     The court also found that a finding of implied preemption
here "would be inconsistent with the purpose of and policies
underlying the Safety Act....  It would defeat the purpose of the
statute if manufacturers were not discouraged from utilizing a
safety system that would otherwise be considered negligent under
state common law tort theories."

     James W. Myers III, Valparaiso, IN, and David H. Knobel,
Merrillville, IN, represent the appellant.

     David M. Heilbron and Leslie G. Landau of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown & Enersen, San Francisco, and Alex Dimitrief of Kirkland &
Ellis, Chicago, represent General Motors.

MICHIGAN JURY FINDS NO
DEFECT IN THREE-WHEEL ATV

     A Michigan federal court jury returned a unanimous verdict
for Honda Motor Co. defendants Dec. 7, finding that a 1985 Honda
ATC-125M three-wheel all-terrain vehicle was not defective.
Carwile v. Honda Research & Development Co., Ltd. et al. (ED MI).

     The jury also found that the Honda defendants were not
negligent with respect to the design and marketing of the ATV or
the warnings that accompanied the vehicle.

     The accident occurred in April 1991 on a sandy trail near
Jensen Beach, FL.  Plaintiff Manford Carwile, who was not wearing
a helmet, careened into a tree after entering an S-curve and
suffered a severe closed head injury.

     Plaintiff claimed that design defects made it difficult to
turn the ATV, and also alleged that Honda failed to adequately
warn about the risks of operating the vehicles.  Honda countered
that Carwile's accident was caused by excessive speed,
inattention and inadequate vehicle maintenance.

     Expert witnesses for the plaintiff were engineer David
Renfroe; Edward Karnes on the adequacy of warnings; Werner Spitz,
M.D., on toxicology and helmet injury-prevention; Gary
Lustgarden, M.D., a neurosurgeon; Robert Ancell, a vocational
rehabilitation expert; Eric Amberg, a neuropsychologist; and
economist Michael Thompson.

     Honda called Kevin Breen, an expert on vehicle design,
accident reconstruction and off-road vehicle riding; Harry H.
Hurt Jr., on the design and protection offered by motorcycle
helmets; and Dr. Philip Haber, on vocational rehabilitation.
Honda also called Masayuka Tanaka, an employee of Honda R&D Co.,
Ltd., to discuss ATV development and design, and Edward Glynn, an
employee of American Honda Motor Co., to discuss Honda's ATV
safety efforts and the Consumer Product Safety Commission
investigation of the vehicles.

     Honda was represented by Robert K. Miller, Larry C. Mann and
Timothy J. Mattson of Bowman and Brooke in Minneapolis and
Detroit.  Carwile was represented by Steven Leuchtman and Frank
Mafrice of Sommers, Schwartz, Silver & Schwartz in Detroit.

ALABAMA JURY AWARDS
$120,000 ON DEFECTIVE
SUZUKI FOUR-WHEEL ATV

     An Alabama state court jury awarded $200,000 in damages to
plaintiff Bobby G. Norman, who claimed that a defective throttle
cable in his Suzuki four-wheel all-terrain vehicle led to a loss-
of-control accident in which he suffered serious injuries.
Norman v. Longshore Cycle Center et al., No. CV-93-56
(AL Cir. Ct., Lauderdale Cty.).

     Norman bought the ATV from co-defendant Longshore Cycle
Center.  When riding away from a neighbor's house, he turned the
handlebars of the ATV as far to the right as he could, at which
point the throttle went wide open and the vehicle flew over an
embankment.

     The plaintiff went airborne, coming to rest after hitting a
tree and having the ATV flip over with him underneath.  He
sustained numerous cuts and abrasions on his arms and legs, and
tore his right shoulder rotator cuff.  The treating orthopedic
surgeon gave him a 50-50 chance that surgery could alleviate his
condition.

     At the time of the accident, the ATV had only 50 miles of
use.  Norman's expert witness, Michael Burleson of Tyler, TX,
tested exemplar throttle cables manufactured by Suzuki, Honda,
Kawasaki and Yamaha to determine how much force was needed to
cause a separation.  All of the other brands not only out-
performed the Suzuki cable, but were more substantial in
appearance, he opined.

     The defendants argued that the accident was caused by
operator error and Norman's failure to take the offered free
safety course.  Their expert witness, Kris Kubly of Madison, WI,
tested the exemplar throttle cables and the actual cable involved
in the accident and found no possibility of malfunction as
claimed by the plaintiff.

     Norman was represented by Debra H. Coble and Frank B. Potts
of Potts & Young in Florence, AL.  Longshore Cycle Center was
represented by Danny D. Henderson of Huntsville, AL.  Suzuki was
represented by John Bergquist of Parsons, Lee & Juliano in
Birmingham, AL.

HIGH CT. REJECTS
CROSS-PETITIONS FOR REVIEW
OF RISK-UTILITY RULING

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 8 denied the separate bids of
Honda Motor Co. and a Mississippi plaintiff to overturn the Fifth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' May 1995 determinations in a
motorcycle product liability action.  Honda Motor Co. et al. v.
Satcher, No. 95-653 (U.S.); Satcher v. Honda Motor Co. et al.,
No. 95-674 (U.S.); see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter,
November 1995.

     The manufacturer had asserted that the appellate panel had
infringed its due process rights in refusing a new trial, and
James Satcher had averred that the Fifth Circuit had no basis on
which to vacate his $2 million award for punitive damages.

     Satcher, who had been driving the defendant's Nighthawk
motorcycle in the 1985 traffic accident that cost him his leg,
obtained $1 million in compensatory damages following a 1991 jury
trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi.  In its initial review of the case in 1993, the
Fifth Circuit reversed.  The panel concluded that as a matter of
state law, the product's claimed defect (lack of leg guards) was
open and obvious to the ordinary consumer.

     Following the Mississippi Supreme Court's issuance of
Sperry-New Holland v. Prestage (1993) shortly thereafter, the
Fifth Circuit vacated its prior ruling and ordered the district
court to reconsider in light of Prestage (which held that the
risk-utility analysis superseded the consumer expectations test
in product liability actions) and the state's recently enacted
product liability statute.  The trial court found for Satcher on
remand.

     In its affirmance of last May 30, the Fifth Circuit rejected
Honda's contentions that it was entitled to a new trial as
Prestage caused a substantive alteration to Mississippi law.  The
panel did strike Satcher's punitive award, concluding that the
defendant's conduct in not including leg guards in its product
design was not so extreme or outrageous as to support it.

     Both litigants filed petitions for writ of certiorari in the
high court late last October.  Honda contended that it was
entitled to new trial in order to defend on a risk-utility
theory, rather than under the consumer expectations test.
Satcher argued that under the Fifth Circuit's punitive damages
standard, such awards may be reversed on a showing of "mere
disagreement in the scientific community as to whether the
defendant's conduct was reasonable."

     Mack E. Barham and Robert E. Arcenaux of Barham & Arcenaux,
PLC, New Orleans; Peter K. Smith, Quitman, MS; Wilton L.
Strickland, Fort Lauderdale, FL; and Ray Ferrero Jr. of Ferrero &

B.F. GOODRICH PETITIONS
CA HIGH COURT ON IMPROPER
SERVICE OF SUMMONS

     In a petition for review filed Dec. 11 with the California
Supreme Court, B.F. Goodrich Co. contends that it was not
properly served with a summons in an exploding-tire case, and
that the trial court disregarded long-standing case authority in
adopting the "substantial compliance rule" and refusing to quash.
B.F. Goodrich Co. v. CA Super. Ct., Monterey Cty., No. S050529
(CA Sup. Ct.).

     Goodrich says plaintiff Joseph Dinner has conceded that
service was improper in that:

     " Goodrich was not named in the complaint or by amendment;

     " there was no notice pursuant to California Code of Civil
     Procedure Section 412.30;

     " if service was attempted, no designation was made;

               " the summons fails to identify on behalf of whom the person
     who received the summons was served;

     " no date of delivery was noted; and

     " the summons failed to indicate the name and capacity of
     the person who allegedly received service.

     Dinner claims he was injured when a Goodrich tire exploded
while being inflated at a gas station.  He then served what
Goodrich calls an "admittedly defective summons" and complaint on
"The B.F. Goodrich Company," not the named defendant "B.F.
Goodrich."

     The Monterey County Superior Court judge refused to quash
and the state appeals court denied review.  In its petition to
the California Supreme Court, Goodrich argues, "As the law is
clear that 'the substantial compliance rule' does not apply where
the summons fails to identify the individual being served on
behalf of a corporation, the trial court's ruling exceeded its
jurisdiction.  Therefore, based on the evidence before it, the
Superior Court abused its discretion in denying petitioner's
motion to quash."

     Goodrich also argues that with the advent of "fast-track"
rules, courts must guard against any tendency to "move the case
along" at the expense of a potential defendant's rights.  "We
cannot trade these rights for expediency, no matter how noble the
cause may be," the petition states.  "The impact of fast track
rules on trial court rulings (such as here) cannot be minimized.
This case presents clear issues of first impression concerning
adequate service, defective pleading and service, and the effect
of fast track rules on the trial court's interest in moving cases
to trial within the fast track limitation framework even against
entities that are not proper parties."

     Goodrich is represented by David B. Paynter, Paul Ellis
Baron and Valerie L. Leatherwood of Lewis, D'Amato, Brisbois &
Brisgard in San Francisco.

8TH CIR. FINDS LAWN MOWER
DESIGN DEFECT CLAIMS
NOT PREEMPTED BY CPSA

     The Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 27
partially reversed a Minnesota federal court's determinations and
found that a family's design defect claims against a lawnmower
manufacturer were not preempted by the Consumer Product Safety
Act (CPSA).  Moe et al. v. MTD Products Inc., No. 95-1938
(8th Cir.).

     The panel did affirm the defense judgment on the balance of
the plaintiffs' claims, holding the remaining theories of
recovery preempted by the CPSA.

     In July 1992, the fingers of 17-year-old Brian Moe were
amputated when he reached into the side grass chute of a self-
propelled walk-behind mower manufactured by MTD Products Inc.
The mower was equipped with a safety device called a blade
brake/clutch system (BBC), which allows the cutting blade to
rotate only when the control lever of the operator handle is
engaged.  Brian was an experienced operator of the mower, and had
removed grass from the side chute twice on the morning of his
accident without incident.

     It was subsequently discovered that the BBC's control cable
had been broken.  In their action against MTD, Brian's parents
asserted that the mower was defectively designed in that the
control cable was routed in such a manner that it rubbed against
the throttle control housing, causing it to fray and ultimately
break.  In its response, MTD pointed to the fact that in 1991,
the mower's handle had broken from the base, and Thomas Moe had
it reattached by a welder.  The repaired handle was 1-3/8 inches
longer than the original, and MTD claimed that the resultant
increase of stress on the BBC control cable caused its breakage.

     The Moes also alleged that an additional label warning that
the cable may fray should have been placed on the mower's handle.
While the owner's manual advised that the control cable should be
inspected, the plaintiffs asserted that this was insufficient
notice of the potential hazard.  The U.S. District Court for the
District of Minnesota determined that all of the Moes' claims
were preempted by the CPSA.

     On appeal, the Moes contended that their failure to warn and
design defect arguments were not federally preempted.  MTD
conceded that the design defect allegations were not preempted,
but argued that summary judgment in its favor was appropriate
because the product had been substantially altered.

     In its review, the Eighth Circuit noted that the Consumer
Product Safety Commission has promulgated a safety standard for
walk-behind power motors, which provides that a label warning
against blade contact injury must be placed on each mower's blade
housing.  In considering the Moes' contention that a warning that
the BBC cable may fray is required, the court stated that the
"risk of injury contemplated by such a warning is the same as
that addressed by the labelling requirements in the Mower
Standard " injury to the hands by the cutting blade."  The Moes'
claim, the panel wrote, "would create a state standard requiring
additional warnings on lawn mowers or in owners manuals related
to the same risk of injury addressed by the federal standard."

     The panel did find the plaintiffs' design defect claims to
be contemplated by the CPSA's savings clause.  "A successful tort
action based on the defective design of an installed BBC would
not create a different standard for mower safety or impose
different requirements on the manufacturer," the court wrote.

     As to MTD's substantial alteration argument, the court
stated that the "record here shows that issues of material fact
exist as to whether the BBC design caused Brian's injury....
Based on the evidence in the record, it would not be 'sheer
speculation' for a jury in this case to find that the design,
rather than the alteration, caused the fraying and the accident."

MO CT. APP.: CASUAL LENDER
OF NAIL GUN NOT STRICTLY
LIABLE OR NEGLIGENT

     The owner who loaned an allegedly defectively designed nail
gun to someone cannot be held liable on theories of strict
liability or negligence if the user injures somebody, the
Missouri Court of Appeals has ruled.  Bailey v. Innovative
Management & Investment Inc., No. WD 50922 (MO Ct. App.).

     In a unanimous Dec. 19 decision, the panel upheld summary
judgment against a man injured when a nail was accidentally
discharged into his head.

     Innovative Management & Investment loaned a nail gun and
other tools to an employee who was building his own home on his
own time.  Plaintiff Ron Bailey volunteered to help with the
project.  The employee's brother was using the nail gun when
Bailey inadvertently hit the bottom of the device, causing it to
discharge.

     A petition was filed in Boone County Circuit Court alleging
product defect and failure to warn strict liability counts, plus
a claim for negligently furnishing a dangerous instrumentality.
Judge Ellen S. Roper granted the defense motion for summary
judgment.

     The Court of Appeals, Western District, affirmed in an
opinion by Judge James M. Smart Jr.  The panel found no basis for
the strict liability causes of action because Innovative
Management did not inject the nail gun into the stream of
commerce and because the employee did not receive the nail gun
for the mutual benefit of the company and himself.  Innovative
Management supplied the nail gun as an isolated, non-commercial
transaction without financial or other compensation, it said, and
the company was not in the business of selling or furnishing
tools.

     As for the negligence count, the court said the company's
mere furnishing of the nail gun was insufficient to support the
claim because only a gratuitous bailment was involved.
Innovative Management owed Bailey no duty to protect him from
injury because the company received no benefit or advantage from
loaning the instrument to the employee, it said.  The court also
cited uncontradicted testimony that the company president was
unaware of any defect or dangerous condition when the employee
borrowed the nail gun.

     Debbie S. Champion of St. Louis represented Bailey.  Jeffrey
O. Parshall of Columbia represented Innovative Management.

MA CT. REFUSES ROWING MACHINE
SUPPLIER BID FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
ON MARKET SHARE ARGUMENT

     Justice Francis X. Spina of the Berkshire, MA, Superior
Court on Dec. 12 rejected the attempt of a rowing machine
supplier to obtain summary judgment on a seller's third-party
claim for market share liability.  Mahar v. Hanover House
Industries Inc. v. Etna Products et al., No. 88-0156
(MA Super. Ct., Berkshire).

     The judge found the present facts distinguishable from those
in a 1982 diethylstilbestrol (DES) case in which the state high
court declined to adopt the market share liability doctrine for
identifying a liable manufacturer defendant.

     The litigation was brought by David Mahar, who alleged that
he sustained injuries in 1987 while using a rowing exerciser
purchased through the mail from Hanover House Industries.
Hanover brought a third-party complaint against three of its
suppliers; one supplier was later voluntarily dismissed.

     In the two-week period before the product was shipped to
Mahar, Hanover received some 58,199 rowing machines from supplier
E. Mishan & Sons and another 35,686 from Etna Products.  The
machines were indistinguishable as to their supplier, and Hanover
had no inventory control in place that could identify the
supplier of the product Mahar purchased.  Etna sought summary
judgment for failure to identify the actual supplier.

     Justice Spina wrote that "[n]o Massachusetts appellate case
has ever held that a 'market-share' approach may be used to
establish the requisite element of the 'identity' of the
manufacturer or supplier in a product liability case," and noted
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's refusal to do so in
the DES case Payton v. Abbott Labs (1982).

     "Several factors are present in this case which were not
present in Payton," the judge continued, "and factors which
caused the Payton Court concern are not present here."  He noted
that all probable suppliers of the product had been named to the
case; he found that the suppliers "were equally as able as the
defendant to identify the unit shipped, and may still inspect the
unit to try and determine the route of its delivery to the
plaintiff."

               The judge further observed that Etna may still offer proof
that it did not supply the unit in issue, and that both suppliers
may implead the product's manufacturer.  He lastly noted that
"there is no public policy supportive of research and development
of new drugs/medicine impacted here."

     Justice Spina concluded that the dispute was "an appropriate
case to allow a plaintiff to proceed with and develop a theory of
liability which is in the formative stages in this Commonwealth
and which has a reasonably good chance for recognition by the
appellate courts."

EVIDENCE OF SUBSEQUENT
REMEDIAL MEASURES CAN BE
EXCLUDED, 11TH CIR. HOLDS

     The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 18 ruled upon
a matter of first impression and held that evidence of subsequent
remedial measures in strict product liability cases may be
properly excluded under Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence.  Wood v. Morbark Industries Inc. et al., No. 93-3472
(11th Cir.).

     The panel did reverse a Florida district judge's denial of
new trial to the plaintiff/appellant, however, determining that
the evidence in issue below had been properly admitted for
impeachment purposes.

     Morbark Industries Inc. had been sued by Ruby Wood, whose
husband, Ginger, died in a 1989 accident involving an "Eeger
Beever" wood chipper of the defendant's manufacture.  Ginger
Wood, a municipal employee, was pulled into the device up to his
upper torso.  In arguing that the product was defective and
unreasonably dangerous, she asserted that the chipper's 17-inch
infeed chute was too short to adequately protect the machine's
operator.

     Morbark was granted a motion in limine to exclude evidence
of post-accident design changes to the chipper that lengthened
the infeed chute.  In its review, the 11th Circuit noted that
defense counsel still "sought to imply to the jury that the
seventeen-inch chute was the safest length chute available and
was still in use by [Ginger's employer] as well as other
government agencies."

     In the course of a 1993 trial in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Florida, plaintiffs' counsel cross-
examined Norvel Morey, Morbark's president and designer of the
Eeger Beever, on the issue of subsequent design changes.  The
trial judge admonished the attorney before the jury, and directed
the jury to disregard any comment concerning the sale of longer
chutes.

               The panel ultimately found for Morbark, determining the
Eeger Beever not to be unreasonably dangerous as designed and
marketed.  Ruby Wood sought new trial, claiming that the trial
judge had committed reversible error by admonishing plaintiff's
counsel before the jury.  In rejecting the motion, the trial
judge found that the admonition had not been unduly prejudicial
to the plaintiff's case.

     In its analysis, the 11th Circuit first rejected Wood's
contention that Rule 407 should not be applied in strict product
liability cases.  "We are persuaded that Rule 407 is necessary in
such cases to focus the jury's attention on the product's
condition or design at the time of the accident," the panel
wrote.  The panel rejected Wood's entreaty to follow the 10th
Circuit's reasoning in Moe v. Avions Marcel (1984), which stated
that federal courts must apply state evidentiary principles if
they conflict with FRE 407.

     Wood next argued that if FRE 407 was deemed controlling,
then the trial court should have applied one of the exceptions to
the rule and held the evidence admissible either to show the
feasibility of precautionary measures, or for impeachment.  Wood
had specifically pointed to Morey's testimony that the 17-inch
chute was the "safest length chute you could possibly put on the
machine."

     The court stated that "[w]hile we do not find that this
testimony put feasibility at issue, we do find that it opened the
door to impeachment....  Wood's counsel should have been allowed
to ask why the supposedly safest design possible was modified
after the accident involving Ginger Wood."

     The panel found that the refusal to allow impeachment of the
witness did not in and of itself substantially affect Wood's
rights, but did have such an impact when considered in
conjunction with the court's direction to the jury.

CA JUDGE DENIES
POST-TRIAL MOTIONS
OF LORILLARD, H&V

     California Superior Court Judge Winton McKibben, without
elaboration, on Nov. 6 denied the motions of Lorillard, Inc. and
Hollingsworth & Vose Co. for a new trial of Milton Horowitz's
suit alleging mesothelioma from asbestos contained in Kent brand
cigarettes.  Horowitz v. Lorillard, Inc. et al., No. 965-245
(CA Super. Ct., San Francisco); see Consumer Product Litigation
Reporter, September 1995.

     Horowitz and his wife, Shirley Horowitz, won jury verdicts
for $2 million against the companies on Aug. 31 after a trial
before Judge McKibben.  The award includes $700,000 in punitive
damages.
               Milton Horowitz, 72, is a retired university professor from
Beverly Hills, CA.  He was still active as a clinical
psychologist when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma in June
1994.  His suit alleges that his cancer was caused by the
asbestos-containing Micronite filters used on Kent cigarettes
between 1952 and 1956.  The suit named Lorillard, Inc. as the
manufacturer of the Kent cigarettes and Hollingsworth & Vose Co.
as the manufacturer of the Micronite filters.

     During the trial, Horowitz claimed that the Kent Micronite
filter was defective and that it rendered the Kent cigarettes
defective by releasing asbestos fibers which he inhaled.  He also
contended that the defendant companies were negligent and failed
to warn about the asbestos health hazard associated with Kent
cigarettes.  He further asserted that the companies
misrepresented the cigarette and filter by claiming that the
filter was "totally harmless" and that the Kent cigarette
"offered the greatest health protection of any cigarette."

     Lorillard and Hollingsworth & Vose defended by arguing that
the filter did not release asbestos fibers.  They also asserted
that Horowitz did not smoke Kent cigarettes in the time period
between 1952 and 1956, when the filter contained asbestos, and
they suggested that he was either mistaken or lying when he said
that he did.

     The jury found for the plaintiffs on all theories of
liability except for the intentional fraud claim " it found that
the defendants made their health representation without knowing
one way or the other whether the filter was "totally harmless."
It awarded $350,000 in economic damages and $700,000 in non-
economic damages to Milton Horowitz, and it awarded $250,000 on a
loss of consortium claim by Shirley Horowitz.  It also found that
Lorillard and Hollingsworth & Vose were each 50% responsible for
the plaintiffs' injuries and damages.

     The jury further determined that Milton Horowitz had
suffered appreciable harm before June 4, 1986, a finding required
by California's Proposition 51, the statute requiring
apportionment of non-economic damages for actions accruing after
June 4, 1986.

     Lastly, the jury found that the plaintiffs had shown by
clear and convincing evidence that each defendant acted with
malice, oppression or fraud, thus entitling the plaintiffs to
punitive damages.

     After a brief supplemental argument, the jury retired on
Aug. 31 to further deliberate the amount, if any, of punitive
damages to award.  It returned with a verdict on Sept. 1,
awarding punitive damages of $560,000 against Lorillard and
$140,000 against Hollingsworth & Vose.

     In its post-trial motion, Hollingsworth & Vose argued that
the court had erred by admitting the deposition testimony of
Elise Comproni, an inspector with the Massachusetts Department of
Labor and Industries, Division of Occupational Hygiene.  Comproni
testified that in 1953 he was "appalled" when he learned that
asbestos was being used in the Kent cigarette filters.
Hollingsworth & Vose argued that he was not qualified to give an
opinion concerning the potential hazards of an asbestos-
containing filter in the early 1950s and that it was prejudiced
by repeated references to the testimony by counsel for the
Horowitzes.

     The filter maker also argued that the weight of the evidence
presented at trial was insufficient to justify the jury's finding
that it had been negligent.  "[P]laintiffs were required to
demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that defendants knew
or should have known of the harmful health effects associated
with an asbestos-containing filter between 1952 and 1956.
Plaintiffs offered no testimony or studies which suggested that
medical science believed such a danger existed during this
period," it asserted.

     Hollingsworth & Vose also contended that it had been
prejudiced by the court decision to allow the jury to consider
fraud claims against it.  The Horowitz complaint, it noted, only
asserted fraud claims against Lorillard, and the plaintiffs
failed to present any evidence of fraud against it.

     Lorillard has prevailed in four previous lawsuits alleging
injury from the filters, largely by raising doubts about whether
the plaintiffs' illness was caused by Kent cigarettes or other
possible exposures to asbestos.  The company is currently
involved in 10 other lawsuits involving the Micronite filters.

     The plaintiffs were represented at trial by Madelyn J.
Chaber with Wartnick, Chaber, Harowitz, Smith & Tigerman in San
Francisco.

     Hollingsworth & Vose is represented by Andrew J.
McElaney Jr., Stephen J. Brake and Daniel R. Harris with Nutter,
McLellan & Fish in Boston and by Donald F. Zimmer Jr. and Cynthia
C. Roenisch with Preuss Walker & Shanagher in San Francisco.
Lorillard is represented by Lewis L. Fenton, Larry E. Hayes and
Ronald F. Scholl with Fenton & Keller of Monterey, CA, and by
David K. Hardy, William S. Ohlemeyer and Mark J. Evans with
Shook, Hardy & Bacon of Kansas City, MO.

LORILLARD, FILTER MAKER
ADDED TO ASBESTOS CASE
IN MICHIGAN

     The plaintiffs in an occupational exposure asbestos case
filed an amended complaint in Michigan state court Dec. 4 to add
Lorillard Inc., Hollingsworth & Vose Co. and Macco Chemical Co.
as defendants in their personal injury product liability suit.
Sorise et al. v. 20th Century Glove Corp. of Texas et al.,
No. 95-521238 NP (MI Cir. Ct., Wayne Cty.).

     The amended complaint filed in Wayne County Circuit Court
named the additional defendants because the lead plaintiff smoked
Kent cigarettes with "Micronite" filters in the 1950s.  In the
original July 25, 1995 complaint, retired tile setter Nelson
Sorise alleged his mesothelioma resulted from on-the-job exposure
to a variety of asbestos products.  Nearly 60 defendants were
named.

     The amendment added the three Kent defendants, alleging that
asbestos fibers in Micronite filters were also a proximate cause
of Sorise's mesothelioma.  According to the complaint, which
alleged failure to warn, Sorise smoked Kents between 1952 and
1956, the time when Micronite filters were used.

     According to Sorise's attorney, Michael B. Serling of
Birmingham, MI, Kents were marketed heavily as being safer than
their competitors on the basis that the Micronite filters removed
tar and nicotine.

     Kent's Micronite filters have been the focus of two recent
actions, one of which ended in a $2 million award in favor of a
California professor who alleged mesothelioma from the asbestos
in the Micronite filters (Horowitz v. Lorillard, Inc. et al.,
No. 964-245 [CA Super. Ct.]; see story this issue).  In the
other, a federal court jury in Chicago returned a defense verdict
in a suit brought by the family of an Encyclopedia Britannica
executive who died from cancer allegedly caused by the asbestos
in the filters (Braun v. Lorillard Inc. et al., No. 94-C-976
[ND IL]; see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, December 1995,
P. 5,285).

     The Sorise case has been assigned to Judge Robert J.
Colombo Jr.

FORMER CIGARETTE MODEL,
10 OTHERS SUE CIGARETTE
MAKERS, SELLERS IN FL

     A former Winston cigarette model and 10 other people filed a
products liability suit against tobacco companies and cigarette
sellers Dec. 11 in Florida state court, alleging injury from
cigarette smoking.  Levine et al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. et
al., No. CL 95-9806-AH, (FL Cir. Ct., 15th Jud. Cir., Palm Beach
Cty.).

     Lead plaintiff Alan Landers, also known as Allan Levine,
worked as a model in Winston print advertisements in the 1960s.
He has undergone two surgeries for lung cancer that he attributes
to smoking cigarettes.
               The complaint stated that the defendants' tobacco products,
when used as intended, were highly likely to cause, or contribute
in substantial fashion, to illness and injuries, including
bronchogenic carcinoma, chronic bronchitis, cardiovascular
disease and other conditions.

     "So likely were the serious health consequences of
defendants' tobacco products that over one in three foreseeable
users would be expected to suffer premature death or serious
impairment," the complaint said.  Further, the plaintiffs
maintained, tobacco products, when used as intended, "were highly
likely to induce in foreseeable users a state of addiction."

     The complaint contains counts of negligence, strict
liability and civil conspiracy.

     The plaintiffs claim that the tobacco firms had a duty to
design a safe product, but sold the cigarettes in their current
form knowing that they would probably cause disease and
addiction.

     Named defendants are R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., American Tobacco Co., Philip Morris
Inc., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., United States
Tobacco Sales & Marketing Co. Inc., Culbro Corp. (formerly known
as General Cigar Co. Inc.), and retailers ABC Liquors Inc.,
Publix Supermarkets Inc. and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Tracy E. Tomlin and
Michael T. Tomlin of Otero, Mullin & Tomlin of Coral Gables, FL,
and by Norwood S. Wilner of Spohrer, Wilner & Maxwell of
Jacksonville, FL.

KS SMOKELESS TOBACCO
CASE WITHDRAWN; NATIONAL
CLASS SUIT TO FOLLOW

     A lawsuit filed on behalf of Kansas residents against the
makers of smokeless tobacco products was withdrawn Dec. 18 by
attorneys who filed the suit because they plan to refile on
behalf of a nationwide class of smokeless tobacco users.  Hammers
v. United States Tobacco Co., No. 95-1335-MLB (D KS); see
Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, August 1995.

     The lawsuit was filed July 24 in U.S. District Court for the
District of Kansas, in Wichita, alleging that the manufacturers
of smokeless tobacco products have designed sales campaigns that
specifically set out to lure users of their products to
"graduate" to products containing higher concentrations of
nicotine.

     The complaint was filed on behalf of all users of smokeless
tobacco products in Kansas.  The plaintiffs were seeking class
action status and had the potential of involving approximately
30,000 Kansas residents.

     Plaintiff attorney Derek Casey of Hutton & Hutton in Wichita
said he expected to file a new lawsuit on behalf of a nationwide
class by mid-February.

     The suit named as defendants United States Tobacco Co.,
Pinkerton Tobacco Co., Conwood Co., L.P., Helme Tobacco Co.,
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., The Smokeless Tobacco Council,
Inc., The Smokeless Tobacco Research Council, Inc., The Tobacco
Institute Inc. and The Council for Tobacco Research, Inc.

     The smokeless tobacco industry has been free from litigation
during a time when lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers have
been filed across the country.  In 1989, the 10th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals upheld a 1986 jury verdict that the evidence in
a case brought by the family of an Oklahoma teenager had failed
to show conclusively that the manufacturer's smokeless tobacco
was the cause of the teenager's death (Marsee v. United States
Tobacco Co., No. 86-2094 [10th Cir.]).

     The Marsee case turned on causation rather than addiction,
which was the basis for the Kansas lawsuit.

D MA DISMISSES MERCURY
POISONING SUIT AGAINST
TUNA CANNER ON CAUSATION

     A U.S. District Court judge sitting in Boston granted
summary judgment dismissing a personal injury complaint against a
tuna fish canning company on Nov. 30, because he concluded that
no genuine issue of any material fact would permit a jury to find
either that the plaintiff suffers from mercury poisoning or that
the cannery's product was the cause of any such poisoning.  Kern
v. Nozaki America Inc., No. 94-12272-RGS (D MA).

     Alice Kern filed a personal injury suit in 1994 alleging
negligence and breach of warranty.  She claimed that she
contracted mercury poisoning from eating five to seven cans of
Geisha brand canned tuna per week for 24 years.  Geisha brand is
sold by defendant Nozaki America Inc., which moved for summary
judgment.

     U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns found that while
there is no question that Kern is ill, the only disease that she
has been diagnosed as having is rheumatoid arthritis.  Her doctor
tested her blood for mercury in 1991 and found her mercury blood
level to be slightly above normal.  It returned to the mid-range
of normal after Kern stopped eating Geisha tuna and underwent
chelation therapy, Judge Stearns said.

     To prevail in her suit, Kern would have had to establish
that eating the amounts of tuna she claims to have ingested can
cause mercury poisoning and that Geisha brand tuna contains
mercury at levels sufficient to have caused the poisoning.  Judge
Stearns found that she could establish neither.

     "Viewing all inferences in the light most favorable to Kern,
there are no disputed facts in the record that would permit a
jury to find that Kern suffers from mercury poisoning, much less
that any such poisoning resulted from her consumption of Geisha
brand tuna," he said.

CIBA ARGUES CONTACT SOLUTION
NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS ARE
PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW

     Approved labels and warnings on medical devices are
"specific requirements" of federal law that preempt causes of
action brought under state law, respondent Ciba Vision Corp.
argued in its answer to a petition filed by a California woman
asking the state Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's ruling
that all of her claims against Ciba are preempted by the Medical
Devices Amendments.  Scott v. Ciba Vision Corp., No. S049608
(CA Sup. Ct.); see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, December
1995.

     In its Nov. 15 answer, Ciba contended that the California
Court of Appeal, Sixth District, was aligned with a majority of
jurisdictions that have held that federal law preempts causes of
action brought under state law.

     Appellant Leslie Scott brought suit in California state
court against Ciba, alleging claims of strict liability,
negligence, failure to provide adequate warnings and breach of
implied warranty.  Scott claimed she had difficulty in
distinguishing Ciba's AOSEPT solution, which contains hydrogen
peroxide, from its saline solution.  She claimed that as a result
of her failure to distinguish between the bottles, she suffered
chemical burns to her eyes when she rinsed her contacts in the
AOSEPT solution instead of the saline solution.

     Scott argued that, around the time of her injury, Ciba had
begun to market its AOSEPT solution with a red cap, but also
continued to market it in the old bottle, knowing that persons
not wearing their contacts would have difficulty in
distinguishing the two.

     The Santa Clara County Superior Court granted Ciba's motion
for summary judgment, finding Scott's claims preempted by the
MDA.  On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth District,
affirmed the trial court.

     The Court of Appeal cited to Evraets v. Intermedics
Intraocular, Inc., 29 Cal.App.4th 786, and 21 C.F.R. Section
808.1(b), in holding that the "requirement" the Food and Drug
Administration refers to in Section 360k includes "any
requirement having the force and effect of law 'whether
established by statute, ordinance, regulation, or court
decision.'"

     Examining Scott's argument that the MDA contains no specific
counterpart regulations regarding AOSEPT, the Court of Appeal
held that all Class III medical devices are subject to the
requirements of the MDA, which include the FDA's stringent
premarket approval process.

     In her petition to the California Supreme Court, Scott
argued that the only other state Supreme Court that has addressed
the issue of federal preemption concerning Class III devices
found that the plaintiff's claims were not preempted (Larsen v.
Pacesetter Systems, Inc. [Hawaii 1992], 837 P.2d 1273, 1281).

     Some of the leading cases that have expounded on the issue
of preemption have recently been criticized, Scott said.  For
example, the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' 1984 ruling in
Martello v. Ciba Vision Corp. gave Section 360k(a), the MDA's
preemption provision, an expansive reading, but was criticized in
the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Kennedy, Scott said.  "The...Ninth
Circuit in Kennedy...stated that the language of Section 360k(a)
does not create the broad, sweeping preemption found by the
'strained reading of the statute' by the court in Martello,"
Scott argued.

     And, Scott said, state actions that attempt to enforce
federal standards are not preempted.  Citing to Evraets, the
appellant said, regarding a claim of negligence per se, since the
state requirements are equal to the federal requirements because
they adopt the federal standards, they are not preempted.

     On the other hand, Ciba argued in its answer that a
consistent line of cases holds that state law tort and warranty
causes of action are preempted because the pre-market approval
process envelops the approved product in specific requirements of
federal law.

     "Scott makes no claim of any defect in the design or
manufacture of AOSEPT," Ciba said.  "Rather, she contends that
California tort and warranty law required that Ciba Vision
package and label AOSEPT differently in order to warn users
against accidental placement of deneutralized solution in the
eye."

     Ciba argued that this is a "strong case for MDA preemption"
because of AOSEPT's premarket approval and Scott's singular focus
on warning deficiencies in the product.

     The respondent said that the court's decision in Evraets,
which Scott cited in her petition, does not warrant review by the
state Supreme Court.  Ciba said Evraets does not deal with a
device that received FDA premarket approval.

     "Evraets contains a discussion of the preemption of state
law claims for breach of warranty that is consistent with the
decision in Scott," Ciba said.  "Evraets only reaches the issue
of preemption in relation to a claim of breach of an express
warranty."

     Ciba concluded that by enacting the MDA, Congress interposed
the FDA as an expert watchdog and preempted certain state law
causes of action.  A jury should not be allowed to rethink the
sufficiency of labels and packaging that the FDA endorsed, said
Ciba.

     In her Nov. 27 reply, Scott said the Court of Appeal cited
two cases in its decision that are not relevant to this case.  In
Evraets and Powers v. Optical Radiation Corp. (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1444, the cases involved experimental products for
which adequate warnings were not yet known, Scott said.

     Ciba's statements that this case is a "pure label and
warning case" and that Scott "makes no claim for any defect in
the design" are disingenuous and completely inaccurate, Scott

PA SUP. CT.: LANDLORDS
HAVE NO DUTY TO INSPECT
FOR LEAD PAINT HAZARDS

     The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Nov. 22 reaffirmed a 27-
year-old ruling that landlords cannot be held to have
constructive notice of the dangers of lead paint to young
children occupying their premises and, therefore, that they have
no duty to test for and remove lead paint from their properties.
Felton v. Spratley et al., No. 7 East. Dist. App. Dkt. (PA
Sup. Ct.).

     The one-page per curiam decision stated that the appeal is
dismissed "as having been improvidently granted," with Justice
John P. Flaherty dissenting.  It offers no further commentary nor
is Justice Flaherty's dissent explained.
               Lucretia Felton and her daughter, Shakeema, petitioned for
rehearing on Dec. 6, and a ruling on that request is still
pending.  Their attorney, Edwin L. London of Matkoff & Shengold,
said he was "terribly disappointed" by the dismissal, especially
since the lower court ruling was a 2-1 split decision, and since
the Supreme Court had been briefed and had heard oral arguments
in October.

     The Supreme Court's dismissal lets stand a ruling affirming
the dismissal of this suit by the trial court on the grounds that
the landlord had no actual notice of the lead paint hazards in
the apartment she rented to the Feltons.

     The Feltons resided in an apartment leased from Marie
Spratley in 1988; Shakeema was diagnosed with lead poisoning the
following year.  When Spratley was notified of the chipping and
peeling lead paint by the Philadelphia Health Department, she had
the paint removed and the apartment repainted within a month.

     The Feltons then filed suit in the Philadelphia County Court
of Common Pleas, alleging negligence and carelessness in failing
to test for and remove the paint prior to Shakeema's poisoning
around May 1989.

     The trial court granted summary judgment to Jessie and
Mollucye Spratley Pearson, the executors of Marie Spratley's
estate, based on the grounds that Spratley was unaware of the
hazardous condition and, therefore, had no obligation to correct
it.  The defendants had argued that Lucretia Felton was aware of
the peeling paint for several months before Shakeema was
diagnosed, but never reported it to them.

     On appeal to state Superior Court, the Feltons conceded that
the defendants lacked actual knowledge of the presence of lead
paint in the apartment, but, they contended, knowledge about lead
paint poisoning had become widespread among the public by the
late 1980s and, therefore, Spratley should have had constructive
knowledge of the hazard and should have eliminated it.

     The Superior Court panel ruled 2-1 that it remained bound by
the state Supreme Court's holding in Kolojeski v. Deisher Inc.,
429, Pa. 191, 239 A.2d 329 (1968), which stated that where the
landlord had no notice that the walls were painted with lead
paint until after the plaintiffs had been treated for lead
poisoning, he had no affirmative duty to inspect the premises for
lead paint and he could not be held liable for the injuries.

     The Feltons argued that public knowledge of lead paint
hazards had increased substantially since 1968 when Kolojeski was
decided and, therefore, that the defendants should be held to
have had constructive notice of the dangers of lead paint.  The
Superior Court majority ruled that the Feltons failed to cite any
state law case or to otherwise persuade it to expand the law of
negligence between landlord and tenant.
               In a New York case in May, a five-judge appellate court
panel ruled that New York City's landlords do have an affirmative
duty to search out and remove lead paint in apartments occupied
by children, but that ruling was based on a city ordinance that
explicitly spells out that duty.  In October, the Residential
Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X) went into
effect.  That federal law requires landlords throughout the
country to inform potential tenants of the presence of lead paint
in rental properties or to abate the hazard if the tenants
include young children.

     In addition to London, the Feltons are represented by Meryl
Cohen of Matkoff & Shengold in Philadelphia.  Spratley is
represented by Josh M. Greenbaum of Cozen & O'Connor, also in
Philadelphia.

1ST CIR: INSURANCE CO.
FAILS TO PROVE LANDLORD
INSURED FOR KNOWN RISK

     A landlord who knew his apartments were contaminated with
lead paint is still entitled to indemnification from his insurer
because the insurance company failed to show that when the
landlord took out the policy, he either knew the lead paint in
his building was the source of a tenant's lead poisoning or knew
that she would suffer further injury after the effective date of
the policy, according to a Nov. 28 ruling by the First Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals.  United States Liability Insurance Co. v.
Selman et al., No. 95-1435 (1st Cir.).

     Livingstone Selman owns an apartment house in Roxbury, MA,
where Robin Razza and her infant daughter, Carol Ann, resided.
Carol Ann was diagnosed with lead poisoning late in 1984.  Selman
began removing the lead paint on March 7, 1985, and by March 29,
an inspection of the Razzas' apartment showed it to be 95% lead-
free.

     In May 1985, Selman changed insurance carriers and insured
the apartment house with United States Liability Insurance Co.
(USLIC).  The insurance company renewed the policy in May 1986.
The Razzas moved from Selman's apartment building in September
1986 and subsequently brought a state law personal injury suit
against Selman that is still pending.

     USLIC, attempting to escape liability, brought a diversity
action seeking a declaratory judgment in U.S. District Court for
the District of Massachusetts.  After a bench trial, the district
court ruled that USLIC had no duty to indemnify Selman for claims
for injuries resulting from Carol Ann's ingestion of lead paint
prior to May 4, 1985 (the inception date of the first policy).
However, the court ruled, USLIC does have a duty to indemnify
Selman with respect to claims arising while the policies were in
effect " from May 4, 1985, to May 3, 1987.
               On appeal, USLIC advanced three alternative grounds for
reversing the district court judgment:  (1) coverage was never
triggered because Carol Ann sustained no discernible injuries
while the insurance policies were in effect; (2) Carol Ann's
injuries were the result of her initial ingestion of lead paint
before the policies went into effect; and (3) Selman knew about
the liability before the policies went into effect and,
therefore, is precluded from coverage under the "known risk"
doctrine.

     Circuit Judge Bruce M. Selya, writing for a unanimous
appellate panel, ruled first that the appeal had to be decided on
the "clear error" standard because the issues revolved around the
interpretation of substantial extrinsic evidence and not solely
on questions about the clear meaning of contract provisions.

     The district court was correct in determining that coverage
had been triggered because Razza's expert witness, Dr. John
Graef, testified that "at least a portion" of Carol Ann's claimed
injuries occurred during the policy periods, the appellate court
found.  Graef's testimony was supported by data showing sharp
increases, or "spikes," in Carol Ann's blood toxicity levels
corresponding to incidents of lead paint ingestion during the
policy period.

     Further, Graef testified that the new incidents of lead
paint ingestion resulted in further injuries that occurred during
the period covered by the policies because, unlike many other
diseases such as measles or chicken pox, lead poisoning injuries
are cumulative, the circuit court ruled.

     "[T]he district court had before it compelling evidence that
Carol Ann Razza ingested several 'big meals' of lead paint chips
while the appellant's policies were in force, and Dr. Graef
testified that each such ingestion caused (or potentially could
cause) discrete injury.  On this basis, the district court
warrantably found a clear nexus between Carol Ann's 'big meals'
and the spikes in her toxicity levels," Judge Selya wrote.

     On the issue of known risk, Judge Selya said, the central
question on appeal is:  "What did Selman know and when did he
know it?"  The known risk doctrine precludes coverage when the
insured knows in advance of the policy's effective date that a
specific loss has already happened or is substantially certain to
happen.

     "[T]he presence of risk runs to the very essence of an
insurance contract.  Where there is no risk of loss " as where a
loss has already occurred before a policy takes effect "
insurance ceases to serve its socially utile purpose of risk-
spreading," he said.

     Finding that the test for asserting the known risk doctrine
is subjective and that the insurer has the burden of proof, the
First Circuit ruled that nothing in the court record showed that
the lead paint in Selman's building was the source of Carol Ann's
illness (or that he knew of the connection), nor that Selman knew
that Carol Ann would suffer further injury from continued
exposure to lead paint.  Further, the panel said, given the
inspection report that the Razza apartment was 95% free of lead
six weeks before the first policy became effective, Selman could
easily have assumed that Carol Ann was no longer exposed to any
significant amount of lead paint and therefore would suffer no
further injury.

     "The district court's finding is strengthened by the utter
lack of any evidence that Selman attempted to conceal or
misrepresent the presence of lead paint in his apartment house
when he applied for insurance.  To the extent that the
appellant's application form did not request such information,
the appellant was the author of its own misfortune," Judge Selya
wrote.

     Finally, the panel ruled, the district court did not commit
reversible error in declining to interpret a clause in the policy
limiting the company's liability to $300,000 per occurrence as
meaning that USLIC's total potential liability is capped at
$300,000.  While the district court did not spell out its
reasoning, it seems self-evident that the basis for the ruling
was that the policy does not define the operative terms of that
clause, Judge Selya concluded.

     USLIC was represented by Alice Olsen Mann and Mark P. Bailey
of Morrison, Mahoney & Miller.  Selman was represented by Kenneth
H. Soble of Soble, Van Dam, Pearlman & Gittelsohn.  Clyde D.
Bergstresser and Angela M. Vieira of Bergstresser & Associates
represented Razza.  All are Boston firms.

HANDBOOK URGES JAPANESE COMPANIES TO GET INVOLVED

     Corporate giving and volunteerism are significant elements
of life in the United States that the Japanese community must
come to terms with, says a handbook published by New York's
Japanese Chamber of Commerce.
     Published with Japanese and English text on facing pages,
the book is titled Joining In! A Handbook for Better Corporate
Citizenship in the United States.  Its 85 pages contain advice to
Japan-based companies in America on how to participate
effectively in communities where they have built plants, by
supporting local charities and volunteering to work for local
organizations.
     In the preface, Hisao Kondo, president of the Japanese
Chamber of Commerce, emphasizes that Joining In! was not written
just to expand Japanese understanding of American philanthropy,
but as a "call to action."  As such, it urges Japanese executives
in the United States to take the initiative in getting involved
in their communities without waiting to be asked.
     "This is a vital means of gaining acceptance and thereby
improving American community perception of the Japanese
transplant company," says the handbook.  It emphasizes that
community involvement can promote a Japanese corporation's
business interests in several ways:
     o  by improving its ability to recruit and retain skilled
local employees;

     o  by fostering good working relationships with local and
state government officials;

     o  by providing tax deductions; and

     o  by improving the company's image.
     Language and cultural barriers have prevented many Japanese
executives from joining boards and volunteering for other
community activities, according to the handbook.  One result of
this is that some Japanese-based corporations have suffered from
the image of being uninvolved.
     To change this perception, the handbook recommends that
Japanese corporations take a number of steps toward becoming more
involved in their local communities:

     o  Establish a company policy on volunteering and community
involvement, after first seeking suggestions from all employees.

     o  Create a program budget.

     o  Appoint a community involvement coordinator who, ideally,
should be Japanese; alternatively, a Japanese and an American
could be joint coordinators.

     o  Select an initial project for special attention and
publicize it in the company and community.

     o  Recognize and reward volunteerism by employees.
     "Volunteer programs are a way for corporations to
demonstrate moral leadership, `doing the right thing,' which
comes back to benefit the company by enhancing its image and its
influence in the community," says the handbook.  "Community
involvement and volunteer programs are ultimately good for
business."
     Next month CGW will look at areas in the United States where
Japanese companies have a strong presence for an overview of
their giving policies.
     Joining In! is available for $40 from the Japanese Chamber
of Commerce and Industry of New York, The Galleria, 115 East 57th
Street, New York, NY 10022.

REEBOK TAKES STEPS TO COMBAT RACISM

     Three recent grants by the Reebok Foundation illustrate the
athletic shoe manufacturer's long-term commitment to human
rights.
     The largest gift, $750,000, went to the Center for the Study
of Sport in Society at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, for a
program to combat racism.
     The three-year program, called "Project Teamwork," plans to
send teams of athletes to schools and community groups around the
country, starting this summer.  Four cities, Boston, Los Angeles,
New York, and Washington, DC, will be targeted in the first year.
     The founders of the project say it is necessary because they
feel civil rights progress has slowed and that racism and
anti-Semitism are on the rise.  They believe athletes are key to
the program's success because athletes are among the strongest
black role models.
     Project Teamwork will also include elements of a program
started five years ago to help former college athletes who failed
to get their degrees after their athletic eligibility expired.
  In the schools and community centers they visit, the
athletes will talk about the dangers of racism, the value of
staying in school, and the fallacy of going through school with
the idea of making a career of professional athletics.
     Reebok also announced a $375,000 grant to TransAfrica, as
part of a campaign to discredit rumors that Reebok International
does business in South Africa.  (Reebok stopped selling its
products in South Africa in 1976.)
     The grant will help build TransAfricare's new library and
research center in Washington, DC.  When completed, the center
will be the primary resource for historical and educational
materials on the role of African Americans in the shaping of U.S.
foreign policy.
     A third grant, for $50,000, went to the NAACP for the
general fund of the civil rights group.
     The grants exemplify Reebok's long-term commitment to the
cause of human rights, says Paul Fireman, chairman and CEO of the
company.  The foundation is also interested in supporting "the
underserved" children and youth, the handicapped, and the
elderly.  It also occasionally assists capital campaigns or
building projects "where the result would make a world of
difference in the lifestyle of the people served," according to
foundation guidelines.
     Reebok's total contributions in 1987 were $285,500,
increasing to $1.5 million in 1988.  The foundation accepts
proposals year-round; the contact person is Jean Mahoney,
executive director, Reebok Foundation, 150 Royall Street, Canton,
MA 02021, (617) 341-7361.

     Look for possible enhancement of Dayton Hudson's charitable

     Look for possible enhancement of Dayton Hudson's charitable
giving policies since the corporation's $1.04 billion acquisition
of Marshall Field's, announced in April.  Marshall Field's 24
stores, located in Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, and Ohio, will
bring Dayton Hudson's total number of department stores to 61.
It is too soon to speculate on changes in corporate giving, a
Dayton Hudson spokesman said, "but if the merger is successful,
Marshall Field's will become a part of our culture, and the
foundation is a big part of that culture."  The Dayton Hudson
Foundation gave $17.4 million in 1988, chiefly to the arts and
humanities and social services.  Cynthia Mayeda was recently
named director of the foundation (CGW, April).

     According to a new independent survey commissioned by Save
the Children, 84% of all heads of companies polled feel that
children's education is a world problem of extreme or great
importance, even more than pollution, energy shortages, and
disease.  More than half (58%) of the business executives polled
think that corporations should participate in charity-sponsored
efforts to help disadvantaged children worldwide.  According to
the survey findings, the three most important factors when
considering a corporate contribution to a charity are geographic
areas served, cited by 77%; concrete results, cited by 76%; and
the percentage of revenues spent on administration, cited by 69%.

PRUDENTIAL FUNDS HEALTH CARE FOR URBAN YOUTH

     In response to health care delivery gaps and high infant
mortality rates in its corporate office host city of Newark, NJ,
the Prudential Foundation will fund two initiatives that will
increase access to medical and social programs for the city's
children.
     The school-based initiative, "Cities in Schools," (CIS) will
offer an array of on-site social services to 135 students who
attend Newark's Central High School, where the dropout rate is 22
percent. Services will include medical and dental care, pre- and
post-natal care, academic counseling, and job training.
     CIS, which received $100,000 from the Prudential Foundation,
is supported nationally by private-sector funding and the federal
Justice, Labor, and Health and Human Services departments. If
successful, the program may be replicated in Newark's four other
high schools.
     The foundation also gave the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey $65,000 to support a mobile pediatric
health clinic that will make house calls to children in Newark's
low-income housing projects. About 100 children a week will visit
the unit.
     The two grants are among $4.5 million the foundation
allocated to health care and education programs in 1990.
     "The projects are classic examples of how addressing the
needs of particular populations and communities can have larger
implications for society and business," said Prudential
Foundation president Peter Goldberg.

THE PRUDENTIAL: HOW MUCH THEY GIVE, WHERE IT GOES

     The Foundation gave $14.3 million in 1989 and $13.34 million
in 1989.  The company's direct giving in 1988 totaled about $1.74
million, which does not include non-monetary support of $252,000.
     Primary concerns are improving basic education skills,
including math, science, language arts, and computer literacy in
public schools, and supporting increased educational
opportunities for the disadvantaged, minorities, women, and
disabled people.  Health care is also a priority.
     A number of education contributions are disbursed as
employee matching gifts to colleges and universities, private
secondary schools, and schools for people with disabilities.
Contact: Elisa D. Pazzuoli, Secretary, Prudential
Foundation, Prudential Plaza, 745 Broad Street, 15th Floor,
Newark, NJ 07101.  Requests for nonmonetary support should be
addressed to William E. Brooks, Vice President, Community
Relations.

D.C. SCHOOL BOARD ACCEPTS $1 MILLION FROM PHILIP MORRIS

     The Washington, DC, school board recently approved a $1
million grant from the Philip Morris tobacco conglomerate,
overturning its original decision to delay acceptance of the
money because of "moral" concerns.
     The uncertainty about whether or not to accept the grant
highlights the concerns that school systems in cities with large
minority populations have in accepting gifts from tobacco
companies.  There is growing anger locally about industry tactics
to promote a product linked to about 900 deaths a year in the
District, a rate that far exceeds the national average.
     But company officials say the criticism would be worse and
more deserved if they failed to share their wealth.  "If we gave
$1 million to Mother Teresa, critics would find something wrong
with it," said Tom Ricke, Philip Morris spokesman.  "We do it
because it's the right thing to do."
     The grant will help finance learning centers at several city
schools chosen as sites for a school-improvement model created by
Yale University child psychiatrist James P. Comer.

CORPORATE SUPPORT OF READING PROGRAMS EXPANDS

     Encouraging children to read is one of corporate America's
favorite ways of disbursing charitable funds.  There is a double
payoff: reading programs address companies' own needs for
literate employees and also enhance their public image.
     Jello Desserts, a division of General Foods Corporation,
which began its Reading Rocket program two years ago in ten city
school systems, will offer the program nationally in 1990-91.
 Launched with a grant of $2.5 million, Reading Rocket is aimed
at children in grades 2-4 and addresses three major
concerns: motivating children to enjoy reading, encouraging
parental participation, and providing teachers and librarians
with additional books.
     Another successful program, Pizza Hut's "Book It!" was
started five years ago to encourage children in grades 1-6 to
read more by rewarding them with pizza vouchers.  This program
has proved so popular that in 1990-91 it will be offered to
children in kindergarten, too.  Because many kindergartners
cannot read, teachers will set reading goals that involve
parents, grandparents, and siblings in reading to the child.
Steven S. Reinemund, president and CEO of Pizza Hut, a division
of Pepsico, explains his company's motivation for the project:
"As an employer, we believe an investment in education is an
investment in our future."
     Currently the company's annual budget for literacy
initiatives is $20 million.
     Contact: Eunice Ellis, Pizza Hut, Inc., P.O. Box 2999,
Wichita, KS 67201.
     Early childhood education is also a priority of the General
Foods Corporation, which merged with Kraft in 1988.  Before the
merger, General Foods gave about $10 million annually.  Contact:
Ronald J. Coman, administrative director, Kraft General Foods
Foundation, Glenview, IL 60025.

CAUSE-RELATED MARKETING: SIX TIPS FOR SUCCESS

     The word is out that corporations can sell products, make
money, and do good at the same time through a well thought out
cause-marketing campaign, William H. Lembeck, president of Ryan
Cause Marketing, a consulting company in Westport, CT, told an
international conference of the National Society of Fund Raising
Executives in Orlando, FL, in March.
     But a lot of nonprofit organizations don't understand the
needs of corporations or how they go about marketing their
products, and therefore miss out on this "huge pot of money,"
Lembeck noted.
     Here are Lembeck's six tips for nonprofits who want to reap
the benefits of cause-related marketing:

     o  Think like a marketer.  Identify your organization's
marketable assets.  These may include your name, community
awareness of your programs, and your board members.

     o  Learn as much as you can about the companies you wish to
approach.  Read the business press; check the companies' annual
reports; watch their ads and promotions.

     o  Try to figure out what their target is before you
approach them.

     o  Address their needs in your presentation; show them that
you're on their side and that working with your organization will
help them sell more products (and incidentally benefit your
cause).

     o  Identify key decision makers.  For cause-marketing
decisions, the person to approach is not the head of the
foundation, it's the vice president of marketing and sales.
o  Follow up a proposal personally by phone and in letters until
you get an answer.

     At its April board meeting, AT&T share-holders

     At its April board meeting, AT&T share-holders
overwhelmingly turned down a proposal that sought to ban
corporate funding for organizations endorsing abortion.  The vote
followed the AT&T Foundation's decision to cut off donations to
Planned Parenthood because of complaints from anti-abortionists.
In a letter to Robert E. Allen, chairman of the board and CEO of
AT&T, Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood, said that
the company's actions, "have damaged corporate philanthropy in
general.  You have demonstrated that a small band of zealots can
successfully harass a major corporation."  Wattleton's letter,
written before the shareholders' meeting, pointed out that AT&T
management advised share-holders to vote against the proposal,
"an enlightened position now undercut by the foundation."

     Earth Day organizers raised about $2.5 million to celebrate

     Earth Day organizers raised about $2.5 million to celebrate
its 20th anniversary in April.  Among corporate donors that met
Earth Day's strict environmental standards were Esprit clothing
company; Shaklee, which manufactures biodegradable and
phosphate-free detergents; and Church & Dwight, which makes Arm &
Hammer products.  Organizers say they turned away $4 million from
corporations that did not meet their exacting standards.  But
being rejected as sponsors of Earth Day has not prevented
companies such as GM, AT&T, Mobil, Shell Oil, and Dow Chemical
from latching onto the environment as a marketing gimmick in
their advertising.  Ad executives predict consumer backlash.
The Soviet national airline, Aeroflot, has agreed to buy jet
engines from General Electric Co., the first time Western-made
commercial aircraft engines have been sold to the Soviet Union.
GE said the sale could be worth as much as $150 million and opens
the door to further sales to the Soviet airline, the world's
largest.  The purchase comes on top of $131 million in orders
from state-owned airlines in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and
Poland.

BURGER KING COOKS UP WAYS TO HELP KIDS STAY IN SCHOOL

     To help combat the nation's chronic school dropout rate,
Burger King has opened Burger King Academies in seven cities;
three more will be announced in September.
     The academies, run by the dropout-prevention organization
Cities in Schools, offer academic instruction to dropout-prone
high school students, along with counseling, job training, and
access to social services such as child care and public
assistance.
     The U.S. Department of Justice helped launch the project
with a $1 million grant.  Burger King added $350,000 seed money,
plus $45,000 a year per academy for budget expenses.
     Academies are located in Long Beach, Inglewood, and
Sacramento, CA; San Antonio, TX; Palm Beach and Miami, FL; and
Philadelphia, PA.

concluded a major organizational restructuring in an effort to

that occurred during the 1980s.  In 1990, with assets that now
exceed $3.2 billion, the foundation expects to make grants
totaling roughly $145 million.  Along with the expanded grant
making will come a program that emphasizes increased foundation
involvement with grantees as well as with other grant makers and
a stronger commitment to interdisciplinary funding.  Here is a
program-by-program look at some of the changes at the foundation.
     Health and human services.  According to Drew E. Altman, who
now heads Pew's health and human services program, "A natural
role for foundations is to provide the seed funds for [health and
human services] programs that ultimately get picked up and
integrated into government funding streams."  In addition to a
closer collaboration with the government, Altman predicts more
partnerships with other foundations.  While Altman says he
expects the process of developing a new agenda for the foundation
to take several years, he is certain that the problems of
children living in poverty will be "a top concern."
     Education.  Pew's new program director for education, Robert
B. Schwartz, believes there is potential for increased
partnerships between the government, the corporate sector, and
foundations in education, with foundations providing the "initial
risk capital to test innovative programs."  While higher
education will continue to be a primary focus of the trusts,
Schwartz expects to direct increased attention toward
intervention programs that will focus on the middle-school years.
     According to Schwartz, the foundation will encourage
educators who are taking a broader view of their role, one which
cuts across traditional service lines and includes
responsibilities such as nutrition and health care.  Schwartz is
also interested in exploring the role of private philanthropy in
encouraging a more centralized national educational agenda.
     Culture.  Marian A Godfrey, the foundation's new program
director for culture, says she "would like to explore
partnerships at the local and national levels" with corporations,
the government, and other foundations.  Godfrey predicts that a
number of existing priorities are likely to receive greater
attention, such as support for individual artists and
multi-cultural programing.  Pew is also looking into
opportunities for funding programs to increase public
appreciation of the arts and culture.
     Religion.  Joel A. Carpenter, the new program director for
religion, believes the importance of religious scholarship has
been underestimated by American academics.  "An anthropologist
going to New Guinea would never think of trying to understand
that culture without also studying its religion," explains
Carpenter, "but somehow American scholars have gotten into the
frame of mind that they can understand Western culture without
this critical component."  In addition to providing continued
support for religious scholarship, Carpenter says Pew will also
expand its support of church-based community service.  As a
beginning, Carpenter says Pew recently initiated a national small
grants program through World Vision that will support local
religious programs in housing, leadership development, and job
training.
     The environment.  The foundation recently hired Joshua S.
Reichert as its new program director for conservation and the
environment.  According to Reichert, the trusts look forward to,
and expect to encourage, a "groundswell of community-based
activism" on behalf of the environment.  Reichert says he will be
considering a wide range of opportunities to promote
environmentally sustainable economic development, strengthen
grass-roots environmental organizations, increase public
awareness, and encourage new public policy ideas for addressing
important environmental problems.
     Public policy.  Kevin F.F. Quigley is the trusts' new
program director for public policy.  While Quigley says the
program's basic priorities will remain the same, he adds that
some areas will receive greater emphasis in the coming years.  "I
will be exploring ways to build on our existing Economics and
National Security program to further strengthen the integration
of the two fields at the policy level," says Quigley.  "Also,
given the trusts' historic interests in supporting free markets
and democracy, we will be taking a closer look at how Pew might
more actively promote these values around the world, beginning in
Eastern Europe."
     In 1989, the Pew Charitable Trusts made grants totaling
roughly $146.7 million.  Of this amount, 46% went to health and
human services, 24% went to education, 14% went to culture, 8%
went to religion, 5% went to conservation and the environment,
and 4% went to public policy.  For more information about the
trusts, contact Deidra A. Lyngard, Communications Manager, Pew
Charitable Trusts, Three Parkway, Suite 501, Philadelphia, PA

WOODRUFF FOUNDATION JOINS TOP 20 U.S. FOUNDATIONS

     The Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, Atlanta, GA, has seen its
assets and giving levels skyrocket during the past year as it
continues to receive assets from the estate of Robert W.
Woodruff.
     At the end of 1987, the foundation had assets of $66.2
million.  By 1988, that figure had more than tripled, with
year-end assets of $194.5 million, and by 1989, assets had
reached $755.7 million.  The foundation estimates assets in the
area of $890 million by the end of this year, which puts it among
the top 20 U.S. foundations in terms of assets.
     Meanwhile, giving levels have bounded from almost $3 million
(1987), to $3.9 million (1988), up to $8.7 million (1989).
Projected total grants for 1990 reflect the foundation's new
wealth, with a contributions figure in the area of $25 million.
Background.  The foundation was established in 1937 by the late
Robert W. Woodruff.  Woodruff became president of the Coca-Cola
Company in the 1920s, and was instrumental in building the soft
drink company into an international business.  He had no children
and left most of his estate to the foundation when he died in
1985.
     The Woodruff Foundation's major priorities are education,
health care, the arts, social services, and the environment.
Most grant recipients are Georgia-based organizations such as
colleges and universities (Emory University has been a major
beneficiary), hospitals, and arts centers.  The foundation also
makes grants to out-of-state organizations for the benefit of
Georgia residents.  For example, the foundation has provided
funds for scholarship programs for students from Georgia.
     In 1988, the foundation gave 41% of total funding to the
arts, 27% to health organizations, 17% to civic groups, 12% to
educational institutions, and 3% to social service organizations.

Foundation, 230 Peachtree Street N.W., Suite 1400, Atlanta, GA

     A U.S. district court has determined that the IRS properly
imposed a $64,000 excise tax on the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation for failure to file annual reports on the progress of
a program-related investment (PRI).  In Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation v. U.S., the court found that the regulation requiring
annual reports on PRI grants was ambiguous.  However, the court
agreed with the IRS that requiring annual reports for the entire
life of the grant was more consistent with the overall regulatory
scheme.  The case concerned a $320,000 PRI grant made by Mott to
a community organization in 1976.  After filing annual reports on
the grant for the years 1976 to 1980, the foundation discontinued
its reports, believing that Treasury regulations required reports
for only the first three years of PRI grants.  In its decision,
the court noted that PRI grantees are required to report to the
grantor throughout the life of the PRI, making it consistent to
require that the grantor report to the IRS during the same
period.

     The Fred Meyer Charitable Trust, Portland, OR, has changed
its name, effective April 23 of this year, to Meyer Memorial
Trust.  According to the foundation, the name change results from
the foundation's desire to make it clear that the trust is a
private foundation, "not a company foundation related in any way
to Fred Meyer, Inc."  When Fred Meyer died in 1978, he left the
bulk of his estate to the trust, which provides funding for
social welfare, arts and humanities, education, and health
organizations.  The Meyer Memorial Trust has never owned stock in
or received any contributions from the company.  The street
address and telephone number for the trust have not changed: 1515
S.W. Fifth Avenue, Suite 500, Portland, OR 97201, (503) 228-5512.

     The Annie E. Casey Foundation, Greenwich, CT, has announced
a 50% increase in grants to aid disadvantaged children.  The
foundation, which accepts funding proposals only from preselected
organizations, will achieve the increase by allocating the
interest on its capital to grants rather than to its endowment.
As a result, funding for programs will increase from about $30
million next year to $45 million in 1993.  According to the
foundation, the extra funds will be used to increase support for
successful grassroots programs which are having difficulty with
fund raising.  Contact the foundation at 31 Brookside Drive,
Greenwich, CT 06830, (203) 661-2773.

GANNETT FOUNDATION TO SELL COMPANY STOCK

     Only a few months after a highly publicized headquarters
move to Arlington, VA, the Gannett Foundation is attracting
attention again with the announcement of plans to sell its
Gannett Company stock.  The foundation, headed by former Gannett
Company chairman Allen H. Neuharth, announced on April 25 that
its trustees had voted unanimously to retain an investment
banking firm to negotiate a possible sale of its 10% block of stock.
     The Gannett Foundation, which ranks in the top 20 U.S.
foundations in terms of assets, is currently the biggest Gannet
Company shareholder.  The Gannett stock represents the
foundation's only asset.
     According to a statement from foundation chairman Neuharth
and president Charles L. Overby, the foundation's decision to
sell its Gannett Company stock was motivated by IRS regulations
requiring foundations to pay out 5% of their assets each year.
The Gannett stock's annual dividend is $1.20 a share, which comes
to an annual yield of roughly 3.3%.
     At current market rates, the Gannett Foundation's 15,940,185
shares are worth between $550 million and $600 million.  Neuharth
and Overby said in their joint statement that "we will expand the
work of the USA's largest information-based foundation,
especially broadening programs in education, literacy, and First
Amendment freedoms."
     The foundation spent about $30 million on grants, programs,
and operations in 1989.  Areas of giving included journalism
(education, minority advancement, and professionalism); adult
literacy; special grants; local and community grants (for a
variety of nonprofits located in areas served by Gannett media);
philanthropy and volunteerism; and disaster relief.

of Communications, Gannett Foundation, 1101 Wilson Boulevard,

FORD FOUNDATION EXPANDS GRANT MAKING

     The Ford Foundation's two-year budget for 1990-91 calls for
a 13.2% increase in grant making compared to 1988-89, according
to the foundation.  Most giving programs, including urban
poverty, human rights and social justice, governance and public
policy, education and culture, and international affairs, will
increase grant making significantly.
     In addition, the foundation has sharply increased funding
for program-related investments (low-interest loans to
nonprofits) and for its general reserve fund, which the
foundation uses to meet unanticipated needs or respond to program
activities outside its usual categories.  The foundation has
slightly decreased funding for its rural poverty and resources
program.
     Approximately 35% of the Ford Foundation's program budget is
allocated for work in selected developing countries.  The
foundation recommends that grant applicants begin by sending a
short letter of inquiry to determine whether the foundation's
interests permit consideration of a formal proposal.
     Grant inquiries should be addressed to Barron M. Tenny, Vice
President, Secretary, and General Counsel, Ford Foundation, 320
East 43rd Street, New York, NY 10017, (212) 573-5000.

ELECTRONICS

Look for a Slowdown
in the Coming Year

According to the Semiconductor Industry Assn.s preliminary
numbers, the worldwide semiconductor device markets grew an
unprecedented 43.7% to well over $145 billion in 1995, after
predicting a growth rate of less than 15%.  The question of whether
market growth of this magnitude can be sustained at the 1995 level
or not remains.  In short, our reply is, no.  A look at the
markets driving forces in 1995 will fill in the blanks.

First, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices accounted for
nearly 30% of the total market, up from 17% as recently as 1993.
The major factor this past year, of course, was the release of
Windows 95 PC operating (OS) system, and its requirement of up to
16 megabytes of RAM for smooth operation.  Since 1993, the influx
of graphics-intensive software had pushed memory requirements to
the 8 megabyte range, where it remains for applications of this
type.  No new wunderkind software applications or OSs are on the
horizon to push RAM requirements up further.  Look for a leveling
of DRAM demand in particular to soften the market somewhat.

This is not to say the market will not experience healthy growth.
While the PC market, still the main silicon device driver, may have
matured in North America, other areas in the world are seeing PC
sales growth in the 20% per year range.  However, hardware
requirements have stabilized for the time being.  We see the
semiconductor market approaching $180 billion in 1996, which is an
increase of just over 23%.  Major beneficiaries of the overall
market are manufacturing equipment suppliers, who will ride for
free in 1996, with many companies reporting up to nine-month
backlogs in orders.

A market for which we see little potential is that for cheap, dumb
PC terminals under development for World Wide Web access.  Under
the concept, these machines would lack the standard hard drive,
floppy disks, and extensive software systems, but would still
require RAM and processor power.

Anyone who has cruised the Web will tell you that moving from site-
to-site is a tedious process, and speed is of the essence.  In
addition, online time is money, and for any system designed to
cruise the Web to be successful, it must provide the processing
power and memory needed to smoothly handle the graphics-intensive
Web.  At current prices, a powerful, 8 megabyte machine cannot be
built and sold with the hoped-for price tag of $500.  A system
built for more than that price will collect dust on warehouse
shelves (right alongside PDAs)!

INTSTRUMENTS

The Analytical Industry
Sharpens Its Focus

For instrument makers, 1995 was a year of recovery from poor
performance during 1993 and part of 1994.  A number of categories
have improved appreciably due to increased demand in segments of
industrial process applications and biomedical research.
Environmental applications are flat to shrinking, so a number of
suppliers are developing new strategies to reach other markets.

Instrument makers continue to find more ways to improve their
manufacturing methods by reducing the number of parts, simplifying
assembly steps and implementing more stringent testing of key
components.  The net result, in some cases, is a product that is
more reliable, and features more capabilities, while actually
costing less.

More importantly though, for future sales, a growing range of
sophisticated technologies are being adapted to various
instrumentation.  New detectors, more powerful computers, improved
methods of analysis, new reagents and other factors are pushing
many instruments to new levels of performance.  Also, other types
of hybrid instrumentation are finding new market niches and are
helping to expand the suppliers product lines.

Examples of new types of instrumentations that may find significant
markets in the future are the Smart Nose instruments, field-flow
fractionation (FFF),  and newly configured ion mobility
spectrometers.  Also, some product segments that were thought to be
technologically mature are showing surprising new innovations that
are reinvigorating those instrument segments.

BCC report G-181 The New Generation of Analytical Instruments, is
an upcoming report that surveys the 1995 analytical instrument
market, as well as international markets and projects units and
sales through 2005 for over 30 instruments.

The BCC estimate of the 1995 U.S. market for analytical
instruments, as defined by the Dept. of Commerce, was approximately
$5.1-$5.8 billion in shipments.  Related measuring instruments
would bring the figure closer to $6.5-$7.5 billion .  Projected
U.S. sales growth is projected to be approximately 5-7% through
2005.

It  is worth noting that of those shipments, $1.2-1.4 billion was
just in parts, components and accessories.  While the overall
market appears to have grown in the U.S. , the parts segment has
stayed flat.  For 1995, pending further data, the estimated value
of exports of analytical instruments from the U.S. was an estimated
$1.90-$2.1 billion, and imports were an estimated $1.2-$1.3
billion.

SEPARATIONS

Advances Point to
Steady Growth

The various ways of separating materials from mixtures are a
critical but little known part of industrial production.  From
pharmaceuticals to food and even waste treatment, producers rely on
these rapidly developing technologies. These techniques are also
key to research and analysis.

Lately, we are seeing increased interest in magnetic separations,
both on the research front and by commercial concerns.  Developing
technologies will advance this high tech market. Los Alamos
National Lab (Los Alamos, NM 87545) researchers are using high-
gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) to extract slightly magnetic
radioactive contaminants from soil or water.  The process primary
advantage is the lack of secondary waste produced.

In the pharmaceutical industry, PerSeptive Diagnostics (500 Old
Connecticut Path, Framingham, MA 10701; Tel: 617/499-1433) have
simplified the process of isolating GAC repeats using BioMag
Streptavidin and magnetic agarose.  While scientists report the use
of magnetic particles specifically for the isolation of CAG
repeats, in principle, the same techniques could be used to isolate
any gene for which a biotinylated PNA probe could be synthesized.


Diagnostic test maker, Ohmicron Environmental Diagnostics Inc. (375
Pheasant Run, Newtown, PA 18940; Tel: 800/544-8881), has
commercialized two new magnetic particle-based RaPID Assay
immunoassay test kits-cyclodienes and metribuzin.

Older processes have also advanced. Researchers continue to test
the boundary of capillary electrophoresis (CE) applications.
Recently, considerable attention has been focused on a highly
promising technique for metal ion analysis.  Andrei Timerbaev has
been developing a number of migration models based on a generally
valid equation for electrophoretic mobility as a function of charge
density.  Two major obstacles affecting CE are electroendosmotic
flow (EOF) and sample adsorption onto the capillary wall.

Researchers at the University of Uppsala (Dept. of Biochemistry,
Uppsala, Sweden) have developed a method of coating the capillaries
that eliminates both problems for a considerable length of time.
Beckman Instruments (2500 Harbor Blvd., Fullerton, CA 92634; Tel:
800/742-2345)  Chia-Hui Shieh has recently patented coated
capillary columns and a method for their use.

Supercritical fluids technology has also expanded its applications
horizons.  Two separate studies recently compared supercritical
fluid extraction (SFE) with liquid extraction as methods for
removing labile vitamins from creams, lotions, and tablets.  As a
result of their work, the researchers recommended SFE as a method
for quality-control analysis of pharmaceutical tablets.

Supercritical carbon dioxide is now being used as a method to
recover uranium and plutonium from nuclear wastes and spent fuels.
And Los Alamos National Lab (Chemical Science and Technology Div.,
Los Alamos, NM 87545) has used supercritical CO2 as a method of
precision cleaning that reduces hazardous waste.  The primary
advantage of this technique is the elimination of chlorocarbons and
chlorofluorocarbons as solvents.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

Watch the Fiber
Optic Market

Market growth for fiber optic materials will increase at a rapid
pace, but not as fast in some segments as many industry sources
predicted a few years ago, says a new BCC business opportunity
report, Fiber Optic Materials.  The predicted market surge for
fiber optic materials in interexchange, or long distance carrier
applications and in networks involving a single building or a group
of buildings continues unabated.  On the other hand, the
uncertainly now creeping into the market revolves around the speed
with which the local exchange carriers (LECs) will upgrade their
residential networks.

Fiber optic materials represent much of the physical structure
needed for existing telecommunications systems, as well as for the
vast networks envisioned for installation during the remainder of
this decade and the 21st century. Telecommunications systems
capable of providing voice, data, text, and video to a variety of
users will require large increases in the ability to transmit an
enormous number of signals over both long and short distances.
Technical advances in erbium-doped amplifiers, plastic optical
fiber (POF), and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technologies, to
name only a few, are spurring the deployment of fiber optic
networks.

Two segments of the fiber optic material market, fiber from local
exchanges to the curb and fiber from the curb to the home, were the
subject of very (some would say wildly) optimistic growth estimates
as recently as 1994.  Now many industry sources believe that for
the next 5-10 years, in most cases, fiber optic service will end at
the neighborhood level.

There are several regions for the new uncertainty in these market
segments.  First, the expected merging of and blurring of the
distinct lines between regional telephone companies and cable
television operators is not occurring nearly as fast as previously
predicted.  Second, although legislation opening up competition in
local communications markets is certain, the pace of its
implementation may be slower than previously thought.  Finally,
despite huge drops in the cost of fiber optic network components,
the rush to replace copper and coaxial cable in these applications
has been slower than forecast.

The BCC Fiber Optic Materials report presents a detailed view of
world market size, growth, and trends for this industry.  The major
product lines and applications are identified, and the market size
for each product line and application is estimated for the next
five years.  Significant global technological trends and
developments in materials and applications are identified and
analyzed, and the structure of the industry is addressed.  Profiles
of the major fiber optic materials suppliers are provided.

This BCC report provides in-depth information and technological
evaluations for decision making by those involved in the supply of
fiber optic materials to the telecommunications industry.  This
study can assist users in strategic planning, acquisition analysis,
technology analysis, commercial development of new products, and
analysis of competitors strategies, strengths, weaknesses,
pricing, market share, and profitability.

MEMBRANES

A Technology That
Is Coming of Age

1996 is expected to see membrane based technologies increasingly
incorporated into large scale industrial processes.  Progress is
expected to continue in an evolutionary mode with newer membranes
and devices overcoming earlier shortcomings such as flux, fouling,
and scalability. Some of the new concepts up for trial during the
year might include contained liquid membranes, membrane based
stripping, extraction and adsorption. Hybrid process will bring in
membrane separations to augment what cannot be attained
economically by either process on a stand alone basis.

Ultrafiltration (UF) is up for a greater variety of materials to
help out the reliable polysulfone. Zirconia on alumina or some
other type of inorganic may find wider acceptance. PVDF and
modified PANs can find their niche. Crossflow operational modes for
UF and MF (microfiltration) will increasingly be the norm.

Pervaporation (PV) will continue its commercial acceptance, but it
is a hard sell.  Potential users do not know what this versatile
money maker can really do for them. Removal of organics from water
via hydrophobic silicone membranes on a microporous substrate in
the spiral wound configuration is being commercialized.  Hollow
fiber units with transverse feed flow have been developed. Yet to
be commercialized is the Exxon process to separate
aromatics/saturates in the same boiling range into an aromatics-
lean retentate for diesel and an aromatics-rich permeate for high
octane gasoline using a polyimide/polyadipate copolymer membrane.

Membrane processes that remove VOCs from air or nitrogen should be
better accepted.  Cation exchange membranes for continuous
deionization should find wider use in deionized water production.
Condensation has been integrated with vapor permeation for VOC
removal and additional hybrids such as cryo-membrane permeation,
membrane-PSA, and cryogenic-membrane-PSA have been patented. A
relatively new commercial development is the membrane phase
contactor for use in extraction, absorption, and stripping. An
example of the absorption application of the membrane phase
contactor is used in the beverage industry to add carbon dioxide to
aqueous solutions for carbonation.

Non-separating functions of membranes are expected to advance in
total usage.  Artificial skin, controlled release applications,
biomemitic devices, and breathable fabrics are all examples. Bag
filters still dominate the particulate/air entrapment market, but
low cost membranes could take market share.  An entire market area
could open up if a really low cost membrane material for disposable
diapers could be produced.

separations industry. She is managing director of Membrane &

PLASTICS

Market Turns to
the Pacific Rim

The plastics industry has been able to absorb some overcapacity
because of increased demand.  However, the spectre of overcapacity
still plagues the industry for many commodity resins because of
rapid expansion in capacities in Pacific Rim countries.
Continuance of this scenario will result in lower prices, and
operating rates along with reduced profits.

Opportunities for plastics consumption are strong in Asia, Africa,
and the Mideast, with Eastern Europe still lagging behind the
global pace.  However, only the Asian market is of significant
volume.

Main driving forces for plastics consumption still reside with
traditional markets led by automotive, consumer products, and
electrical/electronic. In addition to new polymerization advances
characterized by metallocene technologies, other aspects still
being pursued include alloying/blending, and use of reinforcements
to enhance existing properties.

Metallocene-based resins have expanded from polyethylene to
polypropylene with polystyrene versions expected in a year or two.
The high cost of producing metallocene resins will probably be
minimized by converting existing reactors (retrofitting).  In
addition, it is expected that metallocene catalysts will be used in
conjunction with traditional catalysts combining advantages of
both.

Foamed resins have been at the center of the environmental scene
with replacements of CFCs by HCFCs as blowing agents.  The
worldwide agreement to ban CFCs (Montreal Protocol) has been moved
up to the year 2000.  Recycled plastic markets are still dominated
by PET bottles and HDPE.  Packaging will remain the largest market
for recycled resins for the next few years.

BIOTECHNOLOGY

Still Survival
of the Fittest

Seeing into the future can be a bit tricky.  We're reminded of the
Coney Island fortune teller who predicted we'd soon take a journey
over water.  The next day it rained and in the course of our
peregrinations we stepped over a puddle, fulfilling the prophecy.


Predicting this year's unfolding of biotechnology events is
something like that Coney Island experience: if they're general
enough, predictions surely will come to pass, like saying some
biotechnology companies in 1996 will probably succeed while others
will probably have to pack it in. Some products in clinical trials
will pass, while others will fail.

But which ones?  If that could be known ahead of time, one could
make a fortune.  Some people of course believe that test tube
experiments and preclinical studies with animal models can foretell
the future, can tell how the candidate drugs will behave in humans.
And a lot of bets are placed on such forecasts.

One of the big events of the year just past is the recognition that
some biotechnology efforts may fail, just as surely as some will
succeed. We may not know precisely which category any particular
venture may fall into, but just the mere recognition that failure
may occur represents a far cry from biotechnology's earlier, heady
days of overconfidence. Building in plans for the unexpected
"impossibilities" provides companies with mechanisms in place to
let them cope with uncertainty, and survive.

Forecasting is not all speculation, of course, although it can be
wishful thinking.  If a product passes its trials, and if it
receives regulatory approval, and if  it captures an assumed
percentage share of its available market, then a reasonable
forecast of its possible sales can be made and the manufacturing
capacity to fulfill that demand can be rationally planned.  The
"trick" lies in being as objective (at least with oneself) in
making business forecasts as in designing laboratory experiments.

Some forecasting is done by extrapolating from the past and
present, in light of unfolding forces for change. On this basis,
predicting biotechnology events in 1996 is made a little easier by
considering several discernible trends.

    Virtualization of the pharmaceutical industry will accelerate.
Big pharma surrounds itself with drug discovery firms to fulfill
its research needs, while biotechnology companies surround
themselves with contract manufacturers. It's cheaper and less
committal than hiring in these functions. Marketing may become the
next function to be outsourced.

    Differentiation of the biotechnology industry will become more
transparent. Companies divide into those seeking to commercialize
biomolecules and those seeking to commercialize chemical molecules
acting on biological targets. They also divide into discoverers of
candidate targets for therapeutic intervention and developers of
actual drug candidates.

    The struggle to survive will become more intense. Not only is
it getting harder to raise money to sustain research, in view of
coming cuts in the federal budget, but biotechnology companies will
increasingly be judged on their ability to actually deliver
products for sale.

CERAMICS

Less Hype--and
Some Real Growth

One important aspect of the U.S. advanced ceramics industry now is
that the Ceramics Fever of the early and mid-1980s has gone and
a new realization has come among the suppliers of advanced ceramic
components. One good example was the hype over ceramic engines,
thought to be a reality for the 1990s with the component suppliers
competing for shares of a market which failed to materialize.

Another setback to the U.S. advanced ceramics industry has been the
drastic cuts in U.S. military programs.  A good example of this is
the militarys earlier plan to use ceramic armor on land-based
vehicles by the late 1980s.  This has been postponed to a later
date and in some cases abandoned altogether.

BCC has been studying the various advanced ceramics market segments
for the last 10 years.  The recession in the early 1990s had
severely affected certain segments of the advanced ceramics
industry such as structural ceramics and in a limited way, the
ceramic coating business.  Electronic ceramics has not been much
affected by the last fact. The electronics segment has been growing
at a faster rate than our own earlier forecast in 1990 and 1992.

In a recent study to be published in March 1996 (DCD96, Complete
Guide to the U.S. Advanced Ceramics Industry), BCC has attempted to
analyze the overall market potential in the U.S.  BCC has further
estimated the size of the 1995 and future market potential for the
various advanced ceramics market segments in the U.S.  The total
value of the U.S. advanced ceramic components market for 1995 is
estimated to be $5.5 billion.  This will increase to $8.7 billion
by the year 2000 with a growth rate of 9.5% from 1995 to 2000.

Sewing Up 1995 Figures,
Projecting into 1996

Economists participating in the Blue Chip survey of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland, anticipate a 2.4% rate of real economic
growth in 4th quarter 1995--well below last quarters 4.2% advance.
The recent flatness in industrial production and hours worked seems
consistent with this slowdown.  For all of 1995, the Blue Chip
panel foresees a growth rate of approximately 3.2%.  Economists
estimate the nations long-term growth potential at roughly 2.5%
per year.

A boom in business fixed investment has accompanied the current
business expansion, but curiously, the underlying factors have not
ignited residential construction.  Despite some improvement in the
3rd quarter of 1995, new home construction has been a relatively
weak component of GDP this year.  Real residential investment fell
1.4% in the four quarters ending in quarter three of 1995.  With
single-unit housing starts remaining generally weak, residential
construction will most likely stay soft.  Housing starts declined
1.7% in October, the second consecutive monthly drop.

An interesting note, although probably nothing that will take
shape, is that the latest inflation indicators are showing
surprising volatility.  After a four-month gain of only 1.8%, the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerated to a 4.0% annualized rate in
October.

The median CPE--a measure of core inflation--slowed to 3.3%,
hovering between its year-to-date and five-year rates.

Taking a longer perspective, the 12-month change in the CPI and the
median CPI rose to 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.  Both are higher
than 1994 rates, but are still within or below the central tendency
range projected by the Federal Open Market Committee last July.

The Blue Chip forecast paints a far more favorable picture of
expected inflation.  The November 10 projection shows significant
improvement over forecasts made at the beginning of the year.  In
January, over 57% of economists were predicting that inflation
would reach 3.5% of more.  In November, that share fell to less
than 5%.

MNCs to Change
Basic Structure

The National Assn. of Business Economists (1233 20th St. NW, Suite
505, Washington, DC 20036; Tel: 202/463-6223), forecasts
international trade as a source of growth for 1996.  Net exports
should average $116.4 billion, an improvement of $7.5 billion over
1995.

The largest consumer markets in the world--China, India, and the
many countries that comprise the ex-Soviet Union--are in a state of
fundamental transition, and are potentially very lucrative markets.
China, for example, is gradually letting other countries into its
markets.  Chinas electronics market has experienced an over 20%
average annual growth rate during the 1990s, and is expected to
reach $40 billion in semiconductor sales in 1996.  And the market
is far from mature.  Mexico is another tantalizing market,
especially for U.S. companies to explore, provided CEOs can stomach
the dips, twists and turns that the Mexican market endures.

As the world becomes a truly global marketplace, more risk is going
hand-in-hand with more opportunity.  Multinational corporations
(MNCs) and companies looking to do business in foreign countries
will need to make a switch in their organizations. One way to
better position the organization is instead of just happening to
have expatriates in various countries around the world, companies
will start reorganizing their management structure to create a
culture of international-savvy managers who will help in getting
the most out of the outstanding economic opportunities that are
presenting themselves in foreign countries. This will make the
organization more flexible, with better understanding and ability
to handle the foreign markets.

In the next year, MNCs will probably start to undertake changes in
organization.  After assessing opportunities around the world, and
taking into account technologies such as video conferencing, a flat
organizational structure will take hold. There will be switches to
several headquarters, instead of one central one in the dominant
country.  Each region that is economically important will receive
an important group of professionals from the headquarters.

In the world we will soon see, top management all from the same
country will be a weakness of a MNC.  Managements understanding of
the culture in a foreign market by persons either from or very
familiar with the country will prove to be the difference between
the most successful MNCs and the also-rans.

Commerce Department
Reduces Export Controls

Action by the Commerce Department to reduce export controls that
create obstacles such as licensing burdens and delays for U.S.
semiconductor companies drew nothing but praise from the
Semiconductor Industry Association (181 Metro Drive, Suite 450, San
Jose, CA 95110; Tel: 408/436-6600, Fax: 408/436-6646).  The new
regulation, which went into effect Dec. 20, liberalizes export
controls on certain semiconductor devices shipped to China, the
republics of the former Soviet Union, and certain other
destinations for civilian end uses.

In a statement released to coincide with the start of the new
policy, SIA President Thomas W. Armstrong said, "This modernization
of export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needless
and costly licensing delays and burdensome paperwork.  These
reductions will lead to further export opportunities in areas with
major growth potential over the next decade."

The SIA notes that commercial semiconductors represent one of the
least controllable and most widely available high-technology
products in the world today.  Further maintenance of the old export
controls would have damaged U.S. industry without making any
material contribution to U.S. security.

Armstrong added, "The Commerce Department has made substantial
progress in the reduction of outmoded export licensing
requirements.  Continuation of this export liberalization process
to reflect the end of the Cold war will only stimulate business
opportunities and job creation."

In a related development, SIA also reported that the foreign share
in the Japan market for semiconductors rose more than 3% in the
third quarter to 26.2%.  Though no specific figures regarding the
U.S. share of the increase were available, Armstrong touted the
competitiveness of domestic chip makers as well as the U.S.-Japan
agreement as major factors.  SIA spokesman Jeff Weir said that
indications pointed to a substantial U.S. share in the increase.

Armstrong also added that strong relationships between the U.S.
and Japanese industries are being built, which would not have been
possible without the agreement.  Weir emphasized the SIAs support
for renewal of the pact, due this year, which is meeting some
resistance in Japan.

Managed Care
Is Really Here

Healthcare delivery in the U.S. and in most countries throughout
the world will experience significant change in 1996. The challenge
of  boards, management and physicians, says Albert W. Herman,
partner in charge of the Healthcare Services Group of global
accounting, tax and advisory firm Arthur Andersen LLP, will be to
provide the right care, at the right time, in the right amount, in
the right way and be able to prove it.

Market-based changes continue to challenge physicians, executives
and boards of directors in the healthcare industry.  Mergers,
alliances and affiliations among and between providers will
continue unabated in 1996, and managed care will continue its
market penetration across the country, according to Herman.

Based on the latest data available, about 18% of the total U.S.
population is enrolled in some type of managed care arrangement;
about 9% of all Medicare beneficiaries are in a managed care plan,
and about 23% of all Medicaid enrollees are in managed care as
well.  These percentages all will show marked increases in 1996.

At the same time, the debate and decisions from Capitol Hill, the
White House, and the state capitals will continue to influence
provider decision-making as will the initiatives and investigations
pursued by regulators such as the Dept. of Justice, Inspector
General, FBI, IRS, and the SEC.

The managed care market will mature as employers encourage workers
to switch to managed care, and as leading managed care groups and
medical groups begin to consolidate.  The momentum for direct
contracting between the payer and the care provider will grow in
1996, as will enrollee choice of their healthcare providers.
Eventually, managed care risk will shift to integrated delivery
systems, purchasers will contract with these systems for
comprehensive services, and capitation will prevail.

Rapid Change In
Device Market

Daphne Allen, assistant editor of Medical Device & Diagnostic
Industry, has analyzed the growth in the number of registered
medical device manufacturers in the U.S.  Data were obtained from
the FDAs Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance, which is a
part of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

During the period between August 1994 and August 1995, the FDA
recorded an increase of 1,737 registered medical device companies.
Overall, however, the total number of medical device establishments
has declined by 2%.  In addition to companies who leave the device
industry, the decline may be attributed to mergers, acquisitions,
consolidation of sites, and business failures.

The study indicated that six states provide the homes of nearly 47%
of the registered manufacturers.  California led the pack with
1,920 companies; New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Florida, and
Texas are also important locations for manufacturers.  The analysis
was published in Volume 17, No. 10

Fluorine Compounds
Surge Past Problems

Fluorine compounds are all around us and we use them every day,
despite the fact that most people do not know them as such.
"Performance chemicals" can be defined as those which do a specific
job, based on their physical and/or chemical properties, that other
products and materials do not do as well.

As a market for potential growth, total sales for performance
fluorine and chemical polymers should grow from a market value of
$3.8 billion in 1994 to reach $4.1 billion by 1999, an average
annual growth rate (AAGR) of 1.8%.

Chlorofluorocarbons are the largest segment of the total market as
well as the problem that needs to be untangled for the entire
market to sustain growth, but other segments of the fluorine and
chemical polymers market will see respectable growth at least up to
the next century.

Aromatics, a segment of organic fluorochemicals used primarily for
chemical processing, have a 1994 market value of $6 million,
forecasted to grow to $7 million by 1999, resulting in an AAGR of
5.9%

Inorganic fluorochemicals perform many diverse uses, ranging from
fluorides for water treatment and toothpaste, to the large volume
hydrogen fluoride and expensive, highly pure electronic etchants.
The 1994 market value for all inorganics was $567 million,
projected to reach $647 million by 1999, resulting in a 2.7% AAGR.

Fluoropolymers consist of polymer resins such as PTFE and PVDF,
fluoroelastomers, and low molecular weight polymers used as
surfactants, functional fluids, textile finishing chemicals to
impart water and oil repellency, and as chemical intermediates.
The 1994 market value for fluoropolymers is $1.35 billion and will
be $1.76 billion by 1999, reaching a 5.4% AAGR.

Business Communications Co., Inc. has recently published a study
titled Performance Fluorine and Chemical Polymers: Future

Carbon Nitride: A
Designer Abrasive

Scientists at the Carnegie Institution (Washington, DC) have used
a combination of state-of-the-art physics, supercomputers, and
insight gained from the study of minerals to predict the first
feasibly synthesizable material that is more incompressible than
diamond. Their calculations show that this material, a cubic form
of carbon nitride, C3N4, should be significantly less compressible
than diamond at room conditions.

Inasmuch as low compressibility is correlated with hardness, it is
highly possible that the new material could be harder than diamond
and therefore of significant technological use as a superabrasive
material and for wear-resistant coatings.

These results, reported in the January 5 issue of Science , rest
upon state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations. The levels
of speed and accuracy now attainable in such calculations enable
investigators to design materials by doing experiments on the
computer instead of in the laboratory. Scientists are thus
beginning to rationally design useful materials in a more efficient
manner than by the traditional "shake-and-bake" methodology of
finding new materials.

The investigators in the new work are David Teter and Russell
Hemley, both serving at Carnegie's Geophysical Lab and Center for
High Pressure Research. Teter and Hemley's work grew from
widespread interest in the possibility of finding new low
compressibility materials. Various forms of carbon nitrides had
been proposed as possible superhard materials potentially exceeding
diamond in hardness. Teter and Hemley identified several favorable
candidate C3N4 prototype forms and calculated their energetics,
structures and physical properties. They determined the cubic-C3N4
form to be the most incompressible.

Their calculations indicate that the cubic- C3N4 material can be
synthesized at pressures and temperatures now attainable in the
laboratory. (The material would be formed at high pressure and
temperature, and then quenched stably to ambient conditions.)
Scientists at the Carnegie institution and elsewhere are already
working to accomplish this, employing insights gained from the
theoretical work now reported. Conceivably, the material can
eventually be synthesized at an industrial scale using technology
similar to that now used to synthesize industrial diamond.

Teter and Hemley write that most experimental studies of carbon
nitrides have been carried out at ambient or low-pressure
conditions; their results indicate the importance of high-pressure
synthesis in the search for new carbon nitrides.

Home Office Workers
Are a Dynamic Market

Home offices have been in existence for years, from the employees
who are scheduled to work at home, to the after hours workers, and
including the self-employed home office worker.   Only recently,
though, have the home office workers become in vogue, their needs
just beginning to be addressed by office equipment manufacturers.
According to a new report from Business Communications Co., Inc.,
home office workers are a market segment with purchasing power
needing computers, peripherals, software,  office products and
ancillary services.

In report G-189 The Home Office: Markets for Equipment, Supplies
and Services, despite marginal growth in the overall workforce by
the year 2000, the home office segment will expand from 45.7
million individuals in 1995 to 60.9 million workers by 2000,
resulting in an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 5.9%.

Computers are an essential part of many home offices.  In 1995,
home office workers purchased over $13 billion worth of all types
of computers. The market is expected to grow to nearly $30 billion
by the year 2000,  reaching a 17.5% AAGR.

It is up to the manufacturers to recognize potential specialized
equipment to target this consumer group. Fully configured products,
such as computers or some peripherals, that can be accommodated
within smaller spaces would be the first logical product niche, as
the typical home office is in the basement or in the corner of the
living room, or may be in a spare bedroom.

The peripheral market segment for the home office includes
printers, software, modems, ISDN, email,  and related technologies
and remote access.  In 1995, the peripheral market for home offices
was over $42 billion.  By the year 2000, the forecast for the
peripheral market is for it to reach over $70 billion, resulting in
an AAGR of 10.8%.

The entire home office consumer purchases in 1995 was over $79
billion worth of equipment for their office environment.  The 2000
projection for this market is for the home office consumer to spend
over $132 billion, reaching a 10.7% AAGR.

'Ghost Sites' On The
World Wide Web

International Data Corp. (IDC, Five Speen St., Framingham, MA
01701) has predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment as
investors and corporations suffer through the discouragingly slow
development of a significant consumer base. By the end of the year,
IDC predicts 20% of the Fortune 500 companies that have commercial
Web sites will close or stop maintaining them, resulting in ghost
sites. The leading online information service providers will derive
more than one-half of their revenue from providing access to the
Web by mid-1997.

IDC predicts that "In 1996 ... the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's 'intoxication' stage to a
'hangover' stage. The high-flying Internet suppliers will have
disappointing financial results, while technical capabilities of
the Internet are stretched to the breaking point." Although IDC
predicts the overall growth in online subscribers will continue to
be very strong, they expect 1996 to show a high turnover rate as
users disappointed by the content on the Web cancel their online
subscriptions.

But, they also predict that during the next five years, the number
of online users will rise to more than 200 million, and by 2010, it
will exceed 1 billion. Industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate spending
will rise from 2 to 2.5% of revenues to more than 5%. In addition,
IDC believes online commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more
by the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

A full copy of IDC's 1996 predictions can be found on IDC's home
page. The address is http://www.idcresearch.com. Interested parties
are welcome to share views and insights with Frank Gens, senior VP
of research at IDC, via email at fgens@idcresearch.com. For more

Virtual Reality
Is No Illusion

Virtual reality (VR) has been identified as one of the 10 most
promising technologies currently under development.  This new
technology brings upon itself many problems, including the effect
science fiction has had on the perception of VR technology as well
as difficulties in defining the technology.  Nonetheless, there
remains a class of technology that can confidently be defined as
"virtual reality" and analyzed like any other emerging high tech
industry.  This technology is currently used on a routine basis in
a number of markets, and has the potential to enter many more.

At the end of 1995, over 300 companies will sell approximately $255
million worth of VR products and services.  By 2000, the VR
industry will be posting annual sales of over $1 billion and
reaching an annual average growth rate (AAGR) of 33%.  Although
about half of the 2000 market will go for home- and site- based
entertainment, VR products will be used by all facets of society,
including commercial/industrial, the government, military, and
university and secondary schools.

A comprehensive document from Business Communications Co., Inc.
entitled The Virtual Reality Business, reports that the
instructional and developmental market for VR is expected to grow
from a $95 million 1995 market figure to $355 million by 2000,
resulting in an AAGR of 31%.  This figure includes VR technology
that will be present in technical/engineering colleges and
universities, and the "developmental" VR includes spending on
advanced, but as yet non-commercial applications, along with pure
science and research systems not included in the other categories.

Applications of design and development VR market are in
engineering, architecture and chemical design and development.
This market will grow from a 1995 market value of $30 million, to
$150 million by 2000, reaching an AAGR of 40%.

Entertainment uses account for the largest VR market value, and are
expected to continue growing at a 35% AAGR to the year 2000.  A
mass-produced single-user entertainment VR system will be the
driving force behind the growth of this market growth, from a 1995
value of $110 million to $500 million by 2000.

Medical treatment VR market will also sustain growth.  The 1995
market value of $20 million is projected to reach $50 million by
2000, reaching a 20% AAGR.

Mid-IR Laser
Likes it Warm

A team of scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory and the
University of Houston Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (SVEC) has
developed a mid-infrared solid-state laser that operates at near
room temperature.

According to Shin-Shem Steven Pei, SVEC's associate director for
research (Tel: 713/ 743-3621, E-mail: spei@uh.edu), lasing was
observed at temperatures up to 285K. "This is by far the highest
operating temperature for an interband transition laser at this
wavelength," he explained. "We now have a device that works with a
compact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldy cryogenic
system, and room-temperature operation is just around the corner."

The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-II
quantum-well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4
microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVEC
and then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing the
material growth and device design for diode lasers that can produce
sufficient power at 3 to 5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVEC
scientists are also testing a more advanced quantum-cascade laser
design, which should produce higher-intensity light with less
electric current while emitting within either of two atmospheric
transmission windows of 3 to 5 microns and 8 to 12 microns.

Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,
medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicle
and air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covert
illumination for night vision, free-space communications, and IR
countermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly in
these windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.
This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhouse-
gas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical process
control, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IR
systems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compact
IR sources are available.

The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at much
shorter wavelengths. Long-distance telephone networks use 1.3 and
1.5 micron lasers in their optical fiber systems, and a 0.8 micron
beam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible light
ranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readily
absorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmission
windows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within the
windows are too bulky and expensive for most commercial
applications.

Display Panels Made
from Plastic Wrap

U.S. Patent 5,469,020 was issued on Nov. 21, 1995, to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a flexible large-screen
display that has multiple light-emitting elements sandwiched
between crossed electrodes.  The inventor is Bradley R. Herrick
(Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel: 617/981-3356).  The
resulting panels are especially well adapted to inexpensive flat-
panel TV screens or exceptionally large flat-panel displays whose
geometry is not limited to flat surfaces, but may take on curved or
cylindrical configurations.

The patent abstract explains that active light-emitting components
are integrated into a thin, flexible, plastic-wrap like film to
provide an exceptionally large continuous display in which the film
contains densely distributed light-emitting elements that are
addressed by a grid of transparent conductors.  Inexpensive bulk
processing techniques are used to produce plastic wrap with
embedded components completely through the film to permit
activation via a row-column matrix.  The displays are comprised of
a flexible film having two opposing sides and a pair of crossed
electrodes on either side of the film.  A number of light-emitting
elements are dispersed`ig the film and extend from one side of the
film to the other, sandwiched between the crossed electrodes.  The
light-emitting elements are small enough to permit numbers of the
elements to exist at a crossover.

The topological layout provides mass redundancy of components,
spatial decorrelation of component yields, and dramatic reduction
in registration problems of metallic interconnects.  The design can
be used for electroluminescent tape in automotive pin striping and
sign applications, for flexible glue-on displays, and for video
displays such as workstations, HDTV, theater screens, and
billboards.

Herrick explained that the patent is based on theory for the time
being, and that no working models currently exist.  He also said
that calculations indicate that the thinner the plastic the better,
and he would initially be working with films in the 10 to 100
micron thickness range.  The concept involves placing up to
hundreds of diodes in a single pixel, making the technology most
suitable to displays larger than 60 inches diagonally and scaleable
to even larger sizes.  He is currently assembling a production team
and says the only real problem is the same one faced industry-wide
-- blue diodes.

Interactive Holography
Will Be Evaluated

American Propylaea Corp. (555 S. Woodward, Birmingham, MI 48009;
Tel: 810/642-7000) has been awarded a $100,000 research contract by
the U.S. Air Force to evaluate the integration of interactive
holography in manufacturing.  James Fischbach, president and CEO,
reports that the contract represents Phase 1 of a projected 15-
phase $200 million project if Phase 1 is successful.  Phase 2 would
involve $750,000, and Phase 3 would be worth $5 million.

American Propylaea, which developed the worlds first full color
commercial hologram in 1993, scored a major breakthrough in 1994
when it achieved a 42 inch x 45 inch, full motion, true color
holographic display system, the largest yet developed.  Fischbach
predicts that holography will be a $5 billion per year business
within 10 years and identifies the automotive, entertainment,
medical, and retail markets as those with the greatest potential.

Fischbach says that interactive holography could make it possible
for automakers to cut design and development time by 50%, enabling
them to bring new car models to market in under 20 months, compared
with the present 42 months in the U.S. and 36 months in Japan.
Holography could also reduce the need for exploratory surgery and
assist in the training of surgeons, enabling them to view 3-D
information in free space in front of a monitor screen to help them
detect and locate abnormalities and rehearse operations.

Low Temperature
Growth Method

A chemist at Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO
63130) has discovered a new method to grow semiconductor crystals
at temperatures far lower than ever reported.  The method is the
first to use solution phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sized
crystals at low temperature.  The semiconductors made by the new
method may be used in devices such as light emitting diode (LED)
displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact disc players
and computer components.  The breakthrough offers intriguing
possibilities of developing integrated devices consisting of
semiconductors and polymers, plastics or composites.

Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combining
other materials with the semiconductors because of the very high
temperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currently
produced at temperatures of 500-1,200C, but the method William E.
Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, email: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu), associate
professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis, has
discovered allows growth at 200C.  Buhros technique, the
solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth method, is similar to the vapor-
liquid-solid (VLS) gas phase growth method which has been used for
some 30 years.

Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by the
nonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which do
not allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at low
temperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium and
indium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are the
sites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds indium
phosphide, gallium arsenide and indium arsenide (type III-V
semiconductors) nucleate and grow.

Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solid
mechanism, a three phase system where the chemistry occurs in
solution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited into
the liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizes
out as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is to
turn down the heat on solid state synthesis.  This new method
expands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.

Building a New Flat
Panel Video Screen

A researcher at the Dept. of Energy (DOE) Brookhaven National Lab
(Box 5000, Upton, NY 11973-5000) has invented a flat panel video
screen that uses lasers as a light source.  Uses of the device may
include video advertising displays, television, computers,
automotive dashboard and aircraft cockpit displays, as well as
portable military maps and wall-sized displays for home
entertainment.  Since the Brookhaven device has advantages in
brightness, contrast, and viewing angle over the new generation of
liquid crystal cockpit displays, the U.S. Air Force is funding
development of the flat panel device for use in its new planes.

In another project involving the new technology funded by the Dept.
of Defense (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA),
Brookhaven also is working on a 5 ft. plastic television screen for
military use.

The Clinton Administration has identified developing flat panel
displays as vital to the economic future of the U.S.  Brookhaven
engineer James Veligdan (Tel: 516/282-5400) invented the device and
developed the display screen prototype, which is 9 in. wide by 5
in. high and approximately 1 in. thick.  The new flat panel screen
has several advantages over current technologies.

Many video display systems now on the market use cathode ray tubes
(CRTs).  Although reliable, they are very large, heavy, and not
easily transportable.  Other than CRTs, the major current video
display technology is limited to liquid crystal displays (LCDs),
which are comparatively difficult and expensive to manufacture.

The Brookhaven technology works by directing light from a miniature
laser to a scanner, which guides the light beam into the proper
sector of laminated wave guides.  Composed of multiple sheets of
laminated borosilicate glass or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
plastic, the waveguides direct the light to the screen to display
the video image.

"The system is totally eye safe, high-contrast, and offers
exceptionally wide viewing angles.  Also, the screen can be used in
cold weather, whereas liquid crystals thicken and freeze as
temperatures dip below freezing.  The technology can be adapted to
display 3D images if the viewer wears polarized glasses.
Maintenance is easy and inexpensive, says Veligdan.

COMMISSION TO DECIDE ON NEW YORK PETITION ON PLAYGROUNDS

Deciding whether to deny a petition from the New York City Dept. of Consumer
Affairs for a mandatory standard on home playground equipment will be on the
CPSC commissioners' agenda for January 1996.  The commissioners will receive
agency staff recommendations on the petition suggestions that go beyond ASTM
standards.

Though there have been no injuries or deaths, the department wants to impose
its own standards that include requirements for handrails, surfacing, and
prohibiting more than one activity on the same playground apparatus.  The
department based its recommendations on a survey it conducted.  ASTM Chair
for Home Playground Equipment Terri Hendy told PSL she is not sure whether
the commissioners will go ahead with the New York petition and said her group
has been working on revising ASTM standards.

While ASTM standards require home playground sets to not be placed on con-
crete, asphalt or grass, 1996 revisions will go the extra mile by listing
acceptable surfaces such as 8-10 inches of pea gravel, sand or wood mulch.
Also, home daycare centers with 10 children or fewer will have to comply with
ASTM home playground equipment standards.
Hendy said the current standard does not address small home daycare centers.

Other standard modifications the group wants to beef up are guardrails for
elevated platforms, determining the level of force that can be sustained by a
head when a multiple occupancy swing strikes it, and swing set packaging
stating if anchoring is required and if an anchoring set is included.

CRACKING BIKE FRAMES LED TO BROKEN BONES AND RECALL

Mountain bicycle frames that can fracture in the front at the headlug led to
injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to broken bones and a recall.  Riders
are in danger of being thrown from the bike and can get injured or killed.

Raleigh is recalling 300 Technium MT 400 and 24 Technium FT 500 bicycle
frames that measure 16.5 inches from the center of the bottom of the frame to
the seat.  Bike shops and authorized Raleigh dealers sold the bicycles
nationwide from January 1993 through December 1993 for $500 to $700.  Raleigh
spokesman Pat McVey told PSL the firm initiated its own recall in May 1995
and contacted CPSC "in order to increase publicity."  CPSC compliance staffer
David Schmeltzer said firms are required under Section 15 of the Consumer
Product Safety Act to report faulty products and injuries to the agency.

Cracking mountain bicycle frames were also a problem for Cannondale, which
put stickers on all 1995 Cannondales reminding consumers to inspect their
bike frames for cracks (PSL, 1/30).  Schmeltzer said CPSC and other bike
firms have recalled bicycles for defective handlebars, suspension forks and
brakes.

Cosmic brand bicycle wheels made for road bikes by Mavic, S.A. of France and
its distribution facility in West Chester, Penn., were subjected to a Dec. 21
recall.  The firm discovered the front wheel hub may fracture and cause the
spokes to come loose resulting in the driver losing control.  Though there
were no injuries reported, Cosmic Marketing Manager Chris Zigmont said the
recall was necessary.

CPSC will continue examining generic problems of hybrid and mountain bikes.
"We are concerned," Schmeltzer said, adding the agency is trying to figure
out why there have been problems with hybrid and mountain bikes.  Schmeltzer
told PSL it could be due to the kind of use the bike is subjected to or that
they are not designed to withstand abuse.

BREAKING OFF SMALL PARTS ON TOY TRUCK LEAD TO RECALL

Toy truck's driver and wheels that can break off and present choking hazard
to young children have led to the recall of 44,000 wooden toy trucks from
Division Sales of Itasca, Ill.  A spokesman told PSL the company received a
letter from customs stating the problems were discovered during a routine
exam of imported goods.

The firm will not be purchasing any more trucks from the manufacturing
company in China and will destroy any trucks it does have.  Posters in stores
will warn consumers of the potential danger.  The trucks were sold nationwide
in 86 retail and dollar stores for $1 each from December 1993 through
December 1995.

The trucks measure 5 inches long by 2 inches wide and are packaged with a
small wooden driver figure in a blue cardboard box labeled "Wood
toy...engineering truck educational toy" and were sold in six different
styles:

** two styles of dump trucks
** cement truck
** truck with a large, wooden, rotating cylinder
** truck with crane
** truck with ladder

The spokesman said there have been no consumer complaints and "other nations
with less strict standards than the U.S. may still have these toy trucks on
their shelves."  Consumers will receive a full refund upon returning the
truck.

CPSC TO RECEIVE DATA ON BATTERY ONCE DEEMED FLAWED

CPSCers will be updated on a lithium battery that once suffered from
performance problems relating to shelf life and field failure, now addressed
by Ultralife of Newark, N.Y.  An Ultralife spokesman told PSL the firm plans
on talking to CPSC because "the battery has been getting so much attention."

The U9VL Lithium Battery has a shelf life of 10 years and is for commercial
and consumer use such as electronic parking meters, wireless security
systems, portable blood analyzers, ambulatory fuse pumps, remote controls,
digital thermometers, garage door openers, clock radios and smoke detectors.
The battery meets all UL safety requirements, carries the UL component
recognition mark and meets ANSI dimensional standards.

Ultralife promotes the battery as being able to handle extreme temperatures
better than any other 9-volt battery from -40xF to 140xF.  CPSCer Jim Hoebel
said Ultralife is the first battery company to seek CPSC's feedback about a
new battery and called it a "breakthrough product."

CARPET IRRITANT VERIFICATION SOUGHT VIA MOUSE STUDIES

CPSC has identified some 100 chemicals emitted by carpets and carpet padding.
The agency is doing animal testing to determine if those substances are
pulmonary and/or sensory irritants.  The work is not intended to replicate
studies done by Anderson Labs of Dedham, Mass., which showed that certain
carpet chemicals affected mice.  When the current mouse trials are done, CPSC
likely will assess chemicals' effect on humans.

CPSC met Dec. 15 with Air Quality Sciences, which also is testing carpets for
irritants, to discuss the timing and protocols for testing.  The agency
worked with the Environmental Protection Agency and industry in developing
protocols.

OVERHEATED CANDLE HOLDERS THAT CAN SHATTER RECALLED

Glass candle holders that can overheat and shatter have been recalled by
Godinger Silver Art of Brooklyn, N.Y.  Spokesman Abe Freund told PSL the firm
learned problem from a customer who called in a minor hand injury.  The firm
then tested the product in its lab and it failed.  Silver Art immediately
contacted CPSC and a recall notice was put out days later.  Freund said no
other injuries have been reported.

The "Tree Shaped 7 Light Votive Holder" measures 12.75 inches high and 13.75
inches wide at the base and was packaged with four green and three red small
glass pots that votive candles can be placed in.  Major retail department and
gift stores sold the candle holders nationwide from September 1995 through
December 1995 for $25 each.  About 19,000 silver-plated (item #1753) and
brass-plated (item #1753B) holders were recalled.

International Silver of Boston, Mass., also recalled the same product (item
#991194751) but sold it for $19 to $24 in nationwide in stores and on the
Home Shopping Network.  International Silver got seven reports of the glass
pots shattering including one in which the consumer's leg was injured.

SQUEAKER TOYS HELD UP BY CUSTOMS GET RECALLED

The Customs Service held up squeaker toys by Accoutrements of Seattle, Wash.,
from entering the U.S. since the squeaker device can separate from the toy
and pose a choking hazard for young children.  Accoutrements Assistant
Manager Stacey Jones said the firm has never received a complaint about the
toy in its five-year history and this was a "just in case" precaution the
firm decided to take.

The pickle toys sold for 35 cents from August 1991 through November 1995 while
the $2.50 kangaroo toys sold from May 1990 through November 1995 in retail,
toy, museum, chain and drug stores nationwide.  Squeak Pickles toy item S877
were sold individually from bags of 12 labeled in part "***The Coral
Line***Accoutrements***Not for children under three*** made in China."  The
green rubber pickles each measure 3.5 inches long.

Squeak Kangaroo and baby kangaroo toys, item 9394, were sold as a set and
labelled in part "**Great Motherhood***For ages three and up***Squeaking***
Kangaroo***Made in China***S.D.S. toys***."  The gray and black kangaroo is 5
inches while the baby kangaroo is 1.5 inches and fits in the kangaroo's
pouch.

TOO MANY LEAF BLOWER WARRANTEE CLAIMS ALERT RECALL

Too many customer warrantee claims for leaking leaf blower fuel tanks alerted
Tanaka America of Kent, Wash., to recall 11,000 Tanaka and Ariens leaf
blowers due to potential fire hazards.  A Tanaka America spokesman told PSL
that no injuries or complaints were reported, but the firm wanted to forge
ahead with recalling models TBL-455, TBL-500 and BB-430.  The $400 to $460
blower sold nationwide from January 1986 to December 1992.

The Japan-made leaf blower is mounted on a metal backpack frame with padded
shoulder straps, an orange fuel tank and black blower tube with name and
model numbers of the manufacturer are printed in the center of the blower's
fuel tank or on the recoil starter.

The Tanaka spokesman said he was not sure how many blowers were on the market
but that the firm is notifying consumers from its warrantee card files.
Customers are being told to make returns to any authorized Tanaka service
dealer for a free fuel tank replacement.  Only new and improved leaf blowers
are being manufactured.

RATTLES BY GYMBOREE RECALLED FOR CHOKING HAZARD

Rattles that can come apart and release a small bell and wooden pieces have
been recalled by Gymboree of Burlingame, Calif., because they could pose
choking hazards to young children.  Over 2,800 "GymRattles" infant rattles
sold from July 26 to November.

The wooden rattle is 4.5 inches long and has a circular wooden handle, and
multi-colored, cylinder-shaped cage with a small silver bell inside.  The
rattle's hang tag reads in part "GYMBOREE...GymRattle...Crafted in solid
maple wood...Recommended for ages 3 to 18 months."

The rattles sold nationwide at over 240 Gymboree stores for $8 each.
Gymboree representative, George Rodriguez, told PSL the rattle problem was
discovered by one of Gymboree's retail stores and reported to CPSC
immediately.

Though no consumer complaints were reported the firm decided to conduct the
recall to prevent any possibility of injury.  Rodriguez said Gymboree is
mostly known for its children's apparel, and the rattles make up a minute
part of the business.  The firm has asked consumers to return the rattles to
the place of purchase for a full refund.

CELLULAR PHONE CHARGERS CAN POSE ELECTRICAL SHOCK

Cellular phone charger plug prongs that can loosen and become lodged in
electrical outlets pose electrical shock hazards when consumers try removing
the prongs from the outlet.  No injuries have been reported.

Mascot Electronic of Fredrikstad, Norway, is recalling 65,800 ACH-4U cellular
phone chargers used with Nokia phones.  Nokia had received reports that the
charger's plastic cover can crack, thus leading to the plug prongs located on
the charger's back becoming loosened.  The recall applies to chargers with
date codes 9531 through 9546.  "Made in Norway," model number and date code
appear on the label affixed to the charger.

The rectangular, black, plastic charger is three inches long, 2.5 inches
wide, one inch tall and has grooves on the side.  The chargers were sold na-
tionwide from July to November under the brand names Nokia and AT&T.  Phone
dealers sold the chargers separately or as part of a basic sales package.
Mascot manufactured the chargers for Nokia.

HONG KONG PASSES NEW CONSUMER SAFETY REGULATIONS

Consumer goods in Hong Kong now will have to be "reasonably safe" under the
October 1995 Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance.  Hong Kong's Secretary for
Trade and Industry is responsible for approving safety standards and has the
authority to ban unsafe products from the marketplace.  Those violating the
new law face fines or jail.

Hong Kong's Commissioner of Customs and Excise can require responsible
parties to issue a public notice, preventing the parties from supplying or
selling unsafe products.  The commissioner can also order involved parties to
initiate a recall.

Though labs must be approved by the director general of industry, those
accredited under the Hong Kong Laboratory Scheme (HOKLAS) can issue test
certificates that demonstrate compliance with applicable standards.  Relevant
test certificates can also be issued if the lab has a memorandum of

EXTENDED PETITION PERIOD FOR CHILD RESTRAINT SEATS

Makers of portable child restraint systems will have until Sept. 1, 1996, to
comply with new size and weight requirements for test dummies.  The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the deadline should
provide needed leadtime for firms to make necessary design changes to conform
to the new requirements.

In July 1995, a final rule amending Standard 213 added three dummies to child
restraint testing including a newborn infant, 9-month-old and 6-year-old.
The 6-month-old dummy has been removed from future testing.

NHTSA deems the new testing provisions as a more thorough evaluation of child
restraint performance.  Petitions for reconsideration should be sent to
Administrator, Room 5220, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400
Seventh Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 by Jan. 11.  For nonlegal issues,
contact George Mouchachoir at 202/366-4919, and for legal issues contact
Deirdre Fujita at 202/366-2992.

          One result of the recent intense focus on the budget

          One result of the recent intense focus on the budget
battle has been that Congress has yet to pass some bills
not directly associated with the budget dispute.  The
telecommunications bill, which includes the Exon
amendment criminalizing the use of indecent language on
the Internet, probably will not be voted on for another
several weeks.  Public interest advocates are trying to
use that time to lobby against the Exon amendment.
Recent incidents such as the shutdown of access to Usenet
groups by Compuserve at the behest of German prosecutors
may play in favor of those critical of government
intervention.  As access advocate Jim Warren noted: "When
other nations' enforcers choose to inflict their
prejudices and dogmas on the global communications net,
perhaps American leaders may finally understand the
danger of what Congress is attempting with its `decency'
demands on all private and public speech and expression
if aided by any telecommunications device."

Agency Can't Glomarize Where
Disclosure May Be in Public Interest

          In a case that places some important restrictions on
an agency's ability to categorically deny the existence
of information pertaining to individuals, the D.C.
Circuit has ruled that the Customs Service acted
improperly when it told Max Holland of the Nation that it
would neither confirm or deny that it had records
concerning offers by H. Ross Perot to help the Service
with drug interdiction activities.  Circuit Court Judge
Pat Wald, writing for the court, observed that "although
Reporters Committee and the precedent of this circuit
make clear that FOIA extends only to those records which
reveal something about agency action, the mere fact that
records pertain to an individual's activities does not
necessarily qualify them for exemption.  Such records may
still be cloaked with the public interest if the
information would shed light on agency action."

          Wald pointed out that District Court Judge Charles
Richey had erred when he concluded that Holland's request
pertained only to the activities of a private citizen.
Wald noted that "as the language of the contested request
indicates, it would be disingenuous to suggest that
appellants are not interested in the actions of Perot.
Unlike the private activities in Reporters Committee and
the cases. . .from our own circuit, however, what makes
Perot's activities significant is their connection to
agency conduct.  Appellants want to find out whether
Perot offered to help a federal agency fulfill its
statutory duties to interdict drugs, and if so, how that
agency responded to his overtures.  Although Perot
himself may be a target of their investigative work,
appellants also expressed interest in the `privatization
of government functions,' particularly operations which
are covertly funded.  The district court acknowledged as
much, in stating that appellants sought to determine
whether `Customs planned to privatize certain components
of the nation's drug interdiction efforts.'  These
concerns are about `agency activity,' not just Perot's
private activities.  As such, their disclosure may serve
the public's interest in knowing `what their government
is up to.'"

          Because the Nation had identified a public interest
in the records, Wald found that Customs' use of a Glomar
response was inappropriate because it swept too broadly.
"Because the range of circumstances included in Customs'
categorical rule do not `characteristically support' an
inference that all material in law enforcement files
which names a particular individual is exempt from
disclosure to third parties, a more particularized
approach is required."  Wald noted that one alternative
was for Customs to adjust its categorical rule.  "Customs
is. . .free to articulate a revised categorical rule
regarding disclosure of law enforcement records if it can
identify more narrowly tailored circumstances under which
the balance of privacy and public interest
characteristically tips in the direction of exemption."

          The court clarified its earlier decision in Safecard
Services v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197 (D.C. Cir. 1991), by
reining in its application.   In Safecard Services, the
court had established a categorical exemption for names
of third parties in law enforcement records unless the
information was needed to "confirm or refute compelling
evidence that the agency is engaged in illegal activity."
Wald wrote that "to the extent any information contained
in 7(C) investigatory files would reveal the identities
of individuals who are subjects, witnesses, or informants
in law enforcement investigations, those portions of
responsive records are categorically exempt from
disclosure under Safecard.  But we do not read Safecard
as permitting an agency to exempt from disclosure all of
the material in an investigatory record solely on the
grounds that the record includes some information which
identifies a private citizen or provides that person's
name and address.  Because such a blanket exemption would
reach far more broadly than is necessary to protect the
identities of individuals mentioned in law enforcement
files, it would be contrary to FOIA's overall purpose of
disclosure, and thus is not a permissible reading of
Exemption 7(C)."

          An individual's privacy expectation could also be
tempered by their voluntary disclosure of their role
documented in government files.  Wald noted that "Perot
himself has made several public statements indicating
that he has offered to aid the federal government in
hostage rescue and drug interdiction operations.
Redaction of Perot's name from any responsive documents
in the [Customs' investigatory] files that involve the
subject matter of those disclosures, if those records are
not otherwise exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(C)
or other exemptions set forth in [Exemption 7], would not
serve any useful purpose in protecting his privacy.
Perot's decision to bring information connecting himself
with such efforts into the public domain differentiates
his privacy interest from the interest of unnamed
Safecard witnesses who did not voluntarily divulge their
identities; these public disclosures effectively waive
Perot's right to redaction of his name from documents on
events that he has publicly discussed."

          The court also found that Customs' search had been
inadequate.  Although Holland's request asked for records
indexed or cross-indexed under Perot's name, "it also
explicitly seeks information `pertaining to' Perot and
information regarding offers by Perot to assist Customs
in drug interdiction efforts. . . Accordingly,
appellants' request should be interpreted to include
subject matter files on topics of interest to appellants,
in addition to files indexed under Perot's name or
personal identifier."  Wald noted that "if we agreed with
the agency's position that appellants sought only those
records indexed under Perot's name, we might find this
search adequate.  But we have construed the scope of
appellants' request more broadly than did Customs, to
include `subject matter files.'  Customs did not describe
its recordkeeping system in sufficient detail to permit
us to identify what subject matter files, other than
those in the Privacy Act System of Records, might hold
responsive information regarding Perot's offers to help
Customs with its drug interdiction efforts.  In the
absence of this information, the agency's assertions are
too conclusory to allow de novo review of the adequacy of
its search."  (The Nation Magazine, Washington Bureau and
Max Holland v. United States Customs Service, No. 94-
5275, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit, Dec. 8, 1995)

Arkansas

Arkansas

          The supreme court has ruled that the Arkansas
Department of Human Services did not violate the
Administrative Procedure Act or the FOIA when it awarded
a contract to provide obstetrical services under a
federal waiver program.  National Park Medical Center, an
unsuccessful bidder on the contract, claimed that staff
meetings held to develop the bid solicitation violated
the open meetings requirements of the FOIA.  The court
disagreed, noting that such meetings were not the type
covered by the statute.  The court also found that
National Park failed to bring the alleged violation to
the attention of the agency before filing its court
action.  (National Park Medical Center, Inc. v. Arkansas
Department of Human Services, No. 95-411, Supreme Court
of Arkansas, Dec. 4, 1995)

Illinois

          A court of appeals has ruled that a political body
has standing to bring a suit under the Open Meetings Act,
but that the mayor of the City of Northlake failed to
file his suit against the Board of Education of School
District No. 87 within the statutory time limits.  Based
on a series of critical letters between the school board
and the mayor, the school board met in closed session --
allegedly to discuss employment matters -- to draft a
letter to the mayor in response to his recent letters.
Several months later, the mayor sued the school board for
improperly conducting a closed meeting.  On the matter of
standing, the court observed that "we find no compelling
reasons to limit the word `person' [in the Open Meetings
Act] to an individual as opposed to a body politic.
Indeed, creating an impediment to the explicit command of
the statute that actions of public bodies be taken
openly, solely on the basis that a political body is not
an individual person, ill serves the intent of the
legislature and frustrates the principles underlying the
Act.  The deterrence of official misconduct is no less
important simply because it is the office of the mayor
which challenges the infraction rather than the mayor in
his or her individual capacity."  But the court agreed
that the mayor had missed the 45-day deadline for filing
the suit.  The mayor argued that his suit was covered by
a special provision allowing a suit to be filed 45 days
after the state's attorney discovered the violation
because he had informed the state's attorney prior to
filing the suit.  The court rejected that claim, noting
that "if, as contemplated by plaintiffs, any person could
file suit as late as 45 days after the State's Attorney's
discovery of a violation the Act, then the 45-day
limitation period from the date of the meeting is
rendered superfluous."  The court added that "to allow
that same person to file suit in his or her own name
solely upon notification to the State's Attorney would,
no doubt, condone dilatory practices.  In fact, it would
confer upon persons other than the State's Attorney the
opportunity to delay filing an action ad infinitum by
simply not notifying the State's Attorney of the alleged
violation until some future date."  (Reid M. Paxson,
Mayor of the City of Northlake, v. Board of Education of
School District No. 87, Cook County, Illinois, No. 1-94-
4294, Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, Fifth
Division, Dec. 8, 1995)

Indiana

          A court of appeals has ruled that research
applications for projects involving the use of animals
are protected under an exception to the Public Records
Act pertaining to research.  The court noted that "the
application seeks information about the researcher, the
nature of the proposed or ongoing research project, and
procedures to be employed throughout the project.  The
sole subject matter of the application is a research
project and related personnel and procedures.  Even in
the narrowest sense, the information sought by the
application concerns research.  As such, it was not
subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act."
(Scott Robinson, M.D. v. Indiana University, etal., No.
49A02-9306-CV-253, Court of Appeals of Indiana, Second
District, Dec. 11, 1995)

New York

          The Court of Appeals has ruled that a list of
textbooks for courses at the State University of New York
at Farmingdale are agency records even though they are
created and maintained by a contractor.  The case
involved requests from Encore College Bookstores, a
competitor to the university-subsidized bookstore which
was run under contract by Barnes & Noble.  Encore had
initially gotten a copy of the textbook list from the
University, but after Barnes & Noble said its business
had dropped as a result, the University stopped keeping
a copy of the list.  The list was compiled by Barnes &
Noble, which gathered the information through inquiries
to professors each semester.  Both the trial court and an
appellate court had ruled that the lists were not subject
to disclosure because they were not agency records, but
the Court of Appeals disagreed.  It pointed out that the
function of the Auxiliary Service Corporation, which
operated the bookstore, was "to supply these essential
services -- including the campus bookstore -- for SUNY.
ASC's acts in discharging this delegated duty, then, are
performed on SUNY's behalf."  Applying this to the
circumstances, the court noted that "because ASC receives
a copy of the booklist compiled by its subcontractor,
Barnes & Noble, to ensure that the campus bookstore is
adequately maintained, it does so for the benefit of
SUNY, a government agency.  In other words, the booklist
information is `kept' or `held' by ASC `for an agency'.
Thus, the information falls within the unambiguous
definition of the term `records' under the [Freedom of
Information Law]."  The University urged the court to
apply the more restrictive federal standard, which, as
interpreted, requires custody and control of records.
But in rejecting that definition, the Court pointed out
that "to do so would undermine the legislative objective
to provide maximum disclosure by enabling a government
agency to insulate its records from public access by
delegating responsibility for creating or maintaining
particular information to a non-governmental entity."
However, the court went on to find that the list was
protected as commercial business information.  It noted
that "the booklist has obvious commercial value to Encore
since it would enable Encore to offer the precise
inventory that its target clientele -- SUNY-Farmingdale
students -- is required to purchase and that is currently
offered by  Barnes & Noble. . .The likelihood of harm to
Barnes & Noble is enhanced by the economic windfall
conferred upon Encore were it to receive the booklist at
the mere cost of FOIL fees.  The information in the
booklist, accumulated by virtue of the effort and expense
of Barnes & Noble, is also directly available to Encore.
Disclosure through FOIL, however, would enable Encore to
obtain the requisite information without expending its
resources, thereby reducing its cost of business and
placing Barnes & Noble at a competitive disadvantage."
(In the Matter of Encore College Bookstores, Inc. v.
Auxiliary Service Corporation of the State University of
New York at Farmingdale, No. 304, Court of Appeals of New
York, Dec. 27, 1995)

          The Court of Appeals has ruled that litigants who
prevail in exposing egregious violations of the Open
Meetings Law should be awarded attorney's fees as a
matter of course.  Ruling in a case in which the Board of
Trustees of the Village of Monticello decided at a closed
meeting to play "musical chairs" with their jobs --
rotating various village positions among themselves --
and then affirmed their prearranged plan at a subsequent
open meeting, the Court of Appeals explained that "on
this record, denial of a request for attorneys' fees
would constitute an abuse of discretion. . ."  The court
rejected the concept that attorney's fees were
appropriate only for repeated violations of the statute,
noting that "it is inconceivable that the Legislature had
only such recidivist offenders in mind when it vested
trial judges with the authority to award costs and fees
in the first place.  In fact, it is very often the
possibility of recovering costs and attorneys' fees that
gives private citizens like plaintiffs the impetus they
need to bring meritorious lawsuits to enforce the Open
Meetings Law thus advancing the statutory policy of
keeping New Yorkers better apprised of the actions of
their elected officials."  (In the Matter of Victor W.
Gordon v. Village of Monticello, Inc., No. 276, Court of
Appeals of New York, Dec. 7, 1995)

          An appellate court has ruled that the Department of
Transportation improperly withheld contract proposals
even after the contract had been awarded.  The court
noted that the winning proposal "did not include any
intra-agency confidential information which would assist
in DOT's negotiations."  It added that "once the contract
was awarded, the terms of [the winning bidder's] RFP
response could no longer be competitively sensitive.  DOT
implicitly recognized the validity of petitioner's
modified request by releasing a redacted version of [the
winning] RFP response."  The court pointed out that the
department raised the trade secrets exemption for the
first time at the appellate level, claiming that it had
no time to do so at the trial court level.  But the court
noted that "respondents, however, offer no explanation
for why DOT did not raise this exemption when it gave the
redacted version to the petitioner.  In our view, DOT
should, at that point, have given an explanation for
providing a limited version. . .Simply, this record does
not provide any basis to support respondents' position
that there was no opportunity for them to set forth the
argument that there was a trade secret exemption."  (In
the Matter of Cross-Sound Ferry Services, Inc. v.
Department of Transportation, No. 73187, Supreme Court of
New York, Appellate Division, Third Department, Dec. 7,
1995)

          An appellate court has ruled that the Saratoga
Economic Development Corporation is not a public agency
subject to the FOIL.  Although the town provided 50
percent of the Corporation's revenues, the court found
that the Corporation was not similar to the Buffalo
Enterprise Development Corporation which the Court of
Appeals had earlier ruled was a public agency.  The
appellate court noted that the Saratoga Corporation was
"an independent entity formed by private businessmen to
further their own interests. . .It has never been
furnished offices at County expense; no County employee
has ever served on its board; it receives some of its
funding from private individuals and corporations; and it
is not subject to most of the financial controls exerted
over the [Buffalo Corporation].  Significantly, while the
Court of Appeals found that the BEDC described itself as
an `agent' of the City, and that a substantial portion of
its activities consisted of the administration of loan
programs and, concomitantly, the disbursement of funds on
behalf of the City, respondent does none of these things;
rather it has simply contracted with the County on a fee-
for-service basis, much as any other independent business
entity might."  (In the Matter of Farms First v. Saratoga
Economic Development Corporation, No. 73053, Supreme
Court of New York, Appellate Division, Third Department,
Dec. 14, 1995)

Ohio

          A court of appeals has ruled that drafts of proposed
changes to the collective bargaining sections of the Ohio
Code which were prepared by or received by the Office of
Collective Bargaining must be disclosed.  The court noted
that there was no exemption for the draft records and
rejected the agency's suggestion that it adopt a
deliberative process privilege.  The court pointed out
that "even if respondents' public policy arguments may
have some merit, the legislature expresses Ohio public
records law and that statute permits no exemption for a
pre-decisional or deliberative privilege.  The General
Assembly has done all of the balancing needed in public
records law; public policy arguments should not sway our
interpretation."  (State of Ohio ex rel. District 1199,
The Health Care and Social Service Union, SEIU, AFL-CIO
v. Stephen Gulyassy, Deputy Director, No. 95APD01-26,
Court of Appeals of Ohio, Tenth Appellate District,
Franklin County, Dec. 12, 1995)

Wyoming

          After federal courts have largely shut down union
access to payrolls of federal projects to be used for
monitoring compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act, the
Wyoming Supreme Court has made clear that such records
are subject to disclosure under state law.  The
Department of Transportation argued there was no public
interest in disclosure, but the court disagreed, noting
that "the [plaintiffs] demonstrate the information can be
used to audit WTD's, the [Federal Highway
Administration's], and contractors' efforts to comply
both with federal requirements for a prevailing wage
rate, as well as with Wyoming's parallel statutory
requirements.  For that reason alone, any countervailing
interest of the workers in their privacy is outweighed by
a public interest."  The court rejected the claim that
disclosure was an invasion of privacy.  It explained that
"the argument relies almost entirely on construction of
a federal exemption which is not found in Wyoming's
public records act.  However, we are persuaded the record
makes no suggestion that affected employees have
complained about the potential of such a release, nor
would it be likely such complaints, if made, could
overcome the mandate of the public records act to release
information.  This is especially so because the workers
have already released their names and addresses to the
contractor, who has in turn released them to the State of
Wyoming, who has in turn released that information to the
federal government.  There is no indication in the record
that if the [plaintiffs] did contact the workers at their
homes that such would be significantly disruptive of
their privacy.  The record simply does not provide any
basis for denying release of the contested information."

Union of Operating Engineers Local Union 800, No. 95-47
and No. 95-48, Supreme Court of Wyoming, Dec. 22, 1995)

        Ontario Government Proposes Changes to FOI,

        Ontario Government Proposes Changes to FOI,
                  Privacy Statutes

          Ontario entered the world of access and privacy in
the latter 1980s with a carefully constructed statute
that combined access and privacy.  The statute created
the Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner and
was generally seen as one of the most progressive
statutes of its kind.  While Ontario has had its share of
knotty problems under the statute, the law has generally
stood the test of time and the Office of the Information
and Privacy Commissioner has emerged as a leader in its
thoughtful and capable implementation and analysis of the
statute.  But Ontario recently underwent a sweeping
change in political direction and now it seems almost
certain that the Freedom of Information and Protection of
Privacy Act and the Municipal Freedom of Information and
Protection of Privacy Act will be subjected to major
structural changes in the name of more efficient
government.

          An omnibus bill, the centerpiece of the province's
new "Common Sense Revolution," was introduced in the
legislature in late November and was slated for approval
by mid-December, all with very little legislative or
public debate.  However, after a sit-in by opposition
members, public hearings were scheduled.  The legislative
committee considering the omnibus bill was divided in
half, with one half dealing solely with healthcare
amendments and the other half dealing with everything
else.

          The amendments to the freedom of information and
protection of privacy statutes introduce the concept of
an application fee for the first time.  While the federal
Access to Information Act has always included a $5
application fee, the provincial acts have largely treated
such fees as barriers to access and have never provided
for them.  However the new fees, which will be set by
regulation, will apply not only to general information,
but to personal information as well, blurring the
distinction that is made in the federal acts where
personal information requests are not subject to an
application fee.  In another break with tradition, the
amendments will also require an application fee for
appealing an agency's determination to the Office of the
Information and Privacy Commissioner.  The amendments
will also increase fees for search time, costs of
preparing a record for disclosure, and computer and other
costs associated with locating, retrieving, processing,
and copying a record; the amendments also provide for
shipping costs and any other costs incurred in responding
to a request.

          The final significant change will allow agencies to
refuse requests that are considered frivolous or
vexatious.  While multiple or large-scale requests have
sometimes been seen by agencies as frivolous and
vexatious, Information and Privacy Commissioner Tom
Wright ruled this past summer directly on the issue as a
way of setting some guidelines for making such
determinations.  While Wright had decided that the issue
needed addressing on its own merits, part of the
rationale for dealing with the issue was to provide
guidance which would result in consistent treatment of
such requests.  While Wright realized that one agency's
idea of what constituted a frivolous request could well
be another requester's idea of a perfectly legitimate
inquiry, he carefully restrained his decision to deal
with those instances where the request was a clear abuse
of process.  Part of the fear that such determinations
can be made on an agency-by-agency basis is the potential
that such determinations might be abused for no more
legitimate a reason than that the agency did not want to
incur the time or cost involved in responding to a
request.  The new amendment allows a requester whose
request has been rejected as being frivolous or vexatious
to appeal to the Commissioner; ironically, such appeals
will be free.

          While many governments, including the U.S.
government and many state governments, are in the throes
of budget-cutting battles, Ontario is the first
jurisdiction where freedom of information and privacy
protections have been singled out for reductions early in
the game.   On the federal level in the U.S.,
implementation of such statutes has often been given low
priority and agencies struggle with inadequate budgets
and staff, but Congress has not moved to trim them as
statutory rights.  If the current Ontario government
actually views these potential changes as a way to
increase revenues, experience shows clearly that such a
goal is very unlikely.  The nearly certain result of the
proposed changes will be to lower the number of requests,
which, in turn, may save institutions money if their
workloads become small enough that staff can be let go or
moved to another office.  The addition of an application
fee for personal information is likely to impact the
privacy rights of individuals to an even greater extent
than will application fees for information requested by
subject matter.  Not only will individuals pay a fee to
access their personal information, other related rights,
particularly the right of correction or amendment, will
be affected as well.  Since most individuals will not
know if their files are incorrect until they have
actually seen them, corrections will occur only after
access is made pursuant to the new fee regulations.
Since this aspect of fair information practices is based
on the assumption that individuals are in a position to
be most knowledgeable about the accuracy of their
personal information and most concerned about ensuring
accuracy, the entire system is premised on the ability of
individuals to access their files.  Roadblocks
represented by fees may undermine that premise.

          While access advocates are fond of making the
connection between principles of participatory democracy,
freedom of speech and press, and the need for citizen
access to government information, no court has ever quite
made that leap of faith.  But that doesn't mean the
connection doesn't exist.  When governments take measures
that denigrate the ability of citizens to inquire about
their government for no other reason than to save money
or make government more "efficient," that government has
put a pricetag on that aspect of democracy.  Such actions
are likely to have two results.  The first is that fewer
people will participate in the scheme of access and
debate on a societal level will be incrementally more
uninformed.  The other result of fees in such statutes is
to further exacerbate the chasm between economic haves
and economic have-nots.  Those entities, primarily
business, which can easily absorb the fees and realize
that government information is still a bargain in the
commercial market will continue to access government
information and reap the potential benefits.  Those who
are driven by grassroots activism or mere personal
curiosity will begin to drop out of the race or at least
think twice before plunging ahead with a request.  If
information is truly power, the fostering of divisions
along economic, class or political lines ultimately has
consequences that resonate throughout a democratic
society.

ACCESS REPORTS/FREEDOM OF INFORMATION via NewsNet
January 3, 1996

          The D.C. Circuit has ruled that the Secret Service

          The D.C. Circuit has ruled that the Secret Service
properly withheld records concerning the breakup of a
meeting of computer hackers at the Pentagon City Mall by
mall security under Exemption 7(C) (invasion of privacy
concerning law enforcement records) and Exemption 7(D)
(confidential sources). However, it told the Secret
Service to show that the sources had been promised
confidentiality.  Although the agency said it routinely
treated source information as confidential, the court
pointed out that "the manner in which an agency
`routinely' handles information is not sufficient to
establish an implied assurance of confidentiality as to
any particular source."  It then noted that "the Service
offered no evidence that a fear of retaliation by hackers
is sufficiently widespread to justify an inference that
sources of information relating to computer crimes expect
their identities and the information they provide to be
kept confidential."  The agency was able to establish
that at least one source had explicitly requested
confidentiality.  Ironically, it wasn't until the D.C.
Circuit issued its opinion that the plaintiffs --
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility -- even
knew there was more than one source.   As to 7(C), the
court took a hardline position that virtually any mention
of an individual in law enforcement records gave rise to
a privacy expectation.  CPSR pointed out that "the
records also contain information relating to individuals
who attended the meeting of the 2600 Club" and argued
that "the exemption does not authorize the Service to
withhold this information because, it its view, no stigma
could attach to persons who `were engaged in wholly
lawful activity and were peaceably assembled in a public
place.'"  But the court disagreed, noting that "even if
we were to assume that the Service's records contain such
information and even if those individuals were not
suspects, their public identification with a meeting that
reportedly attracted the attention of law enforcement
officials would subject them to a degree of interest that
would impinge upon their privacy.  We conclude, then,
that Exemption 7(C) permits the Service to withhold the
names and identifying information of persons appearing in
its records so long as their privacy interest in not
being connected in any way with a criminal investigation
outweighs the public interest in disclosure."  (Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility v. United States
Secret Service, No. 94-5247, U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, Jan. 2)


          A federal judge in Maine has rejected the rationale
of Dismukes v. Dept. of the Interior and has ruled that
digitized data maintained by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration for use in electronic charting
systems was an agency record subject to disclosure.  NOAA
had argued that it was not obligated to provide the
digitized data because its paper-format charts were
already available and contained the same information.
But Judge D. Brock Hornby, wondered why "if the materials
are subject to disclosure in some format (here, the paper
charts), then why not in any other format in which they
also exist?"  He provided the agency's answer: "Expense
and inconvenience to the agency are the obvious answers,"
but noted that "Congress seems to have addressed these
concerns by providing specific measures for cost
recovery."  Noting that the Supreme Court in Dept. of
Justice v. Tax Analysts had held that agency records may
be withheld only if they are subject to an exemption,
Hornby added that "the paper charts -- information the
human eye can decode -- and the binary number strings --
instructions a computer can decode to generate an image
of a chart on a monitor -- are both agency records.  They
also each add information to the underlying raw data
about depths, shoals, buoy locations, etc., in order to
make the data more easily usable -- by eye, the mind, or
the computer.  Nothing in the FOIA excuses an agency from
disclosing a particular record because it has disclosed
the content elsewhere in a different format."  (Delorme
Publishing Company v. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration of the United States, Department of
Commerce, Civil Action No. 95-94-P-H, U.S. District Court
for the District of Maine, Dec. 11, 1995)


          The Eighth Circuit has ruled that a district court
judge improperly dismissed Jack Urban's FOIA suit for a
copy of a polygraph test he took administered by the
Kansas Bureau of Investigation and provided to the U.S.
Attorney for Kansas.  The lower court dismissed the case
based on the government's claim that it could not find
the record.  The court of appeals noted that "when a
government agency claims that it does not possess or
control a requested document, the agency must show it
fully discharged its statutory obligations by `conducting
a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant
documents.'  Thus, when the question is whether a
requested document exists, or is outside the government's
possession or control, an FOIA action is not moot, and
dismissal prior to service will almost never be
appropriate."  The court said that the response of the
Assistant U.S Attorney for Kansas that he could not
locate the records in the files of the U.S. Attorney's
office was not adequate.  The court noted that "Urban has
now spent nearly eighteen months seeking a copy of
seemingly innocuous test results.  His early requests got
no response or a cryptic brush off.  He has never been
told why he is not entitled to the documents.  And his
attempt to invoke, FOIA, a statute intended to foster
greater access to government records, has instead
fostered more paper shuffling and lame excuses."
Remanding the case to district court, the court of
appeals noted that "there may be a legitimate reason why
Urban is not entitled to the materials he requests, but
none appears in this record."  (Jack Urban v. United
States of America; Kansas Bureau of Investigation, No.
95-2386, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,
Dec. 27, 1995)


          A federal judge in New York has given the FBI a year
to respond to Wayne Pray's request.  Noting that the FBI
had a backlog of 14,055 cases as of May, 1995, Judge
Sidney Stein also indicated that there were at least
1,616 requests ahead of Pray's and that the agency was
processing requests at the rate of 19 per month.  Noting
that this would mean Pray's request would be completed in
seven years, Stein observed that "it seems inconceivable
that defendants would be requesting this Court to stay
Pray's request for seven years.  Therefore this Court is
prepared to assume that defendants' declaration contains
a typographical error, that the average of 19 cases per
month is actually 190 cases per month and that defendants
should therefore be able to comply with Pray's request in
approximately 9 months.  Because of the difficulty in
estimating time, this Court will grant defendants' motion
for a stay until December 31, 1996 or until Pray's
request is responded to, whichever is sooner."  (Wayne
Pray v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Civil Action No.
95-0380 (SHS), U.S District Court for the Southern
District of New York, Dec. 27, 1995)


          A federal court in New York has accepted a
magistrate's recommendation and found that the FBI
properly withheld records concerning the murder of Pedro
Bueno and the whereabouts of the plaintiff's wife and two
daughters.  The only record disclosed to Devernon Le
Grand was a letter from the Director of the FBI to the
National Center for Analysis of Violent Crime field
office in New York informing it that a Violent Crime
Apprehension Program (VICAP) report had been submitted
for Bueno.  In withholding the report under Exemption
7(C) (invasion of privacy concerning law enforcement
records) and Exemption 7(D) (confidential sources), the
magistrate noted that there was no public interest in the
VICAP report, but that "the administration of VICAP,
which seeks to assist state and local law enforcement
agencies in their investigations of unsolved violent
homicides, clearly involves concerns of potential
harassment of personnel and interference with law
enforcement efforts."  As to 7(D), the magistrate
observed that "the VICAP Report for Pedro Bueno was
submitted by the New York State Police to the FBI under
circumstances which support an inference of
confidentiality.  It consists of information concerning
the investigation by the New York State Police of the
Pedro Bueno homicide.  It is reasonable to infer that a
state law enforcement agency would not turn over to the
FBI all of its investigative information on an unsolved
homicide if the information were not to be treated as
confidential by the FBI."  (Devernon Le Grand v. Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Civil Action No. 94-0300, U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York,
Nov. 29, 1995)


          Judge Louis Oberdorfer has ruled that the FBI
properly invoked a series of exemptions and conducted
adequate searches in most instances in responding to a
request from Jeffrey Steinberg.  However, Oberdorfer
found that some searches were inadequate, noting that the
Charlotte and New York offices had not justified their
search for a Terrorist Photograph Album.  He pointed out
that the agency failed to address Steinberg's contention
that the album should be searched.  He noted that
"plaintiff has identified a particular document, the TPA,
that is likely to contain any responsive information that
exists . . .In this case, defendant has failed to meet
its burden of showing that its search was reasonable."
As for the search of the Richmond office for records
concerning the Dan Bar Farm, Oberdorfer noted that the
agency had alluded to a resident agent in Radford, VA,
who had information about the farm; however, the agency
told the court there was no Radford agent.  But Steinberg
produced a document from an Alexandria agent stating that
an agent under Richmond's supervision had information
about the farm.  Steinberg suggested the agency contact
the Alexandria agent and find out who the "missing" agent
was.  Although the agency claimed to do so would be
tantamount to conducting research, Oberdorfer noted that
"it is not unreasonable to require defendant to obtain a
single redacted name and make a single phone call to
clarify defendant's mistake and discover where responsive
records, if any, are located."  (Jeffrey Steinberg v.
U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Action No. 93-2409-LFO,
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Oct.
31, 1995)


          Judge Louis Oberdorfer has ruled that the Customs
Service search for records responsive to a request from
Jeffrey Steinberg was inadequate.  Oberdorfer noted that
"although defendant has stated in conclusory terms that
[the Treasury Enforcement Communications System] is used
to locate investigative files and is, to its mind,
comprehensive, defendant has failed to explain or even to
state, `that no other record system was likely to produce
responsive documents.'"  He pointed out that Steinberg
had produced a list of 18 possible systems of records
that might have responsive records.  He noted that
"plaintiff has shown that it is reasonable to conclude
that additional systems exist and that TECS does not
include these systems.  Plaintiff has shown that it would
not be `unduly burdensome' to search these systems, given
that they are organized alphabetically."  To further
clarify the search issue, Oberdorfer ordered the agency
to respond to Steinberg's interrogatories.  (Jeffrey
Steinberg v. U.S. Department of the Treasury, Civil
Action No. 93-2348-LFO, U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, Sept. 13, 1995)


          A federal court in Chicago has ruled that an FOIA
suit against the Veterans Administration is not moot.
After William Johnson filed suit against the VA, the
agency disclosed records responsive to his request.
However, Johnson continued to contend that it had not
provided all the requested information.  Refusing to
dismiss the case, Judge Suzanne Conlon noted that "while
the medical center denies the existence of the
information in issue, Johnson asserts that his
conversations with the medical center's pharmacy indicate
otherwise.  The Seventh Circuit views conflicting claims
as to the existence of documents or information as a form
of improper withholding.  Accordingly, the case is not
moot."  (William J. Johnson, Sr. v. Veterans
Administration, Civil Action No. 95 C 4909, U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division, Dec. 6, 1995)

          A federal judge in Michigan has ruled that the IRS
properly refused to honor a subpoena requiring testimony
of a special agent and production of documents pertinent
to an ongoing law enforcement investigation.
Acknowledging that he was not dealing with an FOIA
request, Judge Gerald Rosen nevertheless found that FOIA
case law was instructive in reaching a conclusion.
Relying on the Sixth Circuit's decision in Dickerson v.
Dept. of Justice, 992 F.2d 1426 (6th Cir. 1993), which
upheld the Justice Department's decision to withhold all
its files on the Jimmy Hoffa investigation, Rosen noted
that "the level of justification demanded from an agency
when it refuses to disclose information surely must
depend on the nature of the materials sought and their
relation to any ongoing criminal investigations.  The
materials sought by Plaintiffs go to the very heart of
the ongoing criminal investigation of the Plaintiffs."
He concluded that "the subpoena issued in connection with
Plaintiffs' state court action seeks testimony and
materials that are central to an ongoing IRS criminal
investigation.  The District Director reasonably
determined that compliance with this subpoena would
seriously impair federal tax administration."  (Branch
International Services, Inc., etal. v. United States of
America and Internal Revenue Service, Civil Action No.
94-CV-75003-DT, U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan, Southern Division, Nov. 29, 1995)


          A federal court in Minnesota has ruled that Steve
Netzman cannot have access to IRS information concerning
charges or penalties filed against Philip French.  The
court found that the records were "tax information"
covered by Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The judge noted that the Haskell Amendment -- which
"precludes from exemption data in a form which cannot be
associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or
indirectly, a particular taxpayer -- was the only
exception to non-disclosure under 6103.  He pointed out
that the records Netzman was requesting consisted of
"information which relates directly to a particular
individual and, therefore, is not subject to the Haskell
Amendment."  (Steve Netzman v. Internal Revenue Service,
Civil Action No. 3-95-248, U.S. District Court for the
District of Minnesota, Third Division, Nov. 21, 1995)


          A federal judge in New Hampshire has ruled that the
IRS properly withheld records from Terrence Bennett.
Judge Paul Barbadoro pointed out that "the documents
refer to information exchanged pursuant to a tax treaty.
The Service reasonably concluded that the disclosure of
such documents would chill future cooperation with
foreign government treaty partners.  Therefore, it is
entitled to withhold the documents on the ground that
their disclosure would seriously impair federal tax
administration."  (Terrence M. Bennett v. Internal
Revenue Service, Civil Action No. 95-73-B, U.S. District
Court for the District of New Hampshire, Nov. 8, 1995)


          A federal court in California has ruled that data on
which the Department of Health and Human Services relied
to show that the Loma Linda Community Hospital had over-
represented the number of Medicare patients it served
should not have been withheld based on the Privacy Act.
The Department claimed that only 14.77 percent of Loma
Linda's Medicare patients qualified as low-income.  To
defend itself against the charges, Loma Linda requested
access to the underlying data, claiming that its
disclosure would be a routine use under the Privacy Act.
The court found that Loma Linda was entitled to see the
data because it had already had access to the
confidential information contained in it in order to make
its own calculations under the state Medi-Cal program.
The court noted that "the policy underlying the Privacy
Act of protecting confidential information from
disclosure is not implicated in this particular factual
situation.  Even if release of the data relied upon by
the [Health Care Financing Administration] in making its
calculation had unexpectedly included information not
already known to Loma Linda, a confidentiality order
could have been imposed to protect the privacy interests
in issue."  (Loma Linda Community Hospital v. Donna
Shalala, Civil Action No. ED-CV-940055-RT and ED-CV-
940068-RT, U.S. District Court for the Central District
of California, Dec. 15, 1995)


          The report on the state of access to public records
prepared by former House Government Information
Subcommittee counsel Bob Gellman has been published in
Government Information Quarterly.  The paper, entitled
"Public Records -- Access, Privacy and Public Policy: A
Discussion Paper," is reprinted at 12 Government
Information Quarterly, p. 391-426.

Dole Says `Enough Is Enough,' Urges 7 To 10-Day CR

      Contending that "enough is enough," Senate Majority Leader
Dole today said Congress should pass a seven- to 10-day
continuing resolution to reopen the entire federal government. "I
think we've made our point," Dole told reporters, saying the
House and Senate should pass a "clean" CR lasting up to a week
and a half, while budget negotiations continue. "There are not
too many wealthy people working for the federal government," Dole
said, referring to employees who are not being paid. He said he
also is concerned that without immediate legislation, various
"expiring provisions" of federal law will prohibit some states
from providing certain services. He said, for example, some
states may not be able to send out unemployment checks.

      Dole said he would discuss the CR proposal with House
Speaker Gingrich later today. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader
Daschle said this afternoon Democrats would again attempt to
offer a clean CR in the Senate later today and that given Dole's
support, he hoped Gingrich would go along with the proposal. But
House members are likely to stick to their position that a CR
should only be passed as part of an overall budget deal, House
Appropriations Chairman Livingston told CongressDaily. "I
honestly don't believe that a straight CR would pass over here,"
he said, adding that he sympathizes with Dole's position. "I want
to get the government going," he said. A House Republican
leadership aide said, "The last time we gave [President Clinton]
a CR, he didn't even come to the table for a month, so it doesn't
give us much incentive to do it again."

      The aide said tonight's White House budget meeting is
expected to be the first time the negotiators try to resolve the
larger issues. "We'll see how serious they are," the aide said,
adding that decisions on whether the House tries to override
presidential vetoes of the Commerce-Justice-State, VA-HUD and
Interior appropriations bills depends -- in part -- on whether
the Clinton administration bargains in good faith. Livingston
agreed, saying, "The shape and content of the discussion will
have great bearing on what we do over the next few days." Clinton
early today met for two hours with his budget advisers to discuss
strategy for today's negotiating sessions, which could go late
into the evening, Press Secretary Michael McCurry said. When
asked if the president would support a CR that sends all federal
employees back to work without pay, McCurry said, "It's better
than nothing, but not much better than nothing."

      On a related front, the administration has barely started
to piece together the FY97 budget the president is supposed to
present to Congress by Feb. 5 because the final form of the FY96
budget is unknown. An administration official said the president
normally would be making final decisions on the FY97 budget this
time of the year if an FY96 budget were in place. Administration
budget officials need to know final figures for FY96
appropriations and any planned changes in entitlement spending
formulas before they can craft a new budget, the official said.

GOP Leaders To Meet Wed. On Proposed Telco Changes

      At a joint House and Senate leadership meeting scheduled
for Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader Dole and House
Speaker Gingrich are expected to try to iron out a final
compromise on four or five outstanding issues in
telecommunications reform legislation, sources said today. The
issues include foreign ownership, price regulation, and broadcast
ownership. Spectrum sales, an issue Dole brought up again last
week, may also be raised, sources said. Optimistically, if the
leadership can settle these issues, the telecommunications
conference agreement could go to the House floor Thursday. It
could then be brought to a vote in the Senate on Friday or early
next week, sources said, while cautioning, "But we've all heard
that before."

      The most recent version of an agreement put together by the
four conference leaders dropped a provision that would have
relaxed foreign ownership restrictions for U.S. communications
firms. House Commerce Trade and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee
Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, is working to reinstate the
provision, strongly opposed by Senate Commerce ranking member
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. The regional Bell operating companies
have sought "price regulation" of their services to replace the
current system of "rate of return" regulation, which caps the
amount of profits the RBOCs can earn. Also, some conferees want
to loosen broadcast ownership restrictions for the number of
properties held by one owner. And Dole has sought to charge
broadcasters for the purchase of spectrum as a revenue raiser.

House Panels Seeking Superfund Financing Alternatives

      With a rebate to private parties for Superfund cleanups a
target of fierce political attacks, the House Commerce and
Transportation and Infrastructure panels are seeking alternatives
for financing the program, panel sources said. Among the
proposals are further exemptions from liability for new classes
of Superfund sites, a Transportation and Infrastructure source
added. Transportation and Infrastructure Water Resources and
Environment Subcommittee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., last
month said the rebate -- called the retroactive liability
discount -- will be dropped from the Superfund reform legislation
he is sponsoring with Commerce Trade and Hazardous Materials
Subcommittee Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio. "There is general
agreement that it won't survive," Boehlert said.

      Democrats and environmental groups derided the RLD plan as
a "pay-the-polluter" giveaway and a costly new entitlement.
Boehlert said Democrats were able to target the RLD to portray
the Superfund legislation as an attack on the environment. As
approved by Oxley's subcommittee in November, the RLD would cover
50 percent of the cleanup cost at Superfund sites and would be
paid out of the Superfund trust fund. Bill sponsors proposed the
RLD as an alternative to exempting from cleanup liability
altogether sites polluted before the Superfund law went into
effect in 1980. Oxley said repealing retroactive liability would
be too expensive, and that the RLD would reduce liability
litigation and get more money into cleanups.

      To replace the RLD, the committees are considering
exempting more multi-party sites from cleanup liability, the
Transportation source said. Cleanup would be financed directly
from the Superfund trust fund. The source contended adding new
exemptions for multi-party sites to the current plan would reduce
litigation costs and increase money going to cleanup by one-third
to one-half over the amount spent under current law. The bill
already would exempt municipal landfills and private oil
recycling facilities.

Sources: Osprey Exhibits Problems During Shock Tests

      The Navy's troubled efforts to improve its historically
weak ability to counter anti-ship mines suffered another setback
recently, when the first of a new type of mine-hunting ships came
unglued during simulated combat tests. During explosive shock
trials in late October, some of the interior bulkheads and
equipment platforms and decking of the coastal mine hunter Osprey
became separated from the ship's hull, according to sources
familiar with the tests. The problem appears to be a failure of
the bonding that is supposed to hold together the interior
structures and the hull, all of which are made of a special
plastic material, the sources said. One source said the problems
revealed in the Osprey could require extensive modifications that
also would have to be retrofitted, at additional cost, to the 11
other ships in the class, all of which are completed or nearly
finished.

      The damage to the Osprey is just the latest problem with a
project that ran years behind schedule and well above expected
cost. And it continues a rash of difficulties plaguing the Navy's
entire program to eliminate a war-fighting weakness that
handicapped operations in the Persian Gulf. Capt. Gordon
Peterson, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that the Osprey experienced
some damage during the trials but declined to specify how
extensive it was, citing security concerns. Peterson noted some
damage is expected during shock trials and said that "the ship
maintained the ability to maneuver, navigate and perform its war
fighting missions" at the completion of the tests. But one source
said he was told "they suffered significantly more damage than
they expected."

      Another source said the test was stopped after five
explosions, instead of the planned six shots, and repairs had to
be made between the fourth and fifth explosions. Peterson
confirmed repairs were made and the test cut short, explaining
that Navy experts decided "sufficient data was obtained" in five
shots. A government source said the Navy now is struggling over
how to correct the problems revealed in the shock trials.

House, Senate Schedule For This Week

      Both the House and Senate will adjourn momentarily at noon
Wednesday to fulfill the constitutional requirement of ending the
first session of the 104th Congress Jan. 3. When the House
returns Wednesday, it is expected to take up an override of
President Clinton's veto of the defense authorization bill.
Depending on budget negotiations, the House also may try to
override vetoes of the Interior, Commerce-Justice-State and VA-
HUD appropriations bills later this week. A bill to permit states
to operate national parks at their own expense during the
shutdown also may be brought to the floor. The Senate schedule
also will continue to reflect the negotiations.

Talks On Banking Issues Pushed Back; State Fees Still Problematic

      Budget talks on banking issues have been pushed back and
not yet rescheduled, and the issue of state bank fees is still on
the table, sources said today. At a meeting last week of House
Banking and Budget committee staff, Banking aides did not oppose
a revenue-raising provision that would require federal regulators
to collect fees for their examinations of state-chartered banks,
sources said. Staff took a more "objective" stance, saying the
committee "has never approved of a position" to collect the fees,
according to a source. In contrast, on the issue of whether to
raise the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration loans, "staff
does not recommend this as an option," one source said. State
banks already pay examination fees to state regulators, and
Banking Chairman Leach wrote to the Budget Committee last month
urging budget negotiators not to accept the fee provision,
included in the administration's budget proposal.

Union Asks Congress To Contribute Pay To Furloughed Workers

      The National Treasury Employees Union is asking members of
Congress to donate pay they receive during the partial government
shutdown to furloughed federal workers through the Federal
Employee Education and Assistance Fund. In a letter to Congress
Friday, the NTEU called it an "outrage" that Congress, "who
caused this shutdown crisis by not passing the necessary
appropriations bills on time, have been on vacation for the
holiday and will receive no reduction in pay due to the
furlough." The union also said it will file a temporary
restraining order with a federal court asking that the law
requiring federal employees to work without pay be declared
unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Rep. Charles Taylor, R-N.C., offered
Saturday to make available about $10,000 a month from his own pay
for emergency, no-interest loans to furloughed federal workers,
the Associated Press reported. "I know I can't help everyone, but
at least I can get some people through the crisis times," Taylor
said.

Gingrich Admits Mistakes In First Year As Speaker

      Looking back at his first year as speaker of the House and
leader of the Republican revolution, House Speaker Gingrich
acknowledged Saturday that he has made some mistakes and will try
to correct them by confining himself to doing only his job. The
jump from back bench bomb-thrower to key policy decision-maker
caused some errors of inexperience, Gingrich said. "Nobody could
go from being minority whip of the House to the speaker of the
House in one jump and go from being in the opposition party to
working with [Senate Majority Leader] Dole and being really the
dominant agenda-setting force in the country [...] and not make
mistakes," Gingrich said on CNN's "Evans and Novak."

      Among the errors Gingrich noted was linking his treatment
on Air Force One to taking a hard line with President Clinton on
shutting down the government. "There's no question that there are
times, as I've described it, where it's like throwing an
interception straight into the other team's defense. And on
several occasions, and that's one, I did things that weren't
right," Gingrich said. The controversy surrounding his original
acceptance of a $4.5 million book advance also could have been
avoided, he added, by taking advice from people "who understood
being a national figure in the way I frankly didn't understand."

      Gingrich said a major way of avoiding self-inflicted wounds
this year will be to keep to his job as speaker and stop
freelancing as social commentator. Several times in the last year
and a half Gingrich has linked breaking news stories -- like
Susan Smith's murder of her two children in South Carolina -- to
a breakdown of civilization caused by liberal policies. "You
know, I'm speaker of the House. I'm not an assistant professor of
history. I'm not an analyst. I'm not a commentator. And I think
at times I've tried to play other roles, and it's almost always
been wrong," Gingrich said. "I've got to be the speaker of the
House and leader of the House Republican Party and stay inside
that particular box to be effective." Gingrich, however, has said
debate and teaching are the only ways to achieve the broad
cultural goals of conservatives.

      Gingrich also attributed his low poll ratings to how he is
covered by the media. "If I were the person who was seeing seven-
second sound bites, I wouldn't like me either," he said. But he
added that over time, "as people see more of what we're really
doing [...] my ratings will go up." Gingrich also made something
of a New Year's resolution to engage more with individual
reporters and editors in an effort to improve the Republican
revolution. "I'm going to work harder at interacting with
individual editors and reporters to see if we can't get our story
through if by no other means than just embarrassing them into
being professional," he said.

Washington Pundits

   Some observations by Washington experts and pundits on the
ongoing budget battle, as quoted late last week by Reuters:
    "Everyone thought Congress wouldn't leave town for Christmas
with the government shut down because it would look terrible. We
were wrong."

       -- Stanley Collender, a former Hill aide who is now the
in-house budget expert at Price Waterhouse.

       "You have a conflict of issues more fundamental than most
people think. This isn't just children squabbling. This is a real
difference between the way the Republicans in Congress and
Clinton want to take the country."

       -- Stephen Moore, budget analyst at the Cato Institute,
who said the standoff "will probably be ended in the next few
weeks [...] but it could last several months."

       "Custer presumably thought he would win at Little Big
Horn, too."

       -- Political analyst Kevin Phillips -- suggesting that the
Republicans had trapped themselves rhetorically, but are yet to
realize it.

Senate Approves CR; Budget Talks To Continue Today

      As late-night White House budget talks produced "progress"
but no final deal, the Senate Tuesday hedged its bets and passed
a continuing resolution to reopen the federal government as well
as a backup measure to bring federal employees back to work
without pay if, as it appears, the House refuses to approve the
new CR immediately. President Clinton and Hill leaders met from
about 6:15 p.m. (EST) to 9:15 p.m. (EST) Tuesday at the White
House, but did not announce any new agreements on the budget or a
CR afterward. Instead, the participants, continuing their efforts
to keep the budget negotiations behind closed doors, left without
talking to reporters and issued a one-sentence joint statement
said to have been authored by Vice President Gore. The statement
declared, "Our talks continue to make constructive progress and
we will reconvene tomorrow at 1:30 p.m."

      White House Press Secretary Michael McCurry said today's
meeting would be at the White House. Among the participants in
the meeting with Clinton Tuesday night were House Speaker
Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Dole, Senate Minority Leader
Daschle, House Majority Leader Armey, House Minority Leader
Gephardt, Gore and White House Chief of Staff Panetta. After
spending 90 minutes in the Oval Office, the negotiators moved to
the White House residence to continue talks over a dinner of
pasta and shrimp. Meawhile, the Senate earlier Tuesday evening
approved a "clean" continuing resolution that simply extends the
now-expired CR until Jan. 12. Dole appeared on the Senate floor,
shortly after meeting in the afternoon (EST) with House and
Senate Republican leaders for more than two hours, to make
several unanimous consent requests, including one to pass the new
CR. Most programs would be funded at the lowest of House, Senate
or FY95 funding levels. Technically, the CR was added to
legislation that would provide most favored nation status to
Bulgaria.

      In a floor statement, Dole declared, "People have been gone
from their jobs long enough."

      He said while some House Republicans want to refuse to pass
a new CR until a budget deal is set, "I don't quite understand
the logic in all that." And Dole said federal employees "want to
work," adding: "They're caught in the middle. They're pawns [...]
If there's any point to be made, it should have been made by
now."

      While Gingrich refused to consider the possibility of a new
CR until he saw how Tuesday night's budget talks progressed, Dole
denied there was a split between himself and the speaker, but
agreed "there are some differences" between House and Senate
Republicans on "how we should proceed."

      Asked later if he was trying to pressure the House to pass
the CR, Dole said: "Me? No."

      Gingrich speaking with reporters on Capitol Hill declined
to discuss the Senate action Tuesday evening, saying, "I don't
have any comment." And Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley termed
the Senate action as "a tactical judgment for the Senate."

      Talking with reporters in the Oval Office later Tuesday
before the meeting with Clinton, Gingrich said, "Our members will
be back by noon (EST) tomorrow, and we hope to meet with all of
them and brief them on tonight's meeting and whatever happens
tomorrow morning, and maybe get something done during the day
tomorrow." "I think if we can both get movement on the balanced
budget and get the government back to work, and paid for, that
really would be a good step in the right direction," Gingrich
added.

      House Budget Chairman Kasich said it is "very unlikely" the
House would pass a CR until a budget deal is set, adding, "We see
all this as being connected to balancing the budget."

      Anticipating that the House may refuse to consider the new
continuing resolution, the Senate, by unanimous consent Tuesday,
also amended and passed separate House legislation that would
bring federal employees back to work without pay, but with the
guarantee they would eventually be paid.

      The legislation in effect declares all federal employees
"essential."

      In addition, the Senate amended the legislation to provide
targeted funding to several programs, which Dole said could not
continue without the funding.

      Those programs include the federal Meals on Wheels program
for the elderly, child protection services, unemployment
compensation for 11 states, passport offices, programs for native
Americans, certain veterans programs and national parks.

      The Senate also deleted a House provision that would
require the Senate to consider any budget deal on an expedited
basis. However, Dole also requested, and received, unanimous
consent that if Daschle agrees at the time, any budget deal be
considered as budget reconciliation legislation and be subject to
the same limits. Those limits would prohibit a filibuster and
limit debate to a maximum of 20 hours. "That would speed up the
process considerably," Dole said. Because the Senate amended the
House-passed "essential" employees proposal, it apparently would
have to be reconsidered by the House before it would be sent to
Clinton.

      Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Tuesday applauded Dole's efforts
to reopen the federal government, saying, "This is a major step
forward."

      In addition, Senate Budget Chairman Domenici, commenting on
the CR said: "I think it's time we do this [...] Most federal
employees are saying they'd like to work to be paid [...] I hope
the House gives serious consideration to this."

      On another front, as public officials continue to feel the
heat from their constituents over the government shutdown, Rep.
Martin Hoke, R-Ohio, Tuesday announced he donated his $11,133
congressional pay for the month of December to 28 northeast Ohio
charities. Hoke in a statement called his decision a "matter of
conscience."

Oxley Wants To Head House Commerce Telco Panel

      There seems to be some dissension in the GOP over who will
chair the House Commerce Telecommunications and Finance
Subcommittee in the next Congress. Last week, newly converted
Republican Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana, in announcing
he will not run for the open Senate seat in his state this year,
also reportedly said he is the anointed chairman-in-waiting for
the subcommittee after its current chairman, Rep. Jack Fields, R-
Texas, retires later this year. But sources Tuesday said Tauzin's
news came as a surprise to the panel's current second-ranking
Republican, Rep. Michael Oxley of Ohio. "Mr. Oxley intends to be
the next chair of the telecommunications subcommittee," said
Peggy Peterson, his spokeswoman, adding, "He is currently the
vice chairman, and he is pursuing the chairmanship."

      Tauzin last week told reporters Speaker Gingrich promised
him the Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee chairmanship
in the next Congress. When he switched parties, the Republican
leadership agreed to retain Tauzin's seniority in the House.
Tauzin said he would not usurp a "sitting" chairman. In his ninth
congressional term, Tauzin has four years on Oxley and two years
on Commerce Chairman Bliley.

      Asked if Oxley had discussed the matter with Gingrich,
Peterson had no comment. However, she said: "Mr. Oxley does not
think that Republicans are the party of seniority. Seniority is
only one factor in picking a chair."

      Ever since Tauzin made his remarks, sources on and off
Capitol Hill have speculated about whether the reports were
accurate and, if so, why the speaker would make such a deal.

      Some close to the matter said Gingrich hoped Tauzin's plum
spot would lure other senior Democrats over to the GOP, and
strengthen the Republican position in the House.

      The speaker's office did not return several inquiries from
CongressDaily Tuesday.

      Technically, under House Rule 19, the speaker does not
appoint subcommittee chairmen, staff noted. The chairman of the
full committee proposes a leadership slate that must be ratified
by the majority members of the committee, they said. The House
Commerce Committee spokesman had no comment on the matter.

      Oxley intends to file for re-election in his district
Friday, according to his staff.

Roberts Seems Reluctant To Extend Food Aid Programs

   House Agriculture Chairman Roberts appears to be resisting
writing an extension of authority for the Food for Peace and Food
for Progress programs, which provide food to poor countries,
including war-torn Bosnia.

      Authority for the two food programs expired Dec. 31, along
with the rest of the 1990 farm bill. The vetoed GOP budget
reconciliation bill would have reauthorized agricultural
programs, including the international food assistance programs,
but the reauthorization has been tied up in the ongoing budget
negotiations.

      A Roberts spokeswoman Tuesday said the Clinton
administration has not "conveyed to us that there is a particular
problem" regarding the two food programs, adding, "Our effort is
strictly working on the balanced budget."

      But a farm organization lobbyist speculated the underlying
reason probably is that Roberts does not want to break out any
pieces of the farm bill reauthorization that are contained in the
budget reconciliation bill.

      Agency for International Development Administrator Brian
Atwood, Agriculture Secretary Glickman and House International
Relations Chairman Gilman have been pushing Roberts to extend the
program since mid-December, when it became apparent no budget
agreement would be reached before the 1990 farm bill expired.

      Atwood and Glickman both wrote Roberts and other Hill
officials Dec. 13 asking for an extension, and Gilman planned to
introduce it before Christmas. However, Roberts insisted on
obtaining another letter from Glickman explaining the situation
was an emergency. The second Glickman letter was held up for
clearance at the White House, but arrived at the House
Agriculture Committee Tuesday morning.

      The letter states that "any lapse in authority could
seriously undermine the ability of the United States to meet the
needs, particularly emergency needs of vulnerable populations,
and to augment food supplies in food-deficit countries."

      Nevertheless, Agriculture Committee staff director Gary
Mitchell Tuesday through a spokeswoman said the letter was not
specific enough to require action.

      Commenting on the turn of events, a House International
Relations Committee staffer Tuesday said: "We felt that there was
so much agreement to go ahead and do this anyway that there
wasn't a need to go through the specific contracts. We're talking
about a program to feed starving people. If they need specifics,
we'll get specifics."

      In addition, Atwood told CongressDaily he does not think
Roberts needs more specifics to act. "I think a request by Dan
Glickman and me citing that OMB has no objections is clarity
enough. We really need the clear support of Congress and need
their authorization to deliver food in emergency circumstances,"
Atwood said. Atwood said he had a good relationship with Roberts
and believes Roberts "is thinking about this not in partisan but
legislative, tactical terms. I think the approach he is taking is
a risky one and I hope that he would reconsider."

A Third Of Calif. Delegation In Play As Filing Closes

     Filing for the March 26 California primary closed late
Friday, and while there will be no megabucks Senate race in the
Golden State this year, there will be competitive races in at
least a third of the state's 52-member House delegation.

      The California congressional elections this year are
complicated by several minor party candidates who are largely
conservative and could draw enough votes away from Republicans to
affect some close races.

      This is the first year the Natural Law Party and Ross
Perot's Reform Party have qualified as official parties, while
the Libertarian Party has fielded candidates in the past.

      For example, Libertarian candidate Ross Crain took 4
percent of the vote against Democratic Rep. Vic Fazio in 1994 and
9 percent against Fazio in 1992; Fazio won only 50 percent of the
vote in 1994, and 51 percent in 1992, while the GOP nominees and
Crain divided the conservative vote in the Sacramento area seat.

      As a chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Fazio is one
of the GOP's top House targets this year. But Republicans could
encounter a bitter primary battle for the right to oppose Fazio
between 1994 nominee Tim LeFever, a conservative, and Esparto
school board member Charles Schaupp, a moderate.

      The LeFever-Schaupp ideological battle has split GOP
central committees in two of the district's counties, resulting
in attempts to remove people from those panels.

      While Fazio is the GOP's most prominent California target,
his is but one of up to eight Democratic-held seats being eyed by
the Republicans.

      In the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles, where
Democratic Rep. Anthony Beilenson is retiring, Richard Sybert, a
former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, is expected to emerge as the
winner of a three-way GOP primary.

      Sybert, who owns a toy manufacturing company and can tap
into his family fortune, spent $1.6 million in 1994 to win 48
percent against Beilenson.

      Leading a field of five Democrats is Brad Sherman, who has
twice won elections to represent the Los Angeles area on the
state's four-member tax board. Sherman also has family wealth on
which to rely.

      On the southern side of the Los Angeles area, Democratic
Rep. Jane Harman faces the prospect of a rematch against 1994 GOP
nominee Susan Brooks, who lost to Harman by a mere 812 votes.
After the election, Brooks pursued a legal challenge claiming
election irregularities, including that illegal aliens voted.

      Torrance businessman and physician Irwin Savodnik has filed
to challenge Brooks in the primary.

      Another prime GOP target is Democratic Rep. George Brown,
ranking member of the Science Committee, who edged GOP candidate
Robert Guzman by just 51-49 in 1994. Guzman is again seeking the
GOP nod, but so are four other candidates. Widely regarded as the
front-runner in the primary is Linda Wilde, a state Superior
Court judge who has taken a leave of absence to run.

      Included in the next tier of GOP targets are two
conservative Democrats from the state's Central Valley, Reps.
Gary Condit and Calvin Dooley, as well as two northern California
liberals, Reps. Sam Farr and Anna Eshoo.

      Three Republicans have signed up to challenge Farr, who
holds White House Chief of Staff Panetta's former House seat. The
would-be nominees against Farr, who won just 52 percent in 1994,
include Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau Director Jess Brown.

      Eshoo appears more secure: She was re-elected with 61
percent in a difficult year for Democrats. Her 1994 opponent, Ben
Brink, is one of two candidates seeking the GOP nod this year.

      Challenging Condit, a leader of The Coalition, will be
Republican Bill Conrad, a general contractor who has never held
elective office. Condit won his 1994 race by a 2-1 margin,
although GOP nominees for governor and senator won the district.

      Three Republicans are contending for the right to oppose
Dooley, who won 57 percent in 1994. The GOP front-runner is
Assemblyman Trice Harvey, who reportedly did not want to run
against Dooley, but opted to do so because the state's term
limits law is forcing him out of the California Assembly.

      At the southern end of the state, Republicans also think
they may have a shot against San Diego-based Rep. Robert Filner.
While three Republicans have filed for the nomination, local
observers feel Filner is in greater jeopardy in the Democratic
primary.

      San Diego Councilman Juan Vargas, a Democrat who lost to
Filner in a crowded primary in 1992, is running again. Vargas'
assets include a Harvard degree and a Hispanic background in a
district that is 40 percent Hispanic.

      For the Democrats, the targets include three GOP freshmen:
Reps. Frank Riggs, Andrea Seastrand, and Brian Bilbray.

      Riggs, who represents a district that stretches from north
of San Francisco to the Oregon border, first won the seat in
1990, lost it in 1992, and regained it in 1994. Former Democratic
Rep. Dan Hamburg, who lost to Riggs last time out, opted not to
run again this year.

      There are a half-dozen contenders in the Democratic primary
for Riggs' seat, with the three leading contenders including two
recent immigrants from San Francisco. They are Carol Ruth Silver,
a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who
moved into the district last year, and Michela Alioto, a daughter
of former San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto and, until recently,
an aide to Vice President Gore.

      The third major contender is attorney Monica Marvin. She is
backed by state Sen. Mike Thompson, who was the Democrats' first
choice to take on Riggs.

      In the Santa Barbara area, Seastrand will face a rematch
against Democrat Walter Holden Capps, whom she defeated by just
1,500 votes in 1994. And in San Diego, three Democrats are vying
to take on Bilbray. But Democratic prospects there received a
setback just days before the filing deadline when former Rep.
Lynn Schenk, who lost to Bilbray in 1994, announced she would not
run again.

      The leading contender in the three-way Democratic primary
is University of California at Irvine professor Peter Navarro,
who hosts a local talk show. But Navarro carries political
baggage from unsuccessful runs for supervisor and mayor. Also
running is small business owner Nancy Casady, who has ties to
some leading state Democrats.

      The Democrats also are eyeing the open seat of retiring GOP
Rep. Carlos Moorhead in the Los Angeles area and the Long Beach-
based district of GOP Rep. Stephen Horn.

      Two Democrats have filed to take on Horn: 1994 primary
candidate and professor Peter Matthews, and attorney Rick Zbur.
Horn won in 1994 with 58 percent, but won with only 49 percent in
1992.

      Assemblyman James Rogan is the leading GOP contender for
Moorhead's seat, while the Democrats will have tough primary
battle between Douglas Kahn, a wealthy businessman who was
Moorhead's 1992 and 1994 opponent, and Barry Gordon, an actor and
former president of the Screen Actors Guild.

      In the second tier of Democratic targets are GOP Reps.
Richard Pombo and Sonny Bono. Pombo likely will face Democrat
Jason Silva, a public relations consultant, in the Stockton area
seat. Former radio personality and retired businesswoman Anita
Rufus has filed for the Democratic nod against Bono in the Palm
Springs-based district. Meawhile, 10 Democrats have entered the
special election to succeed Democratic Rep. Walter Tucker, who
resigned last month following his conviction on federal bribery
and tax evasion charges.

      The special primary will coincide with the March 26
primary. If no candidate for the open seat receives more than 50
percent, a runoff will be held. The Los Angeles area district is
three-quarters black and Hispanic and is overwhelmingly
Democratic.

      The leading Democrats in the race include Assembly members
Willard Murray and Juanita McDonald, Lynwood Mayor Paul Richards,
Compton Mayor Omar Bradley and Compton City Clerk Charles Davis,
as well as Tucker's wife, Robin, who has operated a youth
training center.

81 Republicans Oppose Deal That Trims $245B Tax Cut

      A group of 81 Republican senators and House members, as
well as one House Democrat, has sent a letter to President
Clinton, House Speaker Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Dole
vowing to oppose any final budget deal that has less than the
$245 billion in tax cuts contained in the budget reconciliation
bill vetoed by Clinton. "We urge you to support a plan that
provides real tax relief for families and economic growth for
small businesses and that balances the budget in seven years; we
also urge you to reject any plan that does not," said the letter,
which was initiated by Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., and Sen. Rod
Grams, R-Minn., and released Tuesday. "You can count on our
steadfast opposition to any budget plan that turns its back on
our promises to American families," the members said. The letter,
signed by 52 Republican House members, one House Democrat, Rep.
Ralph Hall of Texas, and 29 GOP senators also said "the
congressionally approved tax relief package must not be
sacrificed at the altar of more spending and a bigger
government." It further contends "tax relief for families is
critical."

      Among those signing the letter were Senate Majority Whip
Lott, Senate Banking Chairman D'Amato and Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas, who was the only GOP senator seeking the presidency to
sign the letter.

No Senate Votes Slated This Week

      No roll call votes are planned in the Senate this week or
next week unless there is significant movement in budget
negotiations which would require floor action, Senate Majority
Leader Dole announced Tuesday.

      In a Senate floor statement, Dole added that senators will
have ample warning to return to Washington if votes are called
for any reason.

      Today at noon, both the House and Senate are slated to
officially begin the second session of the 104th Congress.

      Votes are expected in the House today, Thursday and Friday,
according to the House GOP cloakroom recorded message for
members.

      The House this week may take up an override of President
Clinton's vetoes of the FY96 Defense authorization legislation
and FY96 Commerce-Justice-State, Interior and VA-HUD
appropriations bills.

      An override attempt also is possible in the House this week
on welfare reform legislation if it is vetoed by Clinton, as the
president promised before Christmas.

      In addition, a bill to permit states to operate national
parks at their own expense during the federal government shutdown
also may be brought to the House floor.

Pressler Urges Quick Passage Of Th Telco Bill

      In an effort to keep up the momentum for passage of
telecommunications reform legislation, Senate Commerce Chairman
Pressler Tuesday issued a statement urging his colleagues to act
quickly to approve a conference agreement. "Congress should put
telecommunications reform first on its list of New Year's
legislative resolutions," Pressler said. House Speaker Gingrich
during a Capitol Hill press conference last Thursday said he "was
going to ask [Senate Majority Leader] Dole probably to have a
meeting on Wednesday with the leading members on the House and
Senate Republican side to go over the [telecommunications] bill."
Gingrich added, "Both of us had expressed some interest, some
concern, about some pieces of the bill." In addition, sources
earlier Tuesday said Dole and Gingrich were expected to try to
iron out a final compromise on four or five outstanding issues in
the telecommunications bill at a joint House-Senate leadership
meeting this morning. However, Dole's office and House Commerce
Committee aides late Tuesday said no such meeting on the
telecommunications legislation had been scheduled for today.

Senators Object To Proposed Regulations On Tobacco

      A group of 32 senators, led by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
and Wendell Ford, D-Ky., Tuesday signed a comment to the FDA
strongly objecting to the agency's proposal to regulate the sale
and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. "Congress
has not given FDA either `clear direction' or any authority to
regulation tobacco," the senators said. Tuesday was the deadline
for public comment on the FDA proposal, which is designed to
prevent teenagers from taking up cigarette smoking and tobacco
chewing. The tobacco industry submitted several thousand pages of
documents opposing FDA regulation and denying that nicotine is
addictive. The senators in their comment declared, "While we
stand steadfastly against tobacco use by minors, we strenuously
object to FDA's effort to expand its jurisdiction and the federal
bureaucracy in dealing with a problem that Congress has already
designated to the states." The senators said Congress in 1992
decided that states should address tobacco use by minors when it
required each state to implement a program to keep minors from
obtaining tobacco products. Congress has denied FDA the authority
to regulate tobacco, the senators added.

NRSC Files Complaint Against Wyden Senate Campaign

      The National Republican Senatorial Committee has filed a
complaint with the FEC alleging irregularities in the Senate
campaign of Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. The complaint, dated last
Thursday, said the AFL-CIO and the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League "are about to violate federal
election law in the Oregon Special Election by making a series of
massive illegal independent expenditures they have improperly
coordinated with the Wyden for Senate campaign and its agents."
The complaint requested the FEC make an "immediate determination"
that the AFL-CIO is illegally subsidizing the Wyden campaign with
"an unusually large number of political operatives" and that the
AFL-CIO and NARAL are prohibited from making independent
expenditures on behalf of Wyden because the groups are "not
legally independent" from the campaign. The Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee termed the complaint is "superficial" and "an
attempt to shift focus from [GOP candidate Gordon Smith's] dismal
business and political record." Wyden and Smith are seeking the
seat of former GOP Sen. Bob Packwood in a Jan. 30 special
election.

Majority In State Believes Thurmon Should Not Seek Re-election

      In a new South Carolina poll, almost 60 percent of likely
GOP primary voters believe 93-year-old Senate Armed Services
Chairman Thurmond should not seek another term. The survey,
conducted for The State newspaper by Mason-Dixon Opinion
Research, found 59 percent believe Thurmond should not seek
another term, while 33 percent feel he should. And while 44
percent said they would vote for Thurmond in a primary, 56
percent said they would consider someone else. In a matchup
against former Gov. Carroll Campbell and Secretary of State Jim
Miles, Thurmond led Campbell by just 40-37 percent, within the
survey's 4.7 point error margin. Miles was at 8 percent. In a
head-to-head with Thurmond, Miles trailed 53-26. Campbell told
The State he will not run against Thurmond, while Miles
sidestepped questions about challenging Thurmond. The poll of 472
likely primary voters was conducted Dec. 26-27.

Durbin Camp Seeks To get Primary Foe Off The Ballot

      Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who is seeking his party's
Senate nomination in the March primary, is hoping to get a
little-known, but well-heeled, foe off the primary ballot. Durbin
last week lodged objections to more than 90 percent of the
petition signatures filed by Chicago attorney Clinton Krislov,
and asked state officials to bar Krislov from the ballot, the
Chicago Tribune reported. An attorney for the Durbin campaign
said volunteers had cross-checked signatures on Krislov's
petitions with voter lists, and had found thousands that did not
match. Krislov, who made a fortune by representing plaintiffs in
class action suits, termed the allegations "outrageous," while
adding, "I'm almost flattered that [Durbin] recognizes the impact
I'm going to have on this race." Krislov has said he will dip
into personal funds to bankroll his campaign. There are four
other Democratic contenders, including former state Treasurer
Patrick Quinn.

CORPORATE LEADERS ASKED TO SHARE IN NATIONAL SACRIFICE

     In  further  response  on Dec. 27 to the advertisement by  a  number  of
corporate executives, forty six congressional Democrats led by Reps. Gephardt
(D=Mo.),  Obey  (D=Wis.) and Miller (D=Calif.) called on the  executives   to
detail the specific areas of personal and company sacrifice they are prepared
to make to assist in efforts to balance the budget.  Rep. Obey said "we think
it  is  important that bIg business understand that most Americans  have  not
benefited from the recent performance of the US economy.  We wanted to  point
out  that  there  were  a  number  of  areas  where  they  could  make  major
contributions.  Given the timing of their ad we thought they should  remember
that  there  are a lot of Bob Cratchits out there and that  big  corporations
might  want  to see if they could pick up a little of the burden  instead  of
laying everything off on the Cratchit family."

     Meanwhile,  on  Dec. 27, Sen. Gramm (R=Tex.) said "it is  critical  that
Senate  Republicans stand their ground as budget negotiations resume  in  the
coming  days.  While the Clinton Administration public relations machine  had
reduced  some Senate republicans to a defensive crouch in earlier  stages  of
the  confrontation,  the House Republicans have called  President   Clinton's
bluff.   Whenever   the President finally begins negotiating  with  America's
future   in  mind  instead  of his own, our  House  colleagues  are  due  the
credit...  House Republicans have taken the moral high ground in this  fight;
the  public is on our side, and President Clinton will have no choice but  to
join us if we keep the courage of our convictions," Sen. Gramm said.

CBO PROJECTS BUDGET PLAN WOULD PRODUCE INCREASING SURPLUS IN OUT YEARS

     The Congressional Budget Office on Dec. 21 said the proposed Seven  Year
Balanced Budget would produce increasing surpluses in 2003 of $10 billion, in
2004 of $30 billion and in 2005 of $50 billion.  The figures were given in  a
memorandum to the Senate Democratic Budget Committee staff that was requested
by Sen. Exon (D=Nebr.).

     House  Budget  Committee Chairman Kasich (R=Ohio) in a  comment  on  the
report said the surpluses "will likely be even larger if we maintain the  cap
on discretionary spending.  Our balanced budget," he said, "is an honest  and
fair  plan  that uses real numbers, conservative  economic  assumptions,  and
makes fundamental structural changes in the Federal government. Balancing the
Federal  budget  now  is  the best Christmas present we  could  give  to  our
children and grandchildren," Rep. Kaisch concluded.

INFORMATION ON LOBBYING REGISTRATION UNDER NEW LAW PLACED IN RECORD

     The  Secretary  of the Senate and the Clerk of the House  filed  in  the
Congressional  Record  information on the new Lobbying Disclosure  Act  (P.L.
104=65)  that  takes  effect  on Jan. 1,  1996.   In  general,  the  Lobbying
Disclosure  Act establishes broad requirements that individuals and  entities
who  seek to influence the Federal government register with the Secretary  of
the  Senate and Clerk of the House and disclose their clients, issues,  fees,
and interests of foreign entities.  All registrations filed under the Act are
public records.

     Information,  forms and instructions will be available in early  January
from  the  House  Legislative Resource Center  1036  Longworth  House  Office
Building  and  Senate  Office  of Public  Records,  232  Hart  Senate  Office
Building.  The first reports under the new act will be due by Aug. 14,  1996.
Lobbying  firms  must file separate reports for each  client.  (Congressional
Record Dec. 22 p. S=19290=21).

     After the law was signed, Sen. Cohen (R=Me.) said he was hopeful that it
would persuade the people "that Congress's business can be done in the  open.
Lobbyists  now  have  to make full disclosure of who they  are,  who  they're
lobbying on behalf of and how much they're spending to do what.  I think many
people  are under the impression that lobbyists are dictating and  dominating
the  legislative process in this country.  They're cynical about it and  they
feel that people who have the money are the ones reaping the benefits."

     Sen. Levin (D=Mich.) also praised the bill.  He said one of the  reasons
he  fought for the bill "is because if we want the public to have  confidence
in  our  actions, the nation's business has got to be conducted more  in  the
sunshine.  When public cynicism runs deep about a democratic government, that
government must act to restore that public confidence."

     Common  Cause  President  Ann McBride said the  bill  and  Congressional
earlier  action ending the lobbyist gift system provide hope to the  American
people  by showing that political reform is possible and their voices can  be
heard on Capitol Hill.

Secretary, and Gail Clements McDonald to be Administrator of the St. Lawrence
Seaway Development Corp. for the term expiring Mar. 20, 1998.

     The President also sent the nomination of Alvin Alm of Virginia to be an
Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environmental Management to the Senate.  He
would replace Thomas Grumbly.

SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE REPORTS LABOR SUPPORT OF ANWR OIL SALE

     The  Senate Energy Committee on Dec. 22 reported that  Robert  Georgine,
President  of the AFL=CIO Building and Construction Trades Department sent  a
letter to President asking him to include the provision to lease a small part
of  the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain  for  oil   exploration
and development  in  any  compromise on the budget  reconciliation   package.
The  Committee   said  that on Oct. 25, the presidents of  five   other   key
AFL=CIO unions issued similar endorsements.

     "On  behalf  of  the  over 3 million  American  working  men  and  women
represented  by the 15 member unions of the Building and Construction  Trades
Department, AFL=CIO, I again ask that you support the provision to allow  the
responsible  leasing  of  a small part of the ANWR  coastal  plain.  American
working families across the US depend on your support," Mr. Georgine wrote.

     Senate  Energy  Committee  Chairman Murkowski  (R=Alaska)  said  he  was
pleased  with  the decision to push for ANWR leasing.  "This is  a  big  step
forward  because it is further proof that the opening of a tiny part  of  the
coastal plain to oil exploration will pay huge benefits to the nation and the
working  people  of America.  It will produce hundreds of thousands  of  high
paying  jobs.  For the first time, we have moved ANWR through both the  House
and the Senate with significant support.  The only thing standing in the  way
of ANWR becoming a reality is the Clinton Administration and Secretary of the
Interior Bruce Babbitt," he said.

FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE: CURRENT ISSUES AND OPTIONS FOR REFORM

By Ralph M. Chite, Environment and Natural Resources Policy Division.
18 pages.  Farmer participation in the federally subsidized crop
insurance program has fallen short of goals anticipated in 1980 when
the program was greatly expanded.  Low participation rates have
contributed to the enactment of ad hoc disaster assistance bills,
which have authorized more than $6 billion in additional direct
payments since 1988. Many policymakers are concerned that the federal
budget cannot continue to support both crop insurance and disaster
payments, and that Congress might be required to reconsider the
proper role of the government in farm risk management.  This paper
pro-vides background on the mechanics of the crop insurance program
and explores policy options and dilemmas in reforming the program.
Order No. 92-318 ENR.

The full report, as described above and authored by the Congressional
Research Service, costs $47 from Penny Hill Press, 6440 Wiscasset
Road, Bethesda, MD  20816, 301-229-8229.

CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACTS:  SUMMARY DATA FOR FISCAL YEARS 1977-
1992

By Kathy Dolan, Government Division.  3 pages.  This report provides
summary data on continuing appropriations acts for the fiscal years
1977-1992.  A continuing appropriation act provides budget authority
for federal agencies and programs until regular appropriations acts
are enacted or, sometimes, for an entire year.  Acts of this kind are
referred to as continuing resolutions because they are typically
enacted as joint resolutions.  Order No. 92-323 GOV.

By William A. Cox, Office of Senior Specialists.  As the federal
government's debt has mushroomed since 1992 at a rate unparalleled in
peacetime, questions about its effects have taken on greater
importance.  Despite steps to reduce the deficit, public debt will
continue to rise rapidly in the next several years.  Who is being
hurt by this development, and who, if anyone, benefits?  Should we be
concerned about heavy reliance on foreign capital?  What are the
implications of rising federal interest payments?  Are we "mortgaging
the nation's future," imposing a swelling burden on posterity?  These
questions are the subject of this brief.  Order No. IB92049.

Research Service, costs $47 from Penny Hill Press, 6440 Wiscasset

"PAY-AS-YOU-GO" BUDGET ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES IN 1992:  ISSUE BRIEF

By Edward Davis, Government Division.  In 1992, economic recovery
legislation and other major domestic policy initiatives are prominent
on the legislative agenda.  To the extent that such proposals are
covered by the PAYGO process, and to avoid a PAYGO sequester in
fiscal year 1993, Congress and the President must come to agreement
on suitable deficit reduction offsets or exempt these proposals from
the PAYGO process.  Order No. IB92055.

SHAREHOLDER VOTING CONCERNING EXECUTIVE PAY

By Michael V. Seitzinger, American Law Division.  4 pages.  The issue
of how much executives of a corporation should be paid is especially
controversial at this time.  A recent change by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in an interpretation of the proxy regulations
will require certain shareholder proposals concerning executive
compensation to be included in proxy materials.  Nevertheless, there
is still congressional interest in enacting legislation more
stringent than this interpretation.  Order No. 92-254 A.

CONSTITUTIONALITY OF COMPELLING DISCLOSURES CONCERNING MOTION PICTURE
ALTERATIONS

By Henry Cohen, American Law Division.  5 pages.  Although movie
marquees and posters, and video cassette casings and boxes, serve to
identify a film and the individuals associated with it, they also
implicitly propose a commercial transaction.  If the bill required
that a film itself disclose information, a better case could be made
that the bill regulated noncommercial speech.  As it is, however, it
appears more likely that the bill would be viewed as regulating
solely commercial speech.  Order No. 92-256 A.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FUNDING ISSUES:  FY 1993; ISSUE BRIEF

By Angela Evans, Education and Public Welfare Division.  Each year
Congress decides funding levels for all programs within the
Department of Education (ED).  Most ED programs are discretionary.
This means that the annual appropriation determines the amount of
funding that will be available to support program activities for a
given fiscal year.  During the process Congress deliberates what
might be appropriate levels of funding for ED programs, how these
levels differ from previous year funding levels, how programs might
be changed to effect savings, and how funding for ED programs
complies with the budget enforcement provisions to restrain spending
on domestic discretionary programs.  Order No. IB92048.

By Joseph P. Riva, Jr., Science Policy Research Division.  7 pages.
Giant oil fields are among the most valuable concentrations of
natural wealth on earth.  When developed anywhere, they contribute
significantly to economic and individual well-being.  With its high
standard of living based on high per capita energy consumption, this
has been particularly true for the United States.  New giant fields
are needed to shore up declining domestic oil production, thus
helping to keep energy affordable.  However, almost all undiscovered
domestic giant fields are likely to be site-specific to a relatively
few areas in Alaska and on the outer continental shelves.  Great
controversy reflecting differing societal values surrounds the
development of oil in these areas, but there is a price for not
exploring.  it could be very high.  Order No. 92-265 SPR.

CHINA-U.S. RELATIONS IN A POST-COLD WAR WORLD:  INFO PACK

 The demise of Soviet communism and the disintegration of the Soviet

gives basic background on the PRC and about U.S.-PRC relations,
including the issues of human rights, trade, and nuclear
proliferation and arms control issues.  Included is material on
communism in the PRC.  Order No. IP460C.

CONGRESS AND THE CRISIS IN U.S.-CHINA POLICY, 1991

By Robert G. Sutter, Office of Senior Specialists.  24 pages.  The
debate between the Bush Administration and its congressional backers,
and a large bipartisan group of critics in Congress over U.S. policy
toward China went through three general states in 1991.  The first
stage saw congressional criticism of China, and Bush Administration
policy toward China, moderate in late 1990 and early 1991.  There was
an outpouring of congressional criticism of China on human rights,
trade, and arms proliferation issues, and criticism of the Bush
Administration's "failed" China policy.  The third state came after
critical votes on conditional most favored nation legislation in
July.  At year's end, all sides in the debate anticipated continued
strong congressional criticism of Chinese practices and Bush
Administration policy.  Order No. 92-324 S.

THE ISRAELI ECONOMY AND ITS EXTERNAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS:  AN OVERVIEW

By Patricia Wertman, Economics Division.  34 pages.  This report
examines the performance of the Israeli economy between 1985 and
1990.  The results of Israel's 1985 stabilization program are
discussed.  Particular emphasis is placed upon Israel's external
sector, that is, its export performance and its level of external
indebtedness.  The report concludes that Israel's stabilization
policy has been largely successful, but that the economy requires
significant resource transfers from abroad.  The recent surge of
immigration into Israel is likely to place fundamental economic
patterns under stress, particularly the near-monopoly structure of
Israel's labor market.  The future outlook of the Israeli economy
and, particularly, its future debt-servicing capacity are tied to
these issues.  Order No. 92-276 E.

YUGOSLAVIA:  NATIONALISM AND ETHNIC RELATIONS:  SELECTED REFERENCES,
1989-1992

By Valentin Leskovsek, Library Services Division.  22 pages.  Events
in Yugoslavia in the last few years have exposed the fragile unity of
a loosely knit, multinational federation.  After the Second World
War, Tito's communism kept an iron hand on the ethnic tensions.  With
his death, the political polarization along ethnic, religious, and
economic lines resurfaced, and national antagonisms rendered a
peaceful solution impossible.  Seeing no way out of a constitutional
stalemate, Slovenia and Croatia each voted for a peaceful separation
and independence.  This brought the armed intervention of the
Yugoslav army wishing to prevent federal disintegration, a step that
pushed the country into a civil war.  This short bibliography of
selected books and articles deals with the present Yugoslav crisis.

REORGANIZING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY:  LANDMARK
COMMISSIONS

By Ronald C. Moe, Government Division.  54 pages.  In most recent
Congresses, including the 102nd Congress, bills have been introduced,
considered, and occasionally passed to establish a commission to
comprehensively study the organization and management of the
executive branch.  Reference is often made during consideration of
proposals to earlier similar commissions (e.g. Hoover Commissions,
Ash Council).  This report provides a summary and analysis of major
("landmark") executive branch study commissions in this century.  The
objective is to place these commissions, their recommendations and
results, into a philosophical and historical context.  Order No. 92-
293 GOV.

ANTITRUST LAW AND JOINT ACTIVITY BY HOSPITALS

By Janice E. Rubin, American Law Division.  9 pages.  Some concern
has been expressed that the federal antitrust laws may be unduly
hindering some hospitals from undertaking joint activities--including
the sharing of technology or expensive medical equipment--which they
believe are necessary in order to maximize the efficiency of their
operations.  Indeed, many hospital administrators are afraid that if
they even talk to each other, much less undertake joint programs,
they will automatically violate the antitrust laws, which prohibit
the anticompetitive consequences of certain actions.  This report,
therefore, will first get out some of the more important concepts in
antitrust law which are pertinent to the issue of joint activity by
hospitals.  It will conclude, after establishing a context, with some
possible congressional or hospital actions to reduce the likelihood
of antitrust challenges.  Order No. 92-269 A.

BREAST CANCER

By Judith A. Johnson, Science Policy Research Division.  2 pages.
For women, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer.  The
National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates that in 1992 46,000 women
will die of breast cancer and 180,000 new cases will be diagnosed.
Controversy continues over the use of mammography in screening
asymptomatic women for the early detection of breast cancer.  A 1990
National Institutes of Health consensus development conference
concluded that lumpectomy is as effective as mastectomy in treating
early breast cancer.  Despite this, only 20 percent of women eligible
for lumpectomy have this new procedure.  Debate persists over whether
breast cancer patients with negative lymph nodes should receive
adjuvant therapy with its attendant risks when only a small
percentage of those treated will actually benefit.  Order No. 92-279

OVARIAN CANCER

By Judith A. Johnson, Science Policy Research Division.  2 pages.
Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality,
behind lung, breast, and colo-rectal.  The National Cancer Institute
(NCI) estimates that in 1992 13,000 women will die of ovarian cancer
and 21,000 new cases will be diagnosed.  Ovarian cancer is difficult
to diagnose because it often imitates other diseases.  Recent
research indicates that if it is detected early, a cure is possible.
NCI is supporting research in a number of institutions to evaluate
the usefulness of early screening methods in the detection of ovarian
cancer.  Order No. 92-280 SPR.

WOMEN WITH HIV INFECTION

By Judith A. Johnson, Science Policy Research Division.  6 pages.
Although, at present, women account for only 10 percent of AIDS cases
reported to CDC, women are the fastest growing group in the HIV
epidemic.  The route of HIV exposure in women is shifting from IV
drug use to heterosexual contact.  Because the medical conditions
experienced by many HIV-infected women are not included in the CDC
AIDS definition, women often are diagnosed and treated later than
men.  Also, women may not qualify for benefit payments because their
symptoms differ from men's.  Order No. 92-281 SPR.

ATTORNEY'S FEES:  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE
ENGLISH RULE

By Harry Cohen, American Law Division.  In the United States, each
party to a lawsuit ordinarily must pay its own attorneys' fees.
Courts generally may order the losing party to pay the winning
party's fees only when authorized by statute.  This is known as the
"American rule," in contrast with the English rule, under which the
losing party routinely pays the attorneys' fees of the prevailing
party.  The President's Council on Competitiveness has proposed that
Congress adopted the English rule in cases brought in federal court
on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.  The proposal has been
introduced by Representative Fish and by Senator Grassley as section
3 of the Access to Justice Act of 1992, H.R. 4155 and S. 2180, 102nd

PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW ABROGATING RESTRICTIONS ON POSSESSION OF
FIREARMS BY CONVICTED FELONS

By P.L. Morgan, American Law Division.  Federal law prohibits a
felon, convicted by state or federal authorities, from possessing
firearms.  Most states have similar laws.  Relief from this
disability arising from a federal conviction for crimes against the
United States can come from a Presidential pardon.  The diverse
states have several methods of authorizing felons to possess
firearms, though not all do.  Eliminating the state prohibition also
has the effect of authorizing the felon to legally possess firearms
under federal law.  This report briefly describes the state laws
prohibiting possession of firearms by felons and the provisions, if
any, for voiding those restrictions.  Order No. 92-262 A.

ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND GASOLINE EXCISE TAX RATES ADJUSTED FOR
INFLATION

By Louis Alan Talley and Brian W. Cashell, Economics Division.  5
pages.  This report provides inflation-adjusted excise tax rates for
alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline products, a brief history of the tax
rates since November 1951, and current revenues.  Each commodity had
rate increases as part of the Revenue Act of 1951.  This tax act was
born from revenue needs dictated by military expenditures brought
about by the Korean conflict.  Revenue needs for budget deficit
reduction purposes caused rate increases in all of these excise taxes
as part of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990.  Order No. 92-263
E.

THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX FOR INDIVIDUALS

By Gregg A. Esenwein, Economics Division.  5 pages.  Many individuals
are able to take advantage of the preferences and incentives in the
individual tax code to reduce their income taxes and avoid paying
their share of the tax burden.  To address this problem of fairness
while still preserving the social and economic incentives in the tax
code, Congress enacted the individual minimum tax.  Since its
inception, the value and effectiveness of the minimum tax has
routinely been the focus of congressional debate.  Order No. 92-304
E.

INCOME TAX PAYMENTS BY FOREIGN-CONTROLLED CORPORATIONS

By Harry G. Gourevitch, Office of Senior Specialists.  9 pages.  In
recent years allegations have been made that domestic corporations
controlled by foreign investors are less profitable and pay less
income tax than domestic corporations controlled by U.S. investors,
and that as a result the United States may be losing billions of
dollars in tax revenue annually.  This report examines the evidence
as to the low profitability of foreign-controlled corporations
compared to U.S.-controlled ones.  Order No. 92-261 S.

THE QUESTION OF INDEXING CAPITAL GAINS BY REGULATION

By Harry G. Gourevitch, Office of Senior Specialists.  7 pages.
Proposals have recently been made to index capital gains for
inflation by amending current Treasury regulations rather than the
Internal Revenue Code.  Advocates of this approach point out that it
is not unusual for the Treasury Department to revoke regulations
outstanding and to issue new ones in their place.  This report
examines the issues raised by these proposals.  Order No. 92-286 S.

considering various proposals for a tax allowance for interest
payments on educational loans.  This report presents data on the
amount of educational debt of some students and briefly discusses
issues of tax equity and efficiency, of subsidizing education through

TAX PROPOSALS: A BRIEF COMPARISON OF THE HOUSE, SENATE, AND
ADMINISTRATION ALTERNATIVES

By Jack Taylor and David L. Brumbaugh, Economics Division.  9 pages.
As March 1991, enters its closing weeks, Congress is moving toward
final consideration of three alternative tax plans:  one sponsored by
the President; one passed by the House; and one approved by the
Senate.  The plans are similar in certain broad respects; all contain
saving and investment incentives designed to improve economic
performance, and all contain a number of provisions whose stated goal
in to assist families or to promote health, education, and home
ownership.  The details of the plans, however, differed widely.

TAX PROVISIONS EXPIRING IN 1992

By David L. Brumbauch, Economics division.  6 pages.  As Congress
debates alternative tax plans in 1992, one question it is considering
is the fate of 12 temporary tax provisions that are scheduled to
expire at the end of June 1992.  In each case, the immediate issue is
whether to let the particular provision expire, or to extend it or
make it permanent.  And while each of the so-called "extenders" is
unique, at a very general level they all pose a similar questions:
each extender is a tax benefit for a particular activity, and each
results in a loss of tax revenue.  In each case, is the activity the
provision promotes beneficial enough to warrant government support
and the resulting revenue loss and diversion of resources from other
uses?  Order No. 92-273 E.

TAX RATES AND THE MARRIAGE PENALTY

By Robert B. Burdette, American Law Division.  2 pages.  This report
examines the rate schedules and tables applied for purposes of
calculating liability under the federal income tax.  One frequently
asked question concerning the rate schedules is why taxable income
reported by an unmarried individual is taxed at a higher rate than a
like amount of taxable income reported by a married couple filing
jointly.  This is an anomaly of having graduated rates applicable to
different types of taxpayers.  Order No. 92-319 A.

By David J. Cantor, Economics Division.  4 pages.  Foreign
competition--as measured by the import penetration rate--increased
significantly in many U.S. markets over the past 20 years.  In 1975,
the average import market share of 42 manufacturing sectors was about
9.4 percent; in 1989, import penetration for these sectors averaged
about 22.2 percent, or more than twice the rate in 1975.  Order No.

JAPANESE-U.S. TRADE RELATIONS:  COOPERATION OR CONFRONTATION:  ISSUE
BRIEF

By William H. Cooper, Economics Division.  With Japan the United
States has one of its most important and, at the same time, one of
its most difficult, trading relationships.  Japan is an important
market for U.S. exports and source of U.S. imports.  But large U.S.
trade deficits with Japan and problems with access to Japanese
markets for U.S. exports have been sources of friction that, at
times, approach confrontation, threatening the health of the
alliance.  Order No. IB92057.

enhance corporation operations and macroeconomic analysis shows
little, if any, net employment effects, a micro view shows that
consequences for certain sectors of U.S. labor markets, including

1991, President bush signed into law H.J. Res. 346 (P.L. 102-197)
enacting the bilateral trade agreement that he and Soviet President
Gorbachev signed in June 1990.  The subsequent dissolution of the
USSR into twelve independent states loosely organized into the

TRADE:  ISSUE BRIEF

By Lenore Sek and William Cooper, Economics Division.  During its
second session, the attention of the 102nd Congress is becoming more
closely focused on trade and related issues.  Many members, mirroring
the concerns of their constituents over the effects of import
penetration in some key sectors and over foreign unfair trade
practices, are considering legislation to alter U.S. trade policy.
Congress may be called on to evaluate multilateral and regional
arrangements that are currently under negotiation.  Trade may also
play a role in the Presidential campaign and congressional campaigns
as part of the debate over U.S. economic policy during and after the

DRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNet
January, 1996

LEGALIZATION MOVEMENT GETS BOOST

"It is our judgement that the war on drugs has failed," writes National
Review Editor William Buckley in the latest edition of the conservative
magazine. The issue includes articles favoring drug legalization by many
long-time legalization advocates, including: Ethan Nadelmann, director of
the Lindesmith Center; Steven B. Duke, a Yale University Law Professor;
Joseph D. McNamara, a former police chief; Kurt Schmoke, Mayor of
Baltimore; Thomas Szasz a Psychiatrist at Syracuse University, and Robert
W. Sweet, a federal judge in New York.

Buckley writes in the lead article that the war on drugs "is diverting
intelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, that
it is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial, and
penal procedures associated with police states." He said that the series of
articles in National Review was designed to mobilize "fresh thought on the
drug problem." However, prominent law enforcement and political leaders
from both major political parties sharply condemned the magazine.

DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine said that legalization would be a
disaster and that "As a citizen, I'm appalled at adding one more social 
ill to a country that already has AIDS and murders."

Former Drug Czar and Education Secretary William Bennett said that
"National Review's position on drug legalization is bankrupt morally,
intellectually and, thank god, politically."
In his National Review article Ethan Nadelmann said the "drug
enforcement/treatment complex" is so "hooked on government dollars that
the anti-drug crusade has become a vested interest." Nadelmann also had
harsh words for DEA's "ideologically driven bureaucrats who intimidate
and persecute doctors for prescribing pain medication in medically
appropriate doses, who hobble methadone programs with their
overregulation, who acknowledge that law enforcement cannot alone solve
the drug problem but then proceed to undermine innovative public health
initiatives."

Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke recommended that the war on drugs be
fought as a "public-health war." Under this system, he explains, the
government would set up a regulatory regime to "pull addicts into the
public-health system. The Government, not criminal traffickers, would
control the price, distribution, and purity of addictive substances-which it
already does with prescription drugs. This would take most of the profit out
of drug trafficking, and it is the profits which drive the crime," says
Schmoke.
He also recommended an expansion of needle exchange programs and
called the war on drugs "our domestic Vietnam."

Joseph McNamara, Former police chief (in Kansas City, Mo., and San Jose
Ca.) said the "military industrial complex pales in comparison to the host of
industries catering to our national puritanical hypocrisy-researchers willing
to tell the government what it wants to hear, prison builders, correction and
parole officers's associations, drug testing companies, dubious purveyors
of anti-drug education."

Robert Sweet, a District Judge in New York City argues that the rights of
the individual have been curtailed in the name of the War on Drugs. "We
have seen the elimination of an accused's right to pretrial release for most
charges under drug laws; heightened restrictions on post-conviction bail;
and invasions into the attorney-client relationship through criminal
forfeiture"

He also states that the "fundamental flaw, which will ultimately destroy this
prohibition as it did the last one, is that criminal sanctions cannot, and
should not attempt to, prohibit personal conduct, which does no harm to
others." He does not address the tragedy of drug addicted babies.

Thomas Szasz, of the Department of Psychiatry at Syracuse University,
charges that the war on drugs is a mass movement characterized by the
demonizing of drugs, addicts, and traffickers as the incarnations of evil. "It
is foolish to dwell on the drug prohibitionist's failure to attain his avowed
aims. Since he wages war on evil, his very effort is synonymous with
success. It is a fatal weakness of prudential critiques of drug policy 
that they ignore the Treligious' character of the war on drugs," says Szasz.

He asks that the right analogy for America's war on drugs is not the
Vietnam war, but communism. Szasz further suggests that "self-
medication" is a basic human right and drug criminalization is sinful.

Steven Duke, Law of Science and Technology Professor at Yale Law
School argues that under legalization, with drugs regulated by the
government, the "proportion of users who would consume drugs without
substantial health or other problems would be greatly increased. He writes
that the only benefit to America in maintaining prohibition is the "psychic
comfort we derive from having a permanent scapegoat. We would be better
off blaming our ills on celestial invaders flying about in flying saucers."

COPS PROGRAM FACES 25% CUT

The COPS police hiring program faces a 25% cut under a six week
continuing resolution enacted by Congress and signed by the President.
Bipartisan negotiations between the White House and Congress produced
another stopgap spending bill to keep the entire federal government running
through March 15. Also facing a 25% cut were the Ounce of Prevention
Council and the drug courts program.

Republicans abandoned their strategy to use government shutdowns as
leverage to advance their balanced-budget goals. Congress and the
administration produced a bill (HR 2880) that combined short-term funding
for nine Cabinet departments whose annual budgets have yet to become law
with full fiscal 1996 funding for foreign aid.

The Congressional budget ax would continue to nick but not behead some
cherished Clinton initiatives, including not only the COPS program, but
also the AmeriCorps National Service program, and subsidies for
community development financial institutions. Funding for these would
continue at a pro-rated level of 75 percent of last year's funding, at least
through March 15. The bill also would end 10 programs, mostly education
grants.

The measure also served as a vehicle for carrying a host of lower-profile
initiatives into law, including a ban on federal funding of fetal embryo
research, restrictions on excessive travel by Cabinet members and the sale
of $100 million worth of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Preserve.

The House passed the much-revised bill Jan. 25 on a 371-42 vote after a
full day of negotiations in the office of Appropriations Committee Chairman
Robert L. Livingston, R-La., finally produced a compromise that all sides
could live with.  The Senate cleared the bill the next day, 82-8, after
defeating Democratic amendments to raise the statutory debt limit and
restore spending on education to fiscal 1995 levels.

President Clinton signed it into law by the midnight Jan. 26 deadline. The
measure provided funding through March 15 at fiscal 1996 conference
levels for the departments of Commerce, Justice, State, Veterans Affairs,
and HUD and other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection
Agency. Clinton earlier had vetoed both the Commerce, Justice and State
bill and the VA-HUD measure.

Programs funded under the Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education bill (HR 2880) and the vetoed Interior spending measure (HR
2880) would be financed at fiscal 1995 levels or the House- or Senate-
passed levels, whichever is lowest. Meanwhile, House-Senate negotiators
on the District of Columbia spending bill (HR 2880) said that final action is
imminent on the measure after they reached agreement on a controversial
school voucher plan.

The final product reflected an unusual degree of bipartisanship, given the
rancor displayed during the two prior partial federal shutdowns. With the
House, Senate and the administration all seeking to avoid another
shutdown, the frequently intense negotiations required give on all sides.

Conspicuously absent was any effort to put more pressure on Clinton.  "We
want to get a signable bill," said Dan Meyer, the top aide to House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., as the talks were in the late stages.

LEGALIZATION MOVEMENT GETS BOOST

"It is our judgement that the war on drugs has failed," writes National
Review Editor William Buckley in the latest edition of the conservative
magazine. The issue includes articles favoring drug legalization by many
long-time legalization advocates, including: Ethan Nadelmann, director of
the Lindesmith Center; Steven B. Duke, a Yale University Law Professor;
Joseph D. McNamara, a former police chief; Kurt Schmoke, Mayor of
Baltimore; Thomas Szasz a Psychiatrist at Syracuse University, and Robert
W. Sweet, a federal judge in New York.

Buckley writes in the lead article that the war on drugs "is diverting
intelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, that
it is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial, and
penal procedures associated with police states." He said that the series of
articles in National Review was designed to mobilize "fresh thought on the
drug problem." However, prominent law enforcement and political leaders
from both major political parties sharply condemned the magazine.

DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine said that legalization would be a
disaster and that "As a citizen, I'm appalled at adding one more social ill 
to a country that already has AIDS and murders."

Former Drug Czar and Education Secretary William Bennett said that
"National Review's position on drug legalization is bankrupt morally,
intellectually and, thank god, politically."

TOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS

"Drug law enforcement has proven to be an effective and integral part of the
battle against illicit drugs and crime in United States," writes former
Michigan State Drug Czar Robert E. Peterson in a fact-filled new report
entitled, The Success of Tough Drug Enforcement.
Peterson uses scores of Justice Department studies to explain and describe
the positive impact of drug enforcement.

The report notes that from 1986-1992, a 13% rise in drug enforcement
manpower brought about a 39% increase in violent crime arrests and a
110% increase in heroin/cocaine trafficking arrests. Since 1980 drug
incarceration rates have increased over 400%. Peterson says that this
increased incarceration had let to the plummeting of murder rates and
narcotics related homicides in most American cities.

"Contrary to popular belief, most drug convicts, and nearly all drug
inmates, are repeat or violent offenders." Thus, getting them off the streets
sharply reduces crime.

Although some advocates for decriminalization of drugs state that U.S.
prisons are bursting with first time or minor offenders, Peterson finds
"Over 93% of state inmates are repeat and/or violent offenders and first time
non-violent marijuana inmates constitute only 1/10 of 1% of the prison
population. He also notes that the average amount of drugs in a marijuana
trafficking case is 3.5 tons, and for cocaine it is 180 pounds. Over 80% of
crack cases involve trafficking of an average quantity of over 18,000 crack
doses.

The report states that although the odds of imprisonment for drugs have
increased over the last ten years, the nation is still far too lenient with
drug felons.  A person, Peterson says, is more likely to go to a federal
prison for violating federal tax, regulatory, immigration, or liquor laws than
for possessing heroin, crack or marijuana.

Nonetheless, those drug criminals that are placed behind bars, result in a
significant cost savings to the public. This is due to the fact that most drug
felons are repeat offenders, many involved with drugs. One study found
that heroin users committed more that 200 crimes per year to support their
drug habit.

The cost of incarcerating criminals averages $20,000 to $27,000 per year.
The estimated cost to society for crimes committed by the average released
criminal, range from $172,000 to $2.36 million per year. Under these
figures, based on several recent federal, state, and think tank studies, it
costs society at least seven times less money to keep someone in prison than
to let them go free.

Peterson strongly supports drug treatment, both for those who are in prison
and for those who are not.  However, he warns that without a regular regimen
of drug testing, treatment failure rates increase.  "Self-reports, counselor
reports, and infrequent or random drug testing significantly under-reports
individual drug use," says Peterson.  He cites a program in Lansing Michigan
which has kept 75% of participants drug-free over a five year period.  As part
of this program drug offenders are drug tested three times per week.  If
tested positive participants face a first sanction of three days in jail, a
second sanction of ten days in jail, a third sanction of 20 days jail and 30
days for each positive drug test thereafter.  Only a small proportion of
program participants ever served jail time.  Although counseling and support
groups (such as AA or NA) were provided, success rates did not vary among
those who participated in these activities.

Another area touched on in the report was the remarkable cost effectiveness
of the Drug Enforcement Administration-through bringing in asset
forfeiture funds. From 1990 to 1993 DEA's budget was $2.7 billion while
$2.2 billion in drug assets were forfeited to the United States. In 1990 an
average of over $250,000 was forfeited by drug dealers for each DEA
Special Agent.

An entire chapter of The Success of Tough Drug Enforcement is dedicated to
analysis of drug enforcement and race.  Peterson find that racial disparities
for drug offenses were lower than that for other crimes, such as murder,
robbery, and violent crime.  Generally, he explains, arrest and incarceration
rates are correlated with victimization rates, crime rates, and complaint
rates.  For example, the robbery rate among blacks is over three times that of
whites and the robbery convictions for blacks is two times that of whites in
state courts.  The rape conviction rate was nearly two times higher for whites
than blacks, and rape victims also were nearly twice as likely to be white.

Overall, blacks were victims of  violence at a rate of 40% higher than that of
whites and arrests of blacks were 39% higher than they were for whites.
Time served by drug offenders also does not vary significantly by race. For
drug trafficking offenses, blacks serve an average of 6% less time in prison
than whites.

Peterson makes a series of drug control policy recommendations in the
report. He suggests that drug enforcement efforts target youth with
sentences that include "strict zero tolerance drug testing" with  treatment
imposed by courts and probation departments. More serious repeat and
violent youth offenders "must be incapacitated and kept from victimizing
communities," he said.

The report also recommends a radical overhaul of probation and parole.
"The current failure rate of those on community release and lack of
consequences for violators indicate that this a weak link in the criminal
justice systems," Peterson says." The earlier that tough, but fair,
community release sanctions and conditions are applied, the greater the
likelihood of deterring crime and drug use, he argues.

Finally, Peterson recommends tougher marijuana enforcement, which has
become, he argues, "far too lax" while use of the drug by youth has rapidly
escalated. The proportion of violent juveniles on marijuana when arrested
has climbed and high school use of the drug has doubled in the last several
years. Peterson recommends that public benefits, student aid, and other
privileges be suspended, reduced, or conditioned on cessation of drug use
and criminal activity. Hefty finds and license revocations can be invoked
and public service conditions applied to repeat marijuana offenders.

The report's author, Robert Peterson served as Governor John Engler's
Drug Control Director from 1991-1995 where he Administered and
evaluated education, health, and law enforcement grant programs. Before
that he served as a prosecutor in Buffalo and a policy adviser to
Pennsylvania's Attorney General. He currently runs his own consulting
firm, PAE Services, Inc., which specializes in evaluating drug control
programs. Peterson can be reached at (607) 786-1845. Individual copies of
the report are available at $20 each from PAE.

NEW DRUG CZAR NAMED

U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey, named the new Director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy during President Clinton's January 24
State of the Union Address, is expected to promote closer cooperation
between drug trafficking and producing countries to fight the narcotics trade
in his new job as President Clinton's drug czar.

Clinton said during his nationally televised speech, "General McCaffrey has
earned three purple hearts and two silver stars fighting for this country.
Tonight I ask that he lead our nation's battle against drugs at home and
abroad. To succeed, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded
before. He needs all of us - every one of us has a role to play on this team.
Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one
more time."

 The general's stint as commander-in-chief of the United States Southern
Command in Panama included collaboration among Latin American
countries, especially Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, in the war on drugs.

"McCaffrey has praised the Andean range countries, where most of the
cultivation of cocaine takes place, of working together. He has always said
when countries work together, they benefit economically and socially," a
military spokesman said.

McCaffrey is a veteran of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars known for his tough
yet conciliatory style, McCaffrey, 53, was assigned in February 1994 as
commander-in-chief of Southcom, which is responsible for all U.S. military
activities in Latin America south of Mexico.

Some Army officials wondered though whether he did the right thing in
accepting the anti-drug post because as the highest decorated officer, he was
in line to become the next Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Some Panamanian officials hope he will make a case to keep some U.S.
troops in Panama after the canal treaties expire in the year 2000, especially
Howard Air Force Base which serves as the South American headquarters
of the  U.S. military's anti-drug trafficking efforts.

American AWACs reconnaissance aircraft fly regular missions from the
base to seek out drug planes flying up from South America towards Central
America and Mexico.

"They've given us information about flight plans of drug traffickers and
helped us detect shipments," said Panama's anti-drug chief Gabriel Castro.

Previously, General McCaffrey served as Director for Strategic Plans and
Policy, Joint Staff, from 1993 to 1994, and as Assistant to the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1992 to 1993.  From 1990 to 1992, General
McCaffrey commanded the 24th Infantry Division, which he deployed to
Saudi Arabia in 1990.  He led the Division on combat operations during
Operation Desert Storm, for which he was awarded the Distinguished
Service Medal.

From 1989 to 1990, General McCaffrey served as Director for Strategy,
Plans, Policy and Joint Affairs for the Department of the Army.  He served
as the Deputy U.S. Military Representative to the NATO Military
Committee from 1988 to 1989.  He has also taught American Government,
National Security Studies and Comparative Politics at the United States
Military Academy at West Point.

General McCaffrey has been decorated for valor twice with the
Distinguished Service Cross - our nation's second highest award for valor
in combat - twice with the Silver Star, three times with the Bronze Star, and
was three times awarded with the Purple Heart for wounds received in
combat.  He is the most highly decorated Army General on active duty.
General McCaffrey received the NAACP Roy Wilkins Renown Service
Award in 1991, and the U.S. Department of State's Superior Honor Award
in 1992. He is a 1964 graduate of the United States Military Academy at
West Point, and earned a Master of Arts degree in civil government from
American University.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was established in
1988 and is organized within the Executive Office of the President.
ONDCP's mission is to develop and coordinate the policies, goals and
objectives of the nation's drug control program for reducing the use of illicit
drugs.  The ONDCP Director is the Administration's primary spokesperson
for drug issues, and develops and coordinates the National Drug Control
Strategy.

VIOLENT CRIME COMMISSION ISSUES REPORTS

The first report of a bipartisan commission on violent crime finds that
despite a welcome decline in crime rates in many U.S. cities, the chances
that Americans will be victims of violent crime remains at an historic high.
The report also deplored the "revolving door" American criminal justice
system in which one of three criminals are supposedly under the
supervision of the justice system at the very time that they murder, rape and
commit other serious crime.

The report, entitled The State of Violent Crime in America, was issued by
the Council on Crime in America, which is co-chaired by former U.S.
Attorney General Griffin B. Bell and Former Drug Czar William J. Bennett.

According to the report, the risk of becoming a victim of violent crime today
exceeds many significant life risks, including injury in a motor vehicle
accident and death from heart disease. Much violent crime, moreover, goes
unreported. The actual number of violent crimes in 1993 (10.9 million) was
5.6 times higher than the number of violent crimes reported to the police
(1.9 million).

"This study paints a realistic and sobering picture of violent crime in
America, but it is not without its ray of hope," said Bennett. "If the success
that cities such as New York and Houston have had in reducing crime rates
teaches us anything, it is that the common sense of the American people is
right when it comes to crime: tough law enforcement is part of the solution,
not part of the problem."

The report attempts to refute some myths about incarceration rates in the
U.S. It found, for example, that the American prison system imprisons just
one criminal for every 100 violent crimes.

John Walters, who served in the Drug Czar's office during the Bush
Administration, is the Council's Executive Director. Other Council members
are former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, Florida Attorney General
Robert Butter-worth, Princeton University Professor John DiIulio,
California Board of Prison Terms Commissioner John Gillis, Indianapolis
Mayor Stephen Goldsmith and Colorado Attorney General Gale Northon.

HOW TO KILL MANUAL CRITICIZED

The instructions are precise and clinical, with gruesome detail to clearly
explain the best way to kill.

"At least three shots should be fired to insure quick and sure death. Aim for
the head-preferably the eye sockets if you are a sharp shooter."
That's just what James Edward Perry did when he walked into a suburban
Maryland home outside Washington in 1993 and pulled the trigger of his
rifle, killing two women before suffocating a severely disabled child in an
alleged  murder-for-hire scheme.
His method, his weapon, his attempted coverup-all allegedly were straight
out of the book, Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors.

Perry was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders. But, according
to a novel lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Maryland, the
book's publishers also
should have to pay.

"This book makes no bones about it. It is simply an instruction manual like
the one you operate your VCR with, but this one tells you how to kill
people," said John Marshall of Rockville, Md., one of the lawyers who
filed the suit.

The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of money from Paladin
Enterprises Inc. and its founder, Peder C. Lund, is believed to be the first
of its kind against a book publisher.

Courts have held magazines like Soldier of Fortune liable for running
advertisements offering hit-man services. But they've yet to hold publishers
responsible for the conduct of someone who learned how to commit crimes
from a book.

Already it's got some legal experts talking about dangerous precedents,
because the case, they say, raises troubling 1st Amendment issues. When
can a court punish publication of truthful information, even information that
has no redeeming value? And if you allow a lawsuit against the book
publisher in this case, what's to stop lawsuits against, for example, makers
of violent movies whose crimes are duplicated in real life?
That's not to say those distinctions can't be drawn, legal experts say, but,
as with most 1st Amendment issues, it would be tricky.

"It would require a change in 1st Amendment analysis to hold publishers
responsible for the crime that ultimately would occur," said Douglas Kmiec,
a  professor at Notre Dame University Law School in South Bend, Ind.

Perry was convicted last year of killing Mildred Horn, her quadriplegic son
and nurse Janice Saunders. He allegedly committed the crimes at the
direction of Horn's ex-husband, Lawrence Horn, who is accused of
ordering the murders to get a $1 million award his son received in a medical
malpractice lawsuit. Horn will stand trial in April.

In Perry's trial, prosecutors cited more than two dozen instances in which
he followed the book to the letter in carrying out the alleged murder-for-hire
scheme. He used the same kind of rifle, rubbed out its serial numbers and
shot the women three times each in the eyes. He also used a homemade
silencer and filed down parts of the rifle, just as the book said.

Furthermore, he allegedly followed the book's suggestions to request
money up front, make the crime scene look like a burglary and discard the
gun. But Dan Hale, a lawyer for the book's publisher, said those things
shouldn't make the Boulder, Colo.-based company liable for Perry's
actions.

"The people who are responsible are the people who committed the crime,"
Hale said. To hold otherwise, he said, would mean scaling back the 1st
Amendment.

The 1st Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and press, does
not protect all speech. The Supreme Court has carved out certain
exceptions, ruling, for example, that speech that is obscene or libelous or
creates a  clear and present danger of imminent lawless action is not always
entitled to  1st Amendment protection. As a result, the government can
restrict it or, in some cases, punish people for engaging in it.

The victims' families in this case argue that the information in "Hit Man"
should be considered unprotected speech, just like libel or defamation. "Our
argument is that there is currently no protection for speech that aids and
abets an illegal transaction," said Rod Smolla, a professor at the College of
William and Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Va., who is also
representing the families. "Because it has absolutely no value of any kind,
it is not protected under the 1st Amendment."

But finding a judge sympathetic to that argument will be difficult, Kmiec
said. Though a libel lawsuit limits speech, it is justified under the 1st
Amendment because the material is false. Here, the material is true-and its
truth only makes it more awful, Kmiec said. "The plaintiff will have to
prove not that the material is false but that it is worthless," Kmiec said.
"There's no directly applicable precedent."

But, as Kmiec noted, deciding what's worthless would be as difficult as
determining what's obscene. Courts have long struggled with trying to
figure  that one out. Hale argued that "culpability lies with Mr. Perry. And if
he conspired with Mr. Horn, he'll  probably be convicted, as well."

The courts will have to decide-meanwhile, the murder manual is still for
sale.

VIRGINIA REFORMS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

Hundreds of violent juvenile offenders would be tried automatically as
adults and face stiffer prison time under a compromise struck last month
between Gov. George Allen and state General Assembly leaders. The
compromise proposal could clear the way for overhauling Virginia's
juvenile justice system, which many say is ill-equipped to handle the
increasingly violent crimes committed by children as young as 14.

Juvenile offenders currently can serve no more than seven years in prison
and must be released when they turn 21, no matter how dangerous they are
deemed to be. Allen, who made juvenile justice reform a top priority of his
legislative agenda this year, was quick to trumpet the bipartisan compromise
at a hastily arranged news conference held just hours after striking the deal.
"This will send a message to young people that we're not just going to give
you a slap on the wrist," Allen said.

The agreement, which resolves differences between two competing plans,
calls for automatically trying as adults all juveniles 14 and older accused of
violent crimes such as murder, rape and forcible sodomy. As part of the
new compromise, juveniles charged with some less-severe  violent
crimes - robbery, carjacking, kidnapping - would be tried as adults  at the
discretion of the local prosecutor.  In addition, judges would be given new
sentencing options beyond  incarceration and probation.

Allen's budget includes $8.5 million for new boot camps and "wilderness
work camps" that are aimed at giving young offenders a second chance
through rehabilitation. Even a juvenile offender sentenced as an adult could
get his or her sentence suspended if a Circuit Court judge chooses to make
use of such alternative programs. "The compromise we offer today reflects
a concern and commitment to be responsive to the vast majority of the
young people who come before the court on minor charges and are in need
of remediation to turn their lives around," said Del. Jerrauld C. Jones, D-
Norfolk, who chaired a legislative task force and helped broker the new
compromise.

The plan also opens long-secretive juvenile court proceedings to the public
when juveniles are charged with felony crimes. Juvenile criminal history
records would also be made public when youths are convicted of felonies.
Attorney General James S. Gilmore III, who headed Allen's advisory
commission, said the compromise struck a careful balance between tougher
sentencing and increased prevention and rehabilitation programs. "We will
prevent, rescue and redirect where and when we can," Gilmore said. "But
we will also punish where we have to, with the paramount concern being
the protection of the community."

The compromise, reached in the opening weeks of the 60-day session, also
reflects the conciliatory tone Allen has taken with the legislature this year,
after watching Democrats kill most of his initiatives in last year's more
polarized session. "Obviously, you can't do things with just Republicans
alone," Allen said. "I think this is a good sign for this session of the
General Assembly."

The actual, practical effect of the plan, if approved, may be difficult to
measure and could vary by locality.  Prosecutors say many of the most
violent juveniles, such as those who commit murder, are already tried as
adults. Judges increasingly transfer teen-agers into adult courts in response
to soaring juvenile crime rates,  they say.

But administration officials say the proposed automatic transfer would target
hundreds more violent teen-agers who now escape any serious punishment
in the juvenile system.  A state study found that of 1,400 juveniles aged 14
and older charged with violent crimes in 1993, fewer than 20 percent were
tried as adults.

Under the juvenile system, the average prison time served for murder was
less than six years. Juveniles who commit rape serve less than five years on
average. And those who commit armed robbery serve about a year,
administration figures show. "I think that sends the wrong message," Allen
said. "Most people say this is just ridiculous."  But critics, who packed a
committee hearing Wednesday, said the plan offers nothing but a simplistic
"harsher-is-better" philosophy.

"That may be the stuff of good politics," said Judith Bennett, of the
Virginia Council of Churches. "It is not the stuff of which sound public
policy is made."  There is little evidence in other states to suggest that
sentencing children as adults will reduce crime, said Julie McConnell,
associate director of the American  Civil Liberties Union's Virginia chapter.

"It is an abdication of our obligation as adults to protect and guide  children
into responsible and socially productive lives," McConnell said.

But few dispute the need to crack down on violent juvenile crime, which
has increased by 36 percent since 1975, according to a study by the Joint
Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the General Assembly's
investigative  arm. To fund the plan, Allen has included $16.7 million in a
bond package that would pay for a renovation and expansion of the
Southampton Correctional  Center, which would house violent juveniles
who are sentenced as adults.

Overall, Allen's budget includes nearly $200 million to meet the rising costs
of a burgeoning juvenile justice system, although more than half that figure
comes from bonds to build new juvenile prisons.  Those bonds include
about $41.6 million in debt already authorized by the legislature to renovate
the Beaumont Correctional Center west of Richmond and build a new 180-
bed center in Chesterfield County.

JUDGE SAYS ITS OK TO RUN FROM POLICE

A federal judge who came under fire for tossing out evidence in a
Washington Heights drug case said  that there was little chance he would
reverse his ruling, and he called prosecutors' bid to get him to change his
mind a "juvenile project."

In a three-way conference call with lawyers from his chambers, Judge
Harold Baer, Jr. said he would listen to prosecutors' arguments that drug
evidence and a videotaped confession should not be thrown out in a federal
case against Carol Bayless, 41.

More than once, however, the judge made it clear that he probably would
not change his decision that the police did not have a reasonable suspicion to
pull over Ms. Bayless's car in the Washington Heights section of
Manhattan.

"While I consider it a rather juvenile project to engage in at this juncture,"
Baer said of prosecutors' bid to get him to reconsider his Jan. 24 ruling, "I
don't have a problem in letting them re-argue."

Baer went on to say: "I doubt that the government has anything new and
different that they can show me in the papers or on the law. But so far as I
am concerned, they certainly should have that opportunity."

In a ruling last week that has been criticized by many of the city's and the
state's top officials, Baer refused to allow as evidence 75 pounds of cocaine
and more than 4 pounds of heroin that the police said they had seized from
Ms. Bayless's rented car on Amsterdam Avenue at 5 a.m. on April 21. The
drugs were estimated to have a street value of $4 million.

The judge ruled that the drugs and Ms. Bayless's videotaped confession
were not admissible as evidence because officers stopped her car without
reasonable suspicion.

An officer who saw Ms. Bayless said he suspected criminal activity in part
because four men who had loaded two duffel bags into her trunk ran away
after seeing him.

But Baer, who served on the Mollen Commission, which investigated
police corruption, said that it was not necessarily suspicious behavior for
people to flee the police in Washington Heights, a neighborhood where, he
said, residents regarded police officers as "corrupt, abusive, and violent."

"Had the men not run when the cops began to stare at  them, it would have
been unusual," Baer wrote.

The ruling immediately touched off a firestorm of criticism from politicians
and law enforcement officials, and quickly became fodder for newspaper
editorials and radio talk shows. Critics accused Baer of being more
concerned about protecting criminals than protecting the public, and said
that his comments about the police unfairly maligned hard-working, honest
officers. Police Commissioner William J. Bratton went so far as to say the
judge was "living in a fantasy land."

Baer, a 1994 Clinton administration appointee to the federal bench, has
repeatedly declined to speak to the public or the press about his ruling and
its potential impact on law enforcement efforts. During the 10-minute
hearing no one mentioned the publicity or criticism that the ruling has
attracted for more than a week.

But the judge's remarks are the first indication of how he would view
prosecutors' efforts to persuade him to change his mind. His remarks were
included in a 10-page transcript of the hearing released late on Friday.

A spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the judge's latest remarks
were relayed  to the mayor, who had harshly criticized the judge's original
decision.

"The mayor is hopeful that Judge Baer's decision will be reversed so a
confessed drug dealer will not go free," the spokesman, Colleen Roche,
said on Friday night. Ms. Roche added that the mayor would not
specifically comment on what the judge said.

A spokesman for Gov. George Pataki said the governor would have no
comment beyond his earlier criticism of the ruling.

In a conference call prosecutors asked the judge for more time to prepare
papers on the issue. But Jay Holtmeier, assistant U.S. attorney, said
prosecutors plan to ask Bear to reopen the hearing on the motion to
suppress evidence.
"Reopening the hearing had never been an item that I had focused on at all,"
Baer told him. "So I am not clear how I come out."

Ramon W. Pagan, Ms. Bayless's lawyer, argued that the prosecutors
should not be permitted to ask Baer to reconsider his decision.

"I think they are trying to create something which is very new and unusual,"
Pagan said. "If they lose a case, they want to redo it again and do an instant
replay, without the direction of the Court of Appeals, and that is not the
way." Baer said prosecutors still had seveal more days to file their motion
for reconsideration.

CRIME DISCUSSED AT STATE OF UNION ADDRESS

President Clinton, preparing to embark on his re-election campaign,
dedicated a significant chunk of his State of the Union Address to crime
issues.

He said during the speech, "At last we have begun to find the way to reduce
crime, forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch
criminals and to prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing is
clearly working," Clinton said.

He cited declining Violent crime rates. In New York City, murders are
down 25%, in St. Louis 18%, in Seattle 32%.  But, he said,  we still have a
long way to go before our streets are safe and our and our people are free of
fear.  He told the audience of Members of Congress that the Crime Bill of
1994 "is critical to the success of community policing. It provides funds for
100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We are already a third of
the way there and I challenge Congress to finish the job.  Let us stick with
the strategy that's working, and keep the crime rate coming down."

Clinton also asked all Americans to respect and support our law
enforcement officers, and told police, "our children need you as role models
and heroes. Don't let them down."

In spite of its unpopularity with the current Congress, Clinton reported that
the Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records
from buying guns. He also said that the assault weapons ban is keeping 19
kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. "I challenge the
Congress to keep those laws on the books," he said.

The President also announced several new initiatives. "Our next step in the
fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the Mob. I
am directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs that
involve juveniles in violent crime and to seek authority to prosecute - as
adults - teenagers who maim and kill like adults," the
President said.

He also offered hope to public housing residents who have been frustrated
with the long legal process usually required for drug-related evictions.
"From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and peddle drugs
should be: One strike and you're out," the President said.

Clinton challenged every state to match federal policy, to assure that
serious, violent criminals serve at least 85% of their sentence.

However, the President also emphasized the importance of drug and crime
prevention programs. He said more police and punishment are important,
but they're not enough. "We have got to keep more of our young people out
of trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, but
developed in communities.  I challenge all of our communities, all of our
adults, to give these children futures to say yes to. And I challenge
Congress not to abandon the Crime Bill's support of these grass-roots
prevention efforts."

Clinton added that to reduce crime and violence, we have to reduce the drug
problem. "The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their
children openly and firmly, and embraces our churches and synagogues,
our youth groups and our schools. I challenge Congress not to cut our
support for drug-free schools. People like D.A.R.E. officers are making a
real impression on grade school children that will give them the strength to
say no when the time comes," he said.

The day after the speech Clinton traveled to Louisville, Kentucky to test his
anti-crime themes on the road. Clinton does not plan to officially announce
his re-election bid until spring. But the State of the Union speech to
Congress and the next day's trip to a state that will be an election-year
battleground effectively launched his campaign.
In a roundtable discussion with police and community leaders, he argued
that Republican efforts to transform the current COPS program into a block
grant program for states should be defeated.

The split over community policing underscores the philosophical divide
between Clinton and the Republican-led Congress over spending and tax
priorities that's led to the budget stalemate.

But Wednesday House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Republicans are ready
to take Clinton up on his budget compromise offer. He suggested that the
White House and Congress agree to a budget "downpayment" of around
$100 billion.

RAP GROUPS TO RAISE MONEY FOR SLAIN OFFICER:

On Sunday, February 18, members of Philadelphia's hip hop community
and Philadelphia police officers will host a benefit for slain police officer
Lauretha Vaird's family. Organized by members of the rap group Da Fat Cat
Clique, the benefit is being held to raise money for the slain officer's family
and to forge a relationship between hip hoppers and cops.  "Too often
people think that rappers are just about violence and crime.  Well, many of
us have jobs and we don't condone nor endorse cop killing.  We think that
this benefit will give us a chance to let the public know that we respect
police officers and that all of us are not negative," said Criz, of Da Fat Cat
Clique.  Several important Philadelphians have been invited to attend the
benefit including Mayor Ed Rendell and Police Commissioner Richard
Neal. There will be performances by rap artists such as Jackal the Bear, Da
Youngstas (Illy Funkstas), The Man They Call Lux, Ital Tha Ruffian and
many more.  The minimum donation to attend the event is only $5 and all
proceeds will benefit the Lauretha Vaird Scholarship Fund.  For more

DETROIT'S POLICE AND SEARS TO HELP HOMELESS:

The Detroit Police Department and Sears announced on February 2 they
would commemorate St. Valentine's Day by helping the homeless.
Commander Ronald Haddad of the Detroit Police Department and Robert
Haddad, Sears district human resource manager, joined forces to create the
"Have a Heart For Detroit," program that involves 15 area Sears stores and
local law enforcement agencies.  Each store will set up drop-off stations in
the package pick-up area to collect used clothing and non-perishable food.
The program runs from Feb. 5 through Feb. 14. "Our offices are dedicated
to community policing and to improving the quality of life for all citizens,"
said Commander Ronald Haddad.  More than 5,300 Sears associates in the
Detroit area are contributing their time and energy to support this drive.  In
addition to the Detroit Police Department, the 314th military intelligence
battalion, a U.S. Army Reserve unit, has volunteered their logistical
expertise as well as offered their base as a collection center. Sydney Boggs,
a Detroit-based candy maker, is providing "A Taste of Detroit" candy heart
to volunteers. Organizations wishing to contribute to the Detroit Police

HUGE FORENSIC SCIENCE CENTER TO OPEN IN FLORIDA:

A new forensic science center is expected to bring thousands of crime lab
workers to St. Petersburg, Florida for training. The National Forensic
Science Technology Center has officially opened for business at St.
Petersburg Junior College's Allstate Center.  It is likely to attract more than
1,000 visitors this year and far more in future years, said Dr. Joan Wood,
Pinellas-Pasco medical examiner and  president of the new center's board of
directors. She said job opportunities  in forensics have been expanding, but
training programs have failed to keep  pace with the demand. "I think we
have a tremendous future ahead of us," she said. This week more than 100
people, most of them from out of state, attended the center's inaugural
three-day workshop, which featured Bruce Weir, a DNA expert who
testified in the O.J. Simpson trial.  Eventually the center could be offering a
workshop every other week, Wood said. It also will be involved in joint
educational programs with the junior college, the University of South
Florida and the University of Central Florida. Other activities will include
research, creation of teaching videos and  computer discs, and development
of industry standards. The center will have a  director and a small support
staff, Wood said.

ATLANTA TARGETS VIOLENT CRIME FOR OLYMPICS:

Atlanta, ranked the most violent U.S. city for the second straight year in a
new survey, is battling to cleanse its image ahead of playing host to the
world for the Olympic Games.  City officials said a private survey that
named Atlanta as the most dangerous U.S. city in violent crime such as
murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, was using outdated statistics
that don't reflect improvements in 1995.  The Morgan Quitno survey, based
on 1994 FBI crime statistics, found Atlanta for the second year in a row to
be the least safe of the 100 largest U.S. cities, or those with more than
100,000 people. The Atlanta Olympics, from July 19 to August 4 this year,
will be the biggest ever, bringing together more than 10,000 athletes from
197 countries. Atlanta officials boast that it will be the most compact Games
in history, with most events and the Olympic Village concentrated in a small
downtown area. But that area is in a high-crime part of the city center where
local residents fear to tread at night. Panhandlers and the homeless are a
frequent sight in the area dubbed "the Olympic Ring." Local journalist Dave
Kindred commented that the Olympic Ring was already crowned with
barbed wire, even at Coca-Cola's world headquarters.

COMMUNITY POLICING BRINGS HOPE TO BAKERSFIELD:

Tony Martinez, a community services specialist with the Bakersfield Police
Department, who has been coordinating city support for projects that
increase neighborhood pride and decrease neighborhood crime. Since April,
Martinez has roamed the neighborhood west of Lakeview Avenue in a van
that touts his Community Oriented and Problem Solving program (COPS).
He has helped set up Neighborhood Watch, clean up vacant lots and
houses, install and replace street lights, remove abandoned vehicles and
increase street police patrols. In addition, the city closed off Gorrill and
Ralston streets at Lakeview  Avenue three years ago to reduce pedestrian
accidents and street-corner drug  dealing. One effect has been that since
June, the neighborhood around Gorrill Street has had only four burglaries,
Martinez said. That's remarkable because it would not have been unusual
for the neighborhood to have four burglaries a  week, he said. "It is the
people in the neighborhood who are taking care of each other," Martinez
said.  Citizens credit Martinez with helping to make changes in the
neighborhood. "Now there is someone to talk to, to listen to our problems
and explain what can be done" one resident said.

DEPARTING DRUG CZAR SLAMS ADIDAS SPORTS SHOE:

As one of his last actions as the nation's National Drug Control Policy
Director, White House Drug Czar Lee Brown is calling on athletic shoe
company giant Adidas to recall or stop selling its "The Hemp" shoe. The
shoe had ben scheduled for distribution to its vast network of retailers over
the next few months. "Hemp" is a street slang for marijuana. In a statement
amplifying a letter to Adidas America President Steve Wynne, Brown said.
"The people at this shoe company apparently think this is cute, but it is
really quite deadly--especially at a time in which more and more of our
young people do not fear illegal drugs and as a result are using them.
Moreover, it has been widely reported that the shoe" had previously been
called the Chronic--another street name for marijuana. Wynne's response to
Brown stated that "Hemp is not marijuana." But Brown, in a second letter
replied, "You fail to get the point. It doesn't matter what the your shoe is
made of -- the question is what you call it." Brown also charged that Adidas
shows a blatant disregard of the fact that we now have a crisis among kids
who think using marijuana is the thing to do. To receive more information

FEDERAL JUDGE HALTED SALE OF DRUG DETECTION DEVICE:

A federal judge last month temporarily halted manufacture and sale of a
device sold to schools, prisons, airports and law enforcement as a drug and
explosives detector. Government tests indicated it's a fake. FBI agent
Norman Townsend told a federal judge that 1,000 Quadro Trackers, also
known as Quadro Positive Molecular Locators, have been sold or ordered
for $395 to $8,000 apiece. But he said analysis by FBI Laboratory
technicians and by the Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratories
show the device is nothing more than a hollow plastic box attached to a
retractable transistor radio antenna. A "chip" inside was found to be two
pieces of plastic surrounding "a small piece of polymer coated white paper,
similar to a candy bar wrapper," Townsend wrote in an affidavit. At the
request of the Justice Department, which is conducting a fraud
investigation, U.S. District Judge Thad Heartfield in Beaumont, Texas,
signed the restraining order against Quadro Corp. of Harleyville, S.C., its
Texas subsidiary and four company officers. The judge found "probable
cause to believe that defendants are engaged in mail and wire fraud." A
schools use package was priced at $995 and law enforcement packages
ranged from $1,145 to $5,000. Locator cards to be inserted in the device
were priced at $250 for heroin and $25 for golf balls, Townsend said.

Market Analysis Program (DMA) in order to develop strategies for
addressing street level drug problems and encourage innovations in
geographic analysis of crime. In Jersey City, New Jersey, one of five DMA
demonstration sides, an evaluation was conducted in 1993 of an innovative

most commonly used drugs among adult male arrestees. The percentage of
males testing positive for cocaine in 1994 ranged from 19% (in San Jose) to
68% (in Manhattan). Cocaine positive rates for females ranges from 19%
(in San Diego) to 80% (in Manhattan). While use of cocaine has declined in
the surveyed household and student populations, similar declines have not
been found among arrestees.  Other cities with more than fifty percent of

SENATORS CALL FOR CRACKDOWN ON MEXICO:

Saying it is high time for Mexico to crack down on drug trafficking into the
United States, Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Alfonse M. D'Amato,
R-N.Y., last month announced plans for legislation aimed at pressuring
Mexico for increased cooperation. The action comes as the Clinton
administration is poised to extend for  six months Mexico's $20 billion in
U.S. loan guarantees. President Clinton provided the guarantees on his own
authority last Jan. 31, after lawmakers balked at his request that Congress
authorize a $40 billion bailout. "The measures my colleague and I are
introducing are meant as a shot across the bow to the government of
Mexico," Feinstein said. "These measures... should send the signal that this
Congress is prepared to back up the president's effort in the strongest
possible terms if Mexico's actions do not match their words in the war on
drugs." The senators measures would tie the six-month extension of the
loan guarantee to Mexico to that country's efforts to curb drug trafficking.
Specifically, Feinstein said Mexican officials would have to comply with a
list of 10 requirements such as meeting extradition requests, prosecuting
local government officials for accepting graft, strengthening the prohibition
on money laundering and regulating chemicals used to produce
methamphetamine and other narcotics. Another measure would suspend
trucking applications from Mexico under border crossing provisions in the
North American Free Trade Agreement until Mexico improves its safety
record. D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee, said his panel would begin holding hearings and
marking up the draft bill in early March.

MEXICO ARRESTS AND EXTRADITES DRUG TRAFFICKER:

On January 15 the Government of Mexico arrested Juan Garcia Abrego and
the next day expelled him from the country. Garcia Abrego was flown to
Houston and taken into federal custody to face an indictment filed in
September, 1993 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Texas. The indictment charges that Garcia Abrego is the leader of one of the
most powerful drug trafficking organizations in Mexico, which, while
operating on both sides of the border, is responsible for transporting tons of
cocaine into the United States for the Cali Cartel. The indictment further
alleges that Garcia Abrego authorized acts of violence, including murder, to
promote drug activities. Garcia Abrego, who faces a life sentence if he is
convicted, was placed on the FBI's list of "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" in
March of 1995. Attorney General Janet Reno in a statement congratulated
Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Jose Angel Gurria and Attorney
General Antonio Lozano Garcia for the capture of Garcia Abrego and the
"expeditious manner in which the government of Mexico achieved his
removal from Mexico to the United States."

CALI MONEY LAUNDERERS INDICTED IN NEW JERSEY:

U.S. authorities indicted 14 people accused of laundering $60 million for
the Cali drug cartel and seized large amounts of cash when they arrested
some of the suspects on February 6. In what prosecutors called the biggest
money laundering case brought in New Jersey, special agents of the U.S.
Customs Service and the Internal Revenue Service arrested suspects in three
states beginning the night of February 5, officials said.  Special Agent Dan
Holmes of the U.S. Customs Service said the arrests were made in New
Jersey, New York and Florida and at least $300,000 in cash had been
confiscated. U.S. Attorney Faith Hochberg said in a statement that the
government would ask to have the suspects held without bail because they
pose a high risk of flight. All face a 20-year prison term and a heavy fine if
convicted.  The indictment said the 14 suspects operated through three front
companies, using money transfer agents and banks over more than two
years to launder cash obtained from illegal narcotic sales in the United States
back to Cali, Colombia. One of the companies named was Latelco, with
offices in West New York, New Jersey, Miami and Cali, Colombia. It
ostensibly sold telephone debit cards. A second was a travel and money
transfer agency in Jersey City.

CRIMINAL CHARGES TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST SAMPER:

Colombia's chief prosecutor was quoted on February 6 as saying that he
would file criminal charges against President Ernesto Samper because of his
alleged links to drug lords. The RCN and Caracol radio networks said
Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso announced his plan to file charges
during closed-door talks with members of the Committee of Accusations of
the House of Representatives. Valdivieso could not be reached to confirm
the reports. The committee, the only body formally authorized to investigate
a sitting president, is preparing to reopen a probe into charges that Samper
accepted up to $6 million in Cali cartel drug money to finance his 1994
election campaign. The congressional panel cleared Samper of any
wrongdoing last December after a four-month probe into the campaign
finance scandal his government has been embroiled in since last summer.
But Samper himself asked it to reopen its investigation last week after
Fernando Botero-his former defence minister and campaign boss -
charged that the President personally approved the use of drug money to
bankroll his campaign.

JEWELRY TRADE SHOW AVOIDS PUBLICITY DUE TO CRIME:

After a jewelry trade show participant from Hong Kong was shot and
robbed of nearly $1 million in diamonds outside a midtown Manhattan
hotel, his fellow jewelers hustled their expensive wares into the Jacob K.
Javits Convention Center for a trade show so exclusive it has been almost a
secret.  According to a report from the New York Times, the JA
International Jewelry Show displays no signs outside, disseminates no
general publicity, posts no show dates in lists of upcoming events and
sends out literature in plain brown envelopes. The  reason for the secrecy is
the concern that public notice would weaken security, though none of the
press officers from the parent company, Blenheim Group U.S.A., would
acknowledge this. Many participants covered the badges identifying them as
part of the show, which is intended only for those in the industry. Police
said that they had not yet made any arrests in the shooting. At the Javits
Center a steady stream of armored cars, vans and taxis dropped off
exhibitors bearing bulky crates, bulging briefcases and duffel bags like the
one stolen earlier. Security was heavy. But one show participant said, fear
of theft, combined with other local inconveniences, was causing the show
to lose ground to the June show in Las Vegas. "People hate the cold, the
snow, the theft, the huge cost of hotel rooms. New York has a pretty lousy
reputation."

DEMOCRATS ATTACK NEW YORK'S MAYOR FOR FOCUS ON
CRIME:

Democrats have begun to turn the mayor's success in lowering the crime
rate against him, ridiculing him for concentrating on little else. City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone delivered an unusual reproach to Giuliani in his
annual address to the Council last month, charging that on issues like
education, housing, and health, Giuliani had been "a very good mayor - on
crime." The crime rate may once have been the voters' top priority, but
some New Yorkers are asking "What have you done for me lately?"
Giuliani seemed conscious of the need to broaden his portfolio when, after
the beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, he announced that he would
reorganize the Child Welfare Administration with the same energy and
commitment he had earlier applied to the Police Department. Then he went
further, proclaiming in his budget message last week that his top priority
was protecting the rights of society's most vulnerable, a category he said
included troubled children, the elderly, the sick and the handicapped. To
help pay for some of his new priorities, he agreed to trim the police force by
1,500 officers. Caught off guard, social-welfare advocates praised the
police cut but remained skeptical of the mayor's real intentions, particularly
if budget cuts continue to grow over all, as now seems likely. The budget
plan for next year, for example, includes a $160 million cut to the Board of
Education, and projects the removal of more than 275,000 people from the
welfare rolls.

VETERANS HOSPITALS NOW PROVIDING DRUG TREATMENT:

The Department of Veterans Affairs is best known for its network of
hospitals, which continues to expand despite a decline in the population of
veterans and despite health care trends that are forcing many other hospitals
to close. But now the department's insulation from the fiscal and political
pressures confronting the rest of the government has helped give it an
important new role as an agency that cares for the poor.  And a poor veteran
often gets assistance that a welfare recipient accustomed to nothing more
than cash or food stamps might find lavish.  "If you're a vet," said Martha
Burt, director of social service research at the Urban Institute, a
Washington-based research organization, "you have a resource that a lot of
other people don't have." With the plunge in the number of war-maimed
veterans treated at the agency's 173 hospitals, the VA has been turning more
of its attention to veterans who are among the nation's drug-addicted or
indigent, mentally ill or physically disabled. To qualify, most need only
have put in some time in the service, in combat or not, in wartime or
peacetime. "If you serve 180 days on active duty," said one Republican
congressional aide who specializes in veterans issues, "and if for whatever
reason you do not succeed in life, you get this complete safety net." As a
result, a department that is the nation's largest employer of doctors and
nurses has also become the largest employer of social workers, with 4,241
on the payroll last year.

NOBEL WINNERS TAKE ANTI-VIOLENCE CAMPAIGN TO U.S.:

In a bid to combat teen violence three Nobel peace laureates will take their
message of non-violence to young people, Nobel laureate Betty Williams
announced last month. ``We're going to change things for the young people
of America,'' said Williams, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in
1977 along with Mairead Corrigan Maguire for their work in Northern
Ireland.  Williams next month will kick off in Denver what is expected to be
a five-year educational program known as PeaceJam. Williams later said
gang members will be recruited to attend the weekend conference in late
March. ``We're going to bring them in. We're going to go out and look for
them,'' she said after a press conference to announce the program.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was awarded the peace prize in 1984 for
his fight against apartheid in South Africa, and the Dalai Lama of Tibet who
received the prize in 1989, will attend similar conferences in Denver later
this year, organizers said.

Funds:  SJI estimates it will have $6 million to $9 million,
but its fiscal 1996 appropriation still is pending in
Congress.  SJI awards several types of grants, including
project grants up to $200,000 for education, research,
evaluation, demonstrations and technical assistance.  SJI
estimates it will have $400,000 in fiscal 1996 for technical
assistance grants of $30,000 each for state or local courts
to engage outside experts; $175,000 for curriculum
adaptation grants of up to $20,000 each for state and local
courts to replicate or modify model training programs funded
by SJI; and $175,000 for scholarships to enable judges and
court managers to attend out-of-state education and training
programs.

Eligibility:  State and local courts, nonprofit
organizations, higher education institutions and other
organizations with expertise in judicial administration.

Areas:  SJI is looking for projects that formulate new
procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existing
arrangements to improve courts; address aspects of state
judicial systems that especially need attention; have
national significance in terms of their impact or may be
replicated in other states; and create and disseminate
products that effectively transfer information and ideas
developed to relevant audiences in state and local judicial
systems or provide relevant technical assistance.

Special interest categories for this year include research
and other projects to improve public confidence in courts
and education and training for judges and other key court
personnel.  Proposals related to public confidence include
research, demonstrations and evaluations and education
activities designed to improve the responsiveness of courts
to public concerns, including projects to improve service to
individual litigants and trial participants; test methods
for clearly and effectively communicating decisions; address
court-community problems resulting from the influx of legal
and illegal immigrants, design and assess procedures for
custody visitation and other domestic relations cases when
family members or property are outside the United States,
improve communications with federal authorities when illegal
aliens are involved in state court proceedings and develop
protocols for dealing with non-U.S. citizens and entities in
criminal and juvenile cases; and increase public
understanding of jury decisions, juror selection and service
processes.

Education and training projects for judges and other key
court personnel include development of innovative education
programs and curriculum adaptation projects.  Innovative
education projects could include self-directed learning
packages, such as interactive computer programs, projects to
familiarize faculty with technology and projects that
incorporate findings from SJI-funded research.  Curriculum
adaptation projects usually help state and local courts
prepare and test a model curriculum or effort developed with
SJI funds by another state or organization.

TOOLS OF THE TRADE: THE FEDERAL REGISTER

The Federal Register -- the federal government's 60-year-old
regulatory affairs reporter -- remains a key grantseeking
tool, even in the electronic age.

The Register last month announced free access to its own
searchable electronic version.

And despite increased use of the Internet by agencies to
advertise funding opportunities directly, the Register is
the forum of choice for certain health-related funders.

In addition to running grant notices, the Register also
updates readers daily on critical rules, regulations and
actions that shape grant competitions.

By following official developments, grantseekers can stay on
top of changes that could affect their eligibility under a
grant program or effect new procedures and requirements.

In its electronic form, readers can have a custom-tailored
Register.  Instead of slogging
through pages of extraneous text dealing with agencies in
which readers may have no interest, readers can key into
only the information they need.

"It's what they've always asked for," says Richard
Claypoole, director of the Federal Register.


And the electronic version has caught on, he says.  Even
before the Register went public,  subscribers logged 558,369
document retrievals from November to December.

In whatever form, grantseekers can use the Federal Register
to:

*  Mine grant nuggets:  The Health Resources and Services
Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Energy
Department regularly use the Federal Register to announce
grant competitions.

Browsers will find health-related Education Department
notices and health and life science notices from the
Agriculture Department and the Environmental Protection
Agency.*  Check on winners:  A few agencies, such as the
Housing and Urban Development Department, use the Federal
Register to announce recent awards.  Announcements are
occasional, but they can provide insights about program
constituents and reveal subgrant and subcontracting
possibilities.

*  Respond to proposed program rules and funding priorities:
Laws creating grant programs often require agencies to
publish regulations before getting down to grantmaking.
Grantseekers can influence program direction by commenting
on the proposals appearing in the Federal Register.*  Keep
up with grant-related policies:  The Register provides the
full text on government-wide policies affecting grants and
contracts, such as Office of Management and Budget circulars
related to university research costs.*In fact, revisions to
OMB Circular A-21, which deals with university costs, could
hit the Register late this month. *  Learn about meetings:
Agencies publish announcements for meetings, ranging from
preapplication workshops and advisory group sessions to
policy-setting forums, including meetings on grantseekers'
home turf.  Notices specify when and where meetings will be
held and which parts will be open to the public.

But the Federal Register also has its drawbacks -- for hard
copy and electronic users.  Agencies used to soliciting
grant applications via the Register sometimes bypass the
publication these days, finding it faster and easier to go
with electronic announcements.

For example, EPA's 1996 grant competition, announced on the
Internet last month, has yet to make it into the Register.
Unless their announcements have regulatory impact, says
Claypoole, agencies are not required to publish application
notices in the Register.

And whether users are hard copy or on-screen readers, they
routinely must trudge through pages of often confusing
legalese.  To make things easier, the Federal Register
office regularly holds workshops on how to use the Federal
Register system.  The 1996 schedule includes workshops in
and out of Washington.

Other efforts to make life easier include a new column on
regulations taking effect that day and a daily reminder of
impending closing dates for comments on proposed rules.

FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY:  WHO DOES WHAT IN THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-19A and GAO/RCED-91-19B
Pages:  32 and 119

Today's federal food safety and quality regulatory system is
fragmented and complex, consisting of as many as 35
different laws and involving 12 federal agencies. The first
volume of this report provides an overall perspective on
federal efforts to ensure food safety and quality. GAO
discusses (1) the statutory responsibilities, programs,
activities, staffing, and budget of the federal agencies
involved with food safety and quality; (2) the inter-agency
agreements used by the agencies to cooperate in meeting
their statutory duties; (3) the ways in which funding and
staffing levels have changed during the 1980s relative to
the agencies' work loads; and (4) the issues that federal
officials believe will be critical for food safety and
quality in the 1990s. The second volume contains a more
detailed description of the food safety and quality
activities of the 12 agencies that were the focus of the
first volume. These 12 agencies include the following: Food
and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control
(HHS); Agricultural Marketing Service, Federal Grain
Inspection Service, Food Safety and Inspection Service,
Agricultural Research Service, and Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (USDA); the Environmental Protection
Agency; the National Marine Fisheries Service (Department of
Commerce); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
(Department of the Treasury); U.S. Customs Service; and
Federal Trade Commission.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE:  STRATEGIC MARKETING NEEDED
TO LEAD AGRIBUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-22
Pages:  46

GAO found that U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies
rarely use strategic marketing--a range of practices that
identify consumer needs and develop products and delivery
systems to satisfy those needs--to help U.S. agribusiness
better compete in both export and domestic markets. Although
USDA agencies are reacting positively to some of the
challenges of strategic marketing, GAO concludes that
overall the Department is not prepared to guide agribusiness
in a market-driven economy. Important marketing policies,
practices, and skills are lacking within individual
agencies, impairing USDA'S ability to fulfill a leadership
role. For example, three of the four agencies GAO examined
do not coordinate their program planning or systematically
exchange information.  These factors have contributed to
USDA's inability to develop a plan for marketing as a
coordinated, Department-wide issue under the new management-
by-objective system.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE:  FARM AGENCIES' FIELD
STRUCTURE NEEDS MAJOR OVERHAUL

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-9
Pages:  60

The U.S. Department of Agriculture runs its farm programs
and services through one of the federal government's largest
and most decentralized field structures. This structure also
dates to the 1930s and reflects the more limited
transportation and communication systems in use at that
time. Given changing patterns in American agriculture and
mounting constraints on federal spending, GAO looked for
ways to improve the overall management of USDA's field
structure. GAO found that USDA can save millions of dollars
while maintaining or improving operational effectiveness by
(1) more aggressively pursuing incremental improvements
through field office collocations and consolidations and (2)
restructuring to provide a more flexible, integrated field
organization GAO notes the likelihood of many sources of
opposition to the restructuring of USDA field operations. As
a result, USDA Will need to engage its grass roots staff,
top management, farm clients, and Congress in updating its
current structure to one that can effectively deliver
services into the next century.

THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1991:  SCORING OF GSA LEASE-
PURCHASES

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-44
Pages:  7

This report discusses differences in how the Office of
Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office
did budgetary scoring for lease-purchase contracts at the
General Services Administration. OMB'S treatment produced
higher outlay estimates for fiscal year 1991 than did CBO'S.
GAO believes that the key to resolving the issue would be
for the administration and Congress to reconsider the matter
in light of a common set of assumptions about the contracts'
financing and the required scoring rule. GAO understands
that the administration will be initiating discussions with
Congress to develop a mutually acceptable
way of resolving the issue.  GAO believes that this is an
appropriate course of action.

BUDGET ISSUES:  EFFECTS OF THE FISCAL YEAR 1990 SEQUESTER

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-21
Pages:  20

This report examines the effects of the fiscal year 1990
sequester on five federal agencies  the Department of Health
and Human Services, IRS, the Department of Education, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. GAO found that the 1990
sequester had only a minimal effect on the five agencies.
The five agencies actually lost less than 1.4 percent of
their final budget authority because (1) growth in agency
appropriations offset sequester reductions and (2)
appropriations enacted after the sequestration were
partially exempt from that process. As a result, agencies
absorbed the sequester reductions by postponing program
expansions and improvements rather than by cutting core
services. Final 1990 figures peg the deficit at $220.4
billion, or $120.4 billion over the target level. Had OMB
predicted the need for a $120 billion sequester in its
earlier sequestration reports, GAO believes that meaningful
nonsequester deficit reduction might have been achieved in
the face of massive, across-the-board cuts. GAO continues to
believe that sequestration alone will not eliminate the
deficit. Instead, a combination of good faith negotiations,
political leadership, and compromise on difficult policy
matters is needed.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:  OVERSIGHT OF BLOCK GRANT MONITORING
NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-23
Pages:  14

Local governments rely on the Community Development Block
Grant program to help meet locally defined community
development needs, including the creation of decent housing
and the expansion of economic opportunities. However, the
Office of Inspector General found that many problems plagued
the administration of grantees' programs. GAO reviewed three
Department of Housing and Urban Development field offices
(Baltimore, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio; and Detroit, Michigan)
to determine how they monitored entitlement grantees of
Community Development Block Grants. GAO found that
weaknesses in HUD'S guidance for monitoring entitlement
grantees may have contributed to inadequate supervisory and
evidentiary control practices.  Without adequate supervisory
and evidentiary controls over its monitoring program, HUD
cannot ensure that management problems are detected or t hat
staff do not duplicate previous work. In addition, without
using information found in Office of Inspector General
reports when planning their monitoring, field offices may
not be using their limited resources most effectively.

STAFFORD STUDENT LOANS:  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOANS
AWARDED TO INELIGIBLE BORROWERS

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-7
Pages:  32

Due to internal control weaknesses, GAO has cited the
Stafford Student Loan Program, the largest government
program for student loans, as one of 14 areas at high-risk
for mismanagement, fraud, and abuse. A main problem at the
Stafford Student Loan Program is the lack of an information
system to protect the government's interests; in fiscal year
1990, more than half the program's funds--$2.4 billion--were
used to repay defaulted loans. Today the Department is
running a multi-million-dollar, commercial-type loan
operations with a data system containing incomplete,
inaccurate, and unreliable information. Consequently, the
Department has no way of knowing whether (1) student loan
defaulters are trying to obtain new loans or (2) borrowers
have exceeded legal loan limits. GAO found that loan
defaulters may have obtained about million in new loans, and
that students have received million of dollar in loans over
the legal limits. While the total impact of such abuses is
unclear because the data are so poor, GAO believes that a
significant problem exists--one that is costing the federal
government millions of dollars in interest subsidies and
additional defaulted loans. The Department of Education
plans to install a new data base in 1993. Until then GAO
believes that the Department needs to do much more to (1)
improve the accuracy and completeness of the current data
base and (2) make this information available to guaranty
agencies. GAO concludes that much is at stake. If the abuses
go unchecked, they will continue to corrode the financial
aid system and ultimately deprive eligible students of the
money they need to finance their education.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:  IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED IN ENFORCING HEALTH
INSURANCE CONTINUATION REQUIREMENTS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-37
Pages:  12

GAO reviewed the Department of Labor's and the Internal
Revenue Service's enforcement of the health insurance
continuation requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). This legislation
requires firms employing 20 or more employees and offering a
group health insurance plan to provide employees and their
families the option of continued coverage in cases of job
loss, death, or divorce. This report discusses (1) Labor and
IRS efforts to help private individuals who bring cases of
alleged noncompliance by employers to their attention, (2)
procedures for investigating these allegations, and (3)
enforcement history. Both IRS and Labor provide information
about COBRA to those who inquire, and Labor will contact
employers to help employees obtain benefits. However, if
employers refuse to provide benefits, IRS cannot and Labor
generally does not try to force employers to provide
benefits. Further, the extent of COBRA violations is
unknown. IRS' method of dealing with potential COBRA
beneficiaries, in GAO'S view, discourages the reporting of
violations. GAO believes that Labor and IRS should do more
to ensure that IRS is made aware of potential COBRA
violations. The knowledge that excise taxes may be assessed
for these violations could deter such violations. Also,
people referred by IRS to Labor could get help quicker if
they were given Labor's phone number along with its address.

JOB TRAINING PARTNERSHIP ACT:  REVIEW OF AUDIT FINDINGS
RELATED TO THE DOWNRIVER COMMUNITY CONFERENCE PROGRAM

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-90-105
Pages:  22

GAO initially looked at four expenditures made by the
Downriver Community Conference--an organization that
provides employment training to residents in the Detroit
area--under the Job Training Partnership Act  (1) $151,824
for contractual services to create a data base to be used to
identify potential program participants, (2) $47,740 for a
sole source contract with a computer consultant, (3)
$100,226 for the purchase of an air-conditioning system, and
(4) a $4,725 payment to a terminated employee. While GAO
concluded that these expenditures represented an allowable
use of funds, concerns were raised that GAO had not fully
developed and considered the evidence of wrongdoing or
misuse of funds in connection with these expenditures.  In a
supplement addressing these concerns, GAO notes that it did
find evidence that some local Downriver rules were violated
and that available evidence provides a basis to question the
wisdom and prudence of some of Downriver's actions. However,
GAO did not find sufficient evidence of fraud or other
improprieties to warrant further inquiry or referral  to the
Department of Justice.

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD:  ACTION NEEDED TO IMPROVE
CASE-PROCESSING TIME AT HEADQUARTERS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-29
Pages:  72

The National Labor Relations Board generally considers cases
involving either allegations of unfair labor practices or
disagreements about elections on union representation. In
response to concerns about the length of time it has taken
to decide some cases appealed to the headquarters Board from
the regional offices, GAO looked at the Board's system for
deciding cases. This report (1) describes how long the Board
had taken to decide cases, particularly since 1984, and
determines whether  there were any excessive delays; (2)
identifies factors that contributed to such delays; and (3)
determines if additional administrative or legislative
action might be warranted.

LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS:  STRIKES AND THE USE OF STRIKE
REPLACEMENTS IN THE 1970S AND 1980S

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-2
Pages:  24, Jan. 18 (24 pages).

The 1980s experienced about half as many strikes as did the
1970s.  Among strikes reported to the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service in 1985 and 1989, GAO estimates that
employers announced an intention of hiring permanent
replacements about one-third of the time and actually hired
them in 17 percent of the strikes. GAO found  little
difference in the use of permanent strike replacements by
employers  in larger versus small strikes. Many employers
and union  representatives involved in strikes in 1985 and
1989 believe that permanent strike replacements were more
common in the late 1980s than in the late 1970s. However,
GAO estimates that--had it surveyed all employers and union
representatives--about one-third of employers and 13 percent
of union representatives would have said that they had no
basis for providing an opinion on trends in the hiring of
permanent replacements.

OIL RESERVE:  SOME CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT SPR DRAWDOWN AND
DISTRIBUTION

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-16
Pages:  40

The crisis in the Persian Gulf has renewed interest in the
ability of the Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to counter disruptions in the supply of oil to the
United States. To provide this protection, DOE must be able
to offset the supplies lost by quickly drawing down reserve
oil from its storage sites and distributing it to
purchasers.  This report (1) reviews DOE'S current and
planned capability for removing oil from reserve sites and
getting it to users via oil distribution networks,(2)
examines the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's compliance with
pipeline safety requirements, and (3) discusses DOE'S
efforts to correct problems that GAO previously reported.
GAO concludes that a major distribution could be hampered
because buyers of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil are
required to use U.S.-flag tankers to ship the oil between
U.S. ports.  DOE and industry officials doubt whether enough
U.S.-flag vessels are available to do the job, and questions
remain about the efficiency of procedures to authorize the
use of foreign vessels.

ENERGY MANAGEMENT:  DOE NEEDS TO BETTER IMPLEMENT CONFLICT-
OF-INTEREST CONTROLS

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-15
Pages:  34

DOE has 22 federally funded research and development centers
that are managed and run by private corporations and
universities under contracts with DOE. In fiscal year 1989,
DOE paid these contractors almost $8 billion these
contractors, in turn, awarded about $3.2 billion to
subcontractors. In response to concerns about subcontractor
conflicts of interest, GAO looked into the situation and
found that while DOE'S written policies and procedures
provide guidance on how to spot and avoid conflicts of
interest among subcontractors, DOE field offices have not
been implementing these internal management controls.
Contrary to DOE regulations the DOE Albuquerque field office
abdicated responsibility and allowed the research centers to
make conflict-of-interest determinations themselves.
Although GAO was unable to determine whether DOE'S policies
and procedures were, in practice, effective, GAO noted two
management control problems. First, Albuquerque has relied
extensively on subcontractor self-certification in making
conflict-of-interest decisions even though certifications
may not always be accurate. Second, Albuquerque's
documentation of conflict-of-interest decisions is limited.
GAO also found that neither Albuquerque nor DOE headquarters
exercised effective oversight to ensure that conflicts of
interest were avoided in the subcontracts awarded by the Los
Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories.

OBLIGATIONS LIMITATION:  RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION'S
COMPLIANCE AS OF JUNE 30,1990

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-41
Pages:  20

This quarterly report examines the Resolution Trust
Corporation's compliance with the maximum obligation limit
set forth in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,
and Enforcement Act of 1989. The act provides a formula for
calculating the limit and sets aside $50 billion in
financing to resolve troubled savings and loans placed into
conservatorship or receivership. On the basis of its review
of RTC'S September 28,1990, report and schedule and its
financial records, GAO concludes that none of the categories
for the formula were omitted from RTC'S calculation and that
there is little risk that RTC exceeded the limitation.
However, RTC is facing a funding crisis. Without enough
money to absorb the losses and to buy the assets of failed
institutions, RTC will have to slowdown its resolution
efforts. As a result, failing institutions will continue to
incur operating losses, thereby increasing resolution costs.
GAO believes that only quick action to identify a long-term
solution to RTC's funding needs will ensure the
Corporation's continued ability to respond to the thrift
crisis. GAO also followed up on recommendations it made to
RTC in its first quarter report and found that RTC is, in
all instances, making progress on the recommendations,
although none have been fully implemented yet.

RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION:  UNNECESSARY LOAN SERVICING
COSTS DUE TO INADEQUATE CONTRACT OVERSIGHT

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-19
Pages:  8

GAO found that from January to July 1990, the Resolution
Trust Corporation might have avoided as much as $1 million
in loan processing costs resulting from continued operations
at a large loan processing center in Orlando, Florida. These
unnecessary costs arose from inadequate RTC oversight,
insufficient RTC and North Carolina National Bank of Florida
initiatives to plan for a large reduction in the number of
loans processed at the center, insufficient cost information
on center operations, and RTC's failure to take early action
to market the center.  Given the thousands of assets in
RTC's current real estate inventory, GAO believes that the
Florida situation highlights the urgent need for timely and
adequate contractor monitoring efforts.

FINANCIAL AUDIT:  AIR FORCE'S BASE-LEVEL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS
DO NOT PROVIDE RELIABLE INFORMATION

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-26
Pages:  24

This report presents of the results of GAO's review of the
Air Force's base-level financial management operations for
fiscal years 1988 and 1989. Base-level managers are
responsible for million of dollars in appropriations and
accountable assets. However, accounting errors and
inaccurate financial reports pervaded the base-level
accounting systems at the 17 bases where GAO conducted its
tests. For fiscal years 1988 and 1989 combined, GAO
identified over $2.7 billion in adjustments needed to
correct errors in year-end, base-level trial balances. This
inaccurate information had already found its way into
financial reports delivered to the Department of Defense,
the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the
Treasury, and Congress. Real property account balances were
misstated because transactions were recorded in an
inaccurate and timely manner. Unauthorized and excessive
issues of inventory and equipment diminished accountability
for those items, and the failure to match personnel and
inventory payroll records created an opportunity for
unauthorized payroll transactions.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT:  INS LACKS ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS
OVER ITS RESOURCES

Order No.:  GA0/AFMD-91-20
Pages:  34

Over 40 years ago, Congress required each federal agency to
establish and maintain adequate systems of accounting and
internal control. However, GAO found that because of an
outmoded accounting system, poor internal controls, and lack
of management emphasis on financial management--weaknesses
that have gone uncorrected for years--the Immigration and
Naturalization Service continues to lack fiscal
accountability over its resources. INS could lose millions
of dollars in revenue because accurate and reliable
financial information is unavailable to effectively bill,
collect, or litigate amounts owed the government. Further,
INS' primary accounting system contains incomplete and
inaccurate financial data. GAO concludes that solving INS'
financial management problems will take strong management
commitment and leadership that must be sustained across
succeeding administrations.

INSPECTORS GENERAL:  WORK PERFORMED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF
LABOR INSPECTOR GENERAL IN 1988 AND 1989

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-24
Pages:  15

The Office of Inspector General audits and investigates
program agencies at the Department of Labor. It also
investigates allegations of racketeering. During fiscal
years 1988 and 1989, both the Office of Audit and the Office
of Investigations spent a majority of their time and
resources investigating projects at the Employment and
Training Administration and at the Employment Standards
Administration. Most of the investigations done by the
Office of Investigations centered on alleged criminal
activity in Labor programs. The Office of Labor Racketeering
classified more than half of the racketeering cases open
during fiscal years 1988 and 1989 as involving employee
benefit plans. GAO was told that all of the Office's cases
investigated during the past two years involved alleged
racketeering or related criminal activity. The Office
pursued all of its cases under criminal statutes except for
two cases pursued under the civil provisions of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act.

IMMIGRATION MANAGEMENT:  STRONG LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT
REFORMS NEEDED TO ADDRESS SERIOUS PROBLEMS

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-28
Pages:  111

The Immigration and Naturalization Service is faced with
balancing the demanding roles of enforcement and service. On
the one hand, INS enforces laws meant to prevent the illegal
entry of millions of poverty stricken, often repressed
people naturally drawn to a better life in the United
States. On the other hand, INS facilitates legal immigration
by processing millions of requests relating to citizenship
and asylum and by inspecting hundreds of millions of people
at ports of entry. This report, one in a series of general
management reviews of major federal departments and
agencies, concludes that over the past decade weak
management systems and inconsistent leadership at INS have
allowed serious problems to go unresolved. As a result, the
agency has degenerated into a group of segmented autonomous
programs, each trying to handle its own set of problems with
little attention to their interrelatedness. Compounding this
lack of overall direction is a chaotic budget development
process that has produced budgets that are simply
compilations of program submissions with little
accountability for funds or attention to agencywide
priorities. The current INS organizational structure, marked
by complicated lines of authority and communication, adds to
and perpetuates the agency's segmented management. Although
lNS' problems did not happen overnight, the agency needs to
take immediate action to improve both enforcement and
service operations. In the long run, the Department of
Justice and INS must articulate a vision of how INS is to
effectively implement the nation's immigration policy.

POSTAL SERVICE:  CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE--EXPRESS AND
PRIORITY MAIL TRANSPORTATION

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-13
Pages:  4

GAO reviewed the Postal Service's award of an express and
priority mail transportation contract to Air Train, Inc.
(later renamed Emery Worldwide Airline, Inc.) and the
contractor's performance under that contract.  The contract
says that the minimum acceptable performance for meeting
express and priority mail delivery times at destination
cities is 98 percent of the time. GAO found that after the
initial start-up week, the on-time performance requirement
was met for 54 of 57 weeks. In addition to the on-time
requirement, the contractor is expected to deliver all
express and priority mail to destination cities without
leaving any mail behind, either at the originating city or
at the hub (where the mail is sorted). GAO found that Air
Train failed to meet these standards 10 out of 57 weeks.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA:  INFORMATION ON COURT ORDERED TENANT
EVICTIONS

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-29
Pages:  20

This report provides information on court ordered tenant
evictions in the District of Columbia, almost 3,000 of which
took place in fiscal year 1990. GAO discusses (1) the time
that elapsed between the landlord's filing of an eviction
request, the court issuance of the eviction order, and the
actual eviction by U.S. deputy marshals for evictions
carried out in fiscal year 1990; (2) reasons for the elapsed
times; and (3) whether using contractors to carry out the
evictions, instead of deputy marshals, would be legal and
appropriate.

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT:  INHERENT WEAKNESSES MAY LIMIT
ITS USEFULNESS FOR SMALL GOVERNMENTS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-16
Pages:  23

Have federal agencies been sufficiently analyzing the effect
of their proposed regulations on small governments (towns
with less than 50,000 inhabitants)?  Further, has the goal
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980--to reduce
regulatory burdens on small businesses, small governments,
and nonprofit organizations--been met for small governments?
GAO found that federal agencies are not doing as many
analyses for small governments as they might, largely
because of weaknesses in the act. First, the Small Business
Administration may be unable to monitor compliance with the
act because it lacks expertise in small government issues.
Second, that act has no provisions for ensuring federal
agency compliance. Third, neither the act nor SBA has
provided criteria or definitions for determining whether
federal rule-making agencies are conducting sufficient
analyses of regulations affecting small governments and how
these analyses should be done. GAO is concerned that
proposed legislation--S. 1758, the Small Governments
Regulatory Partnership Act--would not address these
weaknesses. GAO believes that SBA should develop the
expertise needed to better implement provisions relating to
small governments.  GAO also believes that Congress may wish
to consider amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act to
require SBA, in consultation with OMB, to develop criteria
on whether and how federal agencies should conduct analyses
for small governments.  It should also consider expanding
SBA'S existing authority to review and comment on proposed
agency regulations affecting small governments. This
expansion should direct SBA to work with OMB to ensure
agency compliance with the provisions of the act.

MAJOR ISSUES FACING THE 102ND CONGRESS

Order No.:  GAO/T-OCG-91-1
Pages:  19

GAO'S 1988 transition series sought to alert the President-
elect and the new Congress to the many challenges facing the
nation. This testimony updates the status of the issues GAO
cited in 1988.  The Comptroller General first reviews the
overall state of the economy and the budget, cautioning that
a protracted war in the Middle East, the recession at home,
and further increases in the cost of deposit insurance could
trigger another explosive rise in the deficit over the next
several years; the general fund deficit--excluding the
surpluses in the Social Security and other trust funds--
already appears likely to top $400 billion in 1991.  He then
discusses critical policy problems in the following program
areas:  defense, the financial sector, health,
transportation, agriculture, energy, the environment,
financial management, and the public service. In some cases
GAO reports significant progress, but that is the exception.
Many of the problems, including some of the most important
ones like the thrift crisis, have become more severe. Given
the rapid developments in international affairs--as
evidenced by changes in the Warsaw Pact countries and by the
economic and political integration of Western Europe--the
Comptroller General believes that it is time to revisit the
question, What is required of our government?  If the United
States is to succeed in this new world order, the
Comptroller General believes that several prerequisites must
be satisfied.  First, we must have a government that works,
one that operates efficiently and effectively, both in its
internal functions and in its delivery of services to the
American people.  To reach that goal, investment in
government, its people, its facilities, and its technology
is needed.  Second, we must have a government whose
financial performance relates properly to the national and
world economy.  For that to be achieved, the United States
must move toward a long term fiscal policy that recognizes
the need for a much higher level of national savings.
Third, we must have a financial system in whose safety and
soundness the American people can have complete confidence,
so that our market economy can effectively allocate capital
to the most productive uses.  To accomplish that, we must
resolve the thrift crisis, restore the soundness of the
banking industry, and ensure an efficient and effectively
regulated structure of capital markets.

MEDICAID:  LEGISLATION NEEDED TO IMPROVE COLLECTIONS FROM
PRIVATE INSURERS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-25
Pages:  32

As a public assistance program, Medicaid was expected to pay
for health care only after Medicaid recipients had used all
their other health care resources.  GAO found that two major
problems hinder states from collecting from private insurers
for recipients' covered health care costs.  First, states
cannot prohibit some out-of-state insurers from trying to
avoid paying state Medicaid agencies for such costs.  States
now lack jurisdiction over insurers that operate only
incidentally in the state.  Second, states' limited
authority over plans covered under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) does not allow them to
prohibit these plans from trying to avoid payments for
recipients' covered costs.  Further, many states have not
exercised the authority they do have to mandate that no
ERISA plan include any contract provision that might limit
or exclude payments for Medicaid recipients' health care
costs.  While  state officials found it hard to pinpoint
losses resulting from their payment systems, examples of
state Medicaid losses obtained by GAO suggest that the
problem may be substantial--perhaps millions of dollars in
losses each year--and growing.  To minimize future losses,
federal legislation is needed to clarify Medicaid's role as
a payer of last resort and to enhance the ability of states
to collect from out-of-state insurers and ERISA plans.

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE:  FEW CLAIMS RESOLVED THROUGH MICHIGAN'S
VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION PROGRAM

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-38
Pages:  31

The current ways of resolving medical malpractice claims in
this country are neither efficient nor equitable.  Claims
take a long time to be resolved, awards and settlements are
unpredictable, and legal costs are steep.  Concern about the
existing system has inspired alternative proposals for
claims resolution, including fault-based and no-fault based
approaches.  This report looks at one of the fault-based
alternatives-the Michigan Medical Malpractice Arbitration
Program. GAO assessed (1) the extent of hospital, health
care provider, and patient participation under the Michigan
plan; (2) the arbitration alternative's effect on medical
malpractice claims resolution; and (3) whether arbitration
contributed to reducing medical malpractice insurance costs.
GAO'S conclusions about the program are limited because
program participation has been low. GAO does not foresee
significant increases in program participation because of
the voluntary nature of the program and because of the lack
of incentives for patient participation.

MEDICARE:  MILLIONS IN POTENTIAL RECOVERIES NOT BEING SOUGHT
BY MARYLAND CONTRACTOR

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-32
Pages:  9

As part of a broader GAO effort to evaluate the adequacy of
the Medicare contractor budget for claims-processing and
program safeguard activities, GAO discovered a situation
that it believes warrants congressional attention. GAO found
that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland--a Medicare
claims-processing contractor--has paid at least $8.8 million
in claims for which it has identified other health insurers
that may have primary payment responsibility under the
Medicare secondary payer provisions.  In this case, the
contractor--through its investigative efforts--has
identified other parties that may owe Medicare sizable sums.
However, the contractor lacks the resources to recover these
amounts. GAO concludes that any additional funding of the
contractor's activities to recover these payments may yield
considerably more than each dollar so expended.

SOCIAL SECURITY:  ANALYSIS OF A PROPOSAL TO PRIVATIZE TRUST
FUND RESERVES

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-22
Pages:  40

This report analyzes a proposal by a Member of Congress to
create a new system of individual Social Security accounts.
Under this proposal, the accumulating reserves of the Social
Security Trust Fund would be returned to workers and
invested in individual accounts in the private sector, where
they would be held until the workers' retirement.  In
effect, the proposal would partially and temporarily
privatize Social Security.  GAO found that the proposal
could be integrated with the existing progressive benefit
structure and, given favorable financial market conditions,
could improve retirement incomes.  If implemented, the
Individual Social Security Account may change the mix of
public and private saving but not necessarily the magnitude
of national saving.  The proposal also raises many
administrative difficulties and policy issues that need to
be addressed before Individual Social Security Accounts
could be considered a fully working alternative to the use
of trust fund reserves.

SOCIAL SECURITY:  PRODUCTION INITIATIVES IN OHA'S REGION V
COMPLY WITH LAW AND GUIDELINES

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-36BR
Pages:  24

Persons denied Medicare and Social Security benefits may
appeal such decisions to Administrative Law Judges in 132
hearing offices around the country. The Social Security
Administration's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) is
responsible for managing these judges.  GAO reviewed
productivity initiatives underway in OHA'S Chicago Regional
Office and found that they complied with Administrative
Procedure Act and OHA guidelines.  GAO also found that by
including dispositions of regional chiefs and retired judges
in hearing office statistics, average production figures for
the Chicago region and some hearing offices were slightly
overstated.  However, in terms of distribution of monetary
awards, the only apparent gain from the overstatement was
that one hearing office received an additional $3,529 for
awards and bonuses to support staff for which it would not
have been otherwise eligible. As OHA studies and redesigns
its system of productivity measures for its Administrative
Law Judges, it should ensure that whatever measurement
system it designs fairly recognizes the work done by
individuals and by offices.  In the interim, GAO believes
that when calculating the productivity of its hearing
offices, OHA should count regional chiefs and any retired
judges as resources for those hearing offices that received
credit for their dispositions.

Through its input processing initiative, IRS is attempting
to drastically reduce manual handling of paper income tax
returns, tax payments, and other tax information. The
initiative--part of IRS' overall effort to modernize its tax
processing system--is intended to speed the way tax
information is fed into computers for processing.  This

ADP BUDGET:  POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF
DEFENSE'S BUDGET REQUEST

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-17BR
Pages:  26

To assist Congress in its continuing oversight
responsibilities, GAO reviewed the Department of Defense's
fiscal year 1991 budget request for information technology
resources.  GAO identified potential reductions of $460.1
million--$72 million from the Army, $74.1 million from the
Air Force, $14 million from the Defense Logistics Agency,
and another $300 million from DOD'S operation and
maintenance request.  These potential reductions are based
on GAO'S assessment of budget justifications, schedule
slippages, and program changes. This report also provides
information on DOD'S Corporate Information Management
initiative.

COMMAND AND CONTROL:  DEFENSE'S USE OF ENGINEERING
CONTRACTORS FOR ACQUIRING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-19
Pages:  17

The Department of Defense relies on both in-house and
outside technical expertise to design and develop highly
complex command, control, communications, and intelligence
systems.  This report examines the extent to which DOD uses
engineering support contracts for advice and direction in
acquiring automated data processing systems.  DOD data show
that from fiscal years 1985 through 1989 show that DOD spent
about $3.4 billion for engineering and technical support of
system acquisitions.  Air Force was by far the largest user,
accounting for over $2 billion of the $3.4 billion spent.
DOD'S annual expenditures went from $494.5 million in fiscal
year 1985 to $891.7 million in fiscal year 1989, an 80-
percent increase.

MAINFRAME PROCUREMENTS:  STATISTICS SHOWING HOW AND WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT IS ACQUIRING

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-13
Pages:  32

GAO has previously issued a series of 10 reports on
compatible computer procurements.  Those reports looked at
those agencies that obligated $50 million or more for
mainframe computers and mainframe peripheral acquisitions.
This capping report provides consolidated statistics on
mainframe computer and mainframe peripheral procurements by
35 federal agencies. In particular, GAO looked at the extent
to which the 35 agencies required compatibility with IBM or
other equipment manufacturer. GAO found that during the 3-
1/2 fiscal years ending in March 1989, the agencies
obligated $1.9 billion for mainframe and mainframe
peripheral procurements.  Eighty-two percent ($1,587.8
million) of all the procurements required compatibility with
existing systems. IBM-compatible procurements comprised 64
percent of the compatibility-limited procurements and 52
percent of all procurements. With a 47 percent share of the
total federal market, IBM was the largest vendor; Unisys,
with a 20-percent share, was the next largest. Almost 60
percent of the total value of all procurements involved only
one vendor.  When GAO used the number of procurements--
rather than dollars--for comparison, it found that the
agencies had 3,225 procurements for mainframe and mainframe
peripherals and over 90 percent required some kind of
compatibility. The agencies required IBM compatibility 60
percent of the time. When IBM compatibility was required,
IBM equipment was supplied 68 percent of the time.

INTERNATIONAL BANKING:  IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL
ADEQUACY STANDARDS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-80
Pages:  41

Concerned that banks may not be holding enough capital to
ensure their safety and soundness, Congress passed
legislation in 1983 encouraging other countries to maintain
or improve banks' capital bases.  In 1988 the Basle
Committee on Banking supervision, which included
representatives from 12 nations, adopted a framework to
measure capital adequacy and to establish minimum capital
standards for banks operating internationally.  Included in
the framework are minimum capital adequacy standards that
are to be fully achieved by the end of 1992.  This report
looks at (1) steps regulators and financial institutions are
taking to implement the framework, (2) progress made toward
meeting the framework's objectives, and (3) issues that
remain unresolved in implementing the framework.  GAO
reviews implementation in the United States, France,
Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Japan.

U.S. FOOD EXPORTS:  FIVE COUNTRIES' STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES
FOR TESTING PESTICIDE RESIDUES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-90
Pages:  26

The 1989 controversy over Alar, a substance applied to
apples, intensified public fears about the use of pesticides
and chemicals on produce.  Concern about food residues has
also spread overseas and has led to losses in U.S.
agricultural exports.  This report discusses (1) U.S.
government efforts to prevent or resolve trade disputes
arising over pesticide use; (2) specific procedures used by
foreign governments in selected Pacific Rim countries and
Australia to set tolerances and test for pesticides on U.S.
produce exports; and (3) the technical capabilities of these
foreign governments to conduct pesticide testing.  To
evaluate testing and technical capabilities, GAO visited
Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. GAO
found that the five countries lack information about which
pesticides and other chemicals are being used on U.S.
produce. Further, while the five countries have the
necessary testing capabilities, they use a variety of
standards in testing for pesticides

U.S. EMBASSY, MOSCOW  ALTERNATIVES FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
THEIR COSTS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-43FS
Pages:  3

Using Soviet construction workers, the United States began
building a new embassy in Moscow in 1979. By the mid-1980s,
it was discovered that the building was riddled with Soviet
eavesdropping devices, and construction was halted. This
unclassified version of a classified report looks at the
State Department's proposal to demolish the unfinished
embassy and to rebuild atop the old foundation. GAO
discusses (1) the basis for the current cost estimate of
$270 million for demolition and reconstruction and (2) the
alternatives considered by the State Department for a new
embassy in Moscow and their costs. GAO is concerned that the
State Department's estimates for demolition and rebuilding
may be too low. Regardless of which option is eventually
funded, GAO notes that construction agreements with the
Soviets are still pending for the new office building and
for other land and buildings in adjacent sites. Further
delays in concluding these agreements could affect
construction costs and schedules.  In addition, State has
not prepared cost estimates on the additional property and
facility needs for the Moscow complex.

program performance and whether performance can be compared
between different programs, (2) funding for the interdiction
programs, (3) quantities of drugs seized through the
interdiction programs, and (4) the relationship between drug
seizures and the use of advance information (prior
intelligence) on the drug shipments.

ACQUISITION REFORM:  DEFENSE MANAGEMENT REPORT SAVINGS
INITIATIVES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-11
Pages:  18

The 1986 Packard Commission made many recommendations for
improving operations at the Department of Defense. In
response, DOD developed the Defense Management Report, which
outlines steps to improve DOD management. GAO found that DOD
has implemented several Defense Management Report savings
initiatives and has begun to realize some savings, but the
larger, more complex initiatives are still in the planning
stages. To fully implement the initiatives and achieve DOD'S
savings goal, GAO believes that continued management support
is necessary. Although the initiatives were estimated to
save about $39 billion over fiscal years 1991-95, these
estimates did not always rely on cost analyses supported by
historical facts or empirical cost data. GAO'S review of
$24.5 billion in estimated savings showed that about 82
percent of these savings were based primarily on management
judgment, suggesting that the reliability of the estimates
may vary.  DOD officials said that current budget
negotiations and international security developments--
including Operation Desert Shield--will not delay the
implementation of the efficiencies to generate these
savings.  As of June 1990, none of the Packard Commission's
recommendations to streamline and reduce the acquisition
work force had been made; in fact, the number of acquisition
personnel increased slightly. DOD estimates that over fiscal
years 1991-95, Defense Management Report initiatives will
eliminate almost 2,400 civilian and almost 2,000 military
positions from the acquisition work force. The fiscal year
1991 National Defense Authorization Act, however, requires
much deeper cuts in acquisition and headquarters personnel.

DEFENSE MANAGEMENT:  EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE ACQUISITION
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-15
Pages:  16

GAO reviewed the military services' efforts to streamline
their acquisition management structure in accordance with
DOD'S 1989 Defense Management Report, which was issued in
response to the Packard Commission's 1986 recommendations.
The Packard Commission concluded that DOD acquisition
management had become so encumbered and unproductive that
weapons systems frequently cost more than planned and took
too long to develop and deliver. GAO found that--as
prescribed in the Defense Management Report--each military
service has revised (1) its three-tier structure and (2) the
roles of its materiel and systems command. GAO believes that
these revisions, if fully implemented as intended will more
clearly separate the streamlined acquisition structure from
the service's existing structure by (1) appointing Service
Acquisition Executives and Program Executive Officers who
are devoted full-time to acquisition matters, (2) giving
three-tier officials more control over acquisition matters,
and (3) removing unnecessary review layers from the
acquisition process. Until DOD issues guidance on
implementing the Defense Management Report changes and the
services update their policies and procedures, GAO cannot
determine whether or not DOD'S management accountability
goal will be fully achieved.

ARMY ACQUISITION:  AIR DEFENSE ANTITANK SYSTEM DID NOT MEET
OPERATIONAL TEST OBJECTIVES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-51
Pages:  19

The Army selected its current line-of-sight forward heavy
air defense system--known as the "Air Defense Antitank
System"--in November 1987 to provide needed air defense to
the maneuver force. However, GAO found that operational
testing did not demonstrate that the system was
operationally suitable. The system fell far short of its
availability requirements, in large part because many system
components were unreliable, and many effectiveness
requirements were not met. While the Army acknowledges the
system's problems, it believes that the system has
demonstrated sufficient operational effectiveness to warrant
continuation of the program. In August 1990, the Army opted
to defer production of the system for two years in hopes of
resolving the system's problems. Because the system has not
proven that it can meet established requirements, by law the
Army cannot obligate any procurement funding after fiscal
year 1989 until the system meets or exceeds the Army's
operational test performance criteria.

MILITARY EXPORTS:  IMPLEMENTATION OF RECENT OFFSET
LEGISLATION

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-13
Pages:  8

Offsets are a range of industrial and commercial
compensation practices required by foreign governments and
firms as conditions for the purchase of military exports.
There is a growing perception that offset arrangements erode
the U.S. industrial base as technology and component
production is transferred to foreign sources to satisfy
offset commitments. This report looks at steps taken by the
executive branch to (1) establish a comprehensive U.S.
policy on offsets addressing technology transfer, U.S.
financing of offset arrangements, and the effects of offsets
on specific subsectors of the U.S. industrial base; (2)
negotiate with foreign governments to limit the adverse
effects of offsets; and (3) require U.S. industry to notify
DOD of offset arrangements exceeding $50 million.

WEAPONS PRODUCTION:  IMPACTS OF PRODUCTION RATE CHANGES ON
AIRCRAFT UNIT COSTS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-12
Pages:  12

GAO reviewed the sensitivity of estimated procurement costs
of selected military aircraft programs to reductions in
numbers of aircraft purchased each year. Aircraft
procurement unit costs generally increase as their
procurement rates decrease. However, some mature Air Force
and Navy procurement programs, including those for the KC-
135R engine modification, F/A-18, F-16, AV-B, and F-15 would
not show as significant a unit cost increase as other
aircraft programs if their procurement rates were cut.
According to contractors, the procurement unit cost of some
mature aircraft is less sensitive to procurement rate
reductions when at least one of the following factors is
present  (1) contractors have a chance to manage overhead
and other costs in anticipation of production rate changes,
(2) foreign customers' requirements can offset reductions in
the U.S. procurement quantities, and (3) multiyear
procurement can be used to stabilize prices over a longer
production period. Contractors also said that unit cost is
especially sensitive to sudden unanticipated changes in
production rates. In GAO'S view, these circumstances
underscore the importance of program stability. When
procurement rate decreases are necessary, contractors should
be given enough advance notice so they can eliminate
unnecessary facility, overhead, and other costs before the
production rate decreases begin.

TEST AND EVALUATION:  THE DIRECTOR, OPERATIONAL TEST AND
EVALUATION'S CONTROLS OVER CONTRACTORS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-60
Pages:  17

The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, uses
contractors to assist with the operational test and
evaluation of major weapon systems. Concerns have arisen
that some of these contractors may have a conflict of
interest; that is, they could be assessing the operational
testing of the very weapon systems that they had helped to
develop. This report (l) describes the nature and extent of
the Director's management controls over contractor support,
including measures to address possible conflicts of interest
under omnibus contracts; (2) provides GAO'S views on the
Director's use of Federally Funded Research and Development
Centers, particularly the Institute for Defense Analyses;
and (3) determines the Director's use of the Institute
during fiscal years 1987 through 1989 and identifies any
possible conflicts of interest and the Institute's controls
to avoid such conflicts.  While the Director's policies and
procedures for managing contractors comply with existing
guidelines, GAO is concerned that the Institute is not now
required to disclose to the Director possible conflicts of
interest arising either from its work for no organizations
responsible for system acquisitions and development and
testing or from its use of consultants.

DOD PROCUREMENT:  CHANGES TO MILITARY SPECIFICATIONS FOR
TESTING INDUSTRIAL FASTENERS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-84
Pages:  8

Concluding that several military aircraft accidents were
caused by poor quality fasteners, the Air Force made the
testing specifications for class 3 threaded fasteners more
stringent. GAO found that the Air Force followed applicable
DOD guidance in making the change. To implement the more
stringent testing specifications, the Air Force and the Navy
procured a specific gage--called an indicating gage--that
analyzes deviations in fastener threads. When procuring
these gages, the Air Force and the Navy followed competitive
procurement practices specified in DOD regulations and the
Competition in Contracting Act.

BIOLOGICAL WARFARE:  BETTER CONTROLS IN DOD'S RESEARCH COULD
PREVENT UNNEEDED EXPENDITURES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-68
Pages:  20

The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972, which
prohibits development, production, and stockpiling of
biological and toxin weapons, counts over 100 nations among
its signatories. Yet the number of countries having or
suspected of having biological programs has more than
doubled since then. Starting in fiscal year 1984, Congress
began appropriating funds--$370 million so far--for the
development of countermeasures to defend against a
biological weapons attack. However, GAO found that the Army,
lacking adequate internal controls in its medical research
program, unnecessarily spent funds on research and
development efforts that did not address validated threats
and may have duplicated the research efforts of other
federal agencies.

MILITARY BASES:  RELOCATING THE NAVAL AIR STATION AGANA'S
OPERATIONS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-83
Pages:  58

To accommodate a growing tourist industry and to promote
economic development, Guam wants to expand its international
airport onto property occupied by the U.S. Naval Air Station
Agana. The government of Guam has asked the United States
many times to transfer the station facilities and land to
its control. This report looks at (1) the feasibility of
relocating Agana operations to Andersen Air Force Base,
Guam; (2) the estimated costs of such a relocation; (3) the
potential costs of making enough Navy land available at the
Air Station to expand the international airport and related
facilities without relocating all of the Navy's operations.
GAO concludes that while it is possible to consolidate Navy
and Air Force operations at Andersen Air Force Base, it
would take over 100 years to recover the costs of relocating
the Navy's operations. Although not endorsing any approach,
GAO outlines four options that would allow the airport to
expand without requiring the Navy to relocate. Navy and Guam
officials, however, have expressed concerns about each of
these options and have said that none would fully satisfy
their needs.

MILITARY BASES:  PROCESS USED BY SERVICES FOR JANUARY 1990
BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT PURPOSES

The fiscal year 1991 National Defense Authorization Act
established a new, independent commission to evaluate DOD'S
base closure and realignment proposals, and DOD must
reevaluate its January 1990 candidate bases against criteria
yet to be established. This report provides information on
DOD'S processes before passage of the act. GAO discusses (1)
how DOD had selected the domestic military bases announced
as candidates for disclosure and realignment by the
Secretary of Defense in January 1990 and (2) whether the
military services had developed realistic cost estimates for
closing and realigning the forces at those bases.  GAO found
that DOD did not provide specific written guidance to the
services on how to choose bases for closure and realignment.
Instead, the Secretary of Defense spoke to the services in
general terms, instructing them to consider anticipated
force structure and budget reductions in selecting candidate
bases. In selecting candidate bases, none of the services
used a process as comprehensive and well documented as the
one followed by the 1988 Commission on Base Realignment and
closure.  Further, the processes used by the services in
selecting bases for closure varied.  The Navy did not
develop cost and savings estimates prior to the Secretary's
January 1990 announcement, and the Army and Air Force cost
and savings estimates were only preliminary; efforts to
refine these estimates were suspended with passage of the
fiscal year 1991 Defense Authorization Act.

ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE:  TACTICAL SURVEILLANCE SONOBUOY AND
RELATED SOFTWARE NEED TO BE TESTED TOGETHER

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-41
Pages:  13

Sonobuoys, which are dropped into the ocean from
antisubmarine aircraft, can pick up noises from enemy
submarines and transmit this information by radio to the
plane; this data can then be used to identify, locate, and
attack the submarines. GAO found that the Navy's revised
acquisition strategy adds risk to the Tactical Surveillance
Sonobuoy Program because the sonobuoys may need to be
modified if deficiencies are revealed during operational
testing in fiscal year 1993. Also, if the development of the
aircraft software is further delayed, the Navy will be
unable to use the sonobuoys for some time after they are
delivered. Finally, the revised strategy contradicts Navy
guidance, which generally requires operational test and
evaluation of an entire system before production is
authorized. The Tactical Surveillance Sonobuoy Program is
not an exception to this rule. Consequently, GAO recommends
that the Navy not authorize further production of the
sonobuoy until testing proves that it will work when it is
integrated with the new aircraft software.

OVER-THE-HORIZON RADAR:  BETTER JUSTIFICATION NEEDED FOR DOD
SYSTEMS' EXPANSION

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-61
Pages:  25

The Air Force's Over-the-Horizon Backscatter radar, which
can detect and track bomber-size aircraft, was originally
developed to provide the North American Aerospace Defense
Command's continental air defenses with early warnings of an
attack. The Navy's Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar was
designed to provide air surveillance and warnings of bomber
attacks on Navy battle groups and other U.S. and allied
tactical forces.  This report (1) examines DOD's plans to
use the Air Force radar for counterdrug purposes and (2)
provides information on the cost, design, acquisition and
deployment, missions, and inoperability of both the Air
Force and Navy radar programs.  GAO concludes that DOD needs
to clarify the primary purposes of the central radar system.
If the main purpose is for air defense, rather than the
counterdrug mission, future budget requests should be
justified on that basis, describing what threat the system
is expected to detect. Before providing funds for any
additional Over-the-Horizon Backscatter radar sectors,
Congress may wish to have in hand satisfactory operational
test results on the east coast radar system.

NAVY BUDGET:  POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT
BUDGET

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-65
Pages:  16

GAO reviewed the Navy's aircraft procurement budget request
for fiscal year 1991 and appropriations for the preceding
two years to identify potential budget reductions and
rescissions, including amounts that are not being used for
the purposes appropriated. GAO identified $972.1 million in
potential reductions and rescissions for congressional
consideration. If the proposed procurement of certain
aircraft is reduced or deferred, $658.8 million would be
available from the fiscal year 1991 budget request. An
additional $313.3 million in fiscal years 1989 and 1990
appropriated funds could be rescinded since they are not
being used for the original purposes identified in the
budget requests.

This briefing report looks at the Navy's justification for
its fiscal year 1991 Weapons Procurement budget request and
prior year appropriations. GAO found potential reduction in
the following six weapon and ordnance systems  Trident II
(D-5) missile, Tomahawk cruise missile, High Speed Anti-
Radiation Missile (HARM), MK-48 advanced capability torpedo,
MK-50 advanced lightweight torpedo, and 16-inch gun
ammunition. Although no reductions are involved, GAO also
reviewed the following five weapon systems to report on
timely programmatic issues  Phoenix missile, Standard
Missile, Rolling Airframe Missile, Penguin missile, and
Vertical Launched Antisubmarine rocket.  GAO also identified
prior year funds that were no longer needed for purposes
specified in the selected weapon system procurement
programs.

NAVY BUDGET:  STATUS OF FLYING HOUR AND STEAMING DAY
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-62
Pages:  5

In 1988 Congress asked that the Navy provide budget
justifications for its aircraft flying hour and ship
steaming day programs. These justifications were to include
measurable mission-related goals and the resources need to
meet them, a method for measuring the degree to which the
goals have been met, and an explanation of any differences
between the goals and the actual results. GAO found that the
Navy added three performance indicators in its fiscal year
1990 steaming day budget justifications. The Navy has not
yet developed performance indicators for its flying hour
budget justifications but expects that indicators will be
incorporated into the fiscal year 1992 budget
justifications.  In addition, the Navy has made an effort to
quantify the relationship of flying hours and steaming days
to proficiency and mission readiness. However, because
factors other than the number and frequency of flying hours
and steaming days--such as personnel, equipment, materiel,
and maintenance--affect proficiency and mission readiness,
quantifying the relationship between budget requests and
accomplishment of program goals is difficult. The increased
operational requirements of Operation Desert Shield will
further complicate the process. Thus, the Navy cannot relate
actual versus planned program performance in terms of
program expenditures.

DEFENSE INVENTORY:  DOD'S HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-87FS
Pages:  16

GAO reviewed DOD'S Humanitarian Assistance Program and its
effect on the utilization and donation programs run by the
General Services Administration. Under the Humanitarian
Assistance Program, DOD can make available for humanitarian
relief any nonlethal excess supplies in its system. In the
mid 1980s, the program was used to donate excess property to
help refugee and resistance groups in Afghanistan and to fly
wounded Afghans to the United States and Europe for medical
treatment. Since then, DOD has transferred excess property
to an increasing number of other countries.  This fact sheet
provides information on (1) the quantity and category of
excess material and equipment donated through the program on
an annual basis; (2) the value of these items, based on the
acquisition cost or other valuation; (3) a list of countries
and organizations within those countries that have received
excess property; (4) the annual costs for transporting
excess property; and (5) an assessment of how well excess
property has been used.

ENLISTED FORCE MANAGEMENT:  PAST PRACTICES AND FUTURE
CHALLENGES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-48
Pages:  61

Direct costs for enlisted personnel, who comprise over 85
percent of the total U.S. active-duty military force,
account for one-sixth of the annual defense budget. The high
cost of maintaining a balanced and ready enlisted force
underscores the need for efficient and effective management
of these resources, particularly as the services move toward
smaller forces. This report examines how the services (1)
manage the size and composition of their enlisted forces,
(2) are planning for enlisted force reductions, and (3)
comply with DOD requirements for enlisted force management.
Because the Navy and the Marine Corps do not keep records on
key enlisted force management data submitted to DOD, GAO
only reviewed the Air Force and the Army.

BATTLESHIPS:  ISSUES ARISING FROM THE EXPLOSION ABOARD THE
U.S.S. IOWA

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-4
Pages:  64

In the April 1989 explosion aboard the U.S.S. Iowa, 47
sailors died when bags of gun powder ignited in one of the
battleship's gun turrets. GAO asked the Department of
Energy's Sandia National Laboratories to review the Navy's
technical analysis of the incident; the Navy had concluded
that the explosion was caused by a deliberate act and not by
a defect in the gun or propellent.  While Sandia could
neither confirm nor deny the Navy's conclusion, it did
identify a plausible alternative explanation--that due to
its impact sensitivity, the gun powder could have exploded
as it was being rammed against the base of a shell. As a
result of Sandia's findings, the Navy halted all firings of
the 16-inch guns. With Sandia's help, it is doing more
testing. On the basis of that testing, and because of the
battleships' role in Operation Desert Shield, the Navy has
lifted the firing suspension for the U.S.S. Missouri and the
U.S.S. Wisconsin.  GAO found no evidence of any systemic
safety or serviceability problems aboard the battleships.
GAO did discover problems with the adequacy of supervisory
personnel levels, including the personnel for operating the
turrets, and with training for 16-inch gun operations.   GAO
recommends that, unless current Middle East operations
convincingly demonstrate the utility of the battleships to
support an amphibious assault, the Navy decommission the
Missouri and the Wisconsin.

DEFENSE PROCUREMENT:  NOT PROVIDING TECHNICAL DATA MAY LIMIT
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY COMPETITION

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-53
Pages:  9

Full and open competition involves allowing all sources
capable of meeting the government's needs to compete. Of the
1,047 contracts valued at over $25,000 awarded by the
Defense General Supply Center in Richmond, Virginia, during
the third quarter of fiscal year 1988, less than two percent
were classified as based on other than full and open
competition; the rest were considered fully competitive.
However, GAO found that almost half of these contracts were
actually based on solicitations giving only part numbers as
item descriptions. In general, GAO believes that these
purchase descriptions were inconsistent with full and open
competition. Although the Defense Logistics Agency has
recently stopped classifying and processing solicitations as
fully competitive on the basis of part numbers, other
problems remain that may be causing opportunities for
competition to be missed. This report discusses actions
needed to ensure that Defense Logistics Agency supply
centers award future contracts on the basis of full and open
competition.

COST AND FINANCING OF OPERATION DESERT SHIELD

Order No.:  GAO/T-NSIAD-91-3
Pages:  15

The Comptroller General testified that the total U.S. cost
of Operation Desert Shield could exceed $130 billion in
fiscal year 1991. This estimate consists of three components
the baseline cost of the U.S. forces committed to Desert
Shield ($100 billion); the incremental cost of mounting the
operation, including troop deployment, calling up the
reserves, and providing required additional support for the
forces ($30 billion); and related costs like debt
forgiveness for Egypt and humanitarian assistance ($7
billion). The first component involves funds that would be
spent whether the troops were in the Middle East or
elsewhere.  To date, 35 countries have furnished troops and
equipment.  Yet contributions to defray U.S. expenses are
small relative to the total U.S. cost of the operation; DOD
has reported receipt of cash contributions of about $4.3
billion and in-kind contributions of about $379 million. As
a result of Operation Desert Shield, DOD is obligating its
fiscal year 1991 appropriations at a rapid pace and will
exhaust some of these funds by spring. A supplemental
appropriation to cover the costs of Operation Desert Shield
seems inevitable, the Comptroller General testified. Because
of many uncertainties in the cost estimates, however, GAO
believes that it would be inappropriate to provide a lump
sum supplemental now. Instead, Congress should provide
periodic appropriations during the fiscal year, as actual
costs become clearer. Some of the uncertainties are (1) the
unknown value of offsets like assistance in kind, including
fuel and water; (2) inadequate DOD guidance on what
constitutes Desert Shield costs (an important factor in any
emergency appropriations under the Budget Enforcement Act);
and (3) other factors like a decision to implement a

RANGELAND MANAGEMENT:  BLM EFFORTS TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED
LIVESTOCK GRAZING NEED STRENGTHENING

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-17
Pages:  16

Unauthorized livestock grazing on public rangelands--known
as grazing trespass--can take several forms, including
grazing more livestock than allowed by permit, grazing in
areas that are closed to livestock, or grazing during
unauthorized times of the year. An effective trespass
program must reasonably ensure that offenders, especially
willful ones, (1) will be detected and (2) when detected,
will be assessed a penalty that will not only penalize them
but serve as a deterrent to others. However, GAO found that
the Bureau of Land Management's trespass enforcement efforts
do not meet either of these requirements. Because many
grazing areas are inspected infrequently or not at all,
offenders are unlikely to be detected. Even when offenders
are detected, BLM often exacts no penalties and--for the
more serious violations--seldom assesses the minimum
penalties its own regulations require. BLM staff attribute
the shortfalls in trespass detection and deterrence
primarily to insufficient staff levels. While more staff
would undoubtedly improve performance, GAO believes that
more effective and aggressive detection and deterrence are
possible with existing staffing levels.

MINERAL REVENUES:  FUNDING FOR THE IDAHO INITIATIVE PROJECT

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-50
Pages:  4

The U.S. Geological Survey's Office of Mineral Resources
seeks to identify areas having significant mineral
potential. One such effort is the Idaho Initiative, a $4.5
million, three-year study of roadless and undeveloped
federal lands in Idaho. This report traces $1 million in
fiscal year 1989 expenditures for that project.

OREGON DUNES RECREATION AREA:  PATENTING OF MINING CLAIMS
COMPLIES WITH LAW

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-8
Pages:  39

Under the Mining Law of 1872, U.S. citizens and businesses
are allowed to locate mining claims on most federal lands
and then to obtain full title to them. In 1959 mining claims
were filed for silica sand along the Oregon coast--a site
which in 1972 became the Oregon National Dunes Recreation
Area. In October 1989, at the request of the claim holder,
the federal government transferred title through the patent
process to 780 acres of mining claims in this scenic area.
GAO found that the federal government acted properly when it
concluded that the claims contained an uncommon variety of
sand and, therefore, the claims were subject to the patent
provision of the Mining Law of 1872. In addition, the claim
holder and the federal government complied with the legal
and administrative requirements for patenting. GAO notes,
however, that this situation does raise questions about the
consistency of the mining law's patent provision with more
recent national natural resource policies that call for the
federal government to maintain ownership of federal lands
and to obtain fair market value for public resources.

PARKS AND RECREATION:  RESOURCE LIMITATIONS AFFECT CONDITION
OF FOREST SERVICE RECREATION SITES

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-48
Pages:  64

The Forest Service runs the largest inventory of outdoor
recreation sites in the country.  About 13,000 of these
sites are developed, featuring campgrounds, picnic areas,
and boating and interpretive sites.  GAO estimates that the
Forest Service had a $449 million backlog of unmet
maintenance and reconstruction needs at these sites, more
than double the amount the agency reported in 1986. GAO
developed its own estimate of the backlog because the Forest
Service lacks a reliable system for monitoring or reporting
on the nationwide condition and maintenance needs of its
developed recreation sites. Forest Service officials
attributed the backlog to a lack of personnel and funds. GAO
found that little of the agency's overall recreation budget
is devoted to making the needed repair, and factors like
aging facilities and increased usage are compounding the
problem. GAO is concerned that deferred maintenance could
ultimately result in the loss of many sites. Resource
limitations were only one of several factors affecting
changes in the size and type and to a lesser extent the
number and length of season of developed recreation sites.
However, resource limitations have reduced and eliminated
services like garbage collection and site cleaning. The
Forest Service is now relying on volunteer and a
public/private cost-share program to help compensate for
limited resources. GAO believes that this strategy--while
helpful--faces constraints that will limit its effectiveness
in reducing the backlog.

REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT:  FEDERAL SUPPORT TO THE STATES HAS
DECLINED

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-51
Pages:  40

The Refugee Act of 1980 authorized federal assistance to
resettle refugees in the United States on a uniform basis,
regardless of their country of origin. Upwards of 900,000
refugees have entered this country over the past decade.
Although funds have been appropriated since the expiration
of the act in 1988, the amounts involved have declined,
shifting refugee resettlement costs to state and local
governments. As a result of this and diminished funds to
states for job training and other services, Department of
Health and Human Services assistance per refugee fell 48
percent in 1989 constant dollars--from $6,921 to $3,600.
This report provides (1) estimates of the costs transferred
from the federal government to states as a result of recent
cuts in federal refugee assistance, (2) information from and
views of public and private sector officials on whether
recent reductions have resulted in service cutbacks to
refugees, and (3) data on changes in the percentage of
refugees receiving cash assistance and changes in other
indicators of refugee self-sufficiency.

LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE:  STATES CUSHIONED FUNDING
CUTS BUT ALSO SCALED BACK PROGRAM BENEFITS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-13
Pages:  52

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides
eligible households with assistance for home energy costs.
Assistance is available to (1) help families with cooling
costs, (2) prevent energy cutoffs in crisis situations, and
(3) help families make their homes more energy efficient.
GAO found that between fiscal years 1986 and 1989, the
states--while offsetting about one-fourth of the cuts in
federal funding for the program, mainly with oil overcharge
funds resulting from legal settlements with major oil
producers--scaled back energy assistance benefits In
addition, most states served fewer households, although 43
percent attributed the decrease to factors other than
federal funding cuts, such as improved economic conditions
that reduced the need for assistance. States generally
complied with key program requirements by assuring the
Department of Health and Human Services that they were (1)
doing outreach activities, especially for the elderly and
handicapped, and (2) targeting benefits to households most
in need. Also, the four states GAO visited had incorporated
fiscal controls to prevent erroneous payments. GAO found
that in nearly all states, other government and private
sector programs provide home energy assistance to low-income
households In fiscal year 1989, this assistance amounted to
about $200 million.

TAX ADMINISTRATION:  EFFECTIVENESS OF IRS' RETURN PREPARER
PENALTY PROGRAM IS QUESTIONABLE

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-12
Pages:  73

Almost half the individual income tax returns filed in 1989
were done by paid return preparers. The Internal Revenue
Service has had problems with what it characterizes as
incompetent and unscrupulous tax return preparers who
understate their clients' tax liabilities. GAO found that
IRS needs to better ensure that preparers engaged in
negligent or abusive tax practices are penalized. Although
IRS generally assesses the right penalty once it decides to
penalize a preparer, penalty cases are often not opened when
potential preparer misconduct was evident on returns with at
least $5,000 in taxes owed. This limits IRS' ability to
penalize preparers who are guilty of misconduct and may
weaken the agency's ability to deter preparer misconduct for
the large number of returns not reviewed in IRS' examination
program. IRS examiners and their supervisors said that they
were reluctant to pursue the penalties because of the low
dollar amounts involved.  Even though preparer penalties may
not yield significant revenues, GAO believes that their
potential long-term effect in encouraging voluntary
compliance by preparers and their clients should also be
considered. GAO also found that IRS district offices
sometimes assess different penalties and penalty amounts for
similar misconduct. IRS referral of taxpayer preparers for
disciplinary action can provide further incentives for
compliance. However, the effectiveness of this process is
limited because referrals are often not made when required.

INTERNATIONAL AVIATION:  IMPLICATIONS OF RATIFYING MONTREAL
AVIATION PROTOCOL NO. 3

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-45
Pages:  18

The U.S. government has long been dissatisfied with the low
level of compensation allowed under international law for
injuries or deaths resulting from international aviation
accidents. Under current agreements to which the United
States is a party, an airline is liable for a maximum of
only $75,000 per passenger. A new agreement--Montreal
Aviation Protocol No. 3--is now before the U.S. Senate for
ratification, accompanied by a plan to provide supplemental
compensation for victims of international aviation
disasters. Overall, GAO concludes that American victims of
international aviation accidents and their families would be
better compensated under Protocol No. 3 than under existing
internal agreements. Claimants would no longer have to prove
that the airline was at fault before they received
compensation, and incentives would be provided for airlines
to settle claims quickly. Claimants' costs would be reduced
because in many cases a trial would be avoided. In addition,
the Protocol would raise the airlines' liability limit,
provide funds for additional compensation of victims, and
decrease the proportion of the damage awards that go to
paying claimants' legal costs. The Protocol and the plan
would also increase the likelihood that Americans' lawsuits
would be tried in U.S. courts if compensation offers are
unsatisfactory, resulting in U.S. standards of compensation
being used in determining damage awards. Finally, GAO
concludes that Protocol No. 3 is unlikely to harm airline
safety.  Adverse economic impacts due to aviation accidents
and government safety regulations--not fear of litigation--
are the primary incentives for airlines to operate safely.

TRUCK SAFETY:  IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED IN FHWA'S MOTOR CARRIER
SAFETY PROGRAM

Order No:  GAO/RCED-91-30
Pages:  28

To promote the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles,
the Federal Highway Administration is required to develop a
way to ensure the safety fitness of owners and operators. In
October 1986, FHWA began a safety review program to educate
motor carriers--persons or companies that transport goods or
passengers as a business--about federal safety regulations
and to rate the safety management controls that carriers
have in place to comply with these regulations. GAO found
that FHWA had rated about 40 percent of the interstate motor
carriers in business as of May 1990. While the agency has
accomplished a great deal, about 129,000 carriers still need
to be rated before FHWA'S established deadline of September
30, 1992. GAO believes that FHWA is unlikely to meet this
deadline because (1) the universe of carriers is constantly
changing (due to the entry of new carriers and carriers that
merge and go out of business) and (2) FHWA has assigned a
limited number of safety investigators to this task.
Although 70 percent of the motor carriers assessed under the
safety review program received a less than satisfactory
rating, FHWA has not adequately implemented its two follow-
up procedures for ensuring that carriers correct
deficiencies in safety management controls--certification
letters from carriers and compliance reviews. Until FHWA
knows whether carriers have improved their controls, it
cannot be sure that its safety review program is promoting
the safe operation of commercial vehicles.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL:  EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE OCEANIC SYSTEM
DELAYED

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-2
Pages:  13

Air traffic control services in non-radar oceanic areas
remain essentially unchanged from the 1950s, with oceanic
air traffic controllers still manually updating flight
progress on the basis of periodic radio reports received
from pilots. This labor-intensive and time-consuming process
results in large separation distances between aircraft, long
flights, and lost opportunities for fuel savings. While FAA
has started to provide oceanic controllers with automation
support, the agency's primary modernization effort--the
Oceanic Display and Planning System, still not fully
operational, is over three years behind schedule, and is now
more than three times the original contract cost. FAA'S
long-term strategy is to use satellites to provide accurate,
near real-time control information on oceanic flights;
however, because this strategy now relies on the successful
deployment of the Oceanic Display and Planning System, the
outcome of this approach is unknown.

Schnuck Markets, Inc. Seeks Approval to Divest Twenty-three
Supermarkets in St. Louis Area

FOR YOUR INFORMATION......................JANUARY 10, 1996

     Schnuck Markets, Inc. has applied for Federal Trade
Commission approval to divest 23 St. Louis, Missouri-area
supermarkets to Family Company of America, which intends to
operate the stores as a single grocery chain under the "National"
trade name (see attached list of stores proposed for
divestiture).  The application will be subject to public comment
until Feb. 9.

     Schnucks is based in St. Louis.  Family Company of America
is a newly-formed company, also based in St. Louis, and its
senior management consists largely of former senior managers of
the National Holdings, Inc. supermarket chain.  The divestitures
are required under a 1995 consent order Schnucks signed to settle
FTC charges that the firm's acquisition of supermarkets owned by
National Holdings, Inc. would violate federal antitrust law and
potentially lead to anticompetitive pricing and other conduct
that could hurt supermarket customers in the St. Louis area.  The
consent order requires 24 supermarket divestitures so as to
restore competition.  Schnucks stated in its application that it
still is seeking a buyer for the 24th store.

     According to the application, the proposed divestiture plan
will establish a "substantial competitive force in the market." 
Family would be the third-largest competitor in the market and
its size "will enable it to take advantage of available economies
of scale, especially in such areas as purchasing and advertising,
and its use of the  National' trade name will help ensure an
immediate procompetitive impact," the application states. 
Schnucks also maintains that the proposed subleases of real
estate on which some of the stores are owned "will not adversely
affect the ability of incentives of Family, Schnucks, or any
other party to compete."

     Comments on the application should be addressed to the FTC,
Office of the Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.   Copies of the application and the
order are available from the FTC's Public Reference Branch, Room
130, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.

Praxair to Settle FTC Charges Over CBI Acquisition;
Will Divest Four CBI Plants to Restore Competition

FOR RELEASE:  JANUARY 11, 1996

     Praxair, Inc. has agreed to divest four atmospheric gases
production plants to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that its $2
billion acquisition of CBI Industries, Inc. would violate federal
antitrust laws, reduce competition and raise prices in the market for
atmospheric gases produced off-site for industrial customers in several
areas of the country.

     Praxair, based in Danbury, Connecticut, is the largest supplier of
industrial gases, including atmospheric gases, in America, and the third
largest supplier worldwide.  CBI, which competes with Praxair, is
headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois.  

     The products at issue in the case are "merchant" atmospheric gases
-- nitrogen, oxygen and argon -- supplied to customers via tanker truck
or in cylinders (as opposed to atmospheric gases produced for customers
on-site or near their production facilities.)  Merchant nitrogen is used
in industrial applications such as heat treating, chemical blanketing
and freezing.  Merchant oxygen is used in foundries, steel and glass
production and for medical purposes.  Merchant argon is primarily used
for welding. There are no adequate substitutes for any of the three
gases, the FTC alleged.

     According to the FTC complaint detailing the charges, the
acquisition would reduce competition in the merchant oxygen and nitrogen
markets in both northern and southern California, and also would reduce
competition for merchant nitrogen, oxygen and argon in eastern
Connecticut and western Wisconsin/southeastern Minnesota.  Entry by a
new firm in those markets would be time consuming, costly and unlikely,
the complaint says.  Thus, the proposed acquisition would violate
federal antitrust laws in those areas by:

     -- eliminating direct competition between Praxair and CBI;     

     -- enhancing the likelihood of collusion or other anticompetitive
practices among the      remaining competitors in California;

     -- eliminating competition between the two closest competitors in
eastern Connecticut      and the two closest competitors in western
Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota;

     -- increasing the likelihood that Praxair would unilaterally
exercise market power in      eastern Connecticut, western Wisconsin and
southeastern Minnesota; and,

     -- increasing the likelihood that prices for the gases would
increase in those geographic  areas.

     The proposed consent agreement to settle the charges and restore
competition would require Praxair to divest, individually or in some
combination, CBI's atmospheric gas production facilities in Vacaville
and Irwindale, California; Bozrah, Connecticut; and Madison, Wisconsin.
The proposed divestitures would have to be completed within 12 months
from the date the order becomes final.  If Praxair were to fail to
divest the assets within the specified time frame, the Commission could
appoint a trustee to divest the four plants. 

     To remedy any anticompetitive effects of the acquisition pending
divestiture, Praxair must maintain the four CBI production facilities as
viable, independent competitors of Praxair's nearby plants. 
Accordingly, Praxair has agreed to hold the plants separate from its
other businesses and take steps to assure that no confidential
information is exchanged between the plants and those other businesses. 

     The Commission vote to accept the proposed consent agreement for
public comment was 5-0.  The proposed consent agreement will be
published in the Federal Register shortly and will be subject to public
comment for 60 days, after which the Commission will decide whether to
make it final.  Comments should be addressed to the FTC, Office of the
Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20580.

NOTE: A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not
constitute an admission of a law violation.  When the Commission issues
a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with
respect to future actions.  Each violation of such an order may result
in a civil penalty of $10,000.

     Copies of the complaint, the proposed consent agreement and an
analysis of the agreement to aid the public in commenting, are available
from the FTC's Public Reference Branch, Room 130, at the address listed
above; 202-326-2222; TTY for the hearing impaired 202-326-2502.  To find

Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation Petitions to Modify
an Agreement in Connection with its Acquisition of
Healthtrust, Inc.

FOR YOUR INFORMATION...........................JANUARY 11, 1995

     Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, of Nashville,
Tennessee, has petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to modify
an agreement between the firm and the agency reached in
connection with the firm's acquisition of Healthtrust, Inc..  The
requested modification would eliminate Columbia/HCA's obligations
to "hold separate" the Utah Healthtrust assets pending
divestiture of a lease for commercial office space in a third-party-owned 
building in the Salt Lake City area after
Columbia/HCA's divestiture of certain Utah hospitals.  The FTC is
seeking public comments on the petition for 10 days, until Jan.
22.  Columbia/HCA stated in this petition that, shortly, it will
submit a second petition in which it will seek to end its
obligation to divest the lease.

     The agreement at issue accompanies a consent order that
Columbia/HCA signed to settle FTC charges that its $3 billion
merger with Healthtrust would impair hospital competition --
leading to higher prices, reduced services, or both -- in areas
of Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Utah.  To restore that
competition, the consent order requires a total of seven
divestitures and mandates that Columbia/HCA terminate its
participation in a joint venture.  Under the accompanying "hold
separate" agreement, Columbia/HCA is required to operate the
assets to be divested independently of its other hospitals.

     Columbia/HCA maintains in its petition that the lease is for
office space used by a company, Infusamed, that provided home
health/home infusion services and pharmacy services. The consent
order did not require Columbia to divest Infusamed.  And this is
a different market than the market at issue in the FTC case,
which is acute care inpatient hospital services, the petition
states.

     Comments should be addressed to the FTC, Office of the
Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20580.

     Copies of the petition, and of the consent order and hold
separate agreement are available from the FTC's Public Reference
Branch, Room 130, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20580; 202-326-2222; TTY for the hearing

Comments of the Staff of the Bureau of Consumer Protection in
the Matter of Direct-to-Consumer Promotion

BEFORE THE                                
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

               In the Matter of Direct-to-Consumer
                    Promotion; Public Hearing

                       Docket No. 95N-0227

                     Comments of the Staff of
                the Bureau of Consumer Protection
                   and the Bureau of Economics
                 of the Federal Trade Commission


January 11, 1996

    Introduction.

     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested
comments regarding the promotion of prescription drug products
directly to consumers (DTC) through print, broadcast, and other
media.  Among other things, the agency announced that it "is
particularly interested in exploring whether, and, if so, how,
the agency's current regulatory approach should be modified."  
The staffs of the Bureau of Consumer Protection and the Bureau of
Economics of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offer the
following comments to assist the FDA in its deliberations, based
on our experience in analyzing the effects of information in
consumer product markets and in considering legal requirements
that address information issues.

     The FTC enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act, which
among other things prohibits deceptive or unfair practices in or
affecting commerce.  One of the FTC's primary responsibilities is
to enforce the law prohibiting deceptive practices in national
advertising.  The FTC considers the prevention of deceptive
health-related advertising claims to be of utmost importance, and
has taken action in numerous cases involving deceptive health-related 
claims about OTC drugs, food products, dietary
supplements, and medical devices.  In implementing its mandate,
the FTC has developed considerable expertise in the role of
advertising in the consumer information environment.

     The staff of the Commission also has experience examining
the effects of laws affecting advertising on market performance,
including in the prescription drug market.  While important
differences between advertising for prescription drugs and
advertising for other products might lead to different
approaches, we believe that the staff's experience, particularly
regarding marketing and economic issues, has a bearing on many of
the DTC advertising issues on which the FDA is seeking comment.

     Truthful and non-misleading advertising can help consumers
manage their own health care.  Advertisements can, for example,
provide timely information regarding medical advances, remind
consumers about good health care practices, and supply
information needed by consumers to understand and evaluate their
physician's recommendations.  On the other hand, deceptive or
misleading advertisements in the prescription drug area can
impose particularly high costs on consumers.  Whether or not a
particular advertisement might mislead consumers will turn on the
specific facts associated with that ad (and a determination of
the claims being made).  Any analysis of the likelihood of
deception would therefore depend on a case by case evaluation. 
The FTC staff believes that the Commission's Deception Policy
Statement and its Statement on Advertising Substantiation may
assist the FDA in evaluating prescription drug advertisements.

II.  The Potential Effects of DTC Advertising on Consumers and
     the Marketplace. 

     Assessments of DTC regulatory options are likely to depend
on one's understanding of DTC advertising's effects on consumers
and the marketplace.  In this section we consider this issue. 
First, we consider the incentives to provide consumers with
information about drug therapies.  Second, we describe the unique
role of advertising, in general, and of DTC prescription drug
advertising, in particular, in the consumer information
environment.  Third, we describe the potential effects of DTC
advertising on competition.  Finally, we consider how regulations
can be designed to encourage the potentially beneficial effects
of advertising while discouraging its potentially harmful
effects.

     A.   Incentives to Provide Consumers with Information About
          Alternative Drug Therapies.

     We believe this is a particularly good time to examine the
potential value of DTC advertising.  With the growth of managed
care organizations, consumers are expected to become more
actively involved in their health care decisions and to demand
more information on alternative therapies.  The recent growth
of DTC pharmaceutical advertising expenditures is consistent
with the view that consumers are demanding more product
information. 

     Substantial information about drug therapies is provided to
consumers by independent parties.  Newspapers report on new
drugs, books describe drug options, magazines discuss
alternative therapies, and public health organizations provide
a wealth of information.
 
     Despite the existence of these sources, economic reasoning
suggests that advertising can be an important supplemental source
of information.  Information, like most goods, is costly to
provide.  However, in contrast to most products, information is
not used up when it is consumed, and it is often possible to use
information without paying for it, that is, to "free ride."  As a
result, markets may tend to provide consumers with less than the
optimal amount of information.

     Advertising can reduce this problem.  Firms will provide
health information to consumers when it is profitable to do so. 
Profitability depends on several factors that affect the 
marginal benefits and costs of advertising.  For example,
extensive disclosure requirements can substantially increase the
cost of advertising, thereby decreasing a firm's incentive to
advertise. (Of course, such disclosures may nonetheless be
needed sometimes to prevent deception).

     Firms have strong incentives to provide information about
disease conditions and possible treatments if they can associate
the information with products they sell.  Although firms with
relatively large market shares may find it profitable to provide
advertising messages that do not make such an association,
smaller competitors are less likely to find such advertising
profitable, due to the "free-riding" phenomenon.
  
     Incentives to advertise are also enhanced when firms can
initiate new campaigns quickly.  For example, the sooner
information on product improvements reaches consumers, the sooner
firms can begin through sales to recoup research and development
investments and advertising expenditures.  Similarly, the
incentive to advertise is likely to be greater when firms can
respond rapidly to advertising by competitors.

     B.   Prescription Drug Advertising as a Unique Source of
          Some Information that Can Enhance Consumer Welfare.

     Prescription drug advertising, like any type of advertising,
represents only one component of the total consumer information
environment, which includes the media, package inserts, reference
books, doctors, and pharmacists.  Advertising, like any of these
components, is better at some tasks than others.  For example,
broadcast advertisements are relatively good for disseminating
short bits of information to large audiences but not for
providing complex information.  Complex information is often
disseminated more effectively at another point in the product
consideration and purchasing process, such as through labeling at
the point of sale.  Although reference books that describe drug
characteristics are useful, they may lack information about
recent innovations and may not reach a wide audience.  In
contrast, advertising can inform about product innovations as
soon as they are brought to market.  Advertising can also remind
people of information that they might already know but that has
faded from memory.

     Different forms of advertising may have different advantages
and disadvantages as means of communicating information.  Complex
information is often communicated more effectively through print
media than through broadcast media.  Internet advertising may be
particularly efficient at reaching small sub-populations with a
strong interest in certain types of drugs.
  
     Obviously, one concern with advertised information is that
manufacturers will be inclined to favor their products. 
Although some forces weigh against this outcome, they may be
insufficient to prevent firms from making unfounded claims,
whether intentionally or inadvertently.  Deceptive claims in the
prescription drug area can have serious consequences.

     Although prescription drug advertising shares many
characteristics of advertising in other markets, prescription
drugs have several characteristics that make the analysis of
prescription drug advertising to consumers distinctive.  For
example, product safety and efficacy is a particularly important
issue in this advertising market.  At the product level, this
concern is addressed by the requirement that all prescription
drugs be pre-approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy. 
 
     Concerns about product safety and efficacy are reflected in
control of access to prescription drugs.  Doctors must prescribe
them, and they must be dispensed by pharmacists.  These controls
should help ensure that inappropriate drugs are not used.

     Advertising may make consumers aware of more convenient or
otherwise more desirable versions of drugs than those they
currently use.  Advertising may encourage consumers to see a
doctor for advice about conditions they might have previously
ignored or for further information about conditions already being
treated.  Advertising may cause consumers to inquire about
diagnostic tests that might not otherwise be performed.  Better
informed consumers will be better able to understand and discuss
their individual needs with their doctors and pharmacists.  Thus,
advertising can help consumers make decisions about their health
care and health care costs.  

     C.   Potential Effects of Prescription Drug Advertising on
          Price and Quality Competition.

     Advertising is an important catalyst for price and quality
competition.  Advertising can put downward pressure on prices by
spurring competition among alternative therapies.  To the
extent that prescription drugs compete with OTC drugs,
prescription drug advertising potentially can lead to lower
average prices for both product categories.  We recognize,
however, that the ultimate effect is likely to depend on the
evolution of the health care market and on the individual
characteristics of drug classes and disease conditions.
  
     Quality competition can also be motivated by advertising. 
Advertising can help foster product improvements by delivering
information to consumers on quality variables that they may not
otherwise know about.  If consumers prefer products with the
advertised qualities and receive prescriptions for these products
after consulting with their doctors, then their demand for the
advertised products is reflected in sales and the market reflects
consumer preferences.

     D.   Considerations Regarding Regulation.

     We believe that truthful and non-deceptive DTC advertising
can contribute to consumers' health information environment and 
consumer welfare.  A review of some recent DTC advertising
suggests beneficial outcomes are likely, because many
advertisements focus on the types of claims that we would expect
to help consumers, such as, for example, improved convenience and
cost advantages.  In addition, recent consumer research evidence
suggests that DTC advertisements are likely to encourage people
to seek advice from their doctors, which may result in improved
health care. 

     In a regulatory scheme for DTC advertising, therefore, we
would encourage balancing the benefits and the risks of allowing
pharmaceutical manufacturers greater latitude in their
advertising.  In particular, it is important to protect consumers
from deceptive information but not to stifle truthful information
that could benefit consumers.  As discussed below, we believe
that the net benefits of DTC advertisements can be increased by
limiting current disclosure requirements and by adjusting
disclosure requirements according to the characteristics of
different advertising venues.

III. The FTC's Approach to Advertising.

     During the FDA's public hearings on October 18 and 19, 1995,
regarding DTC prescription drug advertising, many commentators
suggested that the FDA consider adopting an approach similar to
that used by the FTC.  In light of these suggestions, it may be
helpful for us to describe the framework used by the FTC
concerning deceptive advertising.

     The Commission's policy with respect to deceptive
advertising is set out in its Deception Policy Statement and
its Statement on Advertising Substantiation.  An advertisement
is considered deceptive if it contains a representation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably
under the circumstances, and the representation or omission is
material, that is, it is likely to affect consumers' decisions
regarding purchase or use of a product.  Thus, the FTC's
approach involves identifying the claims that are conveyed by an
advertisement, both expressly and by implication, and determining
whether those claims are truthful and substantiated. 
 
     In analyzing an advertisement, the FTC focuses on the net
impression it conveys rather than on the individual elements of
the ad in isolation.  Because advertisements can mislead
consumers by what they do not say as well as by what they do say,
the omission of material information may also render an
advertisement deceptive in some circumstances.  Deception can
occur through omission of information when that information is
necessary to prevent an affirmative representation from being
misleading, or simply by remaining silent, if doing so
constitutes an implied but false representation.  The
Commission has made clear, however, that "[n]ot all omissions are
deceptive, even if providing the information would benefit
consumers."  An omission is considered deceptive only if the
absence of the information causes the advertisement to convey an
inaccurate impression about a material fact. 
  
     The FTC's focus when analyzing the adequacy of disclosures
is on their effectiveness in communicating the necessary
information in the context of the advertising at issue.  When
disclosure of information is necessary to prevent an
advertisement from conveying an inaccurate impression, the mere
physical presence of the information may not be sufficient to
prevent the ad from being considered deceptive.  Thus, the
information must be included in a manner that is calculated to be
noticed, read (or heard, if orally presented), and comprehended
by consumers.

IV.  Considering DTC Prescription Drug Advertising Issues in
     Light of the FTC's Approach.

     A.   The "Brief Summary."

     The FDA in its Federal Register Notice asked whether, and if
so, how, the "brief summary" disclosure requirements for
prescription drug advertising should be modified in the context
of consumer directed advertising for prescription drugs.
  
     Under an FTC deception analysis, the primary questions would
be whether the brief summary requirements are necessary to
prevent deception, and, if so, whether they effectively
communicate the necessary information to consumers.  Pursuant
to the FTC's deception authority, this would be a case-by-case
analysis, as the focus would be on the net impression conveyed by
a specific advertisement, and whether any or all of the brief
summary requirements would be necessary to prevent that
advertisement from conveying a deceptive impression.

     The FTC's experience in enforcing the law pertaining to
deception indicates that it is often difficult to effectively
communicate information to consumers.  More complicated messages
are more difficult to convey to consumers in an understandable
manner.  Fine print disclosures, whether in print or broadcast
advertising, are often insufficient to effectively communicate
important information.

     The "brief summary" that currently appears in consumer
directed prescription drug advertising is obviously highly
technical, complicated, and lengthy.  It is often presented in
fine print, in language that is designed for health care
professionals rather than lay persons.  We believe that the
information contained therein is therefore unlikely to be readily
focused on and understood by consumers. 

     Moreover, if the "brief summary" included information that
was necessary to prevent deception or other consumer injury, we
would be concerned that it would not be effectively communicated
by the current format.  The sheer volume of information required
to be disclosed may itself contribute to a reduced comprehension
of any such specific important information.

     Alternative means could be considered for ensuring consumer
access to information that is important for consumers to have but
that is not necessary to prevent deception or injury.  For
instance, certain kinds of DTC advertisements could provide an
"800" number for consumers to call for further information, or
an alternative source for consumers to obtain the information. 
They could also encourage consumers to ask their doctors about
product risks and benefits and to ask their pharmacists for
package insert information.

     B.   Tailoring Regulation to the Advertising Medium.

     The FDA also asked whether broadcast advertisements should
be subject to the same "brief summary" requirements as
advertisements in other media.  

     Differences among media may affect the likelihood of
deception from advertising claims and, therefore, the
appropriateness of particular approaches to preventing deception. 
Television advertising typically is presented in thirty to sixty
second lengths, although fifteen and even ten second
advertisements are not uncommon.  The brevity of television
advertising makes it very difficult to include lengthy or complex
disclosures, or to do so in a comprehensible manner.  Print
advertising, on the other hand, is more conducive to
communicating relatively complex information than TV advertising
because people can read print advertisements at their own speed,
and even re-read the information if so inclined.  Similarly,
advertising on the Internet can be read at one's own pace and can
be saved or printed for future reference.  Thus, a claim read
quickly in a broadcast advertisement might present a different
likelihood of deception than does the same claim appearing in a
print or on-line format.  Given the variety of media in which
advertising appears, it may be appropriate in designing measures
to prevent deception, such as disclosure requirements, to take
into account practical differences among various advertising
venues.  For instance, the FTC has recognized these differences
and in some cases in which disclosures have been imposed has
designed abbreviated versions for use in broadcast media.  If
necessary, abbreviated disclosures could be supplemented through
requirements that more detailed information be made available on
request and that consumers be made aware of this option.

     The FDA has also requested comments regarding the regulation
of new advertising technologies, such as the Internet.  Although
developing information technologies present new possibilities for
the innovative delivery of valuable information to consumers,
these technologies can be used to deceive consumers.  Although
new media such as the Internet clearly present new challenges
with respect to monitoring and enforcing laws against deception,
we believe that the core principles underlying the FTC's
deception policy apply as well to these developing technologies
as to more traditional advertising media.

     C.   Identifying the Source of an Advertisement.

     The FDA also seeks comment concerning infomercials and
manufacturer-supported DTC promotions that appear to be sponsored
by independent third-party services.

     Consumers' evaluation of information may be affected by an
inaccurate perception regarding its sponsorship.  A potential for
deception therefore exists when consumers do not know that what
appears to be a news broadcast or other programming is really an
infomercial, or that what appears to be independently supplied
information is really supplied by a product's manufacturer.

     This concern about infomercials underlies numerous actions
in recent years by the FTC, challenging the formats used as
deceptive.  In these cases, the FTC typically barred
advertisers from misrepresenting the nature of the "program" and
required them to disclose, at the beginning of an infomercial and
immediately before any product ordering information, that what
consumers are watching is a paid commercial.

     The FTC also has addressed the third-party endorsement
issue, both in its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and
Testimonials in Advertising and in law enforcement actions. 
The Guides suggest that the connections between an endorser and a
seller of an advertised product that "might materially affect the
weight or credibility of the endorsement (i.e., the connection is
not  reasonably expected by the audience')," should be
disclosed.  The FTC has applied the standards described in the
Guides in particular cases, involving endorsers that were
business associates of the marketer, an endorser that was an
officer or director, an endorser that was an employee of the
advertiser, and an endorser that was a product distributor. 
The concern in these cases is that the endorsers had an
undisclosed financial interest in promoting the products.  Again,
the likelihood of deception depends on the specifics of an
individual ad, and the analysis is therefore conducted on a case-by-case basis.

     D.   Regulation of Price Advertising.

     As the FDA reviews its advertising regulations, one issue
not mentioned in the Notice may also deserve attention.  The
FDA's existing brief summary requirements may have the
inadvertent effect of unnecessarily restricting the dissemination
of price information.  While the FDA regulations exempt certain
types of price claims from the brief summary requirement, the
exemption is narrow and apparently would apply only to
advertisements of the price of a specific quantity of a drug, and
not, for instance, to comparative price claims, coupons or other
forms of price reduction information. 
 
     The brief summary requirement adds to the cost of
advertising and may be expected therefore to reduce the amount of
advertising.  With respect to price advertising, therefore, the
brief summary requirements may result in less price competition. 
Price advertising can result in lower prices for consumers.  We
therefore suggest that FDA evaluate whether its limitations on
the exemption for price claims are necessary and desirable.

End of the line for pipeline deal


Hours after the FTC entered federal court to block Questar Corporation from
acquiring a 50 percent interest in Kern River Gas Transmission Company from
Tenneco, Inc., the parties called off the deal.  In the past, the parties
would nevertheless be facing a lengthy administrative trial, the price for
having forced the FTC's hand.  But under the Commission's new enforcement
policy, the matter is now moot.

The $226 million transaction would have given Questar a monopoly over natural
gas transmission services in the Salt Lake City area, the FTC charged in its
short-lived suit.

Questar had a monopoly until 1992, the FTC said, when the Kern River pipeline
opened to provide competition in the area.  Kern River is jointly and
equally-owned by Tenneco and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company.  Allowing Questar
to gain half ownership in Kern River would halt newly emerged competition in
the area, according to the agency.

A senior FTC official said the agency is paying "special attention" to
acquisitions in this newly deregulated industry and assigned at least 10
Competition Bureau attorneys to this investigation.  In this instance, the
official said, the staff identified an unusually strong "potential
competition" case:  although the acquired company hadn't made a single sale in
the market in which the acquiring company was selling, it had been making
offers and Questar allegedly always lowered its price and won the business.

The case, filed in federal district court in Utah, bears a striking
resemblance to the Justice Department's successful attempt to halt the
acquisition of one California natural gas company by another area company in
the 1960s.  The district court allowed that transaction to proceed.  But the
Supreme Court, in U.S.  v.  El Paso Natural Gas Co., et.  al.  (376 U.S.  651)
reversed the district court, ruling that mere attempts by the acquired company
to enter the market -- though unsuccessful -- had a "powerful influence" on
the market.

Questar's decision to abandon the transaction effectively ended the
Commission's enforcement activities in this case.  In the past, Questar could
have been facing administrative litigation.  FTC decisions on whether to
proceed with administrative litigation have been made on a case-by-case basis,
but respondents rarely escaped.

For instance, in 1991, the Commission chose not to proceed to administrative
litigation after going into court to enjoin Wiggins Teape Appleton plc from
acquiring a Vancouver, Washington paper mill owned by Boise Cascade
Corporation.  Wiggins did not abandon that transaction until 20 days after the
FTC asked a federal court for a preliminary injunction.

Under the Commission's new policy it is standard for the agency to close cases
once the acquisition in question is abandoned.  The FTC previously pursued
most cases administratively when the parties pushed the matter into court,
even if only to get an order requiring prior approval of future transactions.
Prior approval provisions in orders are now the exception, not the rule, under
the Commission's new policy.

Atmospheric gas merger challenged
Three little gases; no little substitutes


The $2 billion pairing of Praxair, Inc., America's largest industrial gas
supplier, and CBI Industries, Inc.  would likely harm competition for
atmospheric gases in several parts of the country, the FTC charged last week.
The U.S.  market as a whole would not suffer, but parts of California, the
midwest and the northeast could be hard hit in markets for nitrogen, oxygen
and argon, according to the FTC.  Praxair has agreed to divest four merchant
atmospheric gas production plants to settle those charges.

Those who stayed awake through science class know that nitrogen, oxygen and
argon are the three "atmospheric gases."  They are also very popular
commercial, or "merchant," gases and are shipped to customers either as a
liquid, by tanker truck, or in cylinders.

Nitrogen is used to create inert environments for heat treating and chemical
blanketing.  Food industries and others also use nitrogen for freezing
products.  Oxygen is used for combustion and oxidation in foundries, steel and
glass plants and for medical purposes.  Argon is used primarily for welding.
The common trait of all three gases is that they have no common traits with
other gases; there are no suitable substitutes for any of the three.

But the gases also have their differences, and the FTC's case against Praxair
carefully balances those differences.  Nitrogen and oxygen can be economically
shipped only 150 to 300 miles, for instance, while argon -- a more expensive
gas -- can be economically shipped much longer distances, up to about 1,000
miles, according to the FTC.

If Praxair were to acquire CBI, unfettered by divestiture, the Northern and
Southern California markets for nitrogen and oxygen could be hard hit, the
agency charged.  In both areas, five competitors would become four.  In
Northern California the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) would jump 431 points
to 3366, and Praxair would control 32 percent of the market, the FTC said.  In
Southern California, the HHI would take a similar jump, 440 points, landing at
2727 in a market where Praxair would dominate with a 34.8 percent share.

Nitrogen and oxygen markets in the Northern Midwest and Northeastern U.S.  --
and narrower markets therein, such as the Western Wisconsin/Southeastern
Minnesota area and Eastern Connecticut -- could also be harmed, according to
the FTC.

The same goes for the merchant argon markets in Eastern Connecticut and the
Western Wisconsin/Southeastern Minnesota area, where Praxair and CBI are "each
other's closest geographic competitor."  CBI's share of the argon market is
small, the FTC said.  But because its plant is so close to Praxair's in those
two areas, "localized unilateral anticompetitive effects are likely."

Praxair has agreed to divest four of CBI's atmospheric gas production
facilities.  Plants will be divested in Vacaville, California; Irwindale,
California; Bozrah, Connecticut; and Madison, Wisconsin.

Cranial shunt divestiture ordered
in Johnson & Johnson merger


Johnson & Johnson's $1.8 billion merger with Cordis Corporation snagged in the
market for cranial shunts last month.  Johnson & Johnson has agreed to divest
the Cordis's neuroscience business to a Commission-approved buyer within one
year to settle charges that the acquisition would place 85% of the U.S.
neurological shunt market into the hands of only two firms.

Neurological shunts are used to treat patients -- primarily children --
suffering from the potentially fatal brain disorder hydrocephalus, which
involves excessive pressure on the brain from an increase of fluid in the
skull.  The shunts, once installed, divert cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the
bloodstream of patients suffering from hydrocephalus.

Combining the shunt businesses of Johnson & Johnson and Cordis would raise the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to 4059 for the market, the FTC charged.  The
merger would likely lead to higher prices and reduced innovation in the
market, according to the agency.

Johnson & Johnson has agreed to divest the Cordis neuroscience business, which
includes shunts, intracranial pressure drainage systems and neuroendoscopy
products, tools used to install shunts.  The FTC alleged competitive problems
only in the market for shunts.  But "[significant synergies between the
products manufactured and sold by the [Cordis neuroscience business] exist,
and Cordis's shunts are sold as part of a broader product line," the FTC staff
said in its analysis.  "Therefore, a divestiture of the whole business is
necessary to maintain competition in the shunt market."

There is one potential snag to the divestiture:  a joint venture between
Cordis and Nobles-Lai Engineering, Inc.  to research, develop and manufacture
neuroendoscopy products.  If Nobles-Lai asserts contractual rights, the
divestiture could be held up, allowing Nobles-Lai to benefit from Johnson &
Johnson's marketing outlet and possibly giving Johnson & Johnson control over
Cordis, a situation the proposed order was meant to prevent.

To prevent that from occurring the proposed order includes an insurance
policy.  If Nobles-Lai asserts contractual rights, Johnson & Johnson has
agreed not to contract with Nobles-Lai to research, develop or market any
neuroendoscopy products.  Johnson & Johnson further agreed not to purchase
from or distribute for Nobles-Lai any such products.

Going public - A different divestiture


Oerlikon-Buhrle Holding AG has proposed using Wall Street to divest one of its
subsidiaries in the first divestiture by initial public offering (IPO) of
stock overseen by the FTC.  As envisioned, the company would not directly
divest to another company its turbomolecular pump subsidiary, Balzers-Pfeiffer
GmbH, but would instead offer the shares in Balzers-Pfeiffer.  After that, the
pump unit would operate as a stand-alone business.

Divestiture of Balzers-Pfeiffer is required under a 1995 order settling
charges that Switzerland-based Oerlikon-Buhrle's acquisition of Leybold AG, a
German corporation, would harm competition in the U.S.  turbomolecular pump
market.  Turbomolecular pumps are small "jet engine-like devices" which
produce high vacuum atmospheres used in the production of semiconductors.
[FTC:WATCH No.  422, November 7, 1994]

The FTC has requested public comment until February 1 on the proposed IPO,
though no details of the plan are currently available.  Oerlikon-Buhrle must
first jump through Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hoops before
Balzers-Pfeiffer can go public, and securities law prohibits disclosure of all
but the most basic data about an IPO until a registration statement has been
filed with the SEC.  Once that statement has been filed, the Commission plans
to offer the public an additional opportunity to comment, though not
necessarily an additional 30 days.

The FTC has approved novel forms of divestiture in the past.  In March, 1994
it approved Valspar Corporation's plan to combine four of its own plants and
five plants from a company it acquired into a new company, which was then spun
off to shareholders.  That divestiture settled concerns raised when Valspar
acquired the Resin Products Division of Cargill, Inc.  [FTC:WATCH No.  408,

For the next five years --
Buy your toys in Pennsylvania


Pennsylvania's attorney general has persuaded Playmobil USA, Inc.  to donate
$201,000 to 12 charities and another $50,000 to the state's litigation fund to
settle allegations that the firm and its German parent, geobra Brandstaetter
GmbH & Co.  KG have been keeping the prices of "toy figures, playsets and
accessories" artificially high through a resale price maintenance program.

The agreement, filed in U.S.  District Court for the Middle District of
Pennsylvania, also enjoins Playmobil from "entering into any contract,
combination, conspiracy, agreement or arrangement with any Pennsylvania dealer
to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize the retail prices at which Playmobil
products are sold to the public, or at which Pennsylvania dealers may
advertise Playmobil products."  [emphasis added]

Playmobil is also enjoined "from adopting or establishing any cooperative
advertising policy that denies or reduces advertising rebates or allowances to
a Pennsylvania dealer for any reason related to that dealer's advertised
prices."  [emphasis added]

The consent decree also bars Playmobil from cutting off dealers or
discriminating against them with regard to supply or credit terms "for failing
to adhere to any of Playmobil USA's suggested retail price for those
products."

On the other hand, Playmobil may continue to suggest prices.

The order terminates in five years.

Cigarettes under siege:
The tobacco industry's
two-front federal battle


While the tobacco industry dug in to fight against tobacco advertising
regulations proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FTC poised
itself to attack from the rear last month.  The agency staff, responding to
suggestions from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is busy readying a
proposal for the FTC that could change the way cigarette tar, nicotine and
carbon monoxide values are determined and how they are advertised.

An NCI panel announced it would suggest changes a year ago after concluding
the FTC testing procedures yield tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide figures
that do not accurately reflect the amount of those substances consumers
actually get from smoking.  The tobacco industry may agree with that
conclusion, according to a December 28 Wall Street Journal report.  The report
quotes an internal Philip Morris document that said the FTC testing method
"should be retained:  It gives low ratings."

Consumer Protection Bureau Chief Jodie Bernstein acknowledged that her staff
is working on a proposal based on the NCI panel's suggestions.  The NCI has
not yet released an official report of the two-day conference conducted by its
panel in December 1994 but the report is expected within the month.  The panel
itself released its findings at the conclusion of the conference.  [FTC:WATCH
No.  425, December 19, 1994]

The NCI panel recommended modifications to the FTC's testing methodology to
test the "ranges" of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in cigarettes.
Those ranges should be graphically depicted on each pack of cigarettes sold,
according to NCI, which further suggested use of "appropriate" disclaimers on
packages and in ads for cigarettes classified as either "light" or "ultra
light."  The disclaimers would inform consumers that, at best, evidence
suggests minimal health benefits from smoking lower tar cigarettes.

The FTC staff is exploring ways to change the machine testing protocols to
more accurately reflect the way smokers actually smoke, according to
Bernstein.  The staff proposal will also focus on changes in advertising that
would more accurately reflect the levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide
smokers actually get from smoking.  A graphic depiction of the ranges is among
the proposals under consideration at the FTC.

The NCI panel's suggestion of a graphic depiction of the ranges on every pack
is a recommendation that could run up against the Cigarette Labeling and
Advertising Act.  That law mandates rotating health warnings on cigarette
packages and bars the FTC from requiring any alternative warning.  But the Act
does not restrict the FTC from requiring alternative health warnings in
advertising.  It is in ads, not on packages, that the FTC staff is considering
mandating the graphs of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide values.

At the FDA

The FDA attempt to restrict tobacco advertising in the name of children is
taking heat off any FTC effort at tobacco advertising regulation.  The tobacco
industry launched a major legal strike against the FDA proposal earlier this
month, on the deadline for comments.  As the media scrambled to cover the
tobacco industry offensive, the FTC's comment to the FDA got lost in the
shuffle.

But those comments supported the FDA's goal -- to make cigarettes less
accessible and less attractive to children.  The FTC recommended narrowly
tailoring the regulations to that goal to avoid a First Amendment fight but
encouraged the FDA to "consider a coordinated regulatory enforcement approach
with state and local government agencies."

Commissioner Mary L.  Azcuenaga concurred with the FTC filing of comments at
the FDA, but only "insofar as it reflects the Commission's expertise in
analyzing advertising claims."  The constitutionality of the FDA's regulations
is not for the FTC to consider, she said.  "I would have preferred that the
Commission's comment focus on the empirical basis for the assumptions on which
the proposed regulations rest."  Azcuenaga would also have preferred that her
agency's comments have addressed those studies not contained or referenced in
the FDA notice that could "undermine the basis for the proposed regulations."
FDA will have to face that issue sooner or later if there is a First Amendment
challenge, she opined.

The FTC comments also noted that the panel's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
linked use of tobacco products by kids with advertising but did "not indicate
that tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide ratings play any role in the decisions
of children and adolescents to use tobacco products, or to choose among the
various products."

Advertising industry associations added their voices to the FDA's mountain of
comments.  It is the FTC, not the FDA, that has jurisdiction over tobacco
advertising issues, according to the American Association of Advertising
Agencies (AAAA).  The AAAA also opposes the FDA proposal on First Amendment
grounds but was careful to limit its objections to advertising issues alone.
The ad group did not address whether the FDA has authority to regulate tobacco
products as drugs.

Lighter hand proposed for
prescription drug advertising


The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should use a looser, less regulatory
style for direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drugs, the FTC
staff has advised.  Important benefits can come from DTC advertising.  But the
current structure required in ads could be limiting those benefits, said staff
members of the FTC's Economics and Consumer Protection Bureaus in comments to
the FDA last week.

Currently, disclosures that appear in ads -- known as "Brief Summaries" -- are
"highly technical, complicated and lengthy," the FTC staff said.  A better
solution might be simple disclosures advising consumers to check with their
doctors for more information.

The FDA's existing brief summary requirement may also inadvertently prevent
price advertising and the use of coupons and other price reduction devices,
according to the FTC staff.  Because price advertising can result in lower
prices, the FDA should consider whether limitations on price advertising are
"necessary and desirable."

Self-regulation may move to labels;
but NLEA not part of the plan


The current self-regulatory mandate for the advertising industry should be
extended to include claims made on product labels, a panel of advertising
industry experts has recommended.  But it is not the industry's business to
consider whether labels meet specific Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
labeling requirements, the panel said.  The National Advertising Review
Council (NARC), overseer of industry self-regulation efforts, is expected to
vote on the group's recommendations within the next few months.

The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Better Business Bureau, the
first stop for ads in the industry's self-regulation process, has looked at
label claims in past cases.  But it has done so cautiously, admitting in a
1994 case report that "labels are not normally held to be within the
jurisdiction of the NAD."  The panel's recommendations, if accepted, would
make label inquiries commonplace.

But it is the duty of the NAD to evaluate only whether the ads are false,
deceptive or misleading, not whether the labels violate FDA or other
government regulations, the panel stressed.  The FDA maintains rules for
nutrition labeling, promulgated under the Nutrition Labeling Education Act
(NLEA), that are stricter than the FTC standards for food advertising.

In other news:

* Champion's Jogbra may be "technically unsurpassed," but the company had
insufficient evidence that its product was superior to all others in the
category "across-the-board," NAD ruled.  Champion promised to cooperate with
the NAD and "communicate more clearly" intended claims.

* John O.  Butler Company submitted test data for its Secure Denture Adhesive
Paste showing consumers preferred Secure to other denture adhesives.  The test
was flawed, the NAD ruled, and could not back claims that Secure "outholds the
leading brands."  The disputed ads are scheduled to run through January 1996,
after which they will not be repeated, the company said.

* Life Services Supplements, Inc.  agreed to modify ads for its Citri-Thin
Diet Supplement after the NAD expressed concerns that the ads might suggest
that Citri-Thin alone could help shed and keep off pounds.  The ads should
include a statement informing consumers that a proper diet and exercise should
supplement Citri-Thin.

Federalism:
Maine goes it alone
against debt collectors


Well before the GOP-dominated Congress decided to give more power to the
states, the state of Maine decided it would seek a little power on its own.
In 1994 Maine asked to be exempt from the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
(FDCPA).  The FTC granted that request just before the new year.

The FDCPA, passed in 1978, has always allowed states the option of
independently regulating debt collectors.  In theory, the Act is a minimum
safety net -- states are allowed to pass stricter regulations, but their
regulations must be at least as strict as those outlined in the FDCPA if they
hope to be exempt from the Act.

The FTC has now ruled unanimously that Maine's laws protect consumers at least
as well as the FDCPA.  In some instances, the agency noted, the state offers
better protection.  For instance, Maine has a staff in its Bureau of Consumer
Credit Protection (BCCP) dedicated to protecting the state's consumers from
unfair debt collection practices.  The staff can pursue leads and bring
actions the federal government does not have the manpower to pursue.  And
because Maine takes a "hands-on" enforcement approach, unfair practices can be
stopped quicker, the FTC said, before much damage is done.

Civil penalties are lower under Maine's law than under the FDCPA.  But that
State has an enforcement tool the federal government does not -- revocation of
a debt collector's license.  Maine's "strengths more than offset the
weaknesses," the FTC said.  And Maine consumers may still privately sue debt
collectors under the FDCPA.

Maine is required to file a report with the FTC every two years to keep the
Commission apprised of its activities.  The FTC solicited public comments on
the State's proposal in May, 1994.  [FTC:WATCH No.  413, May 23, 1994]

The names change and one scam may be more popular one year than the next, but
con artists continued to rely on all the old tricks last year.  As the
Telemarketing Sales Rule took effect to ring in the new year, the FTC staff

2. Travel Scams - Impossible-to-meet restrictions apply.
3. Gemstones - Absolutely worthless! How much would you pay?
4. Recovery Rooms - Sorry you lost money. Want to lose some more?
5. Business Opportunities - Vending machines + a little spare time = 
disappointment.
6. Charitable Solicitations - Sometimes, a small portion of your 
contribution actually goes to a charity, but not often.
7. Advance Fee Loans - Money down for empty promises.
8. Toner Rooms - Overpriced office supplies are our specialty.
9. Work at Home Plans - Make Christmas ornaments at home; earn millions.

RIP: Six more rules deep sixed


Being a consumer in the 1960s was tough.  The lucky ones dodged the
potentially fatal effects of inhaling quick-freeze aerosol glass frosting
spray and steered clear of nasty itching fits from fiberglass curtains.  But
still they were liable to succumb to shady salesman looking to make a fast
buck on non-prismatic binoculars, too-tiny sleeping bags and tablecloths, and
extension ladders that didn't quite do the job.

The FTC made some rules to stop all that.  All that stopped.  Now, those rules
have gone the way of disco, and not a decade too soon.  By repealing six more
rules, the Commission has now killed seven rules and eight guides.

* The Quick Freeze Spray Rule (1969-1995) required manufacturers of aerosol
spray products used for frosting beverage glasses to warn consumers that
inhaling the product could be fatal.  The product left the market in 1982,
according to the FTC staff, ushered out by that bastion of good taste, Ronco,
Inc., marketer of the Popiel Pocket Fisherman.  No product, no rule, the
Commission said in repealing the rule.

* The Fiberglass Curtain Rule (1967-1995) was likewise unnecessary, since
fiberglass curtains are no longer sold for consumer use.  They were popular in
the 1960s because they were fire retardent.  They were also, well, fiberglass,
which says "itchy" to anyone who knows the material.  But technology has
evolved and many fire-retardent fabrics that do not cause skin irritation have
replaced fiberglass fabrics.  No product, no rule.

* The Binocular Rule (1964-1995) required marketers of non-prismatic
binoculars to say that their product was non-prismatic.  Technology has driven
the price of prisms down since the rule was promulgated, and nearly all
binoculars today use prisms.  Those that don't -- opera and field glasses, for
instance -- are clearly marketed in a category separate from binoculars, the
FTC staff reasoned.  No product, no rule.

* The Sleeping Bag Rule (1963-1995) and the Tablecloth Rule (1964-1995) both
governed the measurements manufacturers could use when advertising, labeling
and marking their products.  The National Conference on Weight and Measures'
Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation, adopted by 47 states, now governs
the very same thing, for sleeping bags, tablecloths, etc.  State rules in, fed
rules out, said the FTC.

* Finally, the Extension Ladder Rule (1969-1995) set out rules for labeling
extension ladders.  Surprised?  American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
standard A14 does the same.  Industry standard in, fed rule out.

The FTC's review of old rules continues.  The initiative was started well
before President William Jefferson Clinton and his sidekick, Albert Gore, Jr.,
decided to reinvent government, but they're not complaining about "overzealous
deregulation" at the FTC, either.

Terminally ill patients are increasingly cashing in their life insurance
policies and enjoying (or at least using) the money while they can.  The
viatical business is booming and the FTC is now offering a brochure to keep

For the families of the terminally ill, instant cash for a life insurance

Illnesses," explains the legal, financial and tax consequences of viatical
settlements.  Copies are available through the FTC's Public Reference Branch,

"Made in U.S.A." Workshop
scheduled for late March;
consumers reacting


Judging from the latest consumer comments to hit the public record in the
FTC's search for a "Made in the U.S.A."  advertising and labeling standard,
the Commission's old standard is still the best standard.

The FTC has historically required unqualified Made in the U.S.A.  claims to be
backed by a product made entirely, or virtually entirely, in the United
States.  Manufacturers, citing the increasingly global marketplace, have
argued that few products can nowadays meet such a stringent standard.

Consumers, however, have asked the FTC to maintain that high standard for
unqualified claims.  "If 75% of the product was made in the USA and 25% was
made in China, then state that on the label," says one commenter.  More
gruffly, another expressed the same sentiment:  "If a shoe is 20% foreign +
80% [Made in the] USA, say so -- we can handle it."

The Alabama Textile Manufacturers Association, Inc.  agreed.  "The consumer is
entitled to know where a product is manufactured.  We believe any attempt to
'fuzzy' that information is wrong," the association said in urging the FTC to
retain is standard.

The Commission will grapple with "Made in the U.S.A."  advertising and
labeling issues at a public workshop to be held March 26, 27 and possibly even
28, 1996, depending "on the number of issues raised."  Requests to participate
in the conference are due by January 16.

Commissioner Roscoe B.  Starek III dissented without comment on the 4-1
Commission decision to schedule the workshop.  Starek has consistently
resisted efforts to take "Made in the U.S.A."  claims out of the case log and
into the public policy arena.

Arizona therapist network
unlikely to cause problems


An Arizona network of physical, occupational and speech therapists is unlikely
to run afoul of the antitrust laws, according to the FTC staff.  In a December
7, 1995 letter to an attorney representing the proposed Southern Arizona
Therapy Network, Inc.  (SATNET), the FTC gave a clean bill of health to the
venture which, among other things, will rely on a messenger model when
collecting fee information and reporting that information to its members.

Under the messenger model, SATNET will act merely as a messenger of fee
information, collecting it from third-party payers and reporting that
information to its members without recommendation.  The FTC/DOJ Health Care
Statements set out a safety zone for messenger model ventures that leave up to
the venture's individual members decisions on whether to accept or reject
reimbursement levels.

SATNET's plans to collect non-fee information also fall within the safety
zones in the policy statements, the FTC staff said.  And potential future
plans for SATNET to coordinate the setting of capitation rates for its members
is unlikely to cause problems because of the low number of therapists
participating in the plan.  Only 13% of physical therapists in the area, 6% of
occupational therapists and 1% of speech therapists have signed on.

Antitrust immunity raises
international shipping rates?


Collusion is illegal in most industries, but not in the international shipping
industry.  In fact, collusion is actually encouraged in the shipping industry,
and that may lead to higher rates with few offsetting benefits, according to a
new government report.

Paul S.  Clyde of the DOJ's Antitrust Division and James D.  Reitzes, formerly
of the FTC's Economics Bureau, argue that the use of shipping conferences to
set prices for international shipping leads to higher rates when the market
share of the conference participants is high.  The Shipping Act of 1984,
overseen by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), grants antitrust immunity
to these conferences, which have existed since the 19th century.  While the
conferences do not act as perfect cartels, they don't promote perfect
competition either, say Clyde and Reitzes in their December, 1995 report, "The
Effectiveness of Collusion Under Antitrust Immunity:  The Case of Liner
Shipping Conferences."

Conference participants must submit rates to the FMC for review and approval.
The FMC is charged with assuring the rates are neither too high nor too low.
In some conferences, shippers are legally allowed to discount the fees they
file.  But in many others, discounting is deemed rebating, a practice that the
FMC condemns.  Between 1985 and 1989, the FMC assessed more than $12 million
in penalties for rebating, the report states, essentially charging companies
with the egregious practice of competing on price.

The evidence "indicates that conferences do not act as perfect cartels
maximizing the joint profits of their members," according to the report.
"Nonetheless, we find that the level of freight rates is significantly lower
on routes where conference members are free to negotiate service contracts
directly with shippers."

The authors note that higher prices were found "on routes where the
conference's market share is relatively high (over 80%)."  There may be
efficiencies that spring from conferences.  But "even if collective pricing is
required to encourage efficiency-enhancing investment, the associated
anticompetitive harm may still outweigh the efficiency benefits."

Care Labeling, Take Two


In November, the Commission asked whether its proposal to allow symbols in
lieu of words on garment care labels was a good idea.  While pondering that
question (until the comment deadline of January 31), consider these other Care
Labeling Rule teasers:

* Should the mention of new technologies, such as "professional wet cleaning,"
be allowed on care labels?

* If a garment can be washed or dry-cleaned, should manufacturers be required
to let consumers know how to wash the product at home?  The rule now allows
such garments to be labeled with the words "dry clean," though they may not
bear the tag "dry clean only."

* Should the FTC clarify what constitutes a "reasonable basis" for care
instructions?

* Should the definition of water temperatures be changed to reflect current
washing machine settings?

Proposed answers to those questions will be accepted until March 12 as the
FTC's review of the Care Labeling Rule continues.  The FTC proposed allowing
"care symbols" on garment tags last November in furtherance of the goals of
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  [FTC:WATCH No.  445,
November 20] The FTC staff reasoned that symbols cross borders between the
U.S., Canada and Mexico better than words.  ?Comprende?

Dead Animals (I):  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has

Dead Animals (I):  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has
weighed in on the FTC's review of its Guides for Select Leather and Imitation
Leather Products.  PETA, a combative animal rights group, has proposed
"ordering" manufacturers to come up with simpler labels for leather and
nonleather goods.  The group recommends that all leather products be labeled
"Animals Suffered to Make This Product."  Any non-leather good could be
labeled a "Cruelty-free Product."  In this respect, PETA differs from the
National Consumers League (NCL), which has asked the FTC to examine the use of
general claims such as "cruelty-free."  NCL believes such claims are fuzzy.

Dead Animals (II):  Leather Industries of America, Inc.  has asked the
Commission to set a minimum leather content standard -- 75% -- for products
labeled as "bonded leather."  Bonded leather is leather and non-leather bonded
together to make a consumer product.  The FTC's Leather Guides currently allow
use of the term bonded leather even if only 1% of a product is leather,
according to Leather Industries President Charles S.  Myers.

Stephen F.  Quill, President of Ecological Fibers, Inc.  suggests calling
products with a low leather content "reinforced bonded leather."  Quill's firm
makes book bindings that contain 20% leather.  That's not 100% leather, but
"we certainly believe that if you add the word 'reinforced' anyone would know
that it is not directly from the cow," Quill told the FTC.

Sunsetting:  Got an FTC administrative order more than 20 years old?  No you
don't.  Orders now automatically sunset on their 20th birthday.  January 2
marked the mass sunset of old orders under the Commission's new automatic
sunset policy.  Oly oly in free.

Trustees wanted:  The FTC is looking for a few good individuals or "other
entities" to serve as trustees, here's your big chance.  Send your name,
experience and areas of expertise to:  Daniel P.  Ducore, Assistant Director,
Compliance Division, Bureau of Competition, Federal Trade Commission, Suite
2115, 601 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Global Competition Hearings:  Hurry!  January 26 is the deadline for written
comments to be added to the record of the FTC's Global Competition.  [FAXLine
No.  1683 (1 page)]

Mobile Radio:  A federal district court judge has granted the FTC's request
for a preliminary injunction barring Falcon Crest Communications from using
false claims when selling brokerage services to consumers who hold federal
paging and mobile radio licenses.  The licenses themselves were often the
not-so-valuable fruit of a previous investment scam, according to the FTC.
Falcon Crest offered to find high-paying buyers for those licenses, a feat it
was unlikely to accomplish, the FTC charged.  The PI bars false claims and
freezes the assets of Falcon, its parent company, Republic Communications
Corp., and company officers and salesmen Joel H.  Cohen, Jordan Drew, Gary
Perry and Nicholas Vasti.  [FTC Press Release, December 27; Contact:  Stephen

Recovery room telemarketer
must get $250,000 bond backing

The FTC accused Sherri L.  Pollock last January of participating in a scheme
that combined two of the hottest cons on the telemarketing circuit:  the
recovery room and telefunding.  Pollock last month agreed to post a $250,000
surety bond before conducting telemarketing in the future as part of a
settlement of those charges.  Pollock is the last defendant to settle in the
FTC's case against PFR, Inc.

When soliciting charitable donations or payments for prizes or awards, Pollock
agreed not to falsely represent any material facts.  Pollock further agreed to
avoid false representations when telemarketing any good or service.  She will
monitor her employees to make sure they avoid misrepresentations as well,
under the terms of a stipulated final judgment filed in federal court last
month.

The U.S.  Attorney's Office in Las Vegas, the Las Vegas office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the Nevada Attorney General's Telemarketing Unit
assisted the FTC with its case against PFR.  The case was jointly handled by
the FTC's Division of Service Industry Practices and the FTC's San Francisco
Regional Office.

Indictment filed in
job promotion case


The U.S.  Attorney's Office has charged Debra Mink, sole proprietor of an
allegedly bogus job placement service operated under the name International
Services, with 45 counts of wire and mail fraud.  Ads for International
Services allegedly implied the company knew of available jobs, had ties to
Fortune 1000 companies and had an 80% placement rate, none of which was true.

The suit could land Mink in a federal penitentiary for several years if
successful, based on current Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  But first, the
government must find her.  Mink disappeared during the FTC's civil case
against her.  There is a warrant out for her arrest and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) is involved in the search.

By accepting orders for her allegedly bogus service over the phone, Mink
committed wire fraud, according to the indictment.  Ang sending checks through
the mail or by Federal Express to pay for ads placed in newspapers across the
country qualifies as mail fraud, the indictment states.

Though ads promised significant job placement assistance, Mink's business
consisted mainly of resume preparation, according to the indictment.

Last September a federal district court judge ordered Mink to pay a
$593,206.27 judgment, the amount the court determined had been taken in the
scheme.

Calorie claims don't add up
for Mama Tish's ice cups, agency alleges


Representations for Mama Tish's Italian Specialties ice cups get a chilly
reception from the FTC.  Ads praised the benefits of Mama Tish's ice cups,
notably that they are "naturally low in calories."  But of the company's ten
regular flavors and two Nutrasweet-sweetened flavors of ice cups, none
qualified as low in calories, the FTC charged.

The Food and Drug Administration, in rules promulgated under the Nutrition
Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), defines a low calorie food as one having 40
or fewer calories per serving.  Mama Tish's regular flavor ice cups contained
between 104 and 145 calories per serving, according to the FTC, and the two
flavors sweetened with Nutrasweet contained 60 calories per serving.

Mama Tish's has agreed not to misrepresent the amount of calories or "any
other nutrient or ingredient" in any frozen dessert products.  A safe harbor
in the proposed consent order against Mama Tish's would allow any claims
permitted under FDA regulations promulgated under the NLEA.

The case was handled by the FTC's Chicago Regional Office.

"Project Telesweep" cleans up again


A telephone vending machine seller has agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty
and hang up some of his alleged sales practices.  Fitzgerald Lewis, president
of Quartercall Communications, Inc., was charged in July with failing to
provide his customers with disclosure documents required by the Franchise Rule
when selling telephone vending machine business opportunities.  Charges
against Lewis stemmed from "Project Telesweep," an enormous federal/state
crackdown of business opportunity fraud.

Budding entrepreneurs bought telephone vending machines from Lewis hoping to
install them in some public location where they would bring in rates of a
quarter a minute.  Lewis made claims of specific earnings, according to the
FTC.  But Lewis neither backed those earnings claims in writing, nor provided
his customers with the required disclosure documents, the FTC charged.

In addition to the civil penalty, Lewis has agreed not to violate the
Franchise Rule.  He will not misrepresent material facts when selling any
franchise or business opportunity in the future, under the terms of a proposed
consent order filed in federal court.

Training program part of
Funeral Rule settlement


A.H.  Peters Funeral Home of posh Grosse Pointe (Michigan) allegedly failed to
provide its customers with a number of price lists as the FTC's Funeral Home
Services Rule requires.  A.H.  Peters also conditioned the sale of some goods
on the purchase of other goods, the FTC charged, a no-no under the Rule.
What's the funeral home to do?

For starters, A.H.  Peters and its officers, Roy A.  Peters and David L.
Peters, have agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty.  To make sure they won't
make the same alleged mistake twice, they have agreed to institute a training
program for the funeral home's employees to guarantee compliance with the
Rule.

According to the FTC, the suburban Detroit funeral home failed to give its
customers a general price list as the Rule requires.  Same goes for the casket
price list.  And the outer burial price list.  And an itemized written
statement of goods and services selected.

A.H.  Peters has agreed not to violate the Rule in the future.

Columbia/HCA's oops


Read the fine print.  That's the lesson for Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation lawyers, who have asked the Commission to remove a commercial
lease from the company's divestiture requirements.  The fact that the lease
was slated to be divested at all is a "minor mistake," Columbia/HCA attorneys
argue.

Columbia/HCA has asked that the lease for office space used by Infusamed, an
infusion services company, be removed from a hold separate requirement and
promises to file a second request shortly asking that the lease be removed
from the company's divestiture requirements.

Columbia/HCA is required to divest properties in several areas of the country
to settle antitrust charges arising from its acquisition of Healthtrust, Inc.
One of those areas is Salt Lake City, Utah, where Columbia/HCA has agreed to
divest a package of assets referred to as the "Utah Healthtrust Assets."  The
lease got lumped in with that package mistakenly, according to Columbia/HCA.

The public will have 10 days -- not the usual 30 -- to comment on
Columbia/HCA's proposed change.

GM order changed


General Motors has convinced the Federal Trade Commissioners to soften a 1979
order that bars the car maker from placing the name of a car division on an
engine label unless the car division also manufactured the engine (i.e., no
fair identifying Oldsmobiles as having "Rocket 88" engines when the engines
were built by, say, the Chevrolet Division and installed in Chevy's as well).

GM's corporate restructurings since 1979 have resulted in the removal of
engine production from the nameplate divisions that existed then.  This
automotive alchemy constitutes changed conditions of fact, determined the
Commission, allowing it to reopen and modify the order.  Under the modified
order in C-2966, GM can display brand nameplates on engines that are
materially different from those displaying all other brand nameplates, and
cannot display different brand nameplates on identical engines.

Schnuck supermarket divestiture


What goes around may come around, sort of.

When Schnuck Markets, Inc.  acquired supermarkets owned by National Holdings,
Inc.  the FTC charged the acquisition would harm supermarket competition in
the St.  Louis, Missouri-area.  To settle those charges, Schnuck has proposed
divesting 23 stores in that area to a newly formed company, Family Company of
America, whose senior management "consists largely of former senior managers
of the National Holdings, Inc.  supermarket chain."

If the divestitures are allowed, Family would become the third-largest

Remembering Phil Areeda
by Robert Pitofsky


(Phillip Areeda died at the age of 65 Sunday, December 24.  1995)

With the death of Phil Areeda last month, the academic community has lost a
towering figure.  Those of us who teach law and try to engage in scholarship
know better than most that, without him, the world is a lesser place.

Much of Phil Areeda's public life was committed to antitrust scholarship and
his teaching at Harvard Law School.  I once mentioned to Phil that his
treatise was the longest in the history of Western thought not written in
German.  He enjoyed the description.  At the time he was still working on
volume six or seven, and his response was:  "you have no idea".  At his death,
he was working on volume eleven (and anxious that there would not be time
enough to complete the task) and planning volume twelve.

The treatise --unique in legal scholarship in its ambition and scope -- was
begun jointly with Donald Turner and completed with the help of Herb
Hovenkamp.

When work on this treatise started, antitrust was a jumble of conflicting
ideologies, irreconcilable cases and some diffuse and half--baked ideas.  The
goal of the authors was nothing less than to bring some order out of that
chaos and they succeeded admirably.  It is amazing the way sections of the
treatise migrated directly to Court of Appeals and Supreme Court decisions and
established the standard for competitive behavior.

Other aspects of Phil Areeda's scholarship were special.  He was endlessly
careful and meticulous -- some scholars would conclude after two or three
drafts,that they were "close enough" to being right and move on.  Phil never
quit reworking a subject until he was fully-satisfied.  There is also a
quality of "fairness" in his work -- to scholars with whom he might disagree,
to legislative intent, to prior judicial opinions -- that is all too rare in
scholarship.  It often appeared that Phil was at greater pains in stating
fairly the position of adversaries than in elaborating his own views.  He
always tried to give judicial decisions the benefit of a best rather than a
worst interpretation.  Even when he disagreed, he did so with respect and
without rancor.  Finally, Phil was comfortable with ideology but practical as
well.  He recognized that people and courts are fallible, and that life is not
invariably rational, and his interpretations and conclusions reflect that
understanding.

Much of the history of antitrust development in recent decades involves the
integration of economics into antitrust analysis.  Phil Areeda (along with Don
Turner) were among the very best in bringing economic analysis to bear without
allowing it to become overly technical or impractical.  It is common now for
legal briefs and scholarly analysis in the antitrust field to cite and discuss
economic insights as well as legal precedent.  That was not true (or at least
not as true) before Phil helped reshape the field.

While most people are aware of Phil's work through the treatise, his principal
commitment may have been as a teacher at the Harvard Law School.  He was
exceptionally popular in the classroom and invariably respected.  Some have
described his teaching (heavy with the traditional Socratic method) as
orthodox and even "old-fashioned.  That is a fair description if
"old--fashioned" means that he was rigorous in class, well organized, and
constantly courteous to his students.  Unlike the current style in some
quarters, Phil in the classroom was not there to inculcate students with his
personal views of the world, but rather to teach a subject.  He brought to the
classroom a sense that he thought his subject was interesting and important,
and an infectious enthusiasm that never waned.

Somewhere along the way, Phil developed a discriminating taste for good food,
good wine, good books and opera.  His wine cellar was the most extraordinary
private collection I have seen.  Occasionally we would have lunch or dinner at
excellent places like Lutece, the famous French restaurant in New York.  Phil
was a connoisseur and knew the best from second-best, but once the meal
started, he never discussed the food or the wine -- he enjoyed them and
discussed other interesting things.

Through his teaching, Phil influenced the attitudes and careers of thousands
of Harvard students.  The Areeda Turner Treatise and his other scholarship
were the most important and constructive influences on antitrust policy in a
generation.  Scores of scholars around the country can testify to his
generosity in offering advice, ideas, even inspiration.  Shortly before his
death, Phil said "my life has been teaching and writing."  It was a life well
lived.

MONITOR UTILITY COMPANIES THROUGH STATE REGULATORS

Electric power companies, natural gas providers, pipelines, and other 
public utilities are highly regulated at the state level.  They all 
file reams of valuable information with their respective states' 
Public Utility Commissions or equivalent regulatory authorities.
 
Much of this material is readily available to the business 
researcher.  Current and recent historical information such as plant 
locations and facilities, fuel consumption, sales, smokestack 
emissions and other pollution data are yours for the asking.  So to 
is valuable information on future plans such as expansions, major 
equipment purchases, land acquisitions, and much more.
 
Regulatory filings are generally the first items to go after.  These 
are normally provided promptly on request.  But don't overlook the 
rich source of material provided in conjunction with Public Utility 
Commission hearings, feasibility studies, and the like.  Unless you 
know of a specific item's availability, locating these collections of 
in-depth testimonies, exhibits, and studies will likely require a 
visit by you, a staff member, or a hired researcher.  Call the 
applicable Public Utility Commission for the location of its document 
facility, visit it, and pore through the file cabinets and binders 
for valuable intelligence.

U.S. APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS LANDMARK VERDICT IN TOBACCO TRIAL

The Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a precedent-
setting jury verdict in a product liability suit against tobacco
manufacturers, setting aside the $400,000 award and sending the case
back because of errors it found in conduct of the trial.

The 87-page verdict opened some new avenues of argument
for plaintiff's attorneys and reinstated two tobacco companies as
defendants. But its temporary effect, at least, was to maintain the
industry's unbroken string of victories in product liability suits
brought by smokers and their families.

The verdict was returned in 1988 in a suit by Antonio Cipollone,
widower of Rose Cipollone, who died of cancer in 1984 at the age of
58 after more than four decades of smoking.

Like the trial judge, the appeals court accepted a distinction
between tobacco companies' liability before and after 1966, when the
government began requiring warnings of health hazards on packs. But
interpretations differed on several points.

At the trial, only the Liggett Group Inc. was found liable because
before 1966 Rose Cipollone smoked only one of its brands. Phillip
Morris Inc. and Lorillard Inc. were dismissed as defendants because
she smoked their cigarettes after that period.

And the jury returned a verdict only for Antonio Cipollone, not
Rose's estate, because it found her principally responsible for her
own injury.

The appellate court overturned U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin on
both counts.

Elements of the Third Circuit's decision:

* To prevail on the theory known as express warranty, plaintiffs'
attorneys must prove not only that tobacco companies ran pre-1966
advertisements implying that smoking wasn't harmful but also that the
plaintiff relied on those representations.

Rose Cipollone's reliance on the ads cannot be presumed but must be
proved, the court said, and Liggett's lawyers should have the chance
to prove that Rose Cipollone either was unaware of the ads or didn't
believe their message.

"The advertising constituted an express warranty...as long as Mr.
Cipollone can prove that Mrs. Cipollone was aware of the
advertisements and as long as Liggett does not prove that she
disbelieved them," the appellate court ruled.

Sarokin had ruled that it was enough to show that the commercials
were in public use, and it was this ruling upon which the $400,000
award to Antonio Cipollone was based.

* New Jersey's comparative fault law mitigating the manufacturers'
liability for failure to warn should be applied only to the period
before 1966.

The jury found Rose Cipollone was 80 percent responsible for
continuing to smoke and Liggett 20 percent responsible for failing to
warn her of the dangers, so her estate received no award.

But the appeals court ruled that the question of her responsibility
for her actions applied only to the period before warning labels were
required, rather than to her entire life.

"The jury should have been instructed that Mrs. Cipollone's post-1965
conduct bore only on the apportionment of damages, but not on her
comparative fault for her own injuries," the court said.

* The doctrine of inherent characteristics, which holds that
manufacturers cannot be sued if the product's defects are both
inherent and well known, applies only to the period after 1966.

For alleged injuries occurring before that period, a jury can decide
the facts on whether the average person can be expected to know about
the dangers of smoking and, if not, whether a company should be held
liable for defects of a product because its risks outweighed its
benefits.

Sarokin had ruled that the doctrine applied to the years before 1966
and thus barred recovery from Liggett for health effects due to the
design of the cigarettes.

The appeals court rejected Liggett's claim there was insufficient
evidence to prove that smoking the company's cigarettes caused the
cancer.

"The jury could have reasonably concluded...that Mrs. Cipollone's
smoking from 1952 to 1966...caused her lung cancer," the court said.

Both plaintiffs' and defense attorneys claimed victory.

"We repeatedly stated that the verdict was wrong and would be
reversed on appeal," said Liggett General Counsel Josiah Murray.

Plaintiffs' attorney Cynthia Walters expressed pleasure in the
decision, even though it overturned the $400,000 award.

"From our standpoint, we won beyond dispute on two areas of great
concern," she said.

U.S. JUDGE RULES OUT PUNITIVE DAMAGES FOR FLIGHT 103 VICTIMS

U.S. District Judge Thomas J. Platt of New York ruled
Jan. 3 that an international agreement bars families of victims of
the 1988 bombing of Pan American Flight 103 from suing the airline
for punitive damages.

The ruling "adds insult to injury in today's world," Platt said, but
the Warsaw Convention covering international flights limits relief to
compensatory damages.

He said "it is simply not within this court's power to construe the
treaty in a manner inconsistent with the contracting parties'
expectations."

Central to the plaintiffs' case is a charge that Pan Am received a
warning of a bomb threat but neither increased security adequately
nor notified passengers of the risk.

Many of the 259 victims on the plane were American college students
studying abroad who were returning home for the Christmas vacation.

Flight 103, en route from Germany to the United States, blew up over
Lockerbie, Scotland, apparently as the result of a terrorist bomb.

Suits brought by families across the country have been consolidated
into one proceeding in the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn.

Of more than 150 plaintiffs involved, 95 are represented by the New
York law firm of Kreindler & Kreindler, which specializes in aviation
litigation.

The firm's Lee Kreindler indicated there will be an appeal of Judge
Platt's ruling.

"I don't think this is the last word on it," he said.

The Warsaw Convention limits compensatory damages to $75,000 unless
willful misconduct is proven. It doesn't explicitly address punitive
damages, but Platt said the ban is implicit.

"While the Warsaw Convention does not expressly refer to punitive
damage claims, it appears that the Warsaw Convention bars such claims
whether or not willful misconduct exists," he said.

He said those who drew up the treaty in 1929 had a "shared
expectation" of setting "some uniform limit on an airline carrier's
liability in order to promote the civil aviation industry which at
the time of the Warsaw Convention was in its infancy."

"I think the judge was eminently correct in his decision," said James
M. Shaughnessy, a lawyer for Pan Am.

He added that he is not worried about an appeal.

Pan Am argues that it was prohibited by the U.S. government from
notifying passengers of the bomb threat.

The ruling in New York doesn't affect a case being brought against
Pan Am in the Florida courts by families of British passengers and
the 11 persons who were killed on the ground when the jet crashed in
Lockerbie.

"This group specifically chose to pursue our cases through the
Florida courts since it was felt that there would be a better change
of establishing punitive damages through the Florida courts than in
New York," spokesman Peter Watson said in London.

TAIWAN GOVERNMENT HELD LIABLE IN JOURNALIST'S SLAYING

The government of Taiwan can be held liable for its role in the
California slaying of a journalist and critic of the regime, the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Dec. 29.

Henry Liu was shot and killed in Daly City, Calif., on orders of Vice
Adm. Wong Hsi-ling, then director of Taiwan's Defense Intelligence
Bureau. But Taiwan claimed Wong was acting outside his official
duties and had a personal grudge against Liu.

Several of those involved in the scheme, including Wong, were
convicted of murder in Taiwan, and one was convicted in California.

Liu's wife, Helen, filed a wrongful death action against the
government of Taiwan.

Overturning a lower court, the Ninth Circuit said she could proceed.

"Wong's act of ordering the assassination of Henry Liu was not wholly
personal but arose from his employment as director of the DIB," the
appellate panel said.

"When an employee, such as Wong, uses governmental authority in a
mistaken attempt to benefit his employer by silencing an outspoken
critic of the government, there is nothing inequitable about
spreading the loss among all the beneficiaries of the government."

Judge Robert Boochever also wrote that holding Taiwan accountable
wouldn't interfere with formation of foreign policy by the executive
branch of the U.S. government.

John Martel, an attorney for Taiwan, said he would review the
decision and consider an apepal.

He said the government of Taiwan "was as appalled as anyone" by the
killing "and there is no proof that the government had anything to do
with it."

CALIFORNIA PUNITIVE DAMAGES UP SINCE 1987, TORT REFORMERS SAY

The average amount of punitive damages awarded by California juries
has risen by 178 percent since 1987 alone, according to a study by
the Association for California Tort Reform.

The average award for punitive damages in 1989 was
$3.01 million, up from $1.69 million in 1987, the group reported.

The study was based on a review of 1,846 jury verdicts reported by
Jury Verdicts Weekly.

It found 48 punitive damage awards of $1 million or more and 19
awards of $5 million or more.

At the same time, the number of awards is down, from 15.2 percent in
1987 to 9.3 percent in 1989.

Tort reformers say that's because of a change in the law and
increased willingness of defendants to settle.

Victor Schwartz of the Washington, D.C., law firm of Crowell &
Moring, a specialist in torts, noted that in 1987 California raised
its standard of proof for punitive damages from preponderance of the
evidence to clear and convincing evidence.

In addition, he said, "many punitive damage cases are being channeled
into settlement" because punitive damages "are constantly being used
as a threat by plaintiffs' lawyers, and many defendants prefer
settlement to the Russian roulette system of punitive damage
litigation."

The study's findings were presented last month to the California
Legislature's Joint Committee on Tort Liability.

"This study indicates that the threat of punitive damages is a real
and major concern for the business community of California," said
Frank Schubert, president of the Association for California Tort
Reform.

"When one out of ten jury verdicts is likely to result in a punitive
damage award averaging more than $3 million, it is not difficult to
understand why business leaders are leery of California's legal
climate.

"It is a major reason why California is slowly losing its competitive
edge to less litigious international competitors."

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT FINDS INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER SELF-DEFENSE

The Florida Supreme Court ruled Dec. 21 that a clause common to
homeowners' insurance policies bars coverage for policyholders who
injure assailants in their homes in self-defense.

State law authorizes individuals to use force in self-defense, the
court acknowledged, and self-defense is a "worthy" motive for causing
injury.

Self-defense is nevertheless an intentional act and thus excluded
from coverage under a clause barring claims for intentional acts, the
court held in a 5-2 decision.

The case arose from an incident in which Edward Marshall shot his ex-
wife's son after the younger man broke into the house. A jury said
Marshall acted negligently and awarded the son $575,000 in
compensatory and punitive damages.

State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., which wrote the policy, refused to
pay the claim.

The court's unsigned majority opinion said clauses excluding coverage
for intentional acts are non-negotiable elements of most homeowners'
liability policies.

Allowing coverage of intenational acts, even in self-defense, would
skew actuarial tables and encourage individuals to commit wrongful
acts, the court said.

"We will not rewrite a policy under these circumstances to provide
coverage where the clear language of the policy does not; nor will we
invoke public policy to override this otherwise valid contract," the
majority said.

Justices Parker Lee McDonald and Rosemary Barkett dissented, saying
they would side with courts in other states that ruled acts of self-
defense are not the sort of intentional acts that would be
consciously undertaken by a homeowner because he or she is aware of
insurance against liability.

"It would be ironic to exonerate an individual on the basis of self-
defense but deny him insurance coverage of the costs of defense; yet
allow insurance coverage to a person who negligently causes injury,"
McDonald wrote.

FLORIDA COMMISSIONER CHARGES LAWYERS WITH INSURANCE FRAUD

Nine persons including two lawyers have been charged with
racketeering in a scheme to defraud insurance companies with false
medical claims, Florida Insurance Commission Tom Gallagher charged
Dec. 22.

Those charged included Mark Marks, 64, head of a law firm with
offices in Miami, North Miami, Pompano Beach and Fort Lauderdale, and
his son Gary, 32.

Prosecutors charged that the pair arranged for medical tests from the
Center for Neurological Services in Fort Lauderdale and dictated both
what the test results and the bills for the service should be.

They said employees of the law firm were told to alter or conceal
clients' medical records to provide false information to insurance
companies.

Those who cooperated allegedly shared up to thousands of dollars from
a fee-sharing fund.

Gallagher called the operation "an outrageous example of a criminal
conspiracy" designed to "cheat insurance companies out of millions of
dollars."

"The insurance companies were the biggest target, but the people are
the real victims," he said.

"Every lost dollar in insurance gets passed on to the public in the
form of more expensive insurance premiums."

PENNSYLVANIA COURT HOLDS UNION ISN'T LIABLE FOR STRIKE VIOLENCE

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Jan. 3 that the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters isn't liable for damages over violence in a
1977 strike against Freeport Transport Co.

The court said liability of Teamsters Local 538 was clear, but said
evidence didn't prove the international union was involved.

The high court upheld the trial court's judgment of $51,753 in
compensatory damages against the local and the international but
struck down an award of $250,000 in punitive damages against the
international.

Testimony showed that the international union said strike-related
violence would end if amnesty were provided one striker, Jack
Robison. Dissenting Justice John Flaherty said that was enough to
prove union involvement but the majority disagreed.

Robison was later convicted on criminal charges stemming from strike
violence.

"The appearance of a representative of the international in an effort
to end a strike does not mean that the IBT approved or encouraged the
violence during the strike," the court said.

It said the Pennsylvania Labor Anti-Injunctrion Act requires "a
higher showing than the common law rules of agency to establish a
union's liability."

PENNSYLVANIA COURT BARS WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT OVER PREMATURE TRIPLETS

A three-judge panel of Pennsylvania Superior Court has upheld a lower
court's ruling that a wrongful-death suit cannot be filed in the case
of triplets who were born prematurely.

"In the absence of any expression of intent from the Legislature or
any analysis by our Supreme Court, we cannot decide that fetuses born
prior to attaining viability should now be accorded the same rights
that children who have attained viability have been accorded under
the Wrongful Death and Survival Acts," the court said.

Michael and Ann Hudak conceded that their triplets weren't viable
after their premature birth. But they alleged that a group of
Williamsport doctors was negligent in failing to provide proper
treatment to stop premature labor.

culvert, resulting in flood damage to several stores in 1983.

A district court judge had dismissed the case on grounds of
government immunity. But the state's highest court unanimously held
that the immunity applied to policy decisions, and failure to clean
the culvert was an operational decision that didn't necessarily
follow established policy.

The Legislature passed legislation later in 1983 extending government
immunity to flood control, but the Supreme Court ruled that it wasn't
retroactive.

WASHINGTON SUPREME COURT RULES INSURERS MUST PAY FOR WASTE CLEANUP

The Washington State Supreme Court ruled Jan. 4 that insurers for the
Boeing Co. and several other corporations must help their
policyholders pay for cleaning up hazardous waste.

The decision was the latest in a string of court disputes over
whether cleanup costs are "damages" as the term is used in standard
comprehensive general liability coverage.

In its 7-2 ruling, the Washington court said they were.

The suit arose over cleanup of a land owned by Western Processing in
Kent, Wash. A major site for hazardous industrial waste for many
years, it was put on the original Environmental Protection Agency
list for Superfund cleanup.

On one side are Boeing, which said it's spent $40 million on the
cleanup; Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, Inc.; RSR Corp.; John Fluke
Manufacturing Co., Inc., and Davis Walker Corp.

They were notified in 1983 that, as generators of waste at the site,
they were responsible for costs of cleaning it up. They agreed to do
so in a consent decree entered in 1987.

In turn, they sought indemnification from their insurers: Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., Granite State
Insurance Co., American Centennial Insurance Co. and Hartford
Accident & Indemnity Co.

The suit was filed in federal court, which certified the question of
insurance company liability under Washington law to the state Supreme
Court.

Writing for the court, Justice Fred Dore gave short shrift to
insurers' arguments that cleanup costs ordered by government aren't
damages.

"Response costs in response to actual releases of hazardous wastes"
are damages within the meaning of the insurance policies at issue, he
said.

"The reported decisions across the country, the lay dictionary, the
insurance dictionary, the failure of the insurance industry to write
down what it meant, each of these facts lay waste to insurers'
argument," Dore said.

But the majority said the term doesn't cover safety measures or other
preventive costs taken in advance of any damage to property.

Chief Justice Keith Callow wrote a dissent in which he said the
majority ruling "upsets settled rules of insurance construction,
violates controlling precedent, and contravenes public policy."

LAWYER ATTACKS IDEA OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL TRUST FUND

Legal Times published an opinion article in its Dec. 18-25 issue
attacking the proposal of Maurice Greenberg, president of American
International Group, for a National Environmental Trust Fund to pay
for cleaning high-priority hazardous waste sites.

"Greenberg's proposal, if enacted into law, would allow the insurance
industry to escape part or all of its massive contractual liablity to
private- and public-sector policyholders for environ-mental cleanup,"
Peter Kalis wrote in the legal news weekly published in Washington,
D.C.

Kalis is a partner in the Pittsburgh firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockart
who represents manufacturers in their disputes with insurers.

Greenberg's proposed fund would be financed by a tax on all
commercial and industrial property/casualty insurance policies, as
well as equivalent fees paid by self-insured corporations.

In suggesting it last March, he argued that most pollution of soil
and ground water "did not result from deliberate, conscious acts" but
is "the residue of progress." Because all U.S. society benefited, he
said, we have a common interest in cleaning up.

But Kalis argued that comprehensive general liability insurance "was
marketed (and purchased) as a wholesale external-ization of risk, and
one of the risks insured against was the possibility that the lgeal
system would change and casue policy-holders to incur new types of
liability for property damage and bodily injury...

"One must wonder about the constitutional consequences of
congressional nullification of the contractual entitlements of
thousands of policyholders in order to effect an anticipated bailout
of the insurance industry."

COURT REQUIRES LIST OWNER TO OFFER 'OPT-OUT'

Over the past decade, many large mailing houses have adopted
a voluntary "opt-out" policy, permitting persons on a
mailing list to have their names deleted before the list is
rented to other mailers.

Now, for the first time, "opt-out" has been imposed on a
mailer as a matter of law.

The order, from a federal bankruptcy judge in San Antonio,
Tex., arose in unique circumstances.  One of the remaining
assets of a company that filed for bankruptcy was its
mailing list.  The company, Shocking Gray Corp., published a
catalog for gay consumers, many of whom expected that their
names on the list would remain confidential.

At a court-supervised auction to sell off the customer list,
some vendors of sex-related products made bids.  Further,
there was no assurance that whatever company purchased the
list would keep it discreet.

One of the bidders at auction and the leading marketer of
gay products by mail, Sean Strub, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Ronald P. King that if the list fell into the wrong hands it
would deter many gay consumers from letting their names
become part of marketing lists.  He urged the court to order
the buyer to give everyone on the list an opportunity to get
off of it.

The lawyer for the bankrupt company argued that giving
persons on the list the opportunity to be removed would
diminish its value.  "My job is to generate as much cash as
possible," he said.  But the judge ordered the company with
the winning bid at auction, Tzabaco in Northern California,
to offer everybody on the list an opt-out option.  David
Dow, Tzabaco's president,  said that his company, which
sells clothing and furniture by catalog, would have done
this anyway, because it knows the sensitivity of its gay
clientele.  About 15,000 of the 200,000 persons on the list
(7.5 percent) exercised the option.

Lawyers for Shocking Gray said afterwards that this order
exceeded the judge's authority.  But, bankruptcy courts have
wide latitude in managing the disposition of a company's
assets, including attaching conditions to purchases.  95-
52856-RPK (W.D. Tex., U.S. Bankruptcy Ct., Nov. 14).

VARNEY OF TRADE COMMISSION TO THE FOREFRONT

Leadership on the privacy issue in Washington has been
handed around over the past two decades depending on which
persons in high places take an interest.

The Office of Consumer Affairs and the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration have had a
piece of it.  Now it seems to be the Federal Trade
Commission's turn, in the person of its commissioner,
Christine A. Varney.

Not only has the FTC stepped up its compliance activity in
regulating credit bureaus and telemarketing, it has begun a
"Privacy Initiative" involving other agencies of the federal
government and state consumer-protection offices "to begin
to incorporate [privacy] principles in our consumer
protection mission," according to Varney.  After a series of
hearings last fall, the FTC plans a public workshop  this
spring (for information contact Martha Landesberg, e-mail
mlandesberg(at)ftc.gov).

The Bureau of Consumer Protection has been assigned to
gather comments from consumers, businesses, and privacy
organizations.  At the same time, the FTC established a
World Wide Web on-line site (ftc.gov) "to facilitate
thoughtful electronic debate about the rules that should
apply in the use and dissemination of consumer information
on-line," according to Varney, who was chief counsel to
President Clinton's 1992 campaign then cabinet secretary
before being named an FTC commissioner in 1994.  "An
important goal of the FTC's Privacy Initiative is to avoid
cumbersome regulation by facilitating the development of a
set of voluntary principles to govern the use of consumer
information in on-line transactions," Varney told a privacy
conference last fall.  This echoes the mantra of President
Bush's Consumer Advisor, Bonnie Guiton, who proved that "the
bully pulpit" of a federal office can prod businesses even
in the absence of laws.

QUOTABLE

"It combines casualness of speech with the permanence of
writing.  It's got a lot of potential for embarrassing the
other side," says Hartford, Conn., lawyer Allan B. Taylor,
explaining why lawyers like to pour over electronic mail for
evidence, quoted by CONNECTICUT LAW TRIBUNE, Dec. 18, 1995.

'BOSTON GROUP' HOLDS UP MEDICAL PRIVACY BILL

A band of medical privacy critics in Boston has succeeded in
stalling a Senate bill that they believe "undercuts the very
fabric of doctor-patient confidentiality."

The bill introduced last November with bipartisan, liberal
and conservative sponsors and the blessing of Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole seemed assured of quick passage
in the Senate.  In fact, the main sponsor of S 1360, Sen.
Bob Bennett, R-Utah, planned to rush it though the chamber
before Christmas, after a cursory day of hearings Nov. 14.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., had signed on
on as a sponsor in expectation that the American Civil
Liberties Union would endorse the bill.  Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., signed on assuming that the confidentiality bill was
endorsed by privacy advocates.

Janlori Goldman, a former ACLU staff member who as deputy
director of the industry-funded Center for Democracy and
Technology aided in the drafting and the industry response
to the bill, led Senate staff to believe that the
legislation was supported by privacy and patient
organizations.

But a tiny organization of patients and practitioners called
the Coalition for Patient Rights spotted weaknesses in the
proposal.  Its New England representative, Massachusetts
psychiatrist Denise Nagel, persuaded the ACLU affiliate in
Massachusetts to oppose the bill.  She activated a few
privacy advocates in Washington, notably James Love of the
Ralph Nader-founded Consumers Project on Technology and Marc
Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who
oppose the current draft.

The ACLU in Boston demanded a showdown with its national
leadership and persuaded it to reverse its neutral or
favorable stance towards the bill.

Perhaps in response, Goldman's organization and the American
Health Information Management Association (a trade group of
hospital records administrators) organized weekly strategy
sessions in Washington beginning before Christmas and
extending into late February.  Nagel, Rotenberg, and Love
have been a part of these meetings.  At the same time, on
the first working day of the New Year in Boston, Nagel
convened an impressive coalition of medical confidentiality
advocates who are preparing an amended version of the
Bennett bill and a totally new substitute to offer Congress
by next month.

The attendees included Love, Rotenberg, PRIVACY JOURNAL
Publisher Robert Ellis Smith, and representatives of the
Health Law Institute in Boston, the national and local ACLU,
the Council for Responsible Genetics, and the American
Psychiatric Association.

In the meeting, CPR, CRG, and CPT were criticizing a bill
and strategy embraced by CDT.  One had to stay alert.

(Smith has been quoted by COMPUTERWORLD as saying, "The bill
has three or four weaknesses that, if cured, would make it a
net plus for consumers.  Right now, it's a net minus, but it
doesn't miss by much.")

The Boston group thinks that the bill accelerates the
computerization and linkage of patient data and that it
permits wide access to law enforcement and insurance
companies, as well as to employees within a medical
facility.  The Center for Democracy and Technology says that
the Bennett bill is the strongest medical privacy proposal
ever seriously considered by Congress.

The dispute has accentuated a growing schism among privacy
groups  in Washington and, in the process, has stalled
consideration of S 1360 and caused some Senate liberals to
reconsider their endorsement of the current language.

The bill creates a new nationwide right for patients to
inspect their own files and a framework for patients to
consent to a wide variety of disclosures.  The bill
generally gives approval to current disclosures of medical
data.  If medical providers comply with the new law they
would be immune from lawsuits by patients victimized by
disclosure of their medical information.  The bill would
pre-empt stronger state laws in eight states, California,
Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts,  Minnesota,
Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.

AUTOMATED MEDICAL FILES NOW LESS SECURE?

In 1994 52 percent of 355 hospital records managers
responding to a survey said that computerized records are
more secure than paper records.  In 1995, that percentage
slipped to 43 percent, the same number who think that manual
and automated records are about equally secure.  The Second
Annual Computer-Based Patient Records Survey by the Chicago
law firm of Gordon & Glickson, is available from Diana J.P.
McKenzie, 312/372-7671, fax 312/321-9324, e-mail

INTERNET WIRETAP, A FIRST

For the first time, federal prosecutors have used a wiretap
order from a federal court to intercept messages on the
Internet.

The investigation resulted in the arrests Dec. 29 of a
German engineer living in Nevada, his estranged wife, and a
salesman for the German man.  They were charged with an
international conspiracy to sell illegal electronic
surveillance equipment.

In the past, federal authorities have monitored Internet
activities with the consent of participants.  Federal agents
are also able to get identities of Internet users and stored
messages with a subpoena, but intercepting ongoing messages
requires a court-approved warrant.  In this case, Secret
Service agents in New York City secured approval to tap the
German's electronic-mail activity on CompuServe.  They posed
as buyers, in six months of electronic communication with
the suspect, Bernhard Bowitz.

JFK, NIXON, AND NOW -

A writer for SPY magazine was assigned to get a job at the
tabloid newspapers to learn whether the reports of tawdry
gossip-gathering techniques were true.  In an article
published in the November/December issue, Stuart Goldman
reported that the practices were worse than he had imagined.

"The tabloids are, as I would experience first-hand, in the
business of smearing reputations and subverting the truth.
If the blatant fabrication of stories - and the lying,
backstabbing, bribery, blackmail, intimidation, mail theft,
wiretapping, leaking of disinformation, and computer hacking
used to get these stories - wasn't what I initially
expected, I quickly learned otherwise," Goldman wrote in a
shocking expose, after stints working for THE NATIONAL
ENQUIRER, THE STAR, THE GLOBE, and "A  Current Affair" in
Los Angeles.

Hollywood now has its long awaited opportunity for revenge
against the gossip press.  A new company named Phoenix
Pictures has purchased the rights to Goldman's nine-page
story and signed Oliver Stone, who directed "JFK" and
"Nixon," to direct.  Goldman plans to recount more of his
experiences in a forthcoming book, SNITCH: CONFESSIONS OF A
TABLOID SPY,  COMPUTER HACKER AND ALL AROUND SCOUNDREL.

SO MUCH FOR PRINCIPLES

Since the 1980s, the principle of "secondary use" has been
the crucial part of a code of fair information practices
endorsed by the federal government and by hundreds of
businesses.  The principle states that personal information
gathered for one purpose ought not be used for an
incompatible purpose without the consent of the individual.

"The principle," says the Washington spokesman for the
direct-marketing business, Richard A. Barton, "was raised to
the status of Holy Writ."

In the early 1990s, TRW Information Systems abandoned the
principle in its revised code of practices (although its
competitor, Equifax, continues to endorse the principle, in
a code of standards revised in 1993).

Now, Barton says that the principle probably doesn't apply
to the direct marketing industry of the 1990s.  "The
Internet and other interactive services have different
protocols and privacy expectations than traditional forms of
direct marketing," he writes in an essay in DM News (Dec.
25, 1995).  "We now enjoy a greater ability to collect,
store, and organized data than was imaginable just 18 years
ago.  As well, security problems on the Internet have
increased people's privacy concerns.  We must examine
privacy issues with a fresh perspective.  If we do not, we
may not have as great a success in molding the regulatory
environment as we have had in the past."

This revisionism comes when the DMA's most influential
member, Metromail, a direct-marketing firm, has been
criticized for violating the principle on secondary use, by
selling information traditionally used for marketing to law
enforcement, private investigators, and skip tracers.
Metromail has a call-in service whereby anyone, for $3 a
minute, may learn the telephone numbers, names, and ages of
all residents at a known address [see PJ Dec 95].  The
company, a subsidiary of R.H. Donnelley & Sons, said that it
has discontinued including children's names in its service.

BUSTING PARENTS: IT CAN HAPPEN HERE

In a story on the arrest of a famous TV anchor person in
London for having apparently taken innocent nude photographs
of her seven-year-old daughter [see PJ Dec 95], PRIVACY
JOURNAL asked "Can it happen here?"

On the very day that ITN newsreader Julia Somerville was
arrested in a drug store that developed the photos, a woman
was subjected to the same humiliation and fear in Cambridge,
Mass.

Both arrests occurred on Nov. 2.  The case of Toni Marie
Angeli came to light only late in December, perhaps because
she is not famous.

Angeli said that she took pictures of her four-year-old boy
for a class at Harvard, where she is a graduate student.
The photos show the boy nude inside their apartment and
outdoors; in some shots he is urinating.

A photo lab alerted Cambridge police to the photos, and
detectives showed up at the lab to confront the mother when
she picked up the photos.  An argument and scuffle ensued,
and she was arrested for assault and disorderly conduct.  No
charge was issued concerning the photos because there was no
"lascivious intent."

Police said that they wanted to satisfy themselves that the
photos were taken by a parent, without coercion to the
child.

Opinion seemed split in Boston whether the police had
overreacted or whether they were right in checking out all
suspicions of child abuse.  "There is a moral panic afoot in
the U.S. that has been accelerating in recent years," said
the Boston Coalition for Freedom of Expression.  "If there
is no direct evidence of sexual abuse in the pictures, then
that should have been enough."

COMPUTERS, FREEDOM AND PRIVACY 96

The major gathering of the year, the Sixth Conference on
Computers, Freedom and Privacy, will take a multinational
view of new technologies, in the Hyatt Regency Hotel
bordering the campus of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, Mass., Mar. 27-30.  Tutorials on
the first day will cover copyright, Constitutional rights,
legal liability, cryptography, criminal law in cyberspace,
as well as altering audio/visual evidence.  Simultaneously
there will be an exhibit of new interactive technologies.
The conference itself begins Thursday with a keynote address
by George Metakides, information technologist for the
European Union, followed by a Socratic panel on free-speech
on the Internet led by Harvard Law School privacy expert
Arthur R. Miller.  There will also be a panel of science
fiction writers, a panel on Canadian and Dutch perspectives
on the information infrastructure, a discussion of
"electronic money," more on cryptography and on 'net
censorship, and a panel on the new technologies as sources
of news.  There are discounts for registration prior to Feb.

MARYLAND MEDICAL DATA BASE; RECYCLED MEDICAL DATA

FROM MIRIAM L. AZRAEL, ATTORNEY, BALTIMORE, MD.:  Thank you
for including in last month's issue information about
Maryland's medical records data base.  The day after I
received my issue in the mail I received a call from a
Bethesda, Md., subscriber who somehow tracked me down for
more information.  The more Marylanders who get involved in
the process, the more accountable the state will be to
consumers who have legitimate concerns about their medical
records privacy.

FROM SAN DIEGO, CAL.:  Our organization received a complaint
from a person who received a letter from a hospital saying
that "an employee retrieved some computer generated medical
sheets from a recycling box to use as scratch paper at home.
 . . . A friend of our employee inappropriately used several
of these sheets as stationery.  You have been identified as
one who received correspondence from that person on the back
of these medical records and are, therefore, in possession
of this health care information."  The hospital then
cautioned the recipient not to violate California's medical
confidentiality law by disclosing the information and
insisted that the "stationery" be returned to the hospital
immediately.

[In addition to the breach] we are concerned that the
hospital now has in its possession the personal
correspondence list of the [non-employee] individual who
used recycled paper as stationery.

FROM TRUMANSBURG, N.Y.:  I wrote to MIB Inc. and asked for a
copy of my file.  They sent me the form, I filled it out
(they didn't ask for a SSN, amazingly), and they wrote back
and said that they had no file on me at all.  I don't
believe them - I had [individual health] insurance in effect
about three years earlier and the insurance company had
added stuff to my application which they presumably got from
MIB.  Do I have any recourse?

RESPONSE: At present you have to take a consumer reporting
agency's word when it says it has no file on you.  But if
you discover in the future that it did have information on
you, you can take action, based on a violation of the Fair
Credit Reporting Act.

It is not surprising that MIB does not have a file on you.
It has records on only about five percent of the U.S.
population, mainly for life insurance underwriting.  MIB,
located in Boston (617/426-3660), keeps computerized
summaries taken from prior insurance applications and then
provides them to another insurance company to which you
apply for coverage.  It is an example of a huge data base
that does not use Social Security numbers in its files.

FROM MT. HOPE, ARK.:  What kind of background checks on
patients do doctors and dentists do?  How can I get access
to this data base?

RESPONSE:  There are a few data bases that will tell a
doctor whether a person has filed a malpractice lawsuit in
the past.  These entities are subject to the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, which requires them to disclose to you what
information they have stored on you and requires the doctor
to identify the data base if you are turned down as a
patient because of information in them.  (There  is also a
federal data base listing doctors accused of malpractice and
other misconduct, although it is not available to the
general public.  There are a few private data bases that
sell similar information to the public.  They are not
subject to the FCRA.)

House Small Business Panel Finishes SBA Review

     With the House Small Business Committee's
initial review of all SBA programs complete, staffers
say the committee is starting to form its own
proposals to cut the agency.
     Everything is on the table and undecided,
committee sources say, but they are hoping to release
their proposal by mid-May. Other key players will
be the Budget Committee, which sets the
authorization for the agency, and the Appropriations
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and
Judiciary, which divvies up the funds. The House
Small Business Committee proposal will most likely
be the starting point for legislation.
     SBA recently made its own proposal, which
would eliminate the government's subsidy for the
small business loan programs, the agency's costliest
program, and consolidate local SBA offices and
centers. These changes would reduce the agency's
fiscal year 1996 budget by almost a third, providing
nearly double what the House committee proposed.
     But it is unlikely the House Small Business
Committee will stop there. Chair Jan Meyers, R-
Kan., has repeatedly said she believes the 8(a)
program is "duplicative" with the new SDB and
price preference program created as part of last year's
federal acquisition bill. The Small Business
Investment Program has also been pointed to as a
program that could be cut, possibly privatized.
     House aides indicated the committee is concerned
about SBA's proposal to reduce the government's
subsidy loan cost to zero through increases in fees to
banks and borrowers. Several members have
worried additional loan fees would put SBA loans
out of reach of smaller businesses.
     Members, including Meyers, also voiced
concerns about an SBA plan to close local SBA
offices, which might affect their districts. The
proposal would consolidate regional offices with
their district counterpart and eliminate many local
offices, leaving most states with just one SBA office.
Due to their concerns, committee members are
working closely with SBA officials on this matter.
     If Meyers' committee rejects or pares down these
two proposals, as it seems they might, it could mean
cuts may need to be found in other SBA programs,
though no one program will yield as much savings
as the loan program.
     SBA hopes it will have a champion in freshman
Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y. and a member of the
House Appropriations Subcommittee, which has
jurisdiction over SBA funding. Forbes is a former
director of congressional affairs for SBA and
regional administrator for the Northeast Region.
Staff aides say he is a strong advocate of the agency
as a whole.

Clinton Defends Preferences, Hopes to Diffuse Anger
President May Look at Helping Non-Minorities

     Republicans and Democrats may be looking for
ways to help broaden the base of programs for the
disadvantaged, but for very different purposes.
     Republicans hope to promote economic
disadvantage over race as a better way to help lift up
poor Americans than affirmative action. The Clinton
administration appears to be hoping to deflect anger
away from affirmative action, by looking for ways to
help non-minorities.
     In a speech to the California Democratic Party,
Clinton said Democrats should not retreat on those
affirmative action programs that work, but, rather,
should look to what we can do for those hurt by
downsizing and other structural changes in the
economy.
     It was the President's first indication he may take
the initiative on affirmative action. But other reports
have implied the administration's review may call for
additional review and the creation of a bipartisan
committee to study the matter further.
     If the administration lets conservatives take the
lead, it could result in the substitution of economic
for racial preferences. Clint Bolick of the Institute for
Justice, one of the think tanks behind the GOP attack
on affirmative action, has suggested the use of
economic disadvantage-based programs and
specifically targeted aid to help expand opportunities
for those in poor areas.
     For instance, he suggested the Small Business
Administration should narrow its focus to target only
those areas of the nation, namely inner cities, where
the barriers to small business success are highest.
     But a large-scale attempt to help the poor is
unlikely when the federal government faces a
massive deficit. At a panel discussion sponsored by
the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity,
Randall Kennedy of the Harvard Law School warned
that a move to replace economic for social
disadvantage would require more money and
possibly end up unfunded.
     Michael Dyson of the University of North
Carolina said that to truly help the poor masses
would require raising taxes on the rich and increasing
the minimum wage.
     He contended that affirmative action programs
actually cost very little and their elimination would
only help the poor if funds for affirmative action
were being diverted from anti-poverty programs.
     Affirmative action opponents' suggestion to
redirect these programs to target the poor specifically
seems particularly inconsistent when Congress is in
the process of cutting anti-poverty programs,
Kennedy said.
     Kennedy and Dyson were not completely
opposed to changes in affirmative action, particularly
when it came to the subject of whichgroups should
receive such preferences. Asked whether some
distinctions should be made between new immigrant
groups and those groups, such as African Americans
and Native Americans, who suffered historically at
the hands of this nation, Dyson said he was not as
interested in preserving programs in their current
state.
     But, he added, affirmative action should not be
thrown out just because "some of the beneficiaries
are suspect."

Washington Insider

     Federal officials, at first seemingly caught off-
guard by attacks on affirmative action, are now
strongly promoting it as a sign of good business
sense. At a recent conference, Postmaster General
Marvin Runyon, head of the U.S. Postal Service,
said that supplier diversity "is good for the nation
because it gives small, developing businesses a fair
chance. Organizations with strong minority supplier
programs say these small businesses are often able
to respond better and faster to their specific needs.
Encouraging supplier diversity encourages the best
from our country."
***
     But attacks on affirmative action programs on the
state level continue. According to The Los Angeles
Times, California Governor Pete Wilson is expected
to announce the elimination of all state affirmative
action programs not mandated by state law.
Although this will not affect California's major
affirmative action programs in education, hiring, and
contracting, it will mean abolishing several state
advisory boards and councils charged with
monitoring state compliance with those laws.
     Wilson, who also backs a ballot initiative
repealing all state and local affirmative action
programs, rejected diversity initiatives in his hiring
and judicial appointments. According to the Los
Angeles Times, his overall percentage of hires and
appointments of minorities have hovered around
17%, not coming near the percentage of minorities
comprising the state's labor force (39%) or its
population (43%).
***
     Some interesting facts regarding minority set-
asides and the 8(a) program...According to a recent
study done by the SBA Office of Advocacy, the six
largest federal prime contractors receive more
government contracts than do all small, minority-,
and women-owned federal contractors. And critics
say the 8(a) program is concentrated among a few
firms...Also SBA Administrator Phil Lader and his
Deputy Cassandra Pulley, at a recent hearing, cited
the fact that only 3% of the SBA's budget and 10%
of its personnel are devoted to running the 8(a)
program.
**
     For a hearing on a relatively obscure program, a
recent House government programs subcommittee
hearing on the Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) program was unusually well-attended, noted
subcommittee chairman Rep. Peter Torkildsen, R-
Mass. The surge in spectators was explained by the
presence of a dozen SBIR program managers,
wanting to see what subcommittee members were
going to do to their program.
***
     The Energy Dept. last month named Percy
McCraney as deputy director of the Office of
Economic Impact and Diversity in charge of the
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business
Utilization (OSDBU). McCraney is an attorney and
former college business instructor originally from
Louisiana.
***
     Where was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., at the
recent Senate Small Business Committee hearing on
the 8(a) program? Kerry, who was the main sponsor
of the Senate 8(a) reform bill last year, did not even
make a quick appearance. The hearing set up at the
request of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was
expected to question the whole existence of the
program, but Chairman Christopher Bond, R-Mo.,
seemed more bent on reform.
***
     The U.S. Agency for International Development
(AID) will host three one-day Business
Opportunities Conferences for small, minority-
owned, and women-owned businesses, historically
black colleges and universities, and private voluntary
organizations (PVOs) controlled by minorities and
women. The conferences will be May 3 in Miami,
Fla., and sometime in June in Indianapolis, Ind., and
Denver, Colo. The conferences will feature
workshops, counseling sessions, procurement and
subcontracting opportunities, and marketing tips on
doing business abroad. For registration information,
contact Gus Palmer, Thorpe International Inc., 202-
857-7835.
***
     NASA and Boeing Co., prime contractor for the
International Space Station, will host a small
business symposium May 18 at the Capitol Hill
Hyatt in Washington, D.C. Speakers give an
overview of the space station to date and discuss
near-term opportunities in mechanical/electrical
manufacturing, electrical/power/avionics,
mechanical/structural/thermal engineering, and
miscellaneous services. Pre-registration is required.
Contact Kevin Howard, NASA Small Business
Manager for International Space Station Alpha, 713-
280-7409.
***
     Although most congressional Republicans seem
to support continuing the Small Business
Administration's loan programs, Rep. Dick Chrysler,
R-Mich. and a member of the House Small Business
Committee, has characterized the program as
"corporate welfare". Others agree with him. The
Competitive Enterprise Institute has recently issued a
statement advocating the elimination of SBA and its
loan programs. The groups seems to reject the idea
that financial institutions are turning away small
businesses, particularly minorities and women,
because these loans don't offer the same returns as
bigger loans. Instead, they say that most of the small
businesses receiving SBA guarantees have a "poor
credit history." The group also believes SBA accepts
inadequate collateral, allowing borrowers to value the
collateral with no outside verification.
***
     The SBA Region VI Office in Kansas City has a
new phone number: 816-374-6380. So does the
Region III Office in King of Prussia, Pa.: 610-962-
3700.
***
     Senate Small Business Committee Chairman
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., has named Paul Cooksey,
a former SBA deputy administrator during the Bush
administration, as the committee's deputy chief
counsel. He has also served as a deputy assistant
secretary for administration at the Dept. of Treasury.
***
     Terminology watch... The Defense Dept. has a
polite way of saying that it disagrees. It uses the
word "nonconcur."

What's on your mind?

Q: My company is an SDB. Can you give me any
advice on winning subcontracts from primes?
***
A: As part of last year's Federal Acquisition
Streamlining Act, the federal government set a 5%
SDB contracting goal for all federal agencies, with
agencies negotiating subcontracting goals with
primes that can be either above or below this 5%
threshold.
     Subcontracting with primes, however, is actually
no different than contracting directly with a
government agency, except that primes may be more
motivated to work with you. Many primes are
worried about fulfilling their subcontracting goals
and, in fact, some even have problems locating
capable minority-owned firms in their particular
subcontracting niche. In some cases, primes can
even lose their contract if they cannot meet
subcontracting goals. So many primes may be quite
interested. But, just like with the federal agencies,
you will still need to provide a capabilities statement
and make a competitive bid. And, of course, not all
primes have problems finding SDBs.
     In any case, there are ways to improve your
chances for subcontracting with primes. As with all
government contracting, relationships are vital. Once
you have identified those primes that do work in
your field, call the main switchboard and ask for the
name of the person to contact. Most large primes
have a department or a person designated to help
them locate qualified small and minority businesses.
Look for the small business liaison officer or a
similar title. If they have a subcontractors list, request
to be added to it. But remember this is just a first
step.
     Because some contracts require primes to
specifically name the minority firm they will using, it
is important to make them aware of your firm early.
Try and schedule a meeting with the contact person
to give them a brief presentation of your firm's skills,
pertinent prior experience, and key personnel.
     The liaison officer will be able to give you
valuable information, such as what company
locations may need your service or product. They
can also help put you in touch with the prime's buyer
if they think you are qualified.
     Once you have successfully worked for a prime,
it will be much easier to get additional subcontracts
from the prime. So it is worth all the hard work to
get that first subcontract, even if it isn't very big.
***
Q: When will I be able to take advantage of the 10%
price preference for small disadvantaged businesses
contained in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining
Act?
***
A: The regulations, which tell government agencies
how to administer the new rules, must be in place by
October 1995. So you must wait until final rules are
in place--which could be earlier than the October
deadline, but don't count on it.

Congress Agrees to Paperwork Reduction Bill

     Before adjoining for their Easter/Passover recess,
the Senate and House approved the Paperwork
Reduction Act, clearing the measure for President
Clinton, who is expected to sign the bill.
     The bill was heavily supported by small business
lobbies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
National Federation of Independent Businesses, and
National Small Business United. It is estimated that
small businesses spend one billion hours annually
filling out government paperwork at a cost of nearly
$100 billion.
     The legislation, which is part of the GOP Contract
with America and aims particularly to lessen the
paperwork burden on small business, will:
     * require a 10% reduction in government
paperwork for two years and 5% for four years after
that;
     * allow individuals and small businesses to
ignore paperwork requirements if the issuing agency
did not obtain public input in developing them; and
     * reauthorize for six years the Office of
Management and Budget's (OMB) Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is the
primary review arm for reducing government
paperwork.
     The second and most controversial provision of
the bill would excuse the public from filling out
government forms that do not have OMB-issued
control numbers. The lack of such a number means
the federal agency issuing the form did not receive
OMB approval for the information request. If this is
the case, the public is legally excused from any fines
or repercussions as a result of not complying,
including the denial of government benefits.
     The bill is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1, once the
president signs it.

GSA May Contract Out More, Less

     The reorganization of the General Services
Administration (GSA) may result in more
contracting out for some services but less for others.
     GSA has divided its operations into 16 "business
lines" and over the next year will study each of them
for ways to save money and increase efficiency.
     The first two up for review are internal computer
operations and brokerage services.
     Computer operations include 22 data processing
centers, which are staffed largely by contractor
employees. The review found the centers to be two-
and-a-half times less efficient at data processing
compared to private industry.
     GSA spends about $65 million a year in salaries,
contracts, and equipment and facilities rent to run its
internal computer operations.
     To save money, data processing will be
consolidated into two large centers, which GSA
believes will operate more efficiently.
     Older computer equipment will be phased out
rapidly and two large computer services contracts
will be allowed to lapse in 1996 and 1997. Then,
GSA will consider if it can bring service in-house
using commercial software.
     GSA employs about 850 people in brokerage
services to manage the 7,700 buildings which the
agency owns or rents space in for federal workers.
     The agency spends about $94 million a year to
manage $2.4 billion in property leases. About 70%
of leases are considered "small leases" for 10,000
square feet or less.
     GSA takes 200-400 days to complete a lease
transaction, and has begun a pilot program in three
regional offices to cut 100 days from that process.
     In the review, GSA will look at whether it would
be cheaper to contract out for commercial brokerage
services or to keep performing it in-house.

Audit Says Defense Unit Awarded Too Much to
8(a)s

     The Defense Construction Supply Center
(DCSC) awarded a "disproportionate share" of its
construction contracts to 8(a) firms, according to a
Defense Dept. Inspector General's audit.
     The audit looked at DCSC contract awards made
from Oct. 1, 1990 to June 30, 1994, when the center
awarded 95 construction contracts worth $27.1
million. DCSC's procurement budget for the same
period was about $2.4 billion.
     An Ohio contractor's complaint that DCSC paid
"substantially" more than fair market value for the
installation of a sprinkler system by awarding a
contract to an 8(a) firm without competition and gave
the 8(a) "preferential treatment" sparked the audit.
     Auditors determined that the contract was
awarded properly, but said DCSC concentrated its
8(a) awards in the construction industry (defined as
work under SIC Codes 15, 16, and 17) at the
expense of other firms.
     DCSC awarded 97% of the value of its
construction contracts to 8(a) firms. All but four of
the contracts awarded to 8(a)s were awarded as sole-
source contracts, which, the audit said, cost more
than contracts awarded competitively.
     For all other industries, DCSC awarded 2% of the
value of contracts to 8(a)s, the audit reported.
     Congress set the Defense Dept. a goal of
awarding a minimum of 5% of the value of contracts
to small disadvantaged businesses. DCSC, according
to the audit, established an unwritten policy of
relying on awards to 8(a)s in construction to help
achieve its 5% goal. DCSC officials told auditors
they believed it was easier to locate qualified 8(a)
firms in construction than in other industries.
     Auditors recommended that DCSC monitor its
contract awards more closely, so 8(a) awards are not
concentrated in just a few industries.
     The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), of which
DCSC is a part, said it would begin publishing a
quarterly report listing SDB awards by SIC Code.
     DLA disagreed with the audit's findings, however
DCSC has never met the 5% SDB goal and
therefore, could be argued, that DCSC should
increase its 8(a) awards to meet the goal.
     DLA also said all of DCSC's sole-source awards
followed long-established government rules. It added
that auditors did not count millions of dollars in
construction contracts the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers awarded for DCSC requirements which,
if included, would lower the share of contracts going
to 8(a)s.

SBIR Sails Through Congressional Hearing

     Except for a few minor recommendations, the
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
program emerged from a congressional hearing
showered with laurels.
     The hearing, held by the House Small Business
government programs subcommittee, was the last in
a two-month series that examined programs
administered by the SBA.
     SBIR was lauded for creating jobs and generating
tax revenue while adding little or no extra
administrative cost. Congress created the program in
1982 and requires federal agencies with annual
research and development (R&D) budgets of more
than $100 million to devote a percentage to funding
proposals for new and innovative technologies they
solicit from small businesses. The goal of the
program is to develop a product for the commercial
marketplace.
     Subcommittee Chairman Peter Torkildsen, R-
Mass., said  he would consider just a few changes to
the SBIR program.
     Suggestions offered included:
     * reducing paperwork and developing standard
procedures for submitting and evaluating proposals;
     * reining in solicitation topics that one business
owner described as too "far out" for people to
propose a commercially viable product in SBIR's
limited time frame; and
      * designing a computer system to verify SBIR
participation and prevent duplicate awarding of
grants.
     Few cases of multiple awards for the same
proposal have been proven, but SBIR funding was
increased beginning in fiscal year 1993 and the
General Accounting Office (GAO) raised concerns
that more companies could try to take advantage of
the system. 
     SBA officials said a computer system to verify
SBIR participation much quicker than the system
now in use should be available in the next three to
four months.
     SBIR is promoted as a program that helps small
businesses develop new and useful technologies with
little government investment. It's a three-phase
process: In Phase I, companies receive up to
$100,000 over six months to see if their proposal is
viable. In Phase II, companies get up to $750,000
over two years to refine a product or service. No
government money is offered in Phase III,
commercialization.
     All grants are awarded competitively.
     Other suggestions touched on the types of
assistance agencies can offer to SBIR grant
recipients. The legislation allows agencies to provide
technical assistance, but program officials said
recipients appear to need more help in marketing
their products commercially. The Energy Dept.
created a business assistance program, funded with
non-SBIR money, to do that.
     Dr. Samuel J. Barish, the Energy Dept. SBIR
program manager, recommended that a small
percentage of SBIR money, possibly 1%, be
permitted for business development assistance. This
would require an amendment to SBIR legislation.
     Rep. Cleo Fields, D-La., asked about minority
participation in SBIR programs. No recent studies
have been done, but SBA officials said they believe
minorities are underrepresented as a whole, receiving
about 10% of SBIR awards. GAO backed up SBA's
estimate.

DOE Awards Contract to Run Rocky Flats
     Small Business to Get 15% of Contract's Value

     Small and minority-owned businesses will win
more than a half-billion dollars from a major new
Energy Dept. contract.
     DOE earlier this month awarded a $3.5-billion,
five-year contract to Kaiser-Hill Co. for cleanup of a
former nuclear weapons plant at Rocky Flats, in
Golden, Col.
     Kaiser-Hill, a joint venture between ICF Kaiser
and CH2M Hill, two leading environmental
management companies, will take over the Rocky
Flats contract July 1, 1995. The incumbent contractor
is EG&G Rocky Flats Inc.
     In its proposal, Kaiser-Hill set a goal of awarding
15% of the contract's total value, $525 million, to
small businesses. The company said it intends to
award at least $262 million in professional and
technical services contracts to small firms and more
than $130 million to small disadvantaged businesses.
     Kaiser-Hill's proposal beat out one submitted by
Parsons Rocky Flats Corp. and promises to save
$1.2 billion over the life of the contract. The Rocky
Flats contract was the second  awarded competitively
under DOE's Contract Reform Initiative announced
last year, which calls for contracts to be
performance-based as opposed to fixed-fee.
     Work at Rocky Flats will include cleaning up and
removing all high-risk "hot spot" contamination,
stabilizing plutonium and plutonium residues,
consolidating plutonium supplies into a single
building, shipping highly enriched uranium off-site,
rehabilitating 4,100 acres of land for public use, and
remediating five hazardous sites. Kaiser-Hill said it
will complete these tasks three to four years ahead of
established targets.
     For information, contact Ron Shatrow of CH2M
Hill, 303-771-0900, ext. 2110. To get on the bidder's
list, firms can mail a capabilities statement and
corporate brochures to Kaiser-Hill, 6060 S. Willow
Dr., Englewood, Col. 80111. No contracts or
subcontracts will be available until after July 1. Once
Kaiser-Hill takes over, it will contract with a small
business to run the Rocky Flats small business
office.

million. One contract will be for technical assistance
and remediation support services and the other will
