Hubble Repair Mission Trainer
Howdy, Hubble

This past December was a milestone in space history. During December,
NASA mounted one of its most ambitious effort since the Moon landings,
the Hubble Telescope repair mission. As anyone who has been on Earth for
the past few months probably knows, this mission required six EVAs
(extra-vehicular activity) of more than six hours each. In two person
teams, astronauts removed, replaced and repaired many components of the
Hubble telescope. What interests us about this mission is that it was the
first time that VR was used as a significant part of mission training,
both for flight crew and ground-based team members.

We first reported on the Hubble Mission Trainer in our November/December
1992 issue. At that time Bowin Loftin and his team working in the
Software Technology Branch at the Johnson Space Center (Houston, Texas)
had just finished their first prototype of the system. We found it
exciting and innovative. During the last months of 1993 the system was
put into operation. NASA used the system as an auxiliary training tool
for 121 Flight Controllers, real people with line responsibility, who
relied on the system for real training, for a real mission.

We spoke with several people involved with this training project, and the
consensus among them is that this was a highly successful training
technique. Said Page Lucas, a Flight Controller, and the liaison between
the Controllers and the Software Section, "I thought this was a very
efficient way to train flight controllers. It exceeded my expectations."
She explained that this was because the VR system helped them visualize
and understand procedures and equipment much better than the standard
books, models and diagrams.

As Lucas explained, the system was used for 200 hours of training. Each
team member spent about 30-40 minutes in the system on two separate
occasions. People used the system in groups of three, with one person in
the HMD and the other two watching monitors. There was continuos verbal
interaction among the team members.

The training was designed to provide basic understanding of each EVA,
therefore the simulations were simplified in scope and reduced in time.
The astronauts needed six hours to complete the COSTAR installation, but
in the simulation, the task was done in one hour. Most tasks were divided
into two parts, which were worked through on separate occasions.
Simplification involved eliminating details like bolt removal, and moving
into position to do various jobs. What was left was the essence of each
task, such as order of operations, the locations of and familiarization
with components, and the cooperation needed on EVA teams. In Lucas'
words, the training ensured that "flight controllers were all speaking
the same language on the Hubble mission". Using the VR system, she told
us, controllers were able to more quickly visualize and understand
procedures.

According to Steve Potter, Payload Training Supervisor, "we really liked
the system. It really tied [the operations and procedures] all together."
He explained that this type of training has been done using traditional
2D drawings, procedure descriptions, and scale models. While those
techniques work well, VR adds another modality that is especially useful
for those with different learning styles. He would like to see more
detailed graphics and interactions, but felt that the system met his
expectations very well. His group is now looking at other areas of
training that may benefit from this interface, including pilot and
commander training, and further payload operations training.

Lead Timeline Officer, Alan Bartos, was enthusiastic about the system,
his first VR experience. He has responsibility for scheduling operations
during a mission. The VR system gave him a new outlook on the
requirements of various tasks. "Seeing it in action gave us a new
appreciation for what had to happen and how it happens. I thought it was
really excellent." This deeper understanding helps him know which tasks
fit together well, so the crew's time is used more efficiently.

A similar system was used by the flight crew to evaluate Remote
Manipulator System, (RMU, the robot arm) planning, and to refine the
choreography of moving the large and delicate arm and its cargo. The RMU
was used both to move the Hubble itself, as well as a mobile work
platform for the astronauts. The VR simulator used by the astronauts
modeled the arm controls, located in the aft cabin of the space shuttle,
and also permitted the Mission Specialist to "grab and move" the arm to
check positioning.

Tim Saito, Senior Software Engineer, pointed out that the VR system is
only supplementary at this time. The system is constrained by computing
resources and the quality of HMDs. However, the entire team, both the
developers and users of the system, feel that this first training
exercise was a great success. The Software Technology Branch is already
starting their next training system, which will be used for the scheduled
Hubble maintenance mission in 1995.

While there are obvious shortcomings in this system, we feel that it is
of historical significance. We believe that this exercise was the first
to use VR on this scale, over 100 participants, and for this length of
time, over 200 hours of training. It is important that this was real
training, not a evaluation of a demo system. Probably most important,
everyone involved feels that the VR simulation added value to the
training regimen. We salute NASA and everyone who developed the Hubble
Mission Trainer for a job well done.

VR NEWS AND INFORMATION

The price of HMDs continues to drop.  The newest entry into the HMD arena
is the VFX1, a joint development of Advanced Gravis and Forte
Technologies. The new unit, which was shown for the first time at the
Winter Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas, is a full color, medium
resolution design with PC interface. The VFX1 incorporates two Epson
AMLCDs to provide stereo 428 x 244 resolution with a 46.4: x 35.2: field
of view. Included is Forte's 3DOF, proprietary, hybrid tracking system,
called Virtual Orientation System (VOS), providing pitch, roll and yaw
data. Input may be either PAL or NTSC video, with stereo sound optional.
VFX1 is compatible with Advanced Gravis' UltraSound 3D sound card, and
other sound cards. It also includes a VESA features adapter which
interfaces its controller card to standard VGA display systems. The
weight of the actual unit is not yet determined, but is expected to be
less than 2 pounds. Ergonomic features include adjustable interpupilary
distance (IPD), and the "Smart Visor", an optics mounting system that
lets the user pivot the optical unit out of the line of sight. Focus
adjustments are independent for each eye. The unit also adjusts for head
size.

The VFX1 is scheduled for release in the 3rd quarter of 1994 at a retail
price of under us$1,000. We have also been told that the HMD may be made
available without the VOS tracking system, and the VOS will be sold
separately at an as yet undetermined price, starting this coming Fall. We
are told that many major game developers, including Electronic Arts and
LucasArts Games are writing software for the system.

New graphics, auto safety and entertainment are keeping the folks at
Division busy these days. The announcement which may have the most
impact on  world builders is that Division has debuted their new 100 VPX
graphics system. Based on the University of North Carolina's Pixel
Planes architecture, this single board implementation includes 8,192
processors that provide two channels of video output providing either a
stereoscopic display, or high throughput monoscopic video. Two to the
EISA form-factor boards can be used in together to increase throughput
further or to provide four video channels. The 100 VPX is rated by
Division at 300,000 texture mapped, Z-buffered, specularly lit polygons
or spheres per second. The graphics system is available as a stand-alone
for inclusion in OEM systems for #12,000 or in an integrated system, the
ProVISION 100 VPX, for #50,000.

Working with Volvo UK, Division has developed a crash simulator that
Volvo is using as a selling tool at auto shows. Running on a ProVISION
system, the simulation models the interior of a Volvo 850, its exterior,
the countryside and another vehicle. The animation of the experience
matches a current Volvo advertisement, in which the Volvo is struck from
the side at 25 miles per hour. Designed to illustrate the strength of
the side impact protection system, the model will also be used for
training and ergonomic evaluation.

Finally, two entertainment companies have announced liaisons with
Division. UK-based Global Entertainments has formed a new subsidiary,
Virtual Reality Games, Ltd., that will develop a new series of
interactive entertainment systems using Division equipment and
consulting expertise. The American company, Alternate Worlds Technology
also recently announced that they will be building systems based on
Division hardware and software. Kevin Williams, formerly with Hughes
Rediffusion, has been appointed to head Division's interaction with the
entertainment industry.

This past November, Realidad Virtual, of Madrid, demonstrated a new
VR environment at SIMO, Spain's largest annual computer fair. Alice
Through The Monitor was developed for the company America Iberica to
publicize their range of computer magazines. The environment
incorporates four worlds, each containing advertising for America
Iberica's various publications. The user can explore the worlds, and
hunt various types of marine life. Entrance is through a bottomless pit
based on the rabit hole in Alice In Wonderland; the user falls past
doors, each of which leads to one of the other worlds. Despite each user
at the fair only having two minutes to play, the queues were enormous.

The program was demonstrated using the EyeGen3 HMD and a Polhemus
FasTRAK. It was written with PC version of WorldToolKit by Sense8, and
runs on a 33Mhz 486 and two SPEA FIRE boards. Portaling between the four
worlds was used to reduce rendering complexity and time.

The last chapter?
Thomson CSF to Purchase VPL Patents

By Kenny Meyer

VPL Research, Inc. will sell its assets, including its patent
portfolio, to Thomson CSF for us$150,000. The sale is part of a
Chapter 11 reorganization that VPL filed in US Bankruptcy court
on November 12.

VPL initially filed for Chapter 11 protection last March when
it needed protection from numerous creditors and a foreclosure
suit brought by Thomson. Thomson was foreclosing on loans that
were collateralized with VPL's patent portfolio.

The VPL patent portfolio includes two optical flex sensor
patents, the glove control patent, "3D Swivel" licenses, and, at
least, ten additional patent applications covering a range of
key technologies. Many of the applications were filed in both US
and Europe. These intellectual properties would give Thomson a
strategic holding in the VR industry since they could bring
considerable resources to bear in any patent protection suit.

As part of the proposed $150,000 purchase, Thomson will
forgive approximately $2 million in loans to VPL. However, the
plan allows Thomson to retain claim to a $150,000 DIP loan
(Debtor-in-possession) made last September. VPL used the DIP
loan to cover the cost of maintaining the patent portfolio.
Thomson will acquire VPL's assets free and clear without liens
and encumbrances.

Unsecured creditors do not fair well under VPL's plan.
Unsecured claims, totaling approximately $1.5 Million, will be
paid $0.05 on the dollar. Among the unsecured creditors is Tom
Zimmerman who is owed $212,000 for royalties on VPL's important
glove control patent. Zimmerman invented the DataGlove and is
listed as an inventor on several VPL patents.

After the sale of assets to Thomson, VPL will change its name
and the company will be liquidated under Chapter 7. Neither
VPL's president, Jean-Jacque Grimmaud, or Comptroller, Alan
Defrenne, are planning to join Thomson or any new company formed
by Thomson with the acquired assets.

The court is scheduled to approve the reorganization on
February 16. A previous approval date was rescheduled because of
objections from one of VPL's unsecured creditors.

Recent VR Books: Readers' Roundup

The end of 1993 brought a flurry of new VR books. Some of them were
really quite good, others left a lot to be desired. While we will
continue to do complete reviews of new books that we feel are highly
significant, we are starting a new feature, Readers' Roundup, that will
provide capsule reviews and ratings of the deluge of VR books hitting the
shelves. Here is the first installation of Readers' Roundup.

Ratings:
* * * * * 5 Books, required reading
  * * * * 4 Books, worth having
    * * * 3 Books, about average
      * * 2 Books, may be useful
        * 1 Book, wait for the movie

* * * * * Pictorial Communication in Virtual and Real Environments,
second edition, Edited by Stephen R. Ellis with Mary Kaiser & Arthur J.
Grunwald.

Thirty-nine chapters cover topics from Environments to Seeing and
Knowing. This is a rigorous work that discusses many aspects of our
sense, and how to fool them into believing that virtual worlds represent
something real. In the Prologue, Editor Ellis says, "The theater of human
activity is an environment which may be considered to have three parts: a
content,  a geometry, and dynamics....The following discussion develops
an analysis of these parts which is then applied..." That summarizes the
mission of this book, which is accomplished well. This is not a
beginner's book, but is worth the effort required. Ellis and his
co-editors are involved with NASA's VR work and provide a high degree of
experience and understanding.

Published by Taylor and Francis, London, UK, ISBN: 0-74840-0082-6, 615
pages, soft cover, illustrated, indexed, US$39.50.

* * * * * Garage Virtual Reality, Linda Jacobson.

LindaJ, as she is know on the nets, never ceases to amaze us. This, her
second book, is not only an informative, fact-filled base for those
starting in VR, its a ton of fun to read. Jacobson knows many of the
famous and soon-to-be famous personalities she profiles, and her personal
affection for them and the topic shows. Garage VR is intended for those
who can't afford an SGI but want to get into VR anyway. It provides a
solid historical perspective, an ample number of resources, instructions
for building a PowerGlove interface, some software, and profiles of the
leading garage VR hackers. We suspect that this book will be the
launching pad for some of the VR heroes of the future.

Published by Sams Publishing, Indianapolis, IN, USA, ISBN: 0 672 30270 5,

Kalawsky.

This is the first VR book obviously intended as a text, and it is
thorough and complete. Kalawsky works at British Aerospace, and has been
involved in simulation and VR for quite a while. Provided a step by step
explanation of all of the components of VR systems, the reader of this
book will have a comprehensive understanding of the field upon completion
of the volume. One significant blemish is the unacknowledged use of a
substantial amount of material from the journal, "Presence".

* * * * * The Virtual Community, Howard Rheingold.

Rheingold is well known in VR circles, having been among the first to
write on the subject. In this book he turns his sights on a larger
target: the community in cyberspace that has flourished in various
on-line venues. VR is a minor part of the subject matter, but the
implications of electronic community hits each of US with equal impact.
He sings the praises of the great potential, he warns of the risks.
Rheingold's first person narrative is an easy read, but his ideas and
facts warrant careful consideration.

* * Virtual Reality in Engineering, Edited by Kevin Warwick, John Gray
and David Roberts.

This book is visually unpleasant, printed in a large, clunky type that
makes it look cheap. It is a collection of loosely connected chapters
that were mostly written by professors, and indeed, the book "is based on
a Institution of Electrical Engineers vacation school held at the
University of Reading (UK)". The style is didactic, and very
Anglo-centric. We found the approach somewhat round-about, for example,
in the section titled "A definition of virtual reality" the author
provides a full page of discourse, but leaves the reader lacking a
concise definition. As close as one gets is the opening sentence,
"Virtual Reality can be described as the science of integrating man with
information". This book provides some useful reference material, but is
lacking as a stand- alone tutorial.

* * * * Virtual Reality Creations, Dave Stampe, Bernie Roehl, and John
Egan.

This book isn't for people who want to read about VR, it's for people who
want to make VR. Included is a disk and Fresnel 3D viewer. On the disk is
REND386, probably the best-known VR shareware program, and a collection
of sample worlds. The book provides a introduction on VR, and an overview
of VREAM and Superscape software, but the choice stuff starts in the
middle. That's where the REND386 tutorial is. This book was written by
the developers of the software, and provides a complete programmer's
reference to it. If you want to build virtual world's and have a limited
budget, get this book.

* The Virtual Reality Primer, L. Casey Larijani.

Some one at McGraw Hill must have decided they needed a VR book, FAST.
This book is disappointing from cover to cover. It's full of factual
errors, misconceptions, and cute, irrelevant cartoons. Save your money.

* * * * Walkthroughs & Flybys CD, Phil Shatz.

 While this isn't strictly a VR book, it does offer some great examples
of what VR should look like. Unlike many computer books, where an
accompanying disk adds a bit of interest, in this case the book is only
there to provide details on the enclosed CD-ROM. Holding 538 megabytes of
(did you guess?) walkthroughs and flybys, this CD-ROM provides plenty of
ideas and examples to anyone who is designing 3D interactive graphics.
The author presents this book as an art collection, who are we to
disagree. Each demo is described in detail. It's too late for Christmas,
but maybe you know somebody who has a birthday soon. If they have a
CD-ROM player, get them this book.

New York VR Expo 93
Maybe There is Money in Virtual Reality

The big news at the first New York Virtual Reality Expo,
produced by the Meckler organization and co-sponsored by
CyberEdge Journal, was that is was big. Nearly 400 people
attended conference session or tutorials, more than that
attended the first ever VR Video festival, produced by Louis M.
Brill. There were two evening Keynote speeches, one by Robert
Stone, head of the Advanced Robotics Research Lab in Salford,
England, and the other by CEJ Publisher and Editor, Ben Delaney.
There were 34 exhibitors, and there were a couple of thousand
people who came to see them. Finally, the event concluded with a
full-day Venture Capitol Forum, during which fourteen budding
entrepreneurs made presentations about their companies, and
their growth opportunities.

Another interesting note was the composition of the crowd.
Unlike most West Coast shows, the cyberpunk contingent was most
noticeable by its absence. The people at this show were business
professionals, conservative in dress and manner. They were there
to see if there is money in VR. As their focus was finance and
business, so will be the focus of this report.

>>The business of VR

The first business-oriented session brought together two
veterans of the VR production house business and one of the few
market researchers in the field. Chet Dagit, Director of
Business Affairs for WorlDesign (Seattle, Wash, USA) discussed
their experience in getting a world building company off the
ground. From Dagit's presentation, we see that it may not be
easy. In his discussion of Financing and Fund Raising, he
recited a litany of every problem known to small businesses:
lack of capital, difficulty in attracting top people, being
unsure of the product, and the paradoxical problem of no
practical experience and no way to get it. "It sounds clichid",
he said, "but know your customer." In fact, much of Dagit's
presentation was clichid, which doesn't mean it was unimportant,
but that the problems of starting a business are universal.
Dagit emphasized, though perhaps unintentionally, how important
it is for those getting into the VR business to understand not
just VR, but also business.

A more successful experience was related by Ian Capon, form
the London VR studio, Virtual S. Capon and partner Peter
Williams co-founded Virtual S in April of 1991 with the mission
of providing commercial VR for what ever purposes their clients
found appropriate. With a client list that includes Canon Office
Products, Volvo, British Telecom, Compaq and others, Virtual S
may be the most prolific VR production facility in the world.
Capon described their purpose-built worlds, and explained that
the objectives of the clients were primarily one of two:
building trade show volume or product introduction tours. While
these worlds are largely custom designed, Virtual S makes use of
a common production strategy; they re-use modules, slightly
customizing them for individuality. This saves a substantial
amount of time, and enables them to provide high quality at a
relatively low price.

Capon offered a few insights that may be valuable for others
entering the world of VR production for hire. "The full
potential of VR will only be realized through great
productions", he said, emphasizing that "virtual reality isn't a
computing technology, it's more like the telephone of the
future", ubiquitous and easy to use. He also stressed the need
to make effective use of the technology that works, especially
sound. He described the professional, multi-track sound
production facility in the Virtual S studio as providing an
important finishing touch to the visual aspects of worlds. "We
enphasize audio", which he pointed out is, "one of the most
important, and undersold parts of virtual reality". Capon came
off very professionally, as a man with a commercial sensibility
and a bottom-line orientation, and was refreshing in his candor.

A report on market considerations in VR entertainment was
provided by Carrie Heeter, from Michigan State University (East
Lansing, MI, USA). For nearly two years Heeter has been doing
research on the demographics and motivations of players of VR
games, specifically BattleTech players in both Chicago and
Walnut Creek, California. Her conclusions, based on hard data,
present an interesting picture of BattleTech aficionados, and
offer guidance for others entering the VR LBE arena.

Heeter found that 93% of BattleTech players are male, but
that women may be attracted if the games become less
militaristic. 62% of players played more than four times, while
an impressive 42% have played more than 10 games. Repeat
business is essential to financial success, and the factors that
keep 'em coming were no surprise: "It's fun", It's
exhilarating", It's challenging", "The staff is friendly".
Interestingly, the sixth most popular reason is "It's fun to
blow up people", which belies some of the more noble rationale
offered for these games. The players are not fools, however,
with 86% having at least some college attendance. Heeter
believes that virtual travel may be a strong draw for women, and
notes that there is a strong correlation between VR game fans
and science fiction readers. Heeter's research will be published
later this spring in its entirety.

>>Voices of experience

From William Bottoms, Senior Vice President at the investment
firm of Patricoff and Company, came a fascinating look at the VR
industry from the investor's point of view. Patricoff was an
early investor in VPL Research, having put in us$50,000 in 1986,
and is part of the group which recently brought the Virtuality
Group (formerly W Industries) public. His presentation was a
primer in funding, tempered by as much experience as any
investor has had in the VR business, which is, he said quoting
Jaron Lanier, a bit "like surfing in an avalanche of boulders".

Bottoms sees a tremendous potential for VR, which he expects
to be the preferred interface for simulation, communication,
artificial intelligence and multimedia applications. The success
of the VR industry will be driven by its ability to reduce cost,
improve interfaces, and implement efficient programming methods,
he cautioned. Bottoms identified six areas of immediate
opportunity for entrepreneurs and investors in VR:

     *  Sensors
     *  Telemetry
     *  Display technology
     *  Graphics engines
     *  Software development tools
     *  Programming/Applications

Patricia E. Glovsky, of the Polygon Capital Group, started
off by polling the audience. The show of hands indicated that
20% were already running a VR company, 10% were looking for
funding and 5% were investors. She discussed the objectives of
large funders: a 1000% or greater return in 5-7 years, and
stressed the importance of a business plan that demonstrates
that income potential. One way to provide that return is a
public offering, the strategy taken by Virtuality Group,
Division, and Virtual Universe in the past year. While this may
be quite profitable, it imposes significant up front expense and
ongoing regulatory burdens on the company, and needs to be
considered carefully. Glovesky's talk meshed well with
Patricoff's to provide a good foundation for budding VR
capitalists.

We were impressed with this show. Once again, the Meckler
organization and conference chair, Sandra Helsel did a good job
of providing solid organization and valuable information. The
show floor was bustling, and many of the vendors with whom we
have spoken told us they did good business. The two evening
sessions were not well attended, and probably need either more
promotion, a scheduling change, or to be dropped, but that was a
minor flaw in what was otherwise a worthwhile show.

Criterion's RenderWare
PC Renders at Startling Speed

What's faster than a speeding bullet, but less powerful than
your average workstation? It's a PC running the new RenderWare
software from Criterion Software, a spin-off of Canon's UK
Research Centre. RenderWare is an interactive, 3D graphics
programming API for Microsoft Windows and other environments.
That means that you won't find it on the shelves of your local
software emporium. RenderWare is intended for developers, and
provides them with a set of routines that dramatically
accelerates 3D graphics on PCs with no special hardware. It is
based on new algorithms, first reported here in our May/June
1992 Industry Outlook section, on which there have been 20
patent applications filed worldwide.

Criterion showed RenderWare at recent press conferences in
New York City and San Francisco. They demonstrated its
capabilities on a Toshiba 486/DX50 laptop computer with 12
megabytes of RAM. The system will run in 4 MB, in our office we
have run it easily in 8MB, in our standard Windows
configuration. (A Gateway 2000 486/DX33 EISA, 256-color, 1068 x
780 ISA video, Windows for Workgroups 3.1, Norton Desktop 2.2,
and various other Windows programs.) David Lau-Kee, lead
developer of RenderWare, and President of the new company told
us that on the demo system, we were seeing texture mapped,
animated, lighted images being updated at a rate of 40,000
polygons/second. The subjectively rated frame rate was about 15-
20 fps. On our office system, we observed a frame rate of about
10-15 fps, but this still exceeds the performance of any similar
package we have seen. The demos presented by Criterion included
reflective and other surfaces texture mapped on various objects.
This texture mapping, according to co-developer and VP of R&D,
Adam Billyard, "doesn't cost you anything as far as performance
is concerned". The demo also permitted one to use "drop and
drag" techniques to pick up new textures and objects, and drop
them into a RenderWare window.

Criterion rates the software at 40K poly/sec on a 486/DX50
using a 4K polygon model transformed, clipped, painted and
software double-buffered in a 400 x 400 pixel viewport.
Performance scales with CPU power. The software is written
entirely in C, with no operating system dependency, making it
easily portable. The geometry for RenderWare scenes is stored in
a proprietary ASCII format, with converters for other file
formats included. The use of ASCII makes the building of self-
modifying worlds fairly simple. At this time, only 8 bit color
is supported, but 16 bit color and true color support are in the
works, as is sound support. The library of 32 bit code is about
300K in size.

Features

*       Available now on Windows 3.1, Macintosh, Sun (X11). Windows
     NT available soon

*       Multiple light sources supported

*       Multiple orthographic and perspecive views

*       Texture mapping

*       Environment mapping

Now, more than ever...
1993 Conference Rankings

If you went to each of the twenty-one conferences we rank here, you would
have seen over a thousand speakers. You would have heard some
entertaining, informative, innovative presentations and some dull,
derivative, boring ones. You would have seen around 15,000 slides and
nearly as many overhead cells. It would soon become obvious that the
length of the list of initials after a speaker's name is not indicative
of the quality of thought or presentation.

You would have seen 839 exhibits at these 21 shows. They ranged from a
tablecloth on which was placed some equipment and brochures, up to
multi-hundred-thousand dollar show stands. They were attended by close to
three thousand enthusiastic salespeople. Some of them were staffed by
attractive young ladies who were apparently not chosen for their VR
expertise. You would have quickly realized that the price of the exhibit
has no bearing on the quality of the products.

During the 65 days of these symposia, you would have eaten 41.6 awful
pre-made sandwiches, drunk 382.6 cups of luke-warm coffee, waited 33.8
hours in line for lunch and dinner, spoke to about a zillion people and
hauled off 418 kilograms of paper, much of which you discarded in your
hotel room. You wore out 2.1 pairs of shoes.

>It comes down to dollars

Conferences cost a lot to attend, and can provide major paybacks. They
can also be major time and money wasters. Last year, 56,123 people
attended the conferences we list here. Each spent an average of three
days in attendance, plus travel time, let's say 1-1/2 days for travel for
each person. That makes 252,535.5 days spent at VR conferences last year
(691.9 years!) Assuming that each person's time is worth $200 a day (a
very conservative estimate), that time was worth $50,510,698! Plus, each
person paid an average of $510 for each conference, a total of
$28,609,367 in all. Add to that the cost of plane fares, hotel and
restaurant charges and other incidentals, and you have a hefty sum.

>Getting your money's worth

That's why we provide these Conference Rankings each year. Like the rest
of the VR industry, the conference business has grown. Unlike the rest of
the VR industry, the conference business is very profitable. And also
unlike much of the VR industry, conferences effect nearly everyone in the
business. Either you attend a conference, or the people you're trying to
contact are attending. Regardless of your level of involvement, it's
important that you spend your time and money wisely.

A few notes on how to use the rankings. Most important is how well the
conference program fits your information needs. There are essentially
four types of conferences included here: Scientific VR meetings, VR trade
shows, Special-interest VR gatherings, and Non-VR shows that include a
significant VR component.

Remarkable as it may seem, not every 1993 VR conference is included in
our rankings. We know of at least four others for which we were unable to
obtain information by press time. This year we will redouble our efforts
to get this information for every important meeting.
RAIS, our overall top ranked conference,
Informatique, or the IEEE meeting were your best bets last year, and
probably will be next year, too. They provide a preponderance of research
papers, most juried, and provide complete sets of proceedings. There are
fewer exhibits at these meetings, usually less social activity, and lot's
of data.

For people with a general interest in VR, and for executives and
marketing types, the VR trade shows are the most useful. These are
generally bigger shows, with major exhibit areas, and more social
activities, ideal for networking. Many new products are introduced at
these shows, and usually attendees get to try them out.

The special interest shows are hard to summarize, since by definition,
they are narrowly focused and esoteric. Two of these stand out as
providing exceptional programs: the Virtual Reality and Persons with
Disabilities Conference, and the International Conference on Cyberspace.
The former is explained by its title. The Conference on Cyberspace is a
unique meeting, bringing together presentations on the social impact of
new technologies, the importance of gender in cyberspace, providing
access to new technologies to disadvantaged people, and much more. It's
wild and woolly, and very exciting.

The non-VR-specific shows include the biggest listed here: SIGGRAPH and
Technology 2003. SIGGRAPH is the computer graphics show the whole world
waits for. With hundreds of exhibits, scores of presentations, thousands
of attendees, and dozens of parties, SIGGRAPH is all things to all
people. VR has taken root here, and though it is a small part of the
bigger picture, SIGGRAPH is an important VR show. The other
non-VR-specific shows have various foci, and provide VR as an important,
but secondary, part of the program.

Our rankings this year, the third year we've provided them, are produced
in essentially the same manner as previous years. Each conference is
rated on a 0 (awful/none) to 10 (excellent/all) scale in eight
categories. These raw scores are weighted to reflect the importance of
the categories, for example, Percent VR is weighted 2.5 times more
heavily than Entertainment/Parties. The weighted scores are then
normalized on a 0 to 10 scale that is used for the actual ranking. As
noted earlier, the content of each conference is more important than the
absolute rank, as you decide how well it meets your needs.

Finally, we must note that two of these conferences were co- sponsored by
CyberEdge Journal. They are the Virtual Reality and Persons with
Disabilities conference, and the New York Virtual Reality Expo. We have
made every effort to rate these conferences objectively, but feel that
you need to know of our affiliation with them.

>>The Top Ranked Conferences<<

We are presenting the rankings in three parts this year. the first
section ranks conferences by type. The second section provides overall
rankings, while the final chart gives you the detailed information on
which the rankings are based. We hope this helps you with your planning
for the coming year, and applaud everyone who works so hard to make these
conferences worthwhile.

Virtual Environment Products
Avoiding Product Liability Suits

By Paul E. Paray and James P. Jenkins, (C) 1994

NOTE: The opinions set forth in this article are solely those of the
authors and do not represent official NASA policy on any issue discussed.

Mention the words "products liability" to a virtual reality product
manufacturer and you might get a blank stare in return. Many virtual
reality product manufacturers are simply not in tune with the broad brush
devastation this theory of law can inflict on a growing company's
overhead. Some creative lawyers and inventive expert witnesses have
generated a cottage industry by using pseudo-science to influence
juries,. With proper due diligence, virtual reality product manufacturers
can avoid having to waste time defending lawsuits and waste money in
increased insurance premiums.

The law of products liability is generally easy to understand but
difficult to apply. Under the law of most states, one who manufactures,
distributes, or sells a product in a defective condition unreasonably
dangerous to the user is subject to liability for physical harm caused by
the product if 1) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a
product and 2) it is expected to and does reach the user without
substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.  Lawsuits can be
pursued against the seller of the product even if the seller has
exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product
and the user or consumer of the product has not bought the product from
or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.  Simply put,
the manufacturer, distributor or seller is strictly liable to the
consumer for all injuries sustained from use of the defective product
after the product has entered the stream of commerce.

Under the law of most states, the existence of a "defect" or unreasonably
dangerous condition is a prerequisite to recovery. A product may be in a
defective condition, or unreasonably dangerous to the user, by virtue of
a manufacturing defect, a design defect, or inadequate warnings or
directions. Whether a product has a "manufacturing defect" can be
determined by comparing it with other units from the same assembly line.
A product with a design defect is not reasonably fit, suitable or safe
for its intended purpose.

Some states provide that a manufacturer or seller is not liable for any
injuries to a user if at "the time the product left the control of the
manufacturer, there was not a practical and technically feasible
alternative design that would have prevented the harm without
substantially impairing the reasonably anticipated or intended function
of the product." Because this "state-of-the-art" defense is based on the
state of the scientific knowledge, it tends to expand faster than its
assimilation by industry.

Lastly, a product may be unsafe if it fails to adequately warn
foreseeable users as to dangers inherent in the use of the product. Sound
business practice requires virtual reality product manufacturers to fully
explore current technology and potential liability issues before products
are marketed for public use.

Virtual reality product manufacturers should be concerned with the
perceived possible physical effects of HMDs and electromagnetic tracking
devices placed near the body.  Most of the tracking devices on the market
employ an electromagnetic sensor technology. These tracking devices
generally operate at over 100 Hz, and they are placed near users for only
short periods of time. Whether the short term exposure to fields
generated by electromagnetic tracking devices can cause harm to users has
been given little mention in the virtual reality literature.

Although ionizing radiation such as x-rays or gamma rays are able to
knock-out electrons from atoms and cause damage to DNA and tissue,
non-ionizing radiation such as ELF-EMFs do not displace electrons as they
pass through tissue. Evidence is inconclusive that human exposure to
ELF-EMF electric and magnetic fields can increase the risk of cancer and
leukemia. (See "Extremely Low Frequency Electric and Magnetic Fields and
Risk of Human Cancer, 11 Bio-Electromagnetics 91, 92 (1990)). Indeed, a
good deal of research indicates that there is no danger due to extended
ELF-EMF exposure. For example, a study conducted by Southwest Research
Institute that was reported in the September 1993 Industrial Health &
Hazards Update indicates that exposure to 60 Hz electric and magnetic
fields on non-human primates did not cause significant problems.
Notwithstanding this research, the fact remains that the choice of which
exposure parameters constitute a proper safety zone is difficult to
measure.

Paul Brodeur, in a series of New Yorker magazine articles and two books,
the latest one titled The Great Power-Line Cover-Up: How the Utilities
and the Government are Trying to Hide the Cancer Hazard Posed by
Electromagnetic Fields, has created a cottage industry by speculating as
to the dangers of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields
(ELF-EMFs). These fields are in the 30-300 Hertz (Hz) range.  Although
commentators in the August 5, 1992 issue of the Journal of American
Medical Association state that any conclusion of human health risk due to
ELF-EMF exposure is premature, the fact remains that there are vocal
groups seeking to exploit any ambiguities in the medical literature. One
such group is a nation-wide group of lawyers who collectively call
themselves the Electromagnetic Radiation Case Evaluation Team (EMRCET).
EMRCET seeks out ELF- EMF cases in order to create legal precedents for
subsequent cases. In other words, they generate business by using the
popular media to sensationalize phantom dangers and exploit fears.
Several courts have recently rebuked such tactics. For example,
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Administrative Law Judge Hubert
Smolen ruled in September of 1993 that evidence of dangers associated
with ELF-EMFs "taken as a whole remains inclusive".

Even without the medical evidence, there are ELF-EMF products liability
lawsuits being filed and there is money being spent defending these
suits. According to an article in the November 2, 1993 Wall Street
Journal, more than a hundred lawsuits and regulatory disputes involving
EMF complaints have been filed nationwide. Because present virtual
reality technology relies heavily on electromagnetic tracking devices,
safety concerns and preventive litigation techniques should be analyzed
while the industry is in its infancy.

Although there is no reason to believe the electromagnetic tracking
devices are anything but safe, there is still no available talisman to
ward off groups such as EMRCET and the circulation-driven media.
Accordingly, there are three business strategies virtual reality product
manufacturers can employ to better the likelihood that a jury will
determine a product is safe.

First, virtual reality products manufacturers should obtain a basic
understanding of the proper use of warnings. A product may be unsafe if
it fails to adequately warn foreseeable users as to dangers inherent in
the use of the product. This duty to warn is a continuing one. It
requires a manufacturer to provide warnings of dangers that the
manufacturer discovered or reasonably should have discovered after the
product left its control. Courts use an objective standard to determine
the adequacy of a product warning. An adequate warning is "one that a
reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would have
provided with respect to the danger, and that communicates adequate
information on the dangers and safe use of the product, taking into
account the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to, the
persons by whom the product is intended to be used. . . ."

Simply put, a product warning must illuminate the mind of the reasonable
user by explaining risks not reasonably appreciated when a product is in
use. A manufacturer's liability for failure to warn is always contingent
upon proof that the missing warning was indeed the proximate cause of a
plaintiff's injuries. And, the issue of proximate causation turns on
whether proper warnings by the manufacturer would have prevented the
harm. For example, in order to warn against the possibility of physical
injury due to movements made while navigating in cyberspace, it would be
prudent to offer a potential user an instruction leaflet or present a
video demonstration warning the user not to make sudden wide-ranging
motions while navigating in a virtual reality system. There is a
rebuttable presumption that a plaintiff would have followed such a
warning if it had been given.

Determining whether warnings and instructions are adequate is not an easy
task. For example, because a clear understanding of all potential hazards
and consequences of injury must be had before any warnings or
instructions can be created, it is difficult to determine safety
standards until a suitable institution or governmental agency imposes
some safety parameters.  After such information is obtained, several
important questions must be asked. Does the warning or instruction
describe how to avoid the hazard? Would the warning or instruction make a
difference?, i.e., would anyone bother to heed the warning or follow the
instructions? It may even be advisable to liken a virtual reality systems
experience with an amusement park ride and to list those persons who
should not "ride" in cyberspace.

Second, virtual reality product manufacturers should openly discuss
safety issues and pool health and safety information now that the
industry is still in its infancy. Shared safety research would benefit
all segments of the industry. Indeed, the common goal of building a
customer base for virtual reality products would be furthered if
manufacturers pooled their resources.

Third, the formation of a Virtual Reality Technology Business Consortium
would be a cost-effective means of dealing with these virtual reality
product safety issues. Associations such as the Product Liability
Prevention and Defense Group in Falls Church, Virginia already helps
manufacturers of machinery improve their defense against litigation.
Commensurate with their ability to pay and their percentage of activity
in developing virtual reality products, qualifying start-up companies
could even join this consortium.

Virtual reality product manufacturers are urged to address these issues
in a straightforward, practical manner before waves of lawsuits are given
a chance to materialize. Although it certainly does not make any sense to
begin preparing for a specific lawsuit before it is filed, virtual
reality product manufacturers are urged to consider implementing the
above measures in order to prevent the first suit from going to trial.
Similarly, it is also a good idea for manufacturers to meet with the loss
controls representative of their insurance carrier to discuss methods for
evaluating possible risks of loss before any claims are made. Simply put,
although entrepreneurs are by definition "risk takers," there is no
reason to gamble on the ingenuity of groups such as EMRCET.

 Given the fact that their products are placed so close to the body,
manufacturers of HMDs and electromagnetic tracking devices should be
particularly mindful of products liability issues. Although this article
focuses on electromagnetic tracking devices, it should be stressed that
both AMLCD HMDs (having high energy backlights) and CRT HMDs may actually
produce higher density EMF fields than electromagnetic tracking devices.

 A Hz is equivalent to one cycle per second.

 Although IEEE C95.1-199Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure
to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz" is a step in
the right direction, even the IEEE suggests that further research be
conducted.  See "Research Needs in Health Effects of Power Frequency
Electric and Magnetic Fields", IEEE U.S. Activities Board Entity Position
Statement (1991).

KEEPING IN TOUCH: EMINENT MAIL

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Nobody talks of email these days. It is mostly a given for all of us
here in the IT world. DATAQUEST decided to see how corporate users are
taking to this area of communications. Some interesting findings
emerged. Read on:

Do you have email access for most employees?

Yes: 76%
No : 24%

Getting connected through computers is the done thing for more than
three quarters of the people surveyed. The next logical step could
easily be e-commerce. Digital cash? What makes email desirable?

Low cost   16%
Error free 44%
Fast       40%

Email is not sought out because of price factor alone. Corporates are
needing faster and faultless communication transmissions every day, and
that is clearly what email seems to mean to them.

Has Internet furthered email proliferation?

Yes   32%
No    20
Maybe 48%

Almost half the people surveyed are not very sure about the benefits of
the Internet. However, a third of users surveyed feel that the Internet
is a good thing for boosting email. Source: Tele-survey conducted in
Delhi by ESSKAY Enterprises.

KEEPING IN TOUCH: DATANUGGETS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Being in the business of journalism has its own pits ad falls.
Especially in the area of IT, with its heavily laden jargonesque.

Recently, there was this piece posted on the Net by some one who has
been afflicted by a spate of press releases from IT majors. A sample of
what is said and what it actually means:

Advanced design: Most of our own people don't have a clue on how it
works either; All new: Parts not interchangeable with existing models;
Automatic: You can not repair it yourself; and Breakthrough: We finally
figured out how to sell it. And talking of breakthroughs, there is this
little incident about the shades of reality at press meets. Recently, at
a gathering of press people recently, for the launch of a leading
company's telecom product, all the invitees were flummoxed. The reason
was that when the time came for the unveiling of the actual product,
there was so much light and smoke and sound that at the end of the whole
show a very strange, though expected, thing happened. Unable to witness
the product, or the video, or the presenters themselves, the august
assembly took recourse to the only enticement left. And that was the
profuse champagne on call. Quite a bubbly conference, it turned out to
be.

Many would be pardoned today to think that networks are now old hat.

There is hardly any office set up, regardless of size and complexity of
the operation, that does not have a network of sorts to boast of. And
with this kind of proliferation, small wonder then there is a
simultaneous rise in the requirement of the services of network
administrators and managers. The present book under review-- Novell's
Guide to NetWare 3.12 Networks--is an effort in the direction of
familairizing and guiding network managers and users on how to get the
best out of their systems. The book comes with a lot of easy references
called, Fast Track notes, which are very useful for any person who is
pressed for time and requires immediate help on the very pertinent
problem that he may have. Also, the book has all the necessary tutorials
to enable the setting up of the network, upgrading earlier ones and also
maintaining and troubleshooting indicators. The book has a systematic
sequencing of chapters and within each of these there are a lot of easy
references and text which the reader can understand as per the
requirements of the task at hand. Not confining itself to mere
technicalities, the book follows a reader friendly layout in its
treatment of the topic, and to this end has a lot of discussions on the
real life situations that one might face in the networked enterprise.

With topics like data passing schemes, network security, administering
techniques and the like, this guide to the Novell Network is a easy and
useful help book for the many IT stalwarts out there.

BANKING ON IT: JV SHETTY

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

After a fruitful career spanning various top management posts in banks
like UBI, CBI, JV Shetty recently retired as the CMD of Canara Bank. One
of the most technology-friendly banks in India, Canara Bank's deposits
are in the region of Rs 26,000 crore, with a net profit of Rs 250 crore.

A techno-savvy banker, Shetty recently appointed as Director of the
Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), an autonomous body with
the Governor of RBI as its Chairman. This body--which conducts
recruitment test for the banking sector and attests almost 40 lakh
people every year--the world's largest testing organization. Shetty
spoke to Latha Kuttappan and Sindhu Raj of DATAQUEST on a variety of
topics related to IT and banking. Excerpts:

In your new capacity, you are going to push for computerization in
Indian banks using the same as you did in Canara Bank?

I can do it in my individual capacity. However, it will be the
prerogative of the banks to draw up their plans. I certainly believe
that it is the level of technology that decides who is going to be the
leader tomorrow. So, it is in the interest of the banks to take IT
seriously.

How did computerization in Canara Bank come about?

The bank already had introduced computerization and traditional Advanced
Ledger Posting Machines (ALPMs) which used outdated PCs and obsolete
technology. But now, we are only going in for state-of-the-art
technology. When our largest branch (Delhi, Parliament street) was
automated, the software was developed by the Canara Bank team and
Infosys. What we developed there was for 132 activities. Banks abroad
have limited operations. So the software developed by foreign companies
take a long time to customize and runs into problems. As a result you
loose the lead time in overtaking competitors.

When will Canara Bank go online with live transactions?

Bangalore and Delhi are already operational. We are waiting for P
Chidambaram, Finance Minister, who has agreed to inaugurate the first
networked public sector bank. We have introduced CashPoints (ATMs) as a
part of our customer service scheme. Out of 80 branches in Bangalore, if
10 can be put up as ATMs, it will be good. Since major frauds have taken
place, it is better to go on a pilot basis and develop a good audit
system first.

Many banks are complaining about lack of funds for computerization. Is
this true?

I don't see why banks should complain about lack of funds. It is a
question of investments and returns. One can't wait for returns first.

For those banks that are running at a loss, the World Bank has come
forward to finance for technical upgradation programs.

Where do Indian banks stand in compared to foreign banks?

Indian Banks will definitely catch up. In terms of marketing,
competency, expertise, and a variety of other functional abilities, we
are second to none. What we lack is motivation and training. Our front
desk has poor customer service. We are developing a new scheme where we
intend putting well-trained and well-informed probationary officers at
the front desk. In addition to this, if an attitudinal change sets in,
other banks will not be able to match us. Our advantage lies in physical
presence. We are in almost all districts with 2,200 branches spread
across the country. Our deposit base is more stable and dependable than
foreign banks. The key area in the future, I believe, is treasury
management. The niche areas for the twenty-first century will be
investment, training, forex, and project appraisals.

VIGNETTE SPOTLIGHT: NEELAM DHAWAN, VP (DISTRIBUTION), TISL

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

In an industry where changing jobs has become more the rule than the
exception, Neelam Dhawan stands out as an exemplanary exception. The
lady has moved after spending 14 long years in HCL HP, where she was GM
(Marketing), to TISL as VP (Distribution). This is the first job change
she has made after joining HCL straight from college in 1982. This
sudden move came after she was tipped to take over as the head of HCL
Global Alliances, the newly formed HCL Group entity.

Born and brought up in Delhi, Dhawan did her schooling from Convent of
Jesus and Mary, and then went on to secure her degree in economics from
St Stephens College. Armed with a Management degree from Delhi
University's Faculty of Management Studies, she failed to find favour
with Hindustan Lever and Asian Paints as they refused to take women in
marketing. Not willing to settle for the post of a "glorified clerk," as
her brother called the job offer she received from ANZ Grindlays, she
joined HCL.

After training, she was made incharge of the northern region sales where
she remained till 1985. Next, she took over as the Assistant Product
Manager and became a part of the team which was directly involved in the
launch of Busybee systems. In 1995, she became the GM (Marketing).

Despite enormous work pressure, Dhawan prefers a slow pace of life. She
loves travelling, and dreams of going on a world tour, "an undefined
holiday" as she puts it, once she retires. She also plans to resume her
work in Mother Teresa's orphanage where she used to go and help during
her college days. But at the moment, with two young daughters and the
demands of her new job, she still has a lot more to accomplish before
she can even think of retirement.

VIGNETTE SPOTLIGHT: S RAMADORAI

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

"Never let problems overcome you. Meet them head-on!" This statement
comes from S Ramadorai, the newly appointed CEO of TCS. During his
24-years tenure in the company, he has held many responsible posts. He
was part of the top management hierarchy and played a leading role in
building up the company as a global software solutions provider.

Apart from his job, he is an important figure in the IT industry. He has
held several offices including that of Vice Chairman of the Mumbai
Chapter of IEEE Computer Society, Chairman of the Mumbai Chapter of Unix
Forum, and Vice Chairman of INDUNIX. Apart from this, he is a Director
on the board of Tata Elxsi.

A highly qualified person, Ramadorai holds a Bachelors degree in physics
from Delhi University, an engineering degree in electronics and telecom
from the Indian Institute of Science, and a Masters degree in computer
science from the University of California. In 1993, he went to the MIT
Sloan School of Management for the Senior Executive Development Program.

A hectic work schedule does not allow Ramadorai to pursue many hobbies.

Reading and music provide him the much needed respite from his busy
lifestyle. A connoisseur of South Indian fare, Ramadorai prefers Indian
food "any day to the continental western dishes." Luckily for him, his
wife, is an excellent cook. She is Vice Principal at Bombay
International School and is also a classical singer. His 21-years old
son has just completed his graduation in the US and is now proceeding to
the Cambridge University to pursue his MPhil.

A contented man, Ramadorai has spent several years in the IT industry.

He strongly believes in team work. According to him, working in a group
towards a common goal is very helpful and necessary. "The team spirit is
very necessary to become successful."

THE THEORY OF INCREASING RETURNS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Everybody seems to be praising it, but it is imperative that we examine
the drawbacks of this system.

Economists have a theory of diminishing returns which essentially means
that the more you sell the harder it gets. In the software development
field, something that is the exact anti-thesis of this principle is at
work. Dubbed the theory of increasing returns, this essentially states
that the more you sell, the easier it gets.

This theory has been much acclaimed by many people who sadly fail to
realize that this is not exactly praiseworthy because it rests on two
crutches--virtual monopolies and forced standards--and a crutch, no
matter how powerful, is unsightly. About the only good effect it has is
that it acts as an aphrodisiac for established players who control the
industry.

If you care to examine matters in detail, you will realize that it is
not technology but the virtual monopoly of players like Microsoft that
forms the bedrock of the industry. This virtual monopoly is achieved by
forcing standards on the user and the developer industry, and ensuring
that over a period of time they are generally tied down to that
standard.

I do not grudge the apparent advantage that companies like Microsoft,
Netscape, and Sun have due to their clout in the OS/applications,
browser market, and Internet development market respectively. What I'm
worried about is the fact that this sort of a virtual monopoly cripples
technological advances. Thanks to the success of Win95, the penetration
of Mac has been curbed and most users will never realize its powers.

Another problem is that this also ties people to standards. The
dominance of Win95 essentially means that users and developers will find
that it is impossible to migrate to some other platform like the Mac. In
addition to this, developers are forced to develop for a particular
platform because it is more prominent. Some may claim that a variant of
Darwin's survival of the fittest theory is at work, but the point I'm
trying to make is that the fittest product is perhaps not the best for
the user.

The monopoly and standards issue hurts everybody, even its very
proponents. For example, Win95 would have been a much stable product had
it been engineered from the ground up, like Windows NT. But sadly,
Microsoft was tied to its own outdated DOS and Win 3.1 standards, and
because of this, in spite of its best efforts, Win95 falls short of the
mark.

The Increasing returns theory rests on two crutches, Virtual
monopoly and forced standards

RoyalEDGE

Tell me now, do you still find the theory of increasing returns
laudable? Shouldn't something like the software industry, which drives
all our lives to a large extent today, and is expected to form the
foundation of living in the near future, be based on better principles?

Should we worship a principle that ties us down to the shoddiness of the
past, curbs innovation, and forces users and developers alike?

No. Because the increasing returns theory is the shame of our realm. The
relationship between this theory and the software industry is similar to
the relationship between a junkie and his heroin--he may praise it for
the high and the happiness it provides, but it is a crutch,
nevertheless.

Dr RoyalE has a PhD from SHINE--The Sherlock Holmes Institute for Noble
Eminence.

DATA STOCKSTOCK MARKET UPDATE (22 AUGUST-7 SEPTEMBER)

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

The bearish mood of the markets failed to be substantially affected by
the expectations of some sops for the capital markets from the Finance
Minister. The markets which closed at 3406 on 21 August rose by just 102
points to reach 3508 at the end of business hours on 6 September. The US
attack on Iraq and fears of higher oil prices in India also affected the
sentiments. Due to Telecom Scam involving the former Communication
Minister Sukh Ram, the political scenario was also disquieting while
CMIE reported that industrial production grew by only 5 percent in the
first quarter of 1996-97 as compared to a healthy growth of 23 percent
in the corresponding quarter last year. The World Bank's fears of slower
growth in India due to infrastructural bottlenecks, and some
recommendations by FIIs in key counters like SBI also dampened this
response. Whether the current upward move will withstand some of the
negative news filtering into the markets remains to be seen in the
coming weeks. Chances of this, however, remain dim in the current
context in any case, the market is likely to come down in the near
future.

IT stocks were reasonably stable and some stocks like HCL HP and Zenith
gained ground. Mastek reported a poor year with a relatively slow sales
growth of 33 percent to reach 28.79 crore. Profitability was a casualty
led by lower margins on operations and higher interest costs. PAT was in
fact lower by nearly 4 percent despite the growth in sales over the
previous year and stood at a little over Rs 4 crore. Post results
announcement, the share quotes at its 52 week low. PCL's results were
also not very heartening. For the six-month period ended 30 June, PCL
reported sales of 297.20 crore, up 29 percent from the previous period.

Operating margins were down by 0.7 percent from the previous period's
8.8 percent. PAT was Rs 15.75 crore, up only 19 percent over the last
half's figure. The top losers were Mastek, Digital World, and Nexus
Software. Major gainers included Hinditron Informatics, Zenith
Computers, and International Computers.

UNIX ABOUND: A REPORT ON THE SCO FORUM 96

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

A report on the SCO Forum 96--one of the most popular Unix events in the
world. Held at the UCSC campus, it had its fair share of fun and
business.

It was a veritable treat. Set amidst the verdant redwood trees at the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) campus, it was a Unix feast
that lasted for five Californian summer days. Santa Cruz Operation Inc.,
(SCO) celebrated its tenth annual Unix event, SCO Forum 96, this year.

Hosted by SCO, the event was part-sponsored by leading IT companies like
Intel, IBM, Oracle, Compaq, and Unisys. The event was attended by over
2000 people: developers, resellers, OEMs, consultants, academicians, and
the press from all over the world who had converged at the campus to
exchange notes on the trends in the Unix world in particular, and the IT
industry in general. The best of minds met here and discussed the future
of the computing industry.

A host of luminaries delivered the keynote speeches at the Quarry'
sessions in the morning. They included Alok Mohan, President and CEO,
SCO; Doug Michels, Executive VP, Chief Technology Officer, and Founder,
SCO; Dick Watts, VP and GM HP, and the irrepressible Scott McNealy,
President and CEO, Sun Microsystems. McNealy's presence was intriguing
to many, since Sun Microsystems is SCO's arch rival in the Unix market.

But then the event was for the Unix industry as a whole. Nevertheless,
Scott chose to give his own reasons. A Top 10:

A Network Computer (NC) debate titled Will The Network Computer Break
the Windows Monopoly?' was held. One of the most influential computer
journalists in America, David Coursey, hosted the event and the
participants were Hermasn Hauser, Founder of Acorn Computer and Chairman
of NChannel, Philippe Kahn, Co-founder and Chairman of Starfish
Software, Zvi Alon, President and CEO of NetManage Inc., and Philip
Johnson, Director of Server Operating Environments at IDC. Kahn and
Hauser argued in favor of the network computer. After a heated debate,
the wind blew in favour of network computing and the impact of Internet
on the computing model.

In addition to the debate, a special NC pavilion was set up for
developers to display their information appliances'. More than a dozen
NC makers, including Sun Microsystems, HDS, Wyse Technology, and Diba
displayed their NCs for the first time in public.

Parallel conference sessions were held in three streams: Engineering,
systems administration, and business. These sessions included everything
from developing Windows-friendly client server applications to selling
better Internet solutions talks on the internals of Gemini (SCO's
next-generation Unix systems project).

Free Unix

In a move that empowers students, educators, and Unix system enthusiasts
with free access to the world's most popular business computing
environment, SCO announced plans to provide a free license to use its
popular Unix systems, including SCO OpenServer and SCO UnixWare to
anyone in the world who wants to use them for educational purposes and
understanding of Unix systems. The bold move has far-reaching
implications for the future of Unix platform and marks the public debut
of SCO's stewardship of the Unix system.

Mohan said, "This is only the second time in Unix's 25-year history that
the owner of the technology has made this offer. The last time this
happened, a $ 60-billion industry was born."

The Unix system was in its infancy when AT&T Bell Labs gave it free to
colleges and universities to help R&D projects. Soon, thousands of
students learnt to program on Unix systems. After graduation, they took
their knowledge into the corporate world, building a $ 60-billion
industry. The legacy of AT&T's gift to universities includes the
Internet, WWW, multiprocessing, and much more. "SCO believes it is time
to return the favor," said Mohan, "and deliver the result of more than
20 years of technical innovation back to educators and students
worldwide."

Road To Next-generation Unix

SCO has developed a comprehensive roadmap and product strategy for Unix
system users and developers to quickly and easily leverage the
advancements that SCO is making for small, medium, and enterprise-class
environments. The SCO Gemini project is the cornerstone of this
activity. Gemini' is the code-name of a SCO engineering project that
will deliver next-generation Unix systems from the company. Gemini' is
the consolidation of the SCO Openserver and SCO Unixware product lines
with significant enhancements to meet the demands for a new generation
of distributed computing environment. It is also the SCO platform which
will provide the easiest path to 3-Dimensional Architecture (3DA)--the
forthcoming 64-bit Unix system being co-developed by SCO and HP for the
Intel Merced processor.

The Unix system technology being jointly developed by HP and SCO will
encompass a common set of APIs and will serve as the basis or engine'
for the next-generation Unix operating environments that will be offered
by the two companies. Optimized for the Intel IA 64-bit Merced
microprocessor and based on an advanced 3DA, the Unix system will
provide a single development and porting target for 32-bit and 64-bit
applications, enabling OEMs and ISVs to accelerate their delivery of a
wide range of innovative customer solutions.

Moving forward aggressively with their joint development agenda, HP and
SCO announced the availability of the initial API specification of their
next-generation 64/32-bit Unix systems for review by strategic software
developers and systems suppliers. Ensuring that the customers can take
advantage of advanced 32-bit and 64-bit computing is a priority for both
companies.

Endorsements And Partnerships

There were a series of vendor endorsement announcements and strategic
partnerships. IBM announced support for SCO Internet strategy by
delivering its DB2 database for the SCO OpenServer platform ahead of
schedule. IBM also announced that its Net.Data product will beta this
month providing interactive Web access from the SCO OpenServer platform
to many data sources.

IBM Net.Data delivers Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) to data stored
in both IBM and other databases, enabling users on the Internet and
intranet to access a variety of data sources with any Web browser.

In an industry first, Oracle and SCO demonstrated Oracle7 Parallel
Server running the SCO Unixware 2.1 system across Intel-processor-based
hardware servers. The hardware cluster included servers from Compaq,
Digital, IBM, and Unisys, communicating with the same Oracle7 database
residing on a CLARiiON disk array. The demonstration holds significance
since it was the first time a fail-over' high-performance cluster
solution running on Intel-processor-based hardware from numerous vendors
was shown to be a viable solution.

"Only SCO Unixware and Oracle7 Parallel Server can transparently combine
systems from different hardware manufactures into a single, high
availability cluster," said Mike Shelton, SCO's VP, Enterprise
Solutions. "This is a compelling example of SCO Unixware providing a
unified operating system for Intel-based systems," he said.

Propelled by a series of major developments, SCO Unixware continued its
fast-track into the enterprise marketplace. In four months, leading
computer companies (Compaq, Data General, Fujitsu, Intel, NCR, Olivetti,
Siemens Nixdorf, Unisys) and ISVs established SCO Unixware as the Unix
operating system of choice for Intel-processor-based volume enterprise
servers. Newer OEMs are committing to shipping SCO Unixware with their
enterprise servers. SCO calls this the Big E Initiative.

These vendors can focus more resources on developing value-added
technologies and more innovative solutions. ISVs benefit because they
can create a single binary source code for multiple hardware platforms.

This enables them to dramatically cut their development costs while
providing their customers with a clear path to the future. The reduced
R&D costs will enable greater innovation and strengthen the entire
enterprise computing market. Among these ISVs are PeopleSoft, Micro
Focus, Tivoli, Oracle, and IBM.

SCO has formed development partnerships for Gemini. These partnerships
include an alliance between SCO, Data General, ICL, and HAL to provide
ccNUMA (cache coherent Non-Uniform Memory Architecture) capability and
price/performance. SCO has also formed a strategic relationship with
Unisys that includes cooperative development to build large system
scalability and capability for Unixware.

SCO continues to gain momentum in the middleware software segment. Some
of the products now available with SCO Unixware include transaction
processing software from NCR (Top End), BEA Systems (Tuxedo), and SNI
(OpenUTM). Additionally, Unisys and SNI are providing their mainframe
communication suites. Finally, leading-edge Object Request Brokers
(ORBs) are also available from ICL (DAIS) and IONA Technologies (Orbix).

Internet Strategy And NC/OS

SCO announced addition of new components to the SCO Internet Family,
featuring the availability of Netscape's FastTrack Server, the Oracle
WebServer, the Oracle PowerBrowser, standalone PPP from Morning Star
Technologies, the Internet-ready version of SCO TermVision, and the
recently unveiled SCO Network Client/Operating System (NC/OS) product.

In addition, SCO outlined its plans for the new components slated for
version 2.0 of the SCO Internet Family.

SCO also announced the immediate OEM availability of its NC/OS, the
first low cost, small footprint software designed specifically to
provide OEMs with a reliable, time-to-market solution for developing NCs
on standard Intel-processor-based hardware.

The SCO NC/OS technology combines a small 1.5 MB footprint Unix
operating system, TCP/IP networking, with Netscape Navigator client
software, and Java software to provide an open NC operating system that
can run on Intel hardware. Building on its expertise in Unix operating
systems, communication, and Internet technology, SCO is working with
industry leaders to provide this client solution for networked end-users
to access their intranet, Internet, and enterprise applications.

Client Integration

Setting the agenda for the Windows to Unix system integration market,
SCO unveiled three new members of the SCO Vision family--SCO VisionFS,
SCO XVision Eclipse, and SCO SQL/Retriever 4. The new cross-platform
products strengthen SCO's commitment to its Windows integration
strategy, enabling organizations to fully utilize the power and
reliability of Unix servers without sacrificing their investments in
Windows PCs. In addition to being re-engineered for 32-bit platforms,
the SCO Vision family is now geared to meet the demands of mobile users
and to cut costs of managing large groups of PCs. New, reduced prices
provide users a cost-effective solution for integrating Windows PCs to
Unix servers.

The move to provide free Unix licenses for educational, non-professional
use, highlights SCO's aggressive stewardship of the Unix system
technology. SCO's goals for the Unix systems are to deliver into a
dramatically higher-volume market for all Unix customers; extend the
lead in enterprise-class and Small and Medium Business (SMB)
environments through advances in technology; provide SCO customers,
OEMs, and ISVs with a direct path to next-generation Unix Systems; and
extend the expertise in key innovative areas such as Internet, intranet,
Windows-to-Unix integration, and minicomputer RAS capabilities.

DATA VANE: SAMSUNG DEVELOPS 14" TFT-LCD MONITOR

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Samsung Electronics has announced that they have completed development
of a 14-inch thin-film transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD)
monitor that can replace the conventional cathode-ray-type (CRT). Until
now, the use of TFT-LCDs has been restricted to notebooks and medical
imaging machines, but technology advances have resulted in later
versions with very high picture quality.

The new TFT-LCD monitor weighs only 3 kilograms, one tenth the weight of
an average CRT monitor. It is only 5 cm thick, which means it can be
installed in much smaller space than the conventional monitors. This
feature alone is expected to help revolutionize the office of the
future.

SEC's recent R&D success puts the company's LCD technology on a par with
the world's best. The new monitor offers a maximum definition of 1,024 x
768, the same picture quality as a 17-inch CRT monitor. It features
SEC's unique multisync digital graphics processor, which can support
both VGA (640x480) and Super VGA (800x600) systems. The TFT-LCD monitor
can be directly connected, without the need of a separate graphics card,
to PCs now using a CRT monitor.

Brightness is 25 percent more than in a CRT monitor, a major improvement
over other notebook screens. The lightness-darkness ratio is 300:1, and
the device can reproduce 260,000 different color shades. Because of
these features, the new 14-inch TFT-LCD monitor by SEC is expected to
occupy a leading position in the next-generation flat display market.

DATA VANE: SRAM MODULE TO FEATURE BUILT-IN BATTERY MONITOR & CPU

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Dallas Semiconductor has announced a new line of surface-mount NV SRAM
modules that feature a built-in battery monitor, built-in CPU reset, and
reduced power consumption. Initial DS13-Series products include the
DS1330 (32k x 8), DS1345 (128k x 8) and DS1350 (512k x 8). Each DS13xx
module contains a sophisticated battery monitor that periodically checks
the voltage of the module's internal lithium battery.

The DS13-Series products offer 10 years of data retention at 25 degrees
Celsius. Companies building products with service lives greater than 10
years can now design their systems to keep close tabs on remaining
battery capacity over the years.

Manufacturers building products intended for high-temperature
environments, where data-retention life can be substantially less than
10 years, will likewise benefit from using a DS13-Series NV SRAM. In
addition to the battery monitor, the DS13-Series devices have a built-in
CPU reset function that serves as both a power-on reset during system
power-up and a power-fail reset during system power-down.

A BROAD VISION, INDEED

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

BroadVision may help provide a good boost to e-commerce--and probably
extend it.

Napoleon had said that an army marches on its stomach. Similarly, a
corporation marches on its sales people who maintain contact with
customers on a regular basis and perform the vital task of ensuring that
products are sold--for, after all has been said and done, it is not
technology but personal relationships that help foster growth.

Till now, technology was not of much help, except probably in helping
you print labels for a direct marketing exercise or to help you look
through a database that has a few marketing statistics. But now a
company called BroadVision <http://www.broadvision.com> is helping
provide what marketing gurus have always known to be of
essence--contact, and a one-to-one relationship.

BroadVision's application system--called One-To-One--is less an
application system and more a marketing philosophy based on the strategy
described by Don Peppers and Martha Rogers in the book The One-To-One
Future. This marketing philosophy is extensively centered around the
customer--it actually helps provide some sense to the much misused
statement the customer is king--and revolves entirely around his
preferences, likes, and dislikes.

The beauty of the whole thing is that BroadVision has realized the most
important factor--the human factor--in pushing a product. While most
people are arguing about the viability of e-commerce and determining the
drivers for ensuring its success like security considerations,
BroadVision has placed e-commerce where it rightfully belongs--at the
bottom of the chain. As the BroadVision FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
guide puts it, expecting to profit from making e-commerce a reality is
similar to expecting to turning in good business merely by buying a new
cash register. A medium for facilitating active transactions is what is
called for instead of merely a medium that ensures that you can pay
without paper money or a cheque book.

To understand the real difference BroadVision makes both to the merchant
and the buyer, consider a scenario in which a hypothetical dress
merchant has a web site which can be used by websurfers to view the
latest apparels. People will login nineteen to a dozen and go through
the various clothes on display, and probably decide to buy some of them.

While the shop owner has a way of determining which goods move faster
than the others by consulting his books, he has no way of knowing who
prefers what. He is forced to provide exactly the same interface to
every person simply because he does not have any idea about that
individual's preferences.

Now, assume that he had BroadVision. This empowers him with the ability
to determine what a particular user prefers and then providing him with
an interface that is restricted to his context. For example, if a
particular person normally picks up only jeans and T-shirts, he can be
presented with an interface that only offers details about jeans and
T-shirts. This provides greater focus both to the vendor and the user or
buyer. This gives the user a strange sense of belonging, simply because
his preferences are recognized, and this, in turn, psychologically
affects the buying decision.

Further refinement is also possible. For example, if a person
essentially prefers to buy blue denims in the price range of Rs
1,000-1,500, he can be intimated about fresh stock as and when it
arrives. The shop owner can also keep track of the number of items that
have been purchased by a particular person and offer him a good discount
because he has just bought his twentieth shirt this year. This helps
further customer loyalty. Essentially, this scenario is the foundation
stone of the one-to-one philosophy which believes that a great business
is built one customer at a time and each customer is crucial to the
success of an enterprise. BroadVision's philosophy is indeed a welcome
extension to the concept of tailor-made solutions.

One thing to note in this case is that e-commerce is not exactly a
necessity because payment can be made on receipt of goods, though, of
course, it would have been helpful to an extent. But understanding your
customer and his needs, as always, is. Come to think of it, it is really
amazing what a little rule-based reasoning can do. BroadVision, which
already uses rule-based reasoning is contemplating licensing a
personalization algorithm from Firefly, a company which uses such an
algorithm to identify user trends and personal tastes.

This idea is indeed a good one, but one item that could mar it is the
issue of privacy, an issue that most people take quite seriously--for
example, a computer consultant in Oregon paid the state $ 222 for its
complete motor vehicles data base, which he then posted to a Web site,
prompting charges of privacy violations from people who complained that
he had invaded their privacy because anybody can trace, from an Oregon
number plate, the vehicle owner's name, address, birth date, driver's
license number, and title information. But BroadVision's philosophy
mirrors what Professor Anne Wells Branscomb mentions in her book Who
Owns Information--consumers will be willing to provide information about
themselves provided they get something in return for that information.

And in this case, after providing his personal information, the person
does get something in return, namely an environment that is tailored to
his needs.

Surely, this would have pleased Napoleon.

Expecting to profit from making e-commerce a reality is similar to
expecting to turning in good business merely by buying a new cash
register.

CORPORATE COMPUTING - ROLLING OUT WITH IT

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

By Our Correspondent in Delhi

Apollo Tyres Ltd (ATL) was set up in 1977-78. As the manufacturing
technology--based on guidance from General Cars of USA--was not suitable
for Indian roads, the company went into red and incurred cumulative
losses of Rs 27.80 crore in 1982. Two years later, the company wiped out
its accumulated losses and recorded a profit of Rs 57 lakh. Since then,
ATL has never looked back. In the fiscal year 1990-91, the company
registered a turnover of Rs 190 crore. Growing six-fold, the company
added Rs 1200 crore to its kitty by 1995-96. This turnaround--largely
due to the vision of the Chairman and MD, Onkar Singh Kanwar--was
accompanied with significant improvements and investments in the usage
and adoption of IT.

The Technology Roadmap

In the last two years, ATL underwent massive restructuring. The main
objective of the radical transition was to use information as a tool for
decision-making. Besides, with the increase in corporate size, it wanted
information technology to address certain business needs. Primary among
them being increasing competition, rising customer expectations,
reducing scrap and rework, economizing on the cost of production, and
improving process capability and yield. While doing all this,
cost-effectiveness still remained the buzzword.

Jumping Onto The Client Server Bandwagon

Initially, the use of IT was minimal. It was restricted to payroll
systems, accounting packages, and store management systems. All the
locations were equipped with single-user PCs which were used on the
batch processing mode. The software was developed in-house on Foxpro
with Oracle as the RDBMS.

But as the company grew, so did the needs. To successfully address these
needs, it was important that information was integrated. To whit, the
sales and the production department had to be synergized, thereby
developing an enterprise-wide network. And for the same, climbing onto
the client server bus seemed to be the wisest thing to do. Instead of
developing the system in-house, the company acquired MARSHAL, the
Enterprise Management System (EMS) from Madras-based Ramco Systems Ltd
on the Windows NT, Windows SQL server platform. "We realized software
development was not our forte and hence getting a standard package would
save much of our time and effort," says Ashok Kumar Wahi, General
Manager (Information Systems and Human Resources), ATL. The company
chose MARSHAL over the internationally acclaimed EMS packages from SAP,
Baan, and Avalon due to its cost-effectiveness and rich features.

This system is being implemented in three phases. In the first phase,
accounts payable, human resources and payroll, general ledger, and
purchase and inventory have been integrated. In the second phase, which
would be complete by the end of April 1997, Supply Purchase Control
(SPC) and Supply Quality Control (SQC), production, and maintenance
management systems would be integrated. In the third and the final
phase, the rest of the modules like fixed assets, management accounting,
and sales will be integrated.

Preceding the integration of the modules, a business analyst surveyed
the company's operations and outlined the business needs which had to be
addressed by information technology. These included identification of
the training requirements, installation of the base product, master data
creation, development and testing of product extensions, trial run
module wise, and the integration and installation of the product
extensions. "When all the modules have been integrated, a trial run of
the EMS would be performed," informs Wahi. Today, everything in the
company has been standardized on the Windows platform. "We are a total
Windows company," says Wahi. The company also uses MS Office for Office
Automation and MS Mail for groupware.

Communicating For Better Integration

For better integration of information, it was important that the various
locations of the company were also connected. The company's network
consists of its manufacturing locations in Perambra and Kalamassery in
Cochin, Limda in Gujarat, and a recently opened plant in Pune. Besides
these manufacturing locations, the marketing network consists of four
zonal marketing offices located in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, and
Calcutta. All these zonal offices together govern the working of the 100
marketing locations of the company. The Head Office (HO) and the various
offices within Delhi also had to be brought under the communications
network. Far as Roi is conecerned, as compared to quantitative returns,
qualitative returns have been more

To achieve connectivity while being cost-effective, the company decided
to adopt a simple model under which only their prime locations are on a
WAN. Their five offices, including their HO in Delhi, boasts of 20 to
50-node LAN connectivity, while the factories at Baroda and Cochin claim
75-node connectivity each. Further, all these locations have been
connected by a 64 Kbps leased line from DoT. Besides these, the Pune
factory enjoys a 20-node connectivity.

The Marketing Network

While the production side and the offices in Delhi are equipped with a
WAN, the same is not true for the marketing locations of the company. It
is interesting to note that the marketing function, which can benefit
most from a WAN, is devoid of this facility in ATL. The four zonal
offices have five-node LAN connectivity each, while the 100 marketing
offices around the country still operate with single-user PCs. These
locations use the dial-up formula equipped with modems for connecting to
their zonal and head offices. "Our product being a non-perishable
product, promptness in this segment is not required," justifies Wahi.

Besides in the eight locations where ICnet is available, connection from
the ICnet has been acquired. While the locations operate on basic stock
accounting packages, the logistics have been centralized at the HO and a
daily report from each of the locations is sent to the HO.

On the hardware front, while the Proliant 5000 servers form the backbone
of the network, at the front-end they are still operating on 486/DX2
machines from Compaq, Dell, and Acer. To save on costs, the company
re-installed their existing 286 and 386 machines into their marketing
locations all across the country.

The Shop Floor Scene

IT deployment and penetration does not confine itself to post-production
but to the pre-market cycles as well. An efficient, across the board IT
usage has to be worked out from the bottom up.

All efforts of the company would have been of no avail, if the use of IT
had not been extended to the shop floor. To this end, ATL went in for an
extension of the restructuring paradigm, right down to the shop floor.

Here, besides the EMS, the factories utilize certain packages specific
to tyre manufacturing. Typical to any manufacturing industry, the use of
IT at the shop-floor level starts from the use of a process control
system. This means that the very innards of the system--be it design,
testing, or prototyping--have to be attuned to the corporate philosophy.

One of the most important aspect of tyre manufacturing is the design.

The product portfolio of the company contains an assortment of tyres for
passenger cars, heavy vehicle like trucks and tractors, two wheelers,
and even animal-driven vehicles. The sheer variety and profusion of the
is an inventory controller's nightmare. In ATL, each tyre is designed
using the Finite Element Analysis package. This helps in bringing out
workable and relevant decisions along-with the entire bill of materials
and the process support, all at the click of a button, and with enough
accurate details to satisfy the most demanding of customers and the most
fluid of markets. To further add value to the data collected, this
system has been interfaced with the help of MARSHAL for maintenance
management. The data collected serves as a record for preventive
maintenance management and calculating the mean time between failures.

All this is intended to manage maintenance and not merely control it.

Dividends From IT

The massive restructuring has been accrued with an investment of Rs 4.02
crore. But what has been the return on investment for the company? "As
far as return on investment is concerned, as compared to the
quantitative returns, the qualitative returns have been more," says
Wahi. In qualitative terms, the implementation of MARSHAL has resulted
in better co-ordination and streamlining of the activities between
far-flung plants and the HO. With the communication system in place, the
HO is well-informed of the daily stock situation in the factories and
plants.

The company has also been able to reduce the inventory cycle time.

Another benefit which ATL has accrued consequent to reengineering has
been the flexibility, adaptability, and quickness in operations, as
access to all relevant information has made quick decision-making
possible. Today, strategies are validated and deployed across the entire
company, instead of in small pockets. Besides, simultaneous updation of
information has helped ATL employees to take decisions based on present
events and not on past records. At ATL, information is being used more
as a decision-making tool rather than a management tool.

Apart from these qualitative benefits, the most significant and visible
quantitative benefit has been in terms of reduced claims on batches. The
company has managed to reduce its claims to less than half a percent.

Claims are vital to a tyre manufacturing company as high claims on
batches can at times wipe out the entire profit. However, now with the
EMS in place, it has become easier to trace the defect and the
explanation for the same.

Plans On The Anvil

The action does not end here. Though, the existing communication network
suits the current communication needs of the company, to meet the future
needs, it has worked out an extensive communications network. The
implementation of this network would not only connect its remaining
factories, but would also cover the sales depots. With this, the company
will achieve better transparency across their factories and marketing
locations. Keeping up with the current trend, the company plans to equip
its employees with notebooks. Besides, ATL plans to have an Internet
server and install a video-conferencing system. The specifications for
the same and the plan of action have not been worked out as they are not
for the near future. "Though still a dream, it would not be long before
they are realized," asserts Wahi. And going by the track record of this
company, that may well be true in more than one way.

will now be distributed in India by Tata Elxsi. Wacom's line of products
include ArtPad II and UD II series graphic tablets ranging in size from
A2 to A6, and Ergonomic Puck, and Erasing UltraPens. Graphic tablets
from Wacom have the ability to sense the tilt of the pen. Depending on
the software, the amount of tilt can be used to blend colors and the
direction of the tilt to change opacity. The Erasing UltraPens have a
second sensor tip, which is like having an eraser on a pencil. The user
needs to flip the pen to erase and flip back to continue drawing. These
devices address the needs of artists and creative professionals who need
to create or manipulate images on a computer.

Datamatics Information has introduced Hayes Accura 288 message modem in
India. The data/voice/fax modem eliminates the dependence on

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: SAP OPENS NEW GATES ON THE INTERNET

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

SAP announced new versions of its R/3 software (3.1 by YE96, 4.0 by
YE97) and a business framework architecture. As a whole, these releases
are primarily marketing/development initiatives. However, 3.1 is an
Internet release providing users `open' entrance to SAP. Moreover, we
note SAP is moving toward a MSFT-centric strategy, employing MSFT's ITS,
IIS, and Explorer. As 4.0 will be unveiled late in 1997, we expect the
ability to distribute separate R/3 components, and significant added
functionality, particularly for retail organizations; this will further
challenge PeopleSoft, Oracle et al.

Bottomline: SAP's more defined Internet statement of direction will bear
fruit for users by 4Q97,

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: ORBS ON THE WEB: STRANGE EMBEDDED FELLOWS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

The complexity of Web-based applications will increase dramatically as
users integrate Java applets, OLE/ActiveX components, and back-end
services for `Live Web' applications. We believe this provides an
opportunity for ORB vendors, whose strength has been distributed
heterogeneous computing environments. However, because ORBs still lack
the services (transaction integrity, TP monitors, scalability, etc)
required for mainstream adoption, ORB functionality will be bundled into
packages, tools, etc., with proprietary extensions.

Bottomline: While ORB vendors provide messaging services that facilitate
OO-based distributed computing, the necessary services required for
large-scale adoption will not exist for at least 2 years.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: BORLAND SCALES UP WITH OEC

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Borland announced it would acquire Open Environment Corp. (OEM) for
about $ 65M. OEC's products, like the Entera high-end RPC-based
middleware and tools, will complement Borland's tool suite (Delphi,
Latte, and C++). With appropriate integration, Borland could offer
comprehensive products, enabling developers to scale from low-end C/S to
high-end applications. There are integration and management challenges
in merging the companies, but ultimately we believe the combination will
be attractive. Despite a cutthroat market with PowerBuilder 5 and Visual
Basic 5 (4Q) purporting to scale, and Forte, et al. pressuring from the
high-end. Borland is well positioned, combining an accessible front-end
with a proven, scalable back end.

Bottomline: The matching of Borland and OEQ will produce good
integration and distribution, challenging high-end and low-end C/S
tools.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: IBI'S FUSION: OUT OF FOCUS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Information Builders Inc. (IBI) steps into the multinational database
market with Fusion. While Fusion offers competitive features, it is not
likely to succeed outside of the EDA/SQL installed base. Indeed, we
believe the primary motivation of IBI is to stem attrition of its
clients to vendors such as Red Brick, Arbor, and Oracle. To make Fusion
successful, IBI must focus on developing industry-specific applications,
broadening its VAR channels, and re-tooling its skill sets to provide
Fusion integration services.

Bottomline: Fusion will be primary an installed base play, unless IBI
can aggressively deliver industry-specific applications through stronger
VAR relationships.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: NETSCAPE GETS 'PROFESSIONAL' WITH HP

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

A key component of last week's HP and Netscape (NSCP) products/sales
announcement is services. NSCP is playing catch-up in the corporate
messaging and groupware market, and while other recent announcements
(mail, directory, certificate authority) have addressed enterprise
products' shortcomings, NSCP lacks services for larger corporate
customers. Now, NSCP can leverage HP's Professional Services
Organization to comfort corporations worried about supporting,
implementing, and managing NSCP products. Another level of partnering
promises HP OpenView management of NSCP servers; leveraging this
effectively, HP could challenge Tivoli and CA solutions for Internet and
intranet management.

Bottomline: Although many details must be clarified, the services and
management coupling between HP and NSCP has a strong potential for
success.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: NETWORK INTEROPERABILITY TRIUMVIRATE

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

3Com, Bay Networks, and IBM jointly announced a network interoperability
alliance, focussed on emerging LAN/ATM switching standards (eg.,
integrated P-NNI, zero-hop routing. 802. 1Q VLANs). While implying
rudimentary interoperable solutions in heterogeneous environments
composed of these vendors, we believe users will ultimately realize
greater functional value with single-vendor backbone solutions. The
complexity of combining multiple vendors, coupled with the historic
failure of network industry partnerships to sustain long-term
collaborations (eg., Cisco/Synoptics, IBM/Chipcom), makes us skeptical
that this alliance will bear fruit.

Bottomline: Despite industry alliances' promotion of interoperable, open
solutions, users should plan on selecting a strategic vendor for
scalable switching infrastructures. However, conclusive decisions should
be delayed 9-12 months, when product delivery enables real-world
evaluations.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: NAVIGATOR WITHOUT A RUDDER?

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

In the Netscape vs Explorer browser battle, MSFT is rapidly gaining
strength as Explorer reaches technical parity with Navigator. As MSFT
embeds explorer in its OSes during the next 18 months, Navigator will
decline as a serious contender within NT and Windows intranet
environments. Netscape will be `boxed' into heterogeneous environments
and the Internet, as a delivery platform for Netscape-specific
applications. MSFT's edge will be its aggressive ActiveX push,
distribution channel, and development tool availability, as well as the
rapid movement to NT Server (and ultimately to IIS).

Bottomline: MSFT's OS-embedded Explorer strategy, supported by IIS,
ActiveX, as well as many ISVs and package vendors, will make Explorer
the browser standard for MSFT-oriented intranet environments.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: A MODELING TRIO FOR SAP

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

SAP recently extended its business process modelling directions and
engaged the support of three partners: Prof. Scheer (Aris), Intellicorp
(LiveModel), and Visio (Business Modeler). Aris offer a business process
modeling tool, supporting (near future) multiple-package vendors. It is
positioned best for `green field' BPR projects involving legacy systems.

LiveModel is SAP-specific and is most appropriate in SAP-centric
projects. Its key differentiation is support for animated walkthroughs
of `to be' designs, triggering R/3 screens and transactions. Visio is a
lower-end graphics/flowcharting tool for communicating `to be' designs
(developed with Aris or LiveModel) to a brand business audience.

Bottomline: Given SAP's recent investment in Intellicorp (14 percent
ownership), we expect LiveModel to quickly become the leading
SAP-specific product.

JUNK E-MAIL: GARBAGE IN - AND IN AND IN

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

An explosion of junk email threatens to overwhelm the Net.

When CompuServe Inc. subscribers found their electronic mailboxes
stuffed with ads last fall, the online service warned the sender--
Philadelphia-based Cyber Promotions Inc.--to stop or face a
lawsuit. The parties disagree on what happened next, but the junk email
is still coming. And Cyber Promotions President Sanford Wallace isn't a
bit apologetic: "You're doing something the whole Internet world is
telling you not to do, but we've been doing it quite successfully."
How true. Cyber Promotions says it mails up to 3 million messages and
advertisements per day for companies selling everything from videos to
vitamins (table). And that's just the start. Nobody can say precisely
how big junk email is, but Internet experts agree that the volume will
soar as more marketers discover how cheap it is. A mailing to 1 million
people would cost about $ 827,000, including postage and printing, the
Direct Marketing Assn. says. Internet advertisers can reach the same
number for the price of a local phone call plus a few hundred dollars
for time spent online.

Backlash

Even as marketers catch on to junk email, they face a backlash. Net
surfers already complain about unwanted messages, and Internet service
providers grouse that they aren't being adequately compensated. Even
some pioneers of junk email concede that there's a risk that zillions of
free and other marketing messages could overwhelm the Net. "It could be
a serious problem to the efficiency of the Internet," says Neil Albala
of Tucson, who developed a so-called bulk email loader called Floodgate
for Windows.

Like other junk-mail programs, Floodgate lets an ordinary PC blast
messages to email addresses sniffed out from online directories, World
Wide Web sites, and electronic bulletin boards. For marketers who don't
want to operate junk-mail systems themselves, services such as Cyber
Promotions will send the ads for them. A few of these services block
adult ads, but most will mail whatever a client wants.

What can consumers do to avoid the onslaught? There is no legal
prohibition against the practice, but in the Internet community the
related practice of blanketing message boards--known as spamming'--is
dealt with by cyber vigilantes. Spammers are flamed'--vilified in reply
mail. Likewise, technically-savvy email targets can turn the tables on
mailers by deluging them with thousands of flame-mail messages or by
sending email bombs' containing huge files that tie up computers for
hours. But these measures hurt service providers worse than the junk
emailers, who wind up hopping from system to system--or develop their
own domains.

Perhaps most troubling for Internet users, junk emailers are
increasingly adept at targeting them by gleaming personal information
from the Net. For example, purveyors of quack remedies might grab the
online addresses of participants in health-related newsgroups, some of
which attempt to be as private and sensitive as support groups.

The rapid expansion of targeted junk email worries privacy advocates.
"If you lack adequate privacy safeguards, you could anticipate Internet
meltdown," says Electronic Privacy Information Center Director Marc
Rotenberg. But it's unlikely that the federal government will step in to
mandate protections. Federal Trade Commission Credit Practices Associate
Director David Medine says he doesn't favor government involvement in
the issue, saying that "regulation stifles development."

Fighting Back

For now, the FTC is working with two industry groups--the Direct
Marketing Assn. and Interactive Services Assn.--on guidelines to protect
privacy in targeted emailings. "The rules are being written as we go,"
admits Interactive Services Assn. spokeswoman Sara Fitzgerald.

Irate Internet surfers are also beginning to fight software with
software. James Howard, a University of North Carolina student, is
creating a program to block unsolicited email. Says Howard: "We think
there should be technical solutions so you don't get it if you don't
want it." If such blocking systems spread, consumers and service
providers might finally be able to shut out this cyber-annoyance.

INTERNET PHONES STILL ON THE MARKET

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Marketing agents continue to push the Internet phone, declared illegal
by VSNL.

The Internet phone is making news. It allows a realtime chat between
Internet users and at the same offers voice-grade communication at an
inexpensive rate. An Internet phone call can be made with the caller
logging on to the Internet through an access provider. Both, the caller
and receiver have to be logged into the Internet and it is imperative
that both users have the identical software. The additional components
needed, apart from the PC and modem, are a sound blaster card, a
microphone, and a speaker.

Once hooked on to the Net, one can access Internet Phone facilities
provided free by over 30 companies worldwide. Initial access to the
Internet is still made over local phone lines in the dial-up mode. After
this, the call travels over the computer networks that make up the
Internet. The caller's voice travels as bits of data which are sent out
in pieces or packets to various switches and then pieced back together
at the other end of the call. The Internet call costs Rs 30 an hour,
which is much cheaper than an ISD or STD dial-up charge. Though the
Internet phone appears to be very convenient, it has some inherent
limitations.

To establish an Internet phone connection, both users must have the same
software and also be logged in at the same time. Further, the
transmission quality on these lines is very poor, almost one-fourth that
of normal lines. It is difficult to receive the communication clearly.

Moreover, transmission/reception delays are due to the slow speed of the
line.

Not every PC can have an access to Internet phone. To be able to avail
this facility, the PC must have multimedia facilities. In the West,
where the Internet culture is much more pervasive, virtually all users
will have access to the popular Internet phone facilities, but in India
this is not possible.

But this is not VSNL's main worry. VSNL is anxious that the Internet
phone will hit its ISD revenues which is its bread and butter. Hence, it
has gone ahead and banned this service in India. According to Amitabh
Kumar, Director (Operations), VSNL, "This service is not allowed in
India. To offer the Internet service, a person needs a licence. Anyone
found offering the Internet phone service will have his licence
suspended. In fact, when a person is contracted as an agent, he has to
sign an agreement which states that he will neither use or provide the
facility for voice."

Inspite of the fact that Internet phone service is banned, many
marketing agents are still selling the registration for Internet phone
services at Rs 34,000. And the main bait they use to entice customers is
the cost of the phone call which they claim is to the tune of just Re 1
for five minutes.

There are quite a few vendors who are poised to sell Internet phones and
have advertised so. Mumbai-based VocalCall which was to sell VocalTec's
Internet phones in India, had to postpone its product launch. According
to Rajnikant Parekh, Director, VocalCall, "For the time being, we have
decided not to go ahead with our plans. What VSNL has done is good if we
consider it from the Government's point of view. But can VSNL stop the
use of Internet phones? I don't think VSNL can monitor all lines,
especially the TCP/IP lines. Internet phone calls are definitely being
made." In fact, VocalCall inserted an article about its product in a
newspaper about two months ago and so far it has received more than 600
enquiries. This only goes to show that a market exists for the product.

As the popularity of the Internet increases, usage of the Internet phone
too is bound to increase. Says Vijay Mukhi, founder member of the
Internet Users Club of India, "As the number of Internetters increase,
users of the Net's telephone facilities will also proliferate. Then VSNL
will certainly have a reason to worry." And worried VSNL indeed is.

SILICON VALLEY: ROOTING FOR BILL

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

As the American economy goes through a phase of rapid growth, Silicon
Valley has announced its support for Bill Clinton.

In 1992, the endorsement of some 25 leading Silicon Valley high-tech
executives, many of them staunch Republicans, played a key role in
putting Bill Clinton into the White House. In subsequent years, Clinton
has managed to alienate himself from many of his high-tech allies. But
following a month of heavy lobbying, including several meetings with
Silicon Valley leaders, a group of 75 executives announced their support
for the President.

Clinton and Vice President Al Gore video-conferenced from the White
House to a reception in their honor at Adobe Systems to personally
accept the endorsements.Venture capitalist John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins
Caufield & Byers, a Republican, told Clinton and Gore that their group
supports the Administration on positions ranging from jobs and the
economy, to foreign trade and open markets, research and development,
and education and training.

Doerr was one of the 25 original executives supporting Clinton in 1995.
Almost all of them reaffirmed their support for the Democratic ticket.
Less than a year ago, that possibility had seemed remote, particularly
after Clinton vetoed a bill that would have made it far tougher for
lawyers to file shareholder lawsuits.

Clinton told the executives that he is the candidate with a vision of
the future, as opposed to Bob Dole who sees the past as the best model
for tomorrow. "We need this election to be a referendum on the future.

People need to vote for the future. They need to vote for their family's
future, their children's future, their nation's future," Clinton said.

"You don't even have any idea the kind of appeal that your voice has to
Americans all over this country who see you as our leaders in the march
to the future. And if we can make this election a referendum on the
future, I have no doubt how it will come out," he said.

Asked why the conservative executives had rejected Dole, Adobe CEO John
Warnock, said, "From the Republican convention we heard a lot of
backward thinking, looking into the past and reminiscing about good old
times. In high-technology, we look at the future. We don't look at the
past."

The group of 75 executives included Paul Allaire, CEO of Xerox; Carol
Bartz, CEO of Autodesk; Steve Jobs, CEO of Next and Pixar Animation
Studios; Bill Hambrecht, CEO of Hambrecht and Quist; Ed McCracken, CEO
of Silicon Graphics; and John Young, retired CEO of HP.

Steve Jobs, never shy about sharing the spotlight at a major event, took
the opportunity to tell Clinton that Silicon Valley business leaders
traditionally reject government handouts or special tax credits.

Instead, the high tech business community looks for "a solid business
climate, based on economic policies that make sense. We all feel that
we've had that over the last four years and what we're looking for is
for that to continue for another four years. I've lived in Silicon
Valley since I was five years old, and the past four years have been the
best Silicon Valley has ever had in terms of growth in revenue, jobs,
international market share and just sheer momentum," said Jobs.

Bob Dole is not without some Silicon Valley high-tech supporters
himself. TJ Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor has already endorsed Dole,
and additional support could come from Gil Amelio of Apple, Jim Morgan
of Applied Materials, Jerry Sanders of Advanced Micro Devices, and
Gordon Moore of Intel. Under Clinton, the budget has seen four years of
deficit reductions, the creation of 10.4 million new jobs, and a stock
market that has added more than 2000 points.

COMPUTER ASSOCIATION: ASSOCIATING MORE STRONGLY

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

As a part of its Asian thrust, Computer Association is taking a fresh
look at the Indian opportunities.

Despite being amongst the top three independent software companies in
the world, not many IT users in India know about Computer Associates
(CA). Enterprise-management solutions and mission-critical applications
are the two areas that CA is best known for. With very few users having
implemented enterprise management solutions in India, it comes as no
surprise that CA is not a well-known brand name here compared to
companies like Microsoft, Oracle etc.

In its twenty-first year of operations, CA currently has over 9,000
employees and a family of 500 software products. For the year ended
March 1996, it posted a revenue of $ 3.5 billion and a net income of
over $ 75 million. Contributing to this growth has been the Asian region
and according to Chua Tock Ling, Senior VP, CA Asia, the growth in the
Asian region is the fastest in CA. Within Asia, attention was first laid
on the Chinese market. "We have invested a lot of time, efforts, and
resources developing, in the last year, in North Asia (China, and to
some extent Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea) which are all fast-growing
markets," adds Tock Ling.

During the latter part of this year, CA is expected to announce its
plans for South Asia, in which India is the key market. In India, the
company has been having some discussions with various people about how
it can do business in India. Says Sanjay Kumar, President and COO, CA,
"We are comfortable with what is happening in India and we have worked
out some pretty aggressive plans which we will be announcing soon." What
seems to be on the cards is the enhancing of its direct presence by
opening a liaison office in Mumbai or Bangalore in the next three
months.

CA's entry into the Indian market was an indirect one. In 1993, it
acquired a company called Nantucket whose product Clipper was being sold
in India initially by Peutronics and later by Infosys. This trend
continued with CA's acquisition of The ASK Group in 1994, whose product,
Ingress, was being distributed by Mastek. Subsequently, approaching the
market in a more direct manner, CA appointed L&T in end 1994 as its
distributor for Unicenter, which has been the key product for CA so far.

This year, CA appointed its fourth partner, SE Business Solutions for
distributing its business application software.

Bulk of CA's revenue from India has been through the sale of Ingres
which is estimated to have brought in Rs 11 crore in 1995-96. Commenting
on Mastek's performance, Low Gee Sing, Manager (Asia Channels), opined,
"Mastek has been doing a good job and customers are satisfied." Ingres
has not been amongst the best-sellers in the RDBMS market worldwide and
the situation in India is no different. IDC (India) estimates that the
market share of Ingres dropped 4 percentage points to 14 percent in
1995-96, and in its outlook for 1996-97 feels that prospects for Ingres
are not very upbeat. Ravindra Govil, CEO, Mastek, says that the
immediate objective is to regain the market share and more
optimistically feels that beating Oracle is doable, albeit difficult. On
a more global scale, Gee Sing feels that Open Ingres is technically a
solid product and is being used in mission-critical applications.

However, he concedes that the product has not done well on the marketing
aspect and that it does not have enough visibility and mindshare.

CA-Unicenter, the enterprise management solution of CA has been the
primary catalyst for the company's growth since its introduction in
1993. According to Yogesh Gupta, Senior VP (Product Strategy), CA,
"Since its inception, Unicenter has been the fastest-growing product in
the history of software. In calender 1995, Unicenter revenues were $ 500
million. This year, Wall Street expects us to almost double that." But
this "billion dollar potential" software product has less than five
users in India. Gee Sing says, "India is very different from a lot of
other countries. The concept of systems management is pretty alien." One
of the primary reasons for CA's lackluster performance with Unicenter in
India is because of the lack of the mainframe culture to any significant
extent. CA has its task cut out in making its prospects understand that
systems management is equally important in the client server and Unix
environments.

Considering the market share that CA enjoys in many of the developed
countries, its revenue from India are perhaps far below its expectation.

When asked if CA's partners in India have not been particularly strong,
a hesitant Tock Ling says, "I wouldn't put it that they are not
particularly strong. It is a matter of focus, and I think if you put
your mind to develop a brand name and to market and organize your sales
and support forces into developing that brand, then I think we will do a
better job." In any case, that is the prime reason why CA believes that
it needs to have a direct presence in India to develop the market and to
assist partners.

Reiterating this stance is Kumar who says, "We have always been a direct
company and we will continue a direct presence anywhere we go. It is
very important for us." In other words, even if CA works through a
partner, the company would like to have a CA person ultimately
accountable for the solutions that it implements. However, for the kind
of software that CA sells, the company may require more direct
involvement in India than what is currently under consideration. This is
especially relevant for the distributed client server, automated
production control, security control and audit, performance management,
and accounting solutions etc. that CA has to offer.

OLD BOOK, NEW JACKET

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

The recommendations of the Ramani Panel regarding software exports has
nothing new to offer.

With software exports touching Rs 2,300 crore in 1995-96, the Indian
software exports industry is emerging as a unique and profitable forex
earner for the Government of India. Therefore, the initiative taken by
the DoE to prepare a general outlay of plans for the ninth five year
plan (1997-2002) in consultation with IT industry veterans is not
surprising. A panel of experts comprising 14 members from the IT
industry, academic institutes and the DoE was formed under the
chairmanship of KV Ramani, VP, NASSCOM, early this year. Started in
March, the study was completed and the report delivered to DoE recently.

It reviews the present industry, projects Indian software exports for
the next five years, examines the weaknesses in the software sector, and
identifies the thrust areas.

The Ramani Panel report however, has its limitations. It is like the
economic theory of demand and supply which postulates that demand goes
up when supply comes down, given the assumption that everything else is
equal. The report states that software exports from India, growing at a
CAGR of 42.6 percent, could touch Rs 21,800 crore by year 2002--an
eight-fold increase--provided all the recommendations are implemented.

Says Ramani "We could get a 7 percent share of the global software
market." In the event that only 60 percent of the recommendations get
implemented then exports would be in the region of Rs 12,680 crore. The
CAGR in this case is assumed to be 28 percent. Just as assuming that
economic conditions--which are rarely ever stable much less equal--as
being equal is wrong, to assume the probability of all recommendations
being implemented is also wrong.

Though long overdue, given that the last report on the software industry
was compiled in 1992 by the World Bank along with the DoE, the report
does not throw up any new ideas nor does it explore any different
approaches. For instance, the lack of packaged software products from
India has been highlighted as one of the key weaknesses. And the cause
of this--the exorbitant cost of marketing--is by no means a revelation.

Indeed, Indian software companies do not have the means today to absorb
such costs, but the question is, when is it likely to happen? It is an
issue which merits more than a cursory reference, since products have a
major role to play in achieving the year 2002 target.

Similarly, the other two major problem areas--lack of adequate venture
capital and absence of original technology--are not new either. However,
with the entry of several foreign venture capital funding firms into
India in the recent past and the steps taken by TDICI, matters relating
to the funding of small software companies have been mitigated to some
extent. Cause for concern remains though, as what steps the Panel would
take to further this has not been touched upon in depth. Coming to the
absence of original technology, one wonders if it merits being mentioned
at all, if no attempt is made in the first place to see why it is so.

As for manpower shortage and dearth of professionals with project
management skills, it is a subject that has been of concern for over
five years now. And we are yet to arrive at a consensus on how this
could be achieved. We are still stuck at the MCA course level and
talking of the need for standardization of these courses. Since this
hasn't happened despite DoE's efforts, it is safe to assume that it is
not likely to happen in the near future also. For the Panel to bank on
it, is an exercise in futility. However, its suggestion that the IITs
double their current output of students by opting for a shift system
with the existing infrastructure has some merit. But again, what are we
looking at? Doubling from an average of 500 professionals from all the
IITs put together? Surely, when we are talking of growing by 10 times,
it would be but a drop in the ocean?

The Panel's recommendation of forming at least 50 software cities across
the country and, better still, closer to engineering colleges is
interesting. Given that the major metros are increasingly getting out of
reach for most start-up entrepreneurs, this concept is bound to go down
well. It would also mean less clogging of the metros like Bangalore.

However, creating these alternate cities with sops for investors is a
must to attract them. Clearly, the Government has to start making
investments in this direction. And meetings with DoE officials is yet to
bring out the Government's clear stand on this study.

For long we have been talking of India's inherent advantages of a low
cost, high-quality, English-speaking workforce. But over the years, even
as we have been boasting, other Asian countries, having realized the
potential in this business, have begun catching up with India. What the
country now requires is a new perspective and the sooner it comes, the
better.

HOTLINE: NEW CISCO TECHNOLOGY CUTS INTERNET ACCESS RATES

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Internet access fees may be cut by half and data will move faster along
the worldwide computer network as a result of a new technology
introduced by Cisco Systems recently. The new technology will add the
equivalent of a postal zipcode' to each email message. By attaching an
electronic destination tag to an email message, Internet routers don't
have to concern themselves with the often lengthy destination code of a
message until it has been delivered to the server handing the account.

The new routing technology is expected to help unclog many of the data
arteries suffering from an overload of users during peak hours, causing
email messages to take considerably longer to get delivered. Cisco says
that the tag technology, combined with other throughput-boosting
innovations will enable existing Internet equipment to process data up
to four times faster. Another major advantage of the tag technology is
that paths of travel through the Internet can be established so reliably
that Internet access providers will be able to offer their customers up
to three levels of service and prices.

Cisco will present the new router technology, to be made as the standard
for traffic routing, to the Internet Engineering Task Force. As such,
the company would give up ownership of the technology and allow other
firms to use it as a common tool or feature in their Internet products.

HOTLINE: PACKARD BELL SETTLES A CASE: USED PARTS CASE

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Without admitting guilt, Packard Bell Electronics Inc. has settled a
case brought up by 22 states in the US, accusing the PC-maker of selling
new computers which contained parts from returned, previously sold
units. According to the terms of the settlement, Packard Bell has agreed
to pay attorney fees and investigative costs to each of the 22 states
involved in the case. Additionally, the company will label all packages
which contain systems involved in the practice and provide retailers
with point-of-sale material to inform potential customers. January 1997
has been set as a date for beginning the labeling process. Any system
containing parts from returned PCs will also have to be warranted as
new.

Significantly, Packard Bell has walked away from the settlement with no
fines, no penalties, and an agreement of no further litigation. The
company also said that a similar suit was dismissed involving PCs
purchased at Military exchanges and through Government agencies. Again,
without admitting wrongdoing, the PC-maker settled--this time for $ 3.5
million.

HOTLINE: ROUGH TIMES FOR ROCK OLIVETTI

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Olivetti is facing rough times: While the Chairman has resigned, the
company's shares have done yo-yo impersonations on the Italian Stock
Exchange (ISE), even forcing a suspension at one point recently. At the
same time, reports of a power struggle in the boardroom have surfaced,
with several senior staff members reported to be leaving.

The rocky path that Olivetti has trodden in the recent times has
suddenly become even rockier. The activities of its executives are under
investigation. The investigation centers around the possibility that the
company's losses for the first six months of the year have been
understated. Olivetti's board announced worse-than-expected pre-tax
losses of 440.2 billion lire ($ 290 million) and a net debt of 1,260
billion lire ($ 860 million) for the six months ended 30 June 1996. Much
of the blame for the losses has been laid at the door of the PC
division, plus the cost of on-going restructuring. Olivetti has been
spraying its profit and loss account with red ink for four years now.

Despite claims that the PC division had turned the corner, the division
is still costing the firm large chunks of operating revenue, and
investors are less than pleased with the division's performance.

To prevent any share sell-offs, the ISE has suspended the company's
shares. Although the investigation announcement and share trading
suspension would have upset investors, industry experts have welcomed
the management changes. They are talking about the possibility that the
company may pull out of PC production altogether.

HOTLINE: DECKS CLEARED FOR TISL NAME CHANGE

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

The reported name-change of TISL to Tata-IBM Ltd is expected to take
place in the next quarter with the Tata empire changing the royalty
structure levied on its stable of companies. The revised royalty
structure dividing the companies into A', B', and C' categories have two
IT companies--Tata Elxsi and Tata Unisys--in the A' group and because of
this these companies will have to pay the highest royalty--0.25 percent
of their net turnover or 5 percent of their net profit, whichever is
lower. These royalty structures are effective starting 1996-97 fiscal.

Says Ravi Dubey, VP Corporate Communications, Tata,"The change of name
of TISL is driven by the market needs of the company itself. It is in no
way linked to royalties. As a matter of fact royalty is not considered
at all when a company name is to be changed." As for an official
statement he said that they did not have any to make as yet.

However, in case of joint venture companies where the foreign partner
does not charge a royalty fee and offers the brand name on a gratis
basis, Tata will waive the royalty fee. Applicable to TISL and Tata's JV
with AT&T, the rumors pertaining to the name-change of TISL to Tata-IBM
Ltd, long doing the rounds, may finally be cleared. The name changing
exercise has taken so long because negotiations between IBM and TISL
were getting stuck whenever the issue of royalties came up. With the
royalty terms now cut and dried it will be easier for both parties to
conclude their deal smoothly.

WINDOWS 95--THE YEAR AFTER

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

A look at how this wonder-kid' has fared, and what the future holds for
it.

Windows 95 will change the way people use computers. The ease of use
usually associated with Mac is finally going to be available on the PC.

There is a widespread belief that the success of Windows 95 will spur a
massive surge in the sale of PCs and hence spark off a serious demand
for hardware. Orders for semiconductors--a leading indicator of PC
sales--has risen 54 percent. The expectations across the board from the
stock market to average PC user are extremely high. Microsoft has
planned its greatest ever media blitzkrieg to entice 85 million
customers and a $ 130 billion industry to upgrade to Windows 95. An ad
campaign costing several tens of millions of dollars and featuring rock
legends such as Mick Jagger and his 1981 classic, "Start me up" has been
planned. That was August 95.

Windows 95 is the first operating system Microsoft has offered both on
CD-ROM and floppies, giving the company lots of extra space for
gimmicks. A CD-ROM holds 660 MB of data, compared to 1.4 MB for a floppy
disk; Two full length music videos and a film trailer are available on
all CD-ROM versions. Three video clips alone hog up to 220 MB of data.

The company says that more testing has gone into this software than any
software ever written. 400,000 beta copies, 15 million lines of computer
code. A year and several bugs later, what has been the impact of this
hype and the hoopla? What does one really get from Windows 95? What are
the lessons learnt and the long term implications on the computer
industry in general? To upgrade or not to upgrade? What does the future
hold for the competition. This article explores these fundamental
issues.

What do you get from Windows 95?

32-bit OS: From a user perspective, 32 bit programs are a little faster
than conventional 16-bit programs. But the real benefit is for
programers. Gone are the days of large and tiny memory models, gone are
the days of Intel's segmented memory addressing.

PLUG-N-PLAY: You get a plug-and-play OS, which promises relatively
simple management of hardware configuration on your PC. Anybody who has
juggled IRQ numbers and memory addresses to install a PC card will
appreciate the plug-and-play features of Windows 95. Mac users have
taken plug-and-play for granted for years. It is finally time for the
PC. What does plug-and-play mean? This means that Windows 95 has the
ability to automatically recognize a new piece of hardware as it is
added to your PC. Plug-and-play works only if the peripheral bus on your
motherboard and the new piece of hardware you are adding are
plug-and-play compatible. It detects such things as modems and printers
automatically and configures them. Plug-and-play is the new standard
developed by a whole slew of hardware vendors led by Intel and
Microsoft. Unfortunately, plug-and-play does not work on the millions of
new PCs and adapter cards available in the market. However, Windows 95
still does a reasonably good job of identifying most of the popular
legacy adapter cards automatically during installation.

EASE OF NETWORKING: This is one of the really positive features of
Windows 95. You get support for TCP/IP, IPX/SPX straight out of the box.

To make things even more simple, Windows 95 even throws in a NetWare
client for free. Since it is a Win32 compatible platform, all of the
popular Web browsers--Netscape, NCSA Mosaic, Spry's Air Mosaic work just
fine in Windows 95. Other networking goodies include--Dial-up networking
support, including PPP, SLIP, and RAS for Windows NT.

UNIVERSAL MESSAGING LAYER: This is the very first implementation of
Microsoft's long awaited Messaging API, also known as MAPI. This allows
various messaging service providers to "plug-in" their services, and
thus achieve seamless integration with the built in messaging client in
Windows 95. MAPI is a powerful API, going beyond simple messaging. It is
more like an API for information exchange, and it really opens the door
for useful applications like document storage and retrieval, and Lotus
notes type of bulletin board-like applications. The downside to this is
that although MAPI is an open standard and thus would work with any
messaging service, the only built in messaging services in Windows 95
are for Microsoft Network, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Mail,
and Internet POP mail. If you want email connectivity to other messaging
services, you would have to get your own MAPI providers.

USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE: Microsoft has spent countless hours on
usability testing to improve the interface for Windows 95. Consistency
and convenience are a few of the key features of Windows 95. The right
mouse button has had its day at last. If you click the right mouse
button, almost always a pop-up menu comes up, listing the most commonly
used operations that can be done on that object at that time. Among
those menu-items there is almost always a menu-item called
"Properties..." If you choose "Properties..." you usually get a
"Property Sheet" (Everyone else in the world calls them "Tabbed
Dialogs"!) dialog listing all the settings. For instance if you click
the right mouse button on the desktop and choose the "Properties..."
menu-item, a dialog box comes up, which lets you change colors, display
resolution settings, screen savers etc. etc.

DRASTICALLY IMPROVED SHELL: If you have never considered yourself a fan
of Windows 3.1 Program Manager, you might end up liking the Windows 95
shell. The desktop finally gets a life of its own. You can at last
create program icons (called "Shortcuts" in Windows 95) right on the
desktop. If you've always got lost in Windows 95 as soon as you create
more than 3 or 4 windows, you would appreciate the new "Task Bar" at the
bottom. Whenever you minimize a window in Windows 95, the icon moves to
the bottom, on something which looks like standard status bar. As you
minimize more and more windows, all of those icons move to the same bar.

This "Task Bar" is always visible and hence, if you quickly want to go
to some other application it is just one-mouse click away.

What I don't get from Windows 95?

BLAZING SPEED: In fact, all 16-Bit Windows 3.1 applications would run a
little bit slower. The actual speed would depend on many factors like
the amount of memory etc., but no matter how much memory your system has
the speed is a little bit slower.

ROBUST OS: Windows 95 is a lot more robust than Windows 3.1. Windows 95
is more stable than previous versions of Windows and crashes less often.

It is now more difficult for mis-behaving applications to crash the
operating system, though it is still possible to do it. Microsoft paid a
heavy price for speed and compatibility. Under the hood of Windows 95,
there is still a lot of old DOS and 16-bit Windows code! Hence, there
are a lot of back-door entries into the operating system code. The other
main drawback--all 16 bit applications share the same message queue, and
it is the systems message queue. So if you have a 16 bit application
which has gone into an infinite loop, you have a hung system!

To upgrade or not to upgrade?

It often makes sense to upgrade with drastic improvements in software
capability. However, one begins to think twice when upgrade costs top 25
to 30 percent of the cost of a new machine. In general, with anything
older than a 486 based machine, it is advisable to upgrade--Windows 95
or otherwise. Windows 95 will typically stake out at least 40 MB of hard
drive with Windows 95 ready application programs hogging up several more
megabytes of space. So it is probably a good idea to have a larger hard
disk (at least 300 MB or more). In addition, running multiple programs
simultaneously implies one will be inclined to go in for a larger
monitor (15 inch or bigger) of some sort.

Will Windows 95 boost PC sales?

It was anticipated that is would. It turned out that the expectations
were far over-estimated. Several PC manufacturers cancelled orders for
hardware, thereby drastically affecting semiconductor manufacturers.

Several leading semiconductor companies had to resort to lay-offs to
counter the unprecedented drop in sales. The next couple of fiscal
quarters are critical to the success of several of these companies. All
the anticipated surge in sale of new PCs never really occurred. On the
other hand, several existing PC users have upgraded to Windows 95, as
have several corporations with PC networks, though gradually. The result
being, semiconductors stocks taking a beating while Microsoft's stock
has continued to surge ahead on Wall street.

What is the future for Windows 95?

The biggest threat to Microsoft seems to be the rapid growth of the
Internet and software drive by this growth. Netscape, which has been at
the forefront of the Internet revolution, appears to be the leading
player in this area. With the growth of intranets (computer networks
within corporations) and the WWW, the Netscape browser is fast becoming
the interface of choice in corporations. Meanwhile, leading companies
such as Oracle, IBM, and Sun Microsystems are anxious to break the
Wintel monopoly (Intel-Microsoft PC monopoly) and are defining the
Network computer along with "Java applets" (applications that reside on
a network rather than on a local hard disk) as next wave in computing
technology. The result of this intense battle remains to be seen and we
hope to discuss this more in detail in a future article.

ANOTHER OS WAR?

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

It has all the makings of the EDP managers ultimate nightmare. 1996-97
will see the release of new versions of almost all desktop operating
systems. But what could have been a no-holds-barred OS war looks like
ending without even a whimper!

Uncharacteristically, Microsoft is first off the block this time with NT
4. IBM will pitch in with Merlin, Netware Green river is in advanced
Beta, Apple promises to have long delayed Copland out by mid-97, and
rounding off the year will again be Microsoft with Windows 97. Add to
it, new stuff like Spring and Inferno and you have quite a potent brew.

Before the marketing whiz kids take over, here is a quick look at the
promises each OS has to keep.

Green River--Netware To IntranetWare?

At Novell, the spotlight has shifted from Green river to the search for
a new CEO. In a sudden move, Novell and CEO Frankenberg parted ways,
with Novell searching for new corporate directions.

Meanwhile, Green river is not exactly a major upgrade if one goes by the
version number--4.11. The major deliverables of Green river are SMP
scalability or an ability to handle multiple CPU's, better printing and
network management capabilities, and automatic detection for network
cards.

With better security and full TCP/IP support, Green river is being
squarely positioned as an Internet-compliant intranet platform. Novell
has also announced IntranetWare, which over and above Netware 4.11,
includes Netscape Navigator, FTP Services for NetWare, an IPX/IP
Gateway, and a multiprotocol router for WAN and Internet connections.

Copland--A Complete Rewrite

Copland is the first complete rewrite of the Mac OS. Apple is giving up
its long standing commitment of complete backward compatibility for its
operating system and is writing Mac OS 8 only for the PowerPC platform.

(Apple promises to continue support and upgrades for OS 7.5)
Copland has been due for a long time. It was first expected in 1995.

Current target is mid-97.

Copland promises a better interface with customization options,
preemptive multitasking, international language support, and better
communications. Native PowerPC code is expected to make the OS many
times faster. OS 8 will also be the first one from Apple's stables which
can run on boxes other than the Mac. It will run on any machine meeting
the PowerPC specifications.

Merlin--But Where Are The Knights Of The Round Table?

There have been no two opinions about the technical finesse of OS/2.

Merlin is the upgrade of OS/2 Warp. Now scheduled for a 25 September
release, it will be the first OS for the Intel chip with built-in voice
capabilities. Departing from the made-at-IBM-only policy, IBM will
actually replace its own internet explorer with an OS/2 version of
Netscape Navigator. Also, making its debut will be Warp center--based on
Lotus smart center--an object-oriented icon ribbon on the desktop that
will allow users to group and quickly launch programs and check on
system status.

While IBM continues to blow hot and cold about OS/2, the question is not
whether Merlin will deliver on its promises but whether it can
capitalize on the deliverables. Will the magician take OS/2 onto the
winning league? or will this damsel in distress have to continue to wait
for a Knight in shining armour to come to her rescue?

Windows 97--A New Way To Organize Your Files

After Win 95, it's going to be Win 97 with no 96 in between. Official
information is still scarce on what it will be like in 97.

A major change is to be in the way files are organized and accessed.

Windows 97 will have an Internet browser type explorer with a Web page
like organization of directories and files, in place of the current
hierarchical one. Is this Microsoft's version of the Internet PC, with
local disks mimicking the Internet, and both being accessed by
applications in the same way.

Oh! and by the way, what will it be this time in place of Start me up'?

NT and Win 95--Will The Twain Ever Meet?

Microsoft has not been clear about the future of NT and Win 95. Current
trends seem to indicate that NT is going the Win 95 way in look and
feel, while Win 95 seems to be going the NT way (in 97) as far as OS
organization and drivers go. Will the two merge into one or will they go
separate ways?

Inferno--A Long Way To Go

When it was first announced, Inferno was seen by many as a potential
challenger to Java. But while Java (and Java hype) continues to rule the
Net, Inferno is nowhere near to being the challenger it was supposed to
be.

Inferno is actually a combination of the Inferno operating system, the
Limbo programming language, the Dis virtual machine for Limbo, and the
Styx communication protocol. Behind all these strange names, Inferno is
supposed to provide transparent distributed computing in a local area,
wide area or global client server environment.

Resources on Inferno are represented as files and most functions are
implemented as basic file commands. Irrespective of the physical
location of a resource, it will show up on the same hierarchical file
system and will be accessed by Styx. Object code written in Limbo will
execute in the Dis environment with as little as 1 MB memory.

That makes Inferno sound like the operating system for the Internet PC.

So, is Inferno's time yet to come?

NEXTSTEP--OS To API?

NeXTSTEP was Steve Jobs' attempt at recreating the Mac magic after his
ouster from Cupertino. Somewhere along the way, he gave up in part and
sold off the hardware--NeXT Cube and NeXT Station--but continued the
development of NeXTSTEP as an object-oriented OS. Now with the
announcement of OPENSTEP, an API--for among other things Windows NT--as
the upgrade to NeXTSTEP, Jobs seems to have given up the effort
completely.

NeXT Software continues, 300 people strong, focussing on Internet
technologies and products.

Conclusion

The general directions seem to be the same in every case. Good old DOS
is dead. The Internet is in and so are intranets--at the OS level.

Graphics, distributed computing, and networking seem to be the
loadstones for the future.

Apple has more or less squandered its huge lead in things graphical and
is grappling with enormous problems on all fronts. Whatever advantage
Copland would have bought, ***it has been greatly eroded by Win 95. OS2,
acclaimed for its technical finesse, is caught midway between IBM's
prevarication and a lack of application base. Netware is the only one in
the pack which is not a true operating system. It is also the only one
which is not fully graphical.

Does that mean that we are in for a more-dominated-by-Windows world? Any
wagers that one of the others will still rise, a phoenix from the ashes
of the past, to mount a successful challenge to the Microsoft
juggernaut?

idea and we will share it with the rest of the world. Write in to KK at

NETWORK INTERFACE DEVICES: AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROMISES AND THREATS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

By all means, there is definitely a lot that is going for the
network-computer type of devices. An analysis of the promises threats

IBM, Sun, Oracle, Wyse, NCD, Acer, Sony, Acorn, Nintendo, Toshiba,
Digital, ViewCall Europe plc., and other vendors have announced plans to
develop and build low-cost devices targeted to replace
Intel/Windows-based PCs. These devices go by many names--`Network
Terminals', `Network Computers (NC)', `Internet Terminals' and so forth.

Whatever the name, a great deal of interest has been generated
throughout Asia-Pacific in these emerging alternative computer
platforms.

The level of interest differs from one country to another, varying
according to the installed corporate PC base, the strength of corporate
networks and local Internet services, and the dominant culture, which
influences the level of employee autonomy. In Japan, China, and Korea,
highly centralized organizations micro-manage employees and have
consequently resisted movements to have a `mainframe on every desktop'
and to have `distributed, empowered workers' that have swept over the
world in the last 10 years. Many enterprises in these countries are
following the debate over `Internet Terminals' with enthusiasm. They see
an opportunity to reap the rewards of distributed computing without
incurring the pain of high total costs of ownership that come with it.

These countries are investing in nation-wide high-speed networks using
the latest technologies. If they invest more in the network, do they
also need to invest more to maintain and manage the PCs?

These so-called `Internet terminals' have been widely ridiculed by many
in the Western media, but for the wrong reasons. While everyone agrees
that these devices cannot, and will not, replace already purchased PCs,
we believe there will be value in these devices.

Generically, we define a class of devices that is totally
network-dependent as `Network Interface Devices' (NIDs). Thus, while
traditional fixed-function terminals and X-terminals are indeed NIDs, a
low-end PC that can independently run some personal productivity
applications along with Internet access is not, according to our
definition, a NID. Today, the two new classes of NIDs that will be
entering the market are browser-based NIDs and Windows-based NIDs. The
ability to distinguish between these two classes of NIDs is critically
important for enterprises to properly leverage these technologies.

The browser-based NID is a device dedicated to Internet access (both
through the intranet and Internet), mainly World Wide Web server access,
through browser-like functionality. These devices range from products
such as the ViewCall set-top box--where `Surfing the Web' is performed
through the remote control and a TV screen--to those envisioned by Sun
and Oracle--where, equipped with extensions like Java, the products
deliver application functionality that can be executed on the device.

Ventures like Sun's and Oracle's exploit the capabilities of large
server configurations, leveraging the core capabilities of these
vendors. As innovative as these solutions are, however, they are
primarily incremental markets to those of traditional PCs and will have
little long-term effect on user's choice of enterprise desktop. The
ability to run applications locally will be enabled through the addition
of Java-like capabilities. Yet few productive Java applications exist
today, which restricts the initial application of browser-based NIDs to
those enterprises that want to provide low-cost, low-complexity Internet
access, such as hotel suites, kiosks, libraries, and educational
facilities.

The Windows-based NID is a device that has more of a role to play within
the enterprise today than the browser-based NID. Vendors of these
devices (e.g. NCD's Explora and Wyse's WinTerm) have also characterized
their devices as `Internet desktops'. While this has given the vendors a
chance to receive more media attention than their products perhaps would
have gotten otherwise, this characterization overlooks the main appeal
of these NIDs. The remote Windows technology used in these devices is
based on presenting a Windows desktop on a NID that is not running
Windows. These low-priced desktop NIDs (less than $ 1,000) allow full
access to complete Windows NT desktop and to all the Windows
applications from a central server, without the complexity of building
and supporting the Windows environment in each desktop. While these
solutions are not appropriate for those involved with nomadic or mobile
computing (since there is no `offline' mode for NIDs), there are
configurations where Windows-based NIDs are a lower-cost solution. These
NIDs only provide the user interface, enabling any Windows application
(browsers, groupware clients, or 3270 emulators) to run on the server
and facilitate full exploitation of distributed and client server
solutions. While NIDs will not replace every desktop PC, we believe that
NIDs will comprise 10 percent of new corporate desktop purchases in 1998
(0.7 probability).

While both the NIDs can evolve to support complete computing
environments, their initial approaches are different. The major
difference between the Windows-based NID and the browser-based NID is
that browser-based NIDs rely on the Web connectivity paradigm, in which
the browser is the presentation platform through which a user accesses
its computing environment. The Web approach is very network-centric,
independent of the hardware platform, and desktop operating system (OS).

For the execution of applications, browser-based NIDs are totally
reliant on programming languages, environments, and collaborative suites
(such as Java) that are in the early stages of development, but are
network-enabled. No mainstream versions of these types of NIDs are
currently available. Windows-based NIDs use a standard Windows interface
as their primary presentation platforms and an NT Server as the `host'.

For applications, the main feature of the Windows-based NID is the
remote presentation of NT server-based Windows applications allowing
access to the "legacy Windows environment". However, the Windows-based
NID technology does not address any `network-enablement' that Microsoft
may introduce into the application environment. Note, a Windows-based
NID can access any browser running on the NT Server, providing Web
access and, therefore, duplicating the functionality of a browser-based
NID.

These devices are not just for accessing the Internet. Initially
envisioning a low-cost network-connected device, the market referred to
NIDs as Internet terminals. This name is completely misleading. A more
appropriate term could be a "Web terminal" or "Web computer," but even
these names are too restrictive. These devices are not only designed to
access the Internet via the Web, but to run applications as well. Short
term, the Windows-enabled NIDs (e.g. from NCD and Wyse) will be able to
run applications using technology licensed from Citrix. With the Citrix
remote Windows presentation protocol, NIDs will be able to remotely
present a Windows desktop and any Windows-based application. Longer
term, as applications based on Java appear, both the Windows-based and
browser-based NIDs could run applications based on Java. The attraction
to organizations will be in a lower total cost of ownership. In many
Gartner Group research papers, we have indicated that the most
significant portion of the total cost of ownership of PCs is in the
ongoing support and maintenance of the PC platform. The fundamental
problem of how to implement software distribution to hundreds or
thousands of desktops is one of the most significant issues faced by
large organizations. Supporting the underlying complexity of today's
networked computing environment is another significant issue. Support
for the underlying complexity of these environments includes service and
support when moving parts break (most NIDs do not have hard drives,
floppy drives or fans), and support when users inadvertently corrupt
their desktop operating environment. All of these issues are resolved by
using NIDs. The browser and remote presentation code can be
electronically updated over the network into `flash ROM'--a technology
that is available today, but has rarely been used over the network. The
primary attraction of NIDs is to reduce the complexity and, therefore,
the cost of network computing.

Another user misconception is that enterprises will be running NIDs
directly on the Internet or somehow using the Internet to deploy
mission-critical corporate applications. This is a complete
misunderstanding of the technology and is propagated by market
references to all of these devices as Internet terminals. The typical
configuration will not be as an access device to the Internet. Instead,
like other Internet technologies (such as Web servers and Web browsers),
these technologies will be deployed internally within the secure
corporate network to serve as `information portals' to the corporate
network infrastructure--with data access enabled through Web pages and
application access enabled through Citrix-like technologies and, longer
term, by using `Java-like' technologies.

For Windows-based NIDs the applications are available now. For
browser-based NIDs, the applications will be coming soon. Sun
Microsystems has received a lot of attention for its Java programming
language. Any Java-enabled browser (including Netscape) can execute a
Java application. However, there are no significant mission-critical
Java applications available today. Even with the promise of future
Java-based applications, users could be unwilling to give up their
favorite Windows-based word processing application for one written in
Java that may not provide the same functionality and is probably slower.

Users who are concerned that Java is too slow for many applications
should take into account the continual improvements in the language as
the environment matures, improvements in hardware capabilities, and the
whole concept engendered by the Java paradigm--which we call Networked
Dynamic Functionality (NDF). NDF means that network-centric application
evolved to run its `applets' at the place where they perform best and
application functionality is available when required.

NIDs are not X-terminals. X-terminals provided a GUI to UNIX-based
applications that were stored and executed at the UNIX server. Several
significant differences exist between X-terminals and NIDs. First,
X-terminals solve a specific problem--providing GUI access to UNIX
server-based applications. Performance was tolerable on a local network
segment, but scaled poorly on WAN links. Second, X-terminals are
expensive--typically averaging $ 3,000. Last, the personal productivity
applications that users wanted to access were rarely UNIX-based.

UNIX-based emulation of Windows applications (e.g. WABI) was limited to
a subset of applications and suffered from poor performance. NIDs are
based on technologies that were designed around the need to access the
most ubiquitous environments (the Web and Windows) and evolved with an
emphasis on performance across a WAN. For NIDs, price structures are
hitting new low points, through set-top and game-player configurations
and following the pricing trend of PCs.

NIDs are not traditional diskless workstations. Traditional diskless
workstations (TDWs) still run a `full-blown' local OS and `local
applications' that are stored elsewhere. Therefore, a TDW carries along
all of the internal complexity of a full-blown PC, minus local storage.

With a NID, the only OS services available will be those used to serve
the user interface (therefore, a reduction in internal complexity is
possible within the device). Execution of applications will not occur on
a NID, but will be distributed to an appropriate server system. While
the NID model is more biased toward distributed computing, TDWs were
biased toward networked storage.

WHY'S ABOUT YEAR 2000

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

In light of the costs and risks, companies should look at automated and
creative solutions for the Year 2000 problem.

As the year 2000 approaches, the business community is on the verge of
one of the most significant problems it has experienced. Computer
applications that use the date for commutations, comparisons, and
sorting will produce incorrect results or fail due to invalid data. The
problem stems from programming techniques used during the 1960's and
1970's, when two-digit representations of years were used in most
mainframe applications. Since dates are often used in mathematical
computations and comparisons, errors can easily occur when the two-digit
year is 00'.

The Options

Companies would first have to take an inventory of all their code and
decide upon a strategy. The strategy would involve a combination of
discarding code, replacing some of the code with standard Year-2000
enabled packages, and Year-2000 enabling of the remaining code. The
proportion of code falling under each of these categories would depend
on the complexity of the systems in a company. Companies that have a
sizable portion of their critical systems developed and maintained
in-house would address this problem by looking at reengineering and
platform migration options.

A challenge most companies will face is having to justify spending
millions of dollars on a problem that seems so trivial. At the end of
the exercise, there may be no perceived business gains, except that the
organization would continue operations as usual. The tendency will be to
propose to reengineer some or most of the systems--the perceived
benefits would justify the expense. Before choosing the reengineering
option, however, factors such as cost, time available, resource
requirements, risk, and the company's record of success with
reengineering efforts should be considering. The cost of process and
business reengineering includes training, personnel reallocation, and
change management--making it an extremely expensive affair. Most
companies may end up choosing a mixture of the two options. This choice
may not be available as the time available decreases.

Date Enabling The Code And Data

In all probability, organizations will choose to enable some portion of
their code base as there is just not enough time to handle the issue any
other way. Year-2000 enabling could be done in one of three ways--date
expansion, date interpretation, or date manipulation.

* Date expansion involves increasing the year data to store four digits
and modifying all applications that store and access this data. While
the software development effort involved in this strategy is relatively
low, the impact on operations and the coordination required is very
high. This is an ideal strategy for a software product manufacturer,
since such a company would not have the problems of large data and
productionization.

* A date interpretation strategy does not involve changing the data, but
only involves changing the source code to read the data differently. For
instance, in a 70/30' strategy, any year data that is above 70 implies
that the data represents the twentieth century and any year data less
than 70 implies that the data represents the twenty-first century.

Although no major coordination effort is required, every program that
refers to a date field should be changed and significant testing is
required.

This is best employed where the data cannot be changed as it is live
data being used by several applications. This is the ideal strategy for
in-house and production systems.

* A date manipulation strategy involves adding a specific number of
years to the year field. This strategy is ideal for in-house or
production systems where the input and output processing is well
controlled through a limited number of programs. The ideal solution in
most cases may be to implement a mixture of these strategies to areas
most applicable rather than forcing one strategy.

The Methodology

The methodology that would be followed is fairly well defined. An
inventory collection phase is followed by a study of the impact of the
Year-2000 issue on the code. Several commercially available tools help
automate this effort for some of the more popular programming languages
such as COBOL and PL/1. Normally, impact analysis tools are complemented
by code conversion tools which automate the process of enabling the
code. Such tools process several million lines of code per month and are
available for some popular programming languages like COBOL. For
proprietary languages both the analysis and conversion effort will have
to be done manually--a process that takes a lot longer, costs more, and
introduces more bugs.

By the end of code and data enabling, only half the work is done. The
rest--unit and system testing--is not automatable. Unit testing may be
minimal if no manual changes are made and the tool is very reliable and
covers all possible cases. In most cases, unit testing is not trivial.

The most difficult part of the methodology is system testing, since
application knowledge is required. In most cases, this is difficult to
find, especially for the areas of the system that have been stable and
functioning well for several years.

Regardless of the strategy chosen for Year 2000 enabling, the effort
required does not vary much. In case the choice made is to work with a
service provider, the total effort required for data manipulation may be
the lowest. However, it involves the maximum on-site effort, thereby
making it expensive. The data interpretation option would be least
expensive in terms of resources.

Factors Influencing Actual Year 2000 Cost Per Line Of Code

Simplistic code enabling sizing exercises focus on the number of Lines
of Code (LoC) and attach a rate to each LOC. The rate quoted varies from
$ 0.50 to $ 1.50. However, Gartner projections and DBSS experience shows
that the quoted include only the cost of labor and tools of the service
provider for a line of structured COBOL code. The actual expense
incurred by a company for a Year 2000 project could work out to several
times the rate per LoC often quoted by the service providers. Some of
the factors to be considered are:

* Availability of tools for the target environment.

* Availability of application expertise.

* Programming language complexity (in case the language is not COBOL).

* Missing source code.

* Multiple versions of source code
* Testing requirements and complexity.

* CPU and DASD resources for parallel and integration tests.

* Permanent increase in DASD requirement.

* Availability and opportunity cost of using internal resources.

* Implementation and productionization.

* User training.

* Post-implementation supports costs.

In one production environment, the cost per LoC for the software
development effort of the client and DBSS together worked out to
$0.87/line of COBOL code. Of this, the DBSS cost for the on site and
India effort together was $0.45/line of COBOL code. The total cost
worked out to $2.81/LoC. This includes the cost of deciding upon the
strategy, post-implementation support, reengineering lost code, and
increased volumes. Based on the initial assumption of $1.00/LOC the
company had budgeted $18 million for the project. However, the total
cost of the project was $50 million.

For another client, a product vendor, the total cost did work out to
less than $1.50/LOC. This included the cost of internal resources as
well as the cost of testing. Of course, they did have better code, no
lost code, and existing test plans.

Next Step

For a company that is yet to start or just becoming aware of the
problem, a few steps need to be taken immediately. The organization
should try to understand the real size and cost of the problem and
analyze the impact to their business. Waiting for the magic bullet'
would only result in the business having to shut down. Finally, a
company would do well to invite solution providers to at least help them
in a preliminary impact analysis exercise while continuing to educate
itself of the nature and size of this self-designed virus'.

The Right Mix: Breaking into the US market

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

What are the options available to Indian companies wanting to make their
mark in the US market? Which is the most viable? A look at the pros and
cons involved.

In my last article (Where are the right people, September 30),I had
addressed the manpower issue to emphasize why we need to improve revenue
productivity. In this article, I will address the viability of the
product option.

There is a perception among many software companies that the only way to
improve revenue productivity is by taking up packaged products. However,
many senior people in the industry are taking a pragmatic view in
pointing out the risks associated with doing that.

Very few non US companies have been successful in the product market
worldwide. The general expectation of customer support and services in
the US market (which is also the biggest segment) is one of the highest
in the world. Meeting this expectation requires huge investments and a
deep pocket. Given the difficulties in getting finance and the cost of
capital, products may not be a very profitable option! The Indian
company could focus entirely on engineering and let the US partner
handle the entire marketing. In this case, sharing of revenues and
profits may not be favorable to the Indian company, because the
development cost is often about 10 to 20 percent of the total cost.

The virtual monopoly of US companies in the product market is a fact to
reckon with. An analysis of the world's top 100 IT companies and the top
50 companies by software and services revenues (Source: Datamation)
provides some interesting results:

Top 100 IT companies: Of the 33 based outside the US, 30 deal with
hardware, two with services (Cap Gemini Sogeti, Italy, and Intec, Japan)
and one with software (SAP, Germany).

Top 50 companies (by software product revenues): Only two (SAP and
Software AG, Germany) are based outside the US.

Top 50 companies (by services revenues): eight are based outside the
US--Cap Gemini Sogeti and Finsiel (Italy), Intec and Nomura (Japan),
Sema Group and Sligos (France), SAP and British Telecom.

Non-US companies seem to be more successful in services than products.

To understand why, let us look at the challenges of marketing products
in the US and what kind of resources it takes. While the US is the
biggest market for software products, it is also the most competitive.

Taking the product route therefore requires a lot of resources, which
could become a bottleneck for many Indian companies. First, you need
market information to decide what is state-of-the-art and what features
will sell. Your US-based competitors have an edge over you, simply
because they have a better feel of the market and a local presence. How
much could you spend on market research or how far could you depend on
your US partner for market information? Second, the cost of marketing in
the US is phenomenal and even the top Indian software companies often
find it better to tie up with a US distributor rather than handle
marketing entirely on their own. A distributor in the US (like anywhere
else) looks at any product from two perspectives--margins and volumes.

Can every Indian company offer products which are high value or which
are fast selling? To protect their own margins and improve volumes, they
have to offer something very innovative and something not yet available
in the US market. With limited information and the pressure on time,
success depends on the kind of resources that can be pumped into product
development.

The general expectation of product marketing and support in the US is
very high. Most product vendors in the US have toll free (1-800) numbers
where one can contact (free of charge) to obtain product and marketing
information. Distributors in the US are responsible only for providing
local contact, carrying inventory, and providing first-level support or
training (often at extra cost). Installation is always do-it-yourself,
using manuals. If a user has a difficulty with manuals or needs
technical support, he is expected to contact the vendor directly using a
toll free number. Even if a US distributor provides the infrastructure,
the Indian company has to provide people to handle installation and
technical support. Support costs in the US can therefore be considerable.

Obtaining finances and bearing the interest cost could be a problem for
many Indian companies taking the product route. In turnkey projects,
most companies get paid periodically on completion of a milestone and
cash flows are more predictable. But the in-flows of product revenues
are highly skewed against out-flows of investments and expenses. First,
where is the mechanism to fund product investments? What kind of
pressure will investors, financial institutions, and the top management
put in order to maintain or improve the bottomline? If Indian companies
start cutting corners to save costs, will it not work to their
disadvantage? These are important questions to be answered.

Some Indian companies feel that they could get into a two-way marketing
and support tie-up with a US software vendor. The US vendor could handle
Indian products in the US with a similar arrangement in the Indian
market for his products. This helps the Indian company avoid investing
in infrastructure (like 1-800 lines) and people in the US. But this
option has to be carefully evaluated from both sides. First, most US
vendors are more interested in selling their products in India (or the
Asian market) than selling Indian products in the US. Second, Indian
products in general and the brand "Made in India" are not popular in the
US. Will the US vendor's commitment to the Indian product be strong
enough? What happens, if at a late stage, the US partner backs out? Will
the Indian company be left high and dry?

Products carry a higher risk because marketing is often not entirely
under your control and your investments and returns are often spread
over a longer period of time. Does this mean products fetch higher
profits? Not necessarily. Development costs are often far lower than
marketing and distribution costs (which form a bigger share of the total
cost). If your investments and risks are only in development and your
partner picks up all the costs (and associated risks) of marketing, the
profit sharing is bound to be in his favour. If you take on more
responsibility by sharing the marketing and support costs you can claim
a bigger share of profits. But then, your investments and expenses will
be higher. Either way, there is a trade-off.

Of course, Indian companies have to improve their revenue productivity
and reduce the dependency on people. But given the resource
requirements, the product route may not be the best solution for every
Indian company. Two models can achieve this objective, without demanding
a lot of resources. One is creating intellectual property usable across
multiple projects or products. This allows companies to leverage the
investment and get higher revenues over a period of time. The other is
to ask customers to pay for the value of the solution regardless of the
effort or input. My next two articles will examine these models
(Intellectual Property and Pay for Solutions) in detail.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: A TIME FOR VISION

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Strategizing for the future may seem a little irrelevant, and perhaps a
little trivial, in the Indian context. For an industry that is a modest
Rs 9,712 crore, which is just a little were than the size of India's
largest corporate entity--Telco--but an industry which made the axiom
`change is the only constant' true more than ever before, it appears
that planning for the future is the only way to survive. This applies to
Indian companies participating in this nascent industry, irrespective of
size or content. We examine where we are in terms of future planning,
how we got here, and what are the issues that we need to tackle to
realize the true potential of India Inc.

It has been argued at length that the Indian IT industry (read hardware)
is a mere subset of the US (read global) IT industry--there isn't a
single player of global significance that does not have a presence in
India, either as joint ventures or as fully-owned subsidiaries. It is
also said that these companies do not have any strategies far removed
from their parent companies and that they merely follow the trend that
is extant overseas. What we have is both a technologically volatile and
technology-dominated industry. Hence, fashioning a strategy in India
that is separate and removed from the West, in this case the US, would
need a combination of creativity and taking cues from what has happened
elsewhere in the world. There are two problems here. For one, it is an
industry which is driven by technological advances--from microprocessors
to system software--in all core competency areas, and which for the most
part resides in the West. Two, given the rapid changes that are taking
place in the Indian market, strategizing is as much keeping pace with
the market changes as it is keeping pace with technology. Historically,
while in India, computer usage has been traditionally low, the
assimilation of computer technology was not too far behind than that in
the US. And increasingly we are bridging that gap. The possibility of
Indian companies increasingly choosing a foreign brand of PC as against
the existing local brands (HCL, Wipro, PCL) became more than real.

Viewed in this context, a Shiv Nadar joining hands with Hewlett Packard,
Ashok Soota tying up with Acer, Ratan Tata signing up with IBM, Dadan
Bhai setting up Altos to manufacture Dell motherboards are instances of
strategic thinking for the future.

The Indian Imperative

The other side of the picture is that a strategy which leads to closure
of local manufacturing is no strategy at all, and least of all a
foresight. This is where strategizing in the Indian context has come to
embody certain focussed moves in the market. But Indian companies had to
juggle between an Indian market that is not only notoriously
price-sensitive and averse to changing old systems for new with the same
alacrity as in the West, but also had to contend with some draconian
duties in the form of import, excise, and countervailing duties etc.

They had to judiciously mix and match their strategies when it came to
product launches as well as pricing for various market segments.

For instance, though Wipro discontinued its brand of PCs, HCL's Busybee
and PCL still exist as a brand. We could split hairs on manufacturing
versus assembly and on how many local brands there are vis-a-vis foreign
brands, but the fact is that these brands have retained their identity
despite the odds. And, even though HCL pushed boxes up until the early
nineties, it gave birth to NIIT more than a decade ago, which, in turn,
spawned off the training industry in India. This is one of the rare but
substantial examples of how a brand-building strategy can come to
maturity in an entirely different product segment.

The other aspect of the Indian strategic initiative is the capacity and
the inclination to leverage and adapt on partner skills. Wipro, which
could hit the Indian shores even before liberalization, had marketing
and distribution agreements with companies like Sun Microsystems and
Tandem in order to leverage on their strengths to provide solutions. The
phrase `embrace and extend' may have been coined by the Internet team at
Microsoft but it was definitely adopted first by Indian IT companies, as
a strategic tool. And it has worked wonders here, in different ways for
different companies. Thus, if HP lent engineering skills, world-class
manufacturing methodology, and credibility to HCL, Wipro got a wider PC
product portfolio through Acer, and high-end mission-critical solutions
through Tandem. The locals also figured out that multinationals would
find it difficult, if not impossible (as Compaq has proved in the PC
market), to enter the Indian market all alone.

Similarly, in software too, India has evolved, though it hasn't had to
contend with competing products. It is moving from providing onsite
services to offshore, and is among the most preferred choices for
companies in the US and Europe. Thanks to our USPs. There is a gradual
emergence of software products like Bancs 2000 and Marshal for global
consumption.

The Value Of Foresight

The last four years have been cataclysmic in many ways. Some companies
made a success of it, whereas others weren't as lucky. If there haven't
been any instances of failures in the software industry, it doesn't mean
that they have all been singularly smart or right with their strategies.

It is just that their fate was not as inextricably tied with the
emerging Indian market as that of the hardware industry. CMC is one such
instance. A model company once, it completely failed to see the impact
of having a DEC and IBM locally. And soon it started losing out on TPM
contracts to the foreign companies who were operating directly. This is
a clear example of how medium-term strategic thinking is important for a
company, and how often Indian corporates fail to appreciate this.

Tata Unisys, Tata Elxsi, DCM DataSystems, and PSI Data Systems are all
instances of companies that were late off the block in asking this
crucial question: What will the market look like four to five years
hence? It was not enough to merely read the technological trend
overseas; it was imperative to read the changes taking place in the
Indian market scenario too. Tata was early in acquiring Elxsi, which was
ahead of its time elsewhere and in India, with its 64-bit systems. Bull
mainframes had no takers in the world market, pushed as they were from
the bottom by powerful workstations. The mainframe market in India
didn't exist, except in the minds of a few at PSI.

In the recent past we have seen DEIL coming out of a trough successfully
and then going downhill again. DEIL failed twice, first with its
decision to manufacture a particular range of VAX systems in India, and
second, when it went in for manufacturing Apple systems. While in the
first case, DEIL mistook the latent demand for VAX systems in India to
mean that its demand will continue, in the latter case, it failed to
anticipate internal issues in the company which, inhibited a low-value
item to be pushed alongside high-end VAX and Alpha systems. In both the
cases, it had to suffer losses.

At the same time, there are some companies which have pulled themselves
out of the mess quite admirably, for e.g. DCM DataSystems, Tata Elxsi,
and PSI Data Systems. For instance, DCM, after going through several
rounds of restructuring (which resulted in several heads rolling) and
reengineering, is well on its way to full recovery. In the last
financial year, the company grew by around 100 percent. This was
achieved through its strategy of focusing on customer as a vertical
segment instead of any geography or domain like finance or
manufacturing. According to Veer Sagar, MD, DCM DataSystems, "By
combining responsiveness as an USP, and lowest delivered cost in the
country as the business mission along with customer focus, we have been
able to increase profits by 300 percent over the previous year." DCM has
also cut down management layers from eleven to five, reducing the
distance between the customer and president to just three layers.

PSI Data Systems metamorphosed from PSI Bull, which had set up a
manufacturing site in India to manufacture mainframes. It missed
everything--from the first stirrings of liberalization to the swiftly
changing Government policies to the market demand for open systems as
against proprietary systems. In 1992-93, the company declared nearly
half its turnover of Rs 18.5 crore as loss. The company reengineered its
business operations around software and is now into software services
and systems integration. Says Ajay Mehta, CEO and MD, PSI Datasystems
"Having met all its four objectives set in 1993 at the time of
reengineering, PSI made a modest profit of Rs 1 crore on a turnover of
Rs 20.7 crore."

The Choice Of Learning

Do these successes mean that Indian companies have learnt their lessons
well and are into long-term strategizing? Compared with the India of the
late eighties, we have taken giant strides and are on par with the
world. Today, we talk of the application of leading-edge technologies
with the same level of ease and expertise as anybody else from the same
background in the US does. But take a few steps backward and view the
scenario from a distance. What we see is an India that is still as far
away from the US as it was a decade or two ago. In fact, further off, as
in the same time that we have taken giant strides, the US has taken
quantum leaps in technology. While in India PC penetration has just
crossed 1 million, a company like Compaq alone makes over three million
PCs a year. J Ramachandran, Professor of Corporate Strategy and Policy
Area at IIM Bangalore, says, "It is difficult to envisage an Indian IT
player in the global hardware industry. We were very late in opening up
the economy and today, it doesn't make sense to make India a
manufacturing site. The economies of scale will not work out." Gopal
Srinivasan, Past President, MAIT, has a different point of view.

According to him, the hardware industry is divided into several
segments, of which India has a better chance of breaking into areas like
notebooks assembly, peripherals' assemblies and sub-assemblies. What is
important is that in the last one year, more thought has gone into
devising a strategic line of thinking for charting the course of Indian
industry than at any time in the history. The Arthur D Little study
commissioned by MAIT has also looked at the Indian strategic issues and
has made some recommendations in this regard.

The Question Of Need

Indian companies have been hamstrung by the notion that product
development is a resource-intensive business and has not been very
aggressive in that area. However, in the process several important
issues have got sidetracked and not been pushed as aggressively as they
ought to have been. For instance, surely, we could have worked on
developing regional language interfaces for operating systems and made a
difference to acceptance of computers across the country, and not just
in English-speaking pockets. These are simple straight-forward answers
to admittedly complex issues. Clearly, Indian companies need to
re-invent industries and re-generate strategies as opposed to merely
reengineering their processes. For, strategizing is not all about
safeguarding the present businesses and industries. It has more to do
with inventing new ones and re-inventing the old ones. Like Dr CK
Prahlad and Gary Hamel say in their bestseller Competing For The Future,
"It's a pre-requisite for getting to the future first and a pre-
condition for staying out in front." Dr MB Athreya, Management Advisor,
comments, "I have been advocating since the liberalization paradigm
shift of 1991 that Indian companies should go for a grand vision of high
growth, with long-term strategic planning. This is particularly true for
Indian IT industry, where hardware is growing at 40 percent p.a. and
software at 60 percent p.a. There is a possible vision of India being
the world's fifth largest economy by year 2000 A.D., fourth by 2005 and
third by 2010. Indian IT companies should plan with that mindset. The
new Compaqs and Microsofts could emerge from India."

The Road Less Travelled

But for that to happen, Indian IT companies need to pause and ask
themselves a few crucial questions. How do they see themselves by year
2000. Who will be the customers? Would they have the wherewithal to meet
those challenges? What core competencies can they exploit? It is simply
not enough for these companies to go with the tide as we see today in
the case of hardware companies. There isn't a single player who isn't
into software exports as well. It's high time we moved into developing
engineering software as against commercial software. Engineering is an
area where India has immense talent and we could leverage on it and move
up the value chain, instead of deploying them to create commercial
software. The Internet and intranets have come to India in less than 18
months of their capturing the popular imagination of people in the US.

It is still evolving. New ideas and products are emerging daily. It is
hailed as the great equalizer between companies and between nations.

This could be India's chance of becoming first among equals. Nothing
best paraphrases the sentiment than the quote in Competing For The
Future, "Getting to the future is not just about out-running your
competitors bent on reaching the same prize. It is about having one's
own view of what the prize is. There can be as many prizes as runners;
imagination is the only limiting factor."

THE CORPORATE REALMS: A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE PARTICULAR NATURE OF
STRATEGIES THAT SOME IT COMPANIES IN INDIA FOLLOW

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

In India, we may not have instances like Hewlett-Packard--which
re-invented itself and recreated an industry--but we have been witness
to companies that have restructured and re-invented themselves.

Companies that have successfully carved out a space for themselves
despite the presence of bigger players and in some cases, like Intel,
developed their market beyond the limiting borders.

There are quite a few companies--like Mindware and UB Networks--that are
trying to do what has never been done before in India, or elsewhere. For
instance, UB is introducing the concept of buy-backs--a popular concept
in the white goods industry--wherein it will replace all old unmanaged
stackable hubs with chassis-based hubs. Similarly, Mindware is
experimenting with a new concept in people management.

The companies that follow have employed various strategies at various
points in time, to anchor themselves better in the market. It might
appear that several segments and companies have been left out or
ignored, but we have taken representative categories and not companies.

INTEL INSIDE:

This insignia stamped outside the CPUs of PCs was Intel Corp.'s first
step to come out from the bowels of the motherboard to the outside world
and virtually swamp the world of computing with Intel-made newer and
faster chips. Hardly surprising that soon Intel Inside became more of
`Intel Everywhere'. In India too. And it is to Intel's credit that it
has succeeded in the Indian market which traditionally has been slow to
accept change on a first-come-first-serve basis.

The world markets may have been all frenzied over Pentium, but even in
1994-95, less than 9 percent of the PCs sold in India had Pentium
processors inside. And the situation a year ago hadn't changed
dramatically--the Indian market lagged behind the developed world by
approximately 12-18 months in terms of usage of the latest
microprocessors. In less than a year, the time lag has been cut to nine
months, and today, the penetration of Pentium's stand at over 60
percent.

The credit in large measure goes to Atul Vijaykar, who came as Country
Manager (India) mid last year. If, on one hand, he pushed Intel Corp. to
reduce prices on its chips, on the other, he convinced the Indian
corporates to adopt the latest chip technology. He pushed for increased
usage of computers not just in corporate segments but in schools as
well. In fact, he set up a Cyber School at the Delhi National Science
Centre and recently organized a multimedia show for children along with
Tangerine. He went one step further and brought virtually an army of
small vendors who were assembling PCs, including the grey market
vendors, under the ambit of Intel. So much so that, today, they use the
Intel Inside logo as a seal of guarantee and quality.

Pushing the market in all possible directions, he has succeeded in
keeping up the promise made a year ago that 75MHz Pentium systems of
standard configuration would be available between Rs 50,000 and Rs
60,000, not of an MNC brand though, by late 1996. Of course, Intel's
task was made simpler with the reduction in duties and falling prices of
memory. Admittedly, Intel really has no competitors in the Indian market
to lose sleep over yet, but Vijaykar, not leaving anything to chance,
has managed to galvanize the market for Intel and Pentium-based systems
like never before. The only semblance of competition that they face is
from Apple's PowerPC systems. And if Apple had harbored hopes of
harnessing a bulk of the market before everybody swung the Intel way,
clearly Vijaykar's coming has hammered the proverbial last nail on the
coffin.

MICROLAND'S MACRO VIEW:

MicroLand certainly didn't discover networking. That was done by Zenith
way before MicroLand even came into the picture. But it sure pioneered
networking as an industry in India. And if we have over 35 systems
integrators today, providing networking solutions in the low and medium
end of the corporate market, it is thanks to MicroLand, which
single-handedly spawned off the industry.

But that is not the only reason why MicroLand gets mentioned here. It
has consistently looked beyond the `now' and done what most others
considered impossible. For instance, when it landed the authorized
distributor deal from Compaq, it was an insignificant company, barely a
force to be reckoned with in India. Similarly, when it tied up with all
the leading players in every aspect of networking--from local to
enterprise-wide--it was doing more than just bringing world-class
networking products to India. Pradeep Kar, MD, was also communicating at
large that if the world leaders thought fit to go with MicroLand, then
MicroLand must be a company capable of delivering world-class solutions.

Every single move was pre-meditated. Like in the old days when Jenson
and Nicholson became synonymous with paints through its advertising
slogan `When you see color, think of us,' MicroLand has used the same
associating strategy with Connectivity India (CI). MicroLand effectively
exploited the potential of the CI forum to leverage its networking
solution-providing capabilities. A measure of MicroLand's success can be
gauged from the fact that, despite its size, it is associated with
companies like Wipro and TISL.

Though MicroLand is viewed with skepticism in some quarters--it is
believed that MicroLand has reached its peak and will flatten out--it is
more of a proactive company moving up the value chain more consistently
than many others. It exploited the fact that organizations moved to a
rhythm and that this would deter companies like TISL or DEIL from doing
the same. The general belief is that the associating strategy that
worked so well for networking is unlikely to work in case of Internet
India. Since the market is yet to open out, it remains a debatable
issue.

ADVANTEC'S ADVANTAGE:

Two years ago, Advantec Network Systems was hardly known but today it is
one of the fastest growing companies in the field of providing a
one-stop shop for networking solutions. No, it is not a systems
integrator. It just acts as a `via media' for the systems integrators by
stocking all the major networking products like hubs and switches.

Neither is it a master warehousing agent. Advantec is somewhere in
between the two. Today, Advantec is the single-point hub that supports,
trains, and provides just-in-time delivery and credit to over 120
systems integrators. These 120 systems integrators include the smallest
to the largest, namely, Wipro. It has spread itself over two regional
depots and 40 warehouses in India to deliver network components whenever
and wherever in the shortest possible time. Though Advantec started as a
distributor for AT&T's structured cabling Systimax--it accounts for
nearly 60 percent of AT&T's Systimax sales in India--it figured quickly
enough that the number of companies providing network solutions would go
up considerably.

It stepped in and devised ways of meeting this need early on by
concentrating on developing skills in the areas of network design,
installation, testing, and certification besides training programmes for
end-users. It acts as a consultant to its team of systems integrators,
pitching in to help them. Now leveraging on its reach, it has put its
network out for the benefit of small systems integrators to pool their
talent and resources to address large enterprise-wide networking tasks.

GODREJ'S GAINS:

Godrej nearly came to be labelled the Jack-of-all-trades,
master-of-none, for reasons more than not having a focus--it changed its
name thrice in as many years. It was into everything--from research and
development in CAD/CAM to the manufacture of printers and distribution
and marketing. It came close to losing everything but fortunately
several rounds of transformation led the company to its area of core
competency--distribution--sooner than later. A competency Godrej and
Boyce is traditionally known for.

Today, Godrej Pacific Technology Ltd (GPTL), after its joint venture
with Tech Pacific of Australia--one of the largest OA product
distribution company in Asia--is one of the largest distributors in
India. Given that distribution is now a major strategic area for most
companies in IT, GPTL can be safely said to have arrived.

INDIAN IT COMPANIES: A CASE FOR REENGINEERING

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

If Indian IT companies desire global competitiveness and viability, it
is necessary that they transform now and wholly.

The World Competitiveness Survey of 1994 ranked India 39 out of 41
emerging economies on parameters ranging from customer responsiveness to
TQM. The recently released 1996 Update hasn't shown much change with
India ranking 46 out of 49 countries. If this is representative of the
Indian standing in global markets in general, the IT industry doesn't
fare much better. Despite the brave show put on by the software exports
industry in the face of accelerating worldwide competition, penetration
of IT within India and the ability of Indian organizations to stand
shoulder to shoulder with global leaders is still poor, with only the
odd firm standing out occasionally as an exception to the general
mediocrity that pervades the Indian IT scene.

What ails this industry? Can the entire blame be assigned to the
sluggish domestic demand or is the malaise within the industry itself?

If India is to be a force to be reckoned within the next millennium,
will a little patching and plumbing suffice or do we need fundamental
rethinking and radical redesign of the industry's business processes to
achieve a dramatic turnaround in perception and fortunes?

The case for reengineering is brought into sharp focus if we analyze the
status of the industry today and the achievements it has made in the
last few years. We see a domestic hardware industry that is on its knees
and under threat of obliteration by foreign brands, a software industry
that is still known more for its forays overseas with a service
portfolio that is only slowly shifting from body shopping and legacy
systems to leading edge technologies, and a training industry that
produces close to a million trained personnel every year but is still
making only a small dent in the demand-supply gap for international
quality software professionals.

On the other hand, the industry still has a lot going for it. The Arthur
D Little Survey for MAIT on the Competitiveness of the Indian IT
Hardware Industry for Exports mentions low labour rates, well-trained
engineers, and a large domestic market as key opportunities that can
propel Indian IT companies to worldclass status. The presence of well
organized associations in every segment of the industry--NASSCOM, MAIT,
NACT, Indian Internet Forum etc. augurs well for the collective
capability of the industry. But as the study points out, the perception
of the global customer ranges from, "Doing business with India is a
headache," to, "I would source from them if they had better quality!"
A look at the Arthur D Little perception of the weakest areas in the
Indian hardware industry compared to global brand owner expectations
show the following areas to be addressed in order of weakness.

Quality
Volume Flexibility
Delivery
Cost Reduction Ability
Management Capability
Technological Position
Communication Capability
Financial Strength
Cost

While this is based on the hardware industry, the software sector too
would exhibit a rather similar list of priority areas. And these can be
broadly classified in three areas that require drastic improvement.

A Business Processes
B Customer Responsiveness
C Infrastructural Support

If each of these areas are addressed meticulously and urgently, there is
still a chance that India can be an IT Superpower by the year 2000. Let
us see what that is going to take and who are the parties that will have
to get involved to expedite the transformation.

Reengineering Business Processes

For both the hardware and software sectors of the industry, the two key
business processes are new product development and order fulfillment.

While new product development may still be a little while away for the
hardware industry and is just being seen as crucial for the software
industry, this will be a process that will determine our long-term
success in the global arena. What is, however, crying out for immediate
reengineering is order fulfillment. Day after day, one hears horror
stories of computers delivered months after the committed date, software
contract cancellations on account of major delays, and even training
courses that finish a year later than the committed finish date. Every
Indian company must understand that delivering on time is not an option
but an imperative for international business. Comprehensive
reengineering exercises of the entire process, from the time the first
buyer-supplier handshake takes place, to the receipt of the last payment
must be done with no respect for existing functions, departments, and
non-value adding activities that inhibit on-time fulfillment.

Anticipating And Satisfying Customer Needs

The best product in the world is no good if the customer needs or
perceives he needs something else. The slow take-off of the SOHO market
in India is just one case in point of international products launched in
India with mega advertising and great fanfare only to meet with strong
disinterest from skeptical customers. The IT vendor in India is already
known as a hit-and-run salesman, more interested in closing the sale and
collecting his commission than building long term alliances with the
customer.

The venerable CK Prahlad talks about building opportunity share rather
than getting obsessed with today's market shares. The companies who
succeed or even survive into the twenty first century will be those with
a clear vision of customer needs, a commitment to satisfying and
exceeding customer expectations at all times, and building long-lasting
customer value. In the decade that this author has spent in the IT
Industry, no Indian company can truthfully claim this stature today!

Creating A Supportive Infrastructure

One of the gems that Vittal used to throw at IT chieftains was "When the
going gets tough, the tough go to the Government!" While this point is
worth noting, when it comes to improving organizations within the
existing framework, the Government too has one responsibility if it
truly wishes to see a global IT industry emerge in India--and that is to
provide at least a semblance of infrastructural support that will enable
customer response and order fulfillment to be maximized and force the
world to take India seriously. In a world where electronic data
interchange is the order of the day, email is struggling to make its
presence felt in India, and while the information superhighway is
knocking at Indian doors, the number of Internet subscribers is still to
touch the five-figure mark.

This is one activity where the industry associations have to be working
on a daily basis with the Government. Instead of attempting to be all
things to all people and spouting new jargon at every conceivable forum,
MAIT, NACT, and IIF should follow the excellent example of NASSCOM and
work hard to make the Government and their respective segments of the
industry, work together to create a better future for the entire Indian
IT industry.

Will the industry captains wake up and steer the IT ship to the promised
land or will we all flounder and see our global aspirations shattered on
the stark rocks of global realities?

ALPHA REVENUE PACES SOLID SECOND QUARTER FINANCIALS

CASH PICTURE UNCHANGED:  DIGITAL ON JAN. 23 REPORTED NET INCOME OF
$148.8 million, or $0.91 per common share, for the second quarter,
which ended December 30, 1995, compared with net income of $18.9
million, or $0.07 per common share, for the same period last year.
But cash remained the same as in the first quarter, and grew less
than $400 million since last year.

Digital cited the strong performance of its 64-bit Alpha-based
computer lines as one of the key reasons for healthy sales.  Sales
in these lines grew by 50 percent over the prior year, with
strongest demand shown for AlphaServer systems.  Strong sales
growth was reported also in the Alpha workstation products,
especially those shipping with Windows NT.

Total operating revenue for the quarter was $3.95 billion, up 14
percent from the $3.47 billion for the comparable quarter a year
ago.

Gross margin for the quarter was 32.6 percent, compared with 33.1
percent for the comparable period in the prior year and 32.2
percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.

Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.11 billion,
essentially unchanged from the same period last year, on higher
revenue.  Current period operating expenses reflected previously
announced demand generation initiatives, including variable sales
and distribution costs associated with increased volumes.

The increase in product sales over last year is a healthy sign
that Digital's profit is not just coming from belt-tightening.

The company ended the quarter with approximately 61,100 employees,
down 4,500 from a year ago and 400 from the first quarter of the
current fiscal year.

"Digital is solidly into a strategic growth phase, as demonstrated
by our highest quarterly revenue ever," said Digital Chairman
Robert B. Palmer.  "We enjoyed significant revenue growth in all
of our product businesses and in our new service offerings.  We
also recorded good revenue growth in all geographies.  I am
optimistic we will experience continued growth as we move into the
second half of our fiscal year."

"I am pleased that our efforts have produced five consecutive
quarters of improving profits, on a year-over-year basis," said
CFO Vincent J. Mullarkey.  "We clearly achieved accelerated
revenue and profit growth during the quarter.  We are experiencing
strong demand across the company for all of our new product and
service offerings.

"Over the course of the next two years, Digital will continue to
concentrate on improving operations to bring profit levels in line
with the computer industry's leading financial performers,"
Mullarkey said.

Product revenues were up 26 percent in the quarter to $2.35
billion from $1.87 billion in the second quarter of last year, and
the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year product revenue
growth.

ALPHA RESULTS

The company's 64-bit Alpha systems sales grew by 50 percent over
the prior year, driven by strong demand for AlphaServer systems.
Digital's total Alpha-generated revenue since introduction three
years ago, now exceeds $7 billion.

The company reported revenue growth and increasing demand in its
AlphaStation line, with particularly strong growth in workstations
shipping with Windows NT.  Workstation products range from
Intel-based personal workstations to the industry-leading 64-bit
AlphaStation 600.

Digital also unveiled an advanced software translation and
emulation technology that enables high-performance x86
compatibility on Alpha systems.  The FX!32 software provides Alpha
users the same suite of Microsoft Windows applications that run on
x86 systems.

PERSONAL COMPUTERS

Digital recorded strong revenue growth in its personal computer
business.

"Two quarters ago we redirected the course of our PC business to
balance growth and financial performance," Palmer said.  "This
strategy is working.  We continue to capture additional market
share, with more than 40 percent revenue growth in the second
quarter, as demand for our full range of Intel-based personal
computer products accelerates."

Revenue from the company's components product businesses,
including storage subsystems and network products, grew more than
30 percent over last year.  The Storage Business Unit, a supplier
of platform-neutral storage solutions, saw strong revenue growth
in its StorageWorks products.  The Network Products Business Unit
also experienced revenue growth in its switching and hub products.

The company's service revenues were $1.604 billion, essentially
unchanged from the same period last year.  While VAX maintenance
revenues were down slightly, the decline was offset by the
significant growth in the company's new multivendor services,
network integration services and Alpha systems maintenance and
support.

The company continues to make progress in improving overall gross
margin trends, Mullarkey said.

Product gross margin was 32.5 percent, compared with 30.5 percent
in the second quarter of a year ago.  Service gross margin was
32.7 percent compared with 36.1 percent in the comparable period
last year, reflecting the expected shift in mix towards new high
growth, but somewhat lower margin multivendor service and support
offerings.

Digital ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash,
essentially unchanged from the first quarter and an increase of
$362 million compared with last year.

"I am pleased with many aspects of our asset management
performance, with solid improvements in asset turns for both
inventory and property, plant and equipment," Mullarkey said.  He
said Digital needed to improve the effectiveness of managing
accounts receivable, which stood at about $3.5 billion.  He also
said he was confident the company had enough cash now and in the
future to finance operations.

DIGITAL UNLEASHES HARDWARE BARRAGE

January, especially the last few days thereof, proved a busy time
for Digital in the hardware area.

In a span of only a few days the Maynard, Mass.-based computer
maker introduced upgraded 64-bit RISC-based AlphaServer models, a
new 133 MHz Pentium-based enterprise PC server with symmetric
multiprocessing, and a new workstation with a 64-bit 333 MHz Alpha
microprocessor.

Following is an overview and summary of the new machines:

ALPHASERVERS

Digital announced significant enhancements to the AlphaServer
family of 64-bit RISC systems on Jan. 30.  The company upgraded
the server line with added processor power, increased throughput,
new server management software, as well as lower costs.

* The AlphaServer 8400 enterprise server will now be available
with up to 12 350 MHz Alpha 21164 processors.  (The six-CPU
AlphaServer 8200 system will also be available with the more
powerful chip.)  The four-CPU AlphaServer 2100 and two-CPU
AlphaServer 2000 systems are now faster as well, upgraded with the
300 MHz Alpha 21164 microprocessors.

Users can upgrade to the 5/350 system with a simple CPU and clock
module upgrade.  Existing memory, I/O, base operating system
licenses and layered product software options continue to be
supported on the 5/350 system offerings.

The new AlphaServer 8400 5/350 provides audited database
performance of 11,456 transactions per minute (tpmC) at $286/tpmC
using the 64-bit Oracle7 Unix database.  The systems support the
OpenVMS 64-bit software environment.

AlphaServer 8400 5/350 systems will be available in March, priced
from $319,000 with two CPUs, 512MB of memory, and 2GB disk.

* A new version of the AlphaServer 2100, the 2100A, has eight PCI
and three EISA slots for higher bandwidth and faster access to
larger databases and high-speed real-time data access devices.
Earlier versions had only three PCI slots.  Similarly, the new
single-processor AlphaServer 1000A system has seven PCI slots and
two EISA slots.

Digital believes the 2100A 5/300 system is the world's fastest and
most cost-effective Windows NT platform, providing 3194.4 tpmC at
$196/tpmC running Microsoft SQL Server V6.5 client/server database
management system.  The 2100A is targeted at customers with large
disk farms, multiple network segments, and heavy I/O applications.
Available now, the AlphaServer 2100 5/300 system is priced from
$52,430 with one CPU, 128MB of memory, and 2GB disk.

*  The single processor AlphaServer 1000 4/266 workgroup/network
system holds the world record for single-processor performance and
price/performance on any operating system or database -- 1153.7
tpmC at $229/tpmC running Microsoft SQL Server V6.5.  By tripling
the number of available PCI slots, network throughput is
increased, enhancing customers' use of multiple disk controllers
and multiple network controllers/segments.  The 1000A system is
targeted at Internet platforms for electronic commerce,
information distribution, and collaboration.  The system is
available with Internet and World Wide Web server software.  The
AlphaServer 1000A 4/233 systems are available in March and priced
from $13,680 with 32MB of memory, and 1.05GB disk.  The system is
offered with a range of CPU performance -- 233 or 266 MHz -- each
in a deskside pedestal, rackmount, or cabinet configuration.

* The systems have free ServerWORKS software for easier management
of SNMP-based distributed network environments.

All AlphaServer systems now include ServerWORKS Manager software
free of charge.  ServerWORKS is launched from within the
MANAGEWORKS Workgroup Administrator.  MANAGEWORKS, also included
in the package, enables system administrators to monitor and
manage multiple network operating systems and SNMP-compliant
devices on a common LAN.  The package provides users a server
management and distributed network management package for
Digital's AlphaServer and Intel based Prioris systems and other
network devices.

* Prices were cut on current AlphaServer 2100, 2000, and 400
models.  For example, prices are reduced on the popular
AlphaServer 2100 5/250 system from $43,390 to $38,430, or 11
percent.

PRIORIS ZX 5133MP PC SERVER

The Prioris ZX 5133MP superserver, announced Jan. 30, is the lead
product in Digital's a new line of Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)
enterprise PC servers carrying the "ZX" designation.  Based on the
133 MHz Pentium chip, the Prioris ZX 5133MP is targeted at
enterprise-class applications.  The company also announced the
immediate availability of new Pentium processor models of the
Prioris LX, Prioris XL Server and Prioris HX PC servers.

The ZX 5133MP is a scalable superserver for resource-intensive
applications such as database transaction processing, decision
support, groupware, internet access, and general file and print or
e-mail services for large LANs.  It is optimized as a
line-of-business application server suitable for large branch
offices and remote sites in a variety of industries including
financial services, retail, manufacturing, transportation,
communications and government, and for organizations migrating to
a client/server environment using Windows NT or Unix.

The server incorporates Intel's industry-standard Multi-processing
Specification (MPS 1.1 or 1.4) and supports SMP scalability from
one to four 133 MHz Pentium processors.  Each CPU is equipped with
up to one MB of dedicated secondary level, two-way write-back
cache for maximum performance in database-intensive applications.
Extending Digital's leadership position in PCI technology, the new
system features a dual peer PCI bus and integrated dual Fast/Wide
SCSI controllers to provide maximum throughput for heavy file
sharing and database-intensive tasks.

The machine comes with ECC memory and a maximum memory capacity of
768MB.  The system also has nine total bus-master I/O slots (five
PCI for maximum performance, four EISA for legacy card
compatibility); up to 28GB internal storage capacity with external
support for up to one terabyte; 11 total drive bays including
seven hot-swappable bays; optional redundant power supply,
standard redundant cooling and a rackmount-ready chassis.

It will also include, free, the ServerWORKS Manager software.

The Prioris ZX 5133MP family will be available on February 12,
1996.  A Prioris ZX 5133MP/1 RAID system equipped with a single
Pentium 133 MHz processor, 512KB of synchronous secondary two-way
write-back cache, a dual-channel PCI RAID controller, 32MB of
memory with two-way interleaving, integrated dual Fast/Wide SCSI-2
controllers, a quad-speed CD-ROM drive, and three 2.1GB SCSI hard
disk drives carries a suggested list price of $17,119.

A Prioris ZX 5133MP/2 RAID system equipped with dual symmetric
multiprocessing Pentium 133 MHz processors, 1MB of synchronous
secondary two-way write-back cache per processor, a dual-channel
PCI RAID controller, 64MB of memory with two-way interleaving,
integrated dual Fast/Wide SCSI-2 controllers, a quad-speed CD-ROM
drive, and three 2.1GB SCSI hard disk drives carries a suggested
list price of $24,369.

HIGH-END ALPHASTATION

The AlphaStation 600 5/333 workstation has the newest 64-bit Alpha
microprocessor, the 333 MHz 21164 Alpha chip, and can run the most
popular technical software applications, including offerings from
Parametric Technology, EDS/Unigraphics, Mentor Graphics, Synopsys,
Softimage, ESRI, and others.

AlphaStations are chip and board upgradeable, so technical end
users can upgrade to the AlphaStation 600 5/333 fairly easily.

Digital says the AlphaStation 600 5/333 is the fastest workstation
on the market with record-breaking SPECint95 performance of 9.19
and SPECfp95 performance of 13.2.  It is also the world's first
workstation to break the 400 SPECint92 barrier with 412.4
SPECint92 and to offer a price/performance ratio of
$84.9/SPECint92.  For floating point, it delivers performance of
545.2 SPECfp92.  Integer and floating point capabilities make the
new workstation a suitable platform for complex compute- and
graphics-intensive design applications.

For customers who want to run graphics applications under the
Windows NT operating system, Digital has two midrange 3D graphics
accelerators -- the ZLXp-L1 and ZLXp-L2 boards, announced several
months ago.  With the same graphics performance found in Unix
environments, the L1 and L2 are suitable for mechanical
computer-aided design (MCAD) applications such as Parametric
Technology's PRO/Engineer; 3D animation software such as
Microsoft's Softimage; and others.


Available immediately, the AlphaStation 600 5/333 workstation is
$28,885 for a Windows NT-based version that includes a 17-inch
color monitor, a 1 Gbyte disk, 4 MBytes fast cache, 32 MBytes of
memory, a ZLXp-E1 graphics adapter, floppy, CD-ROM, audio, mouse,
keyboard, and a an industry leading three-year warranty.
AlphaStation workstations also run the Digital Unix and OpenVMS
operating systems.

Digital also said it has cut the price of the AlphaStation 600
5/266 workstation.  A Windows NT-based version is $23,885 for a
package that includes a 17-inch color monitor, a 1 Gbyte disk, 2
MBytes fast cache, 32 MBytes of memory, a ZLXp-E1 graphics
adapter, floppy, CD- ROM, audio, mouse, keyboard, and a three-year
warranty.

NEW 150 MHZ, 166 MHZ PENTIUM CHIPS TO BE USED

Digital early in January announced plans to incorporate the new
150 MHz and 166 MHz Intel Pentium processors across its desktop,
retail and server PC families.  Digital is including the new
processors in several models within its Celebris XL, Celebris GL
and Venturis commercial desktop families and is introducing two
new powerful home computers in its Starion retail line.  The
company also announced that it will offer 166 MHz Pentium-powered
models of its Prioris server line in single- and dual-processor
configurations.

ENHANCED INTERNET ALPHASERVER SOFTWARE KIT UNVEILED

Digital announced the Internet AlphaServer Software Kit for
Digital Unix V.2 this month at Internet World.

Enhancements include graphical Internet AlphaServer administration
software scripts for quick installation and a graphical interface
for setup and management of Internet news groups.  The AlphaServer
system can handle thousands of Internet newsgroups on one server.
The kit also includes tcpwrapper, an enhanced Internet security
application that allows users to turn off certain programs that
expose systems to unsecured Internet traffic, as well as a test to
verify changes.  The enhanced Software Kit can now run in
Digital's DECsafe Available Server Environment (ASE), allowing
users access to their web site even if a failure occurs.

"The Net is today's hot spot for doing business.  No company can
afford to ignore the business implications of representation on
the Internet.  It's the global vehicle for expanding users
markets, taking offerings worldwide and laying a strong foundation
for future commerce," said Rose Ann Giordano, vice president of
Digital's Internet Business Group.

The 64-bit Digital UNIX architecture can support 1,000
simultaneous domain names, enabling Internet Service Providers to
host multiple customer sites on one server.  The Internet
AlphaServer Software Kit runs in all models of Digital's
AlphaServer family.  The kit is also prepackaged on two new
AlphaServer systems including the 1000/266 and 400/233.

"SUPER SPIDER:" DIGITAL'S INTERNET SEARCH TOOL

Within weeks of its introduction, Digital says, its advanced
"super spider" technology has become the fastest-growing
information search and indexing capability on the Internet's World
Wide Web.

The technology's super spider and super indexer employ
next-generation software and advanced networking, powered by
Digital's AlphaServer 8400 system.  The scalable hardware has
quadrupled its original capacity -- from two to eight processors,
and double the memory -- to keep pace with demand.

The super spider technology conducts comprehensive searches of the
entire Web faster than spiders used in conventional information
search services.  It creates and dispatches a "brood of spiders"
that crawls the entire Web.  Second-generation scalable software
simultaneously locates and indexes text as it finds Web pages.  A
search engine enables Web users to conduct precise searches for
specific information by looking for phrases, specifying key words,
using case-sensitive matches, and restricting searches to titles
or other parts of a document.

The super spider has searched up to 2.5 million pages per day,
finding and indexing information.  It is enroute to finding every
page and indexing every word of text on the Web, Digital said.


@STANDFRAME = Digital News Briefs

* Digital and INNOSOFT INTERNATIONAL INC. ANNOUNCED A WORLDWIDE

Photoresist Coats
Tube Interiors

Chunghwa Picture Tubes (Illinois) was awarded U.S. Patent 5,536,994
for a new thin film photoresist for the inside of cathode ray tubes
on July 16, 1996.  A description follows.

The inner surface of a video display panel such as cathode ray tube
(CRT) glass faceplate is initially coated with a mixture of one of
the primary color phosphors, an organic binder such as polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) diluted with water, and a photoresist agent. The
organic binder overcomes the poor adhesion to the glass faceplate
of the photoresist which typically includes polyvinyl pyrrolidone
(PVP) and reduces the oxygen which decreases phosphor exposure
time.

To overcome PVA and PVP incompatibilities which give rise to
nonuniform film thickness, a vinyl pyrrolidone-vinyl alcohol (VP-
VA) copolymer is added to the phosphor, organic binder and
photoresist mixture in the range of 0.1-30 wt%. The copolymer with
both the VP and VA functioning groups serves as a coupling agent
between the PVA and PVP and eliminates incompatibilities between
these components. The VP-VA copolymer preferably has a VP/VA mole
ratio in the range of 20/80 to 80/20.

latest highest speed PCI logic chipset, support for all 486 class
up to Pentium Class 586 CPUs, PCI accelerated video with flat panel
interface, and onboard controllers for SCSI-2 LAN, touch screen,
floppy and hard drives (PCI EIDE to PIO mode 4) and a 16 bit sound
chip with amplifier and operational flash disk support.

The PCI onboard bus implementation runs at the maximum PCI
specification of 33 MHz, and connects the vital high throughput
peripherals (Ethernet LAN, SCSI, hard drive and video system) to
the CPU by the fastest possible means to avoid delays in system
performance.  The DPX-57 also supports EDO RAM up to 64 MB for
system memory.

The video system is based around the latest chipsets and includes
up to 2 MB VRAM, 64-bit hardware video acceleration, hardware video
playback support via a VESA advanced feature connector and PCI CPU
connection with Burst Mode and BIOS ROM support.  Video expansion
via the VAFC allows overlay of real time video from NTSC/PAL or
MPEG sources such as CCD video cameras, VCR or frame grabber.

The DPX-57 is ideal for embedded control applications particularly
those using a flat screen display.  All flat panel technologies are
supported including AMLCD (TFT), FSTN color and monochrome, EL and
plasma.  High resolution flat panel displays up to 1280 x 1024
pixels can be driven.  The onboard touch screen decoder opens up a
whole range of POS, factory automation, SCADA (Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition), man-machine interface and operator interface
applications.  In addition to flat panels, the DPX-57 will drive
non-interlaced CRT monitors.

The high level of integration and compact size ensures this unit's
suitability for a wide range of industrial, commercial and OEM

NEC Research
Improves Phosphors

The fact that NEC is a player in flat panel displays does not mean
that the company is giving up on the CRT.  A recent example
supports their continuing advancements in this traditional display
technology.  NEC's CromaClear CRT features illuminated elliptical-
shaped phosphors designed to improve color saturation, focus, and
contrast.  The design benefits the display of video windows and
complex multi-media images.

A video boost feature also improves video applications by
maximizing contrast and brightness to closely approximate the image
brightness of video and TV.  Offered in 15-in. and 17-in. sizes,
the MultiSync M family of monitors also has integrated speakers and
microphone.

Hitachi Markets
Large Screens

High brightness and high display density are required for desktop
computers with paper-white displays on white backgrounds.  Hitachi
(Tokyo, Japan) has met this need through the development of two
types of color display tubes (CDTs) that are capable of displaying
more than 2 million pixels.

One model, the 51 cm CDT, has a fine phosphor screen with
horizontal and vertical dot pitches of 0.22 and 0.16 mm,
respectively.  Information with 1,600 pixels by 1,200 lines can be
displayed on the A3-size screen.  The other model, the 56-cm CDT,
has a horizontally extended screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio that
has an excellent human visual angle.  It can display information
with 1,920 pixels by 1,080 lines.

Both new tubes feature a recently developed elliptical aperture
dynamic focus (A-EA-DF) electron gun with high focus.  They can
display over 2 million pixels of information with top notch
brightness and contrast.  In addition, they can operate at
horizontal scanning frequencies of 107 kHz or more, which provides
high-quality paper-white image with no flicker.

Monitor Designed for
Different Work Sites

A new LCD monitor made by RDI Computer Corp. (Carlsbad, CA) is
designed to be easily transported to a variety of worksites.
Tradenamed the PowerScreen, it is a standalone monitor with a 12.1-
in. diagonal, 1024 x 768 high resolution active matrix LCD.  It
weighs just 12.5 lbs. (60% lighter than comparable CRTs), and is
only 1 1/2 inches in depth.  The PowerScreen offers almost the same
viewable image size as a conventional 14-in. monitor.

As a special feature, the PowerScreen is available without
plastics.  That is, it can be integrated into a user's own system
for embedded applications such as process control, test and
measurement, and medical analyses.  In this configuration, the flat
panel module weighs just 8 lbs. and is only 1 1/4 in. deep.  Since
it can be wall mounted or embedded in equipment, it is ideal for
many OEM requirements.

Other benefits include 70% less power than most standard 14-in.
monitors and static free operation.  It is not affected by magnetic
induction and does not produce harmful x-ray emissions.  In
addition, it connects directly to a Sun SPARC workstation or PC
without adding hardware or software, and supports a variety of VESA
monitor timing standards.

RDI is known for its PowerLite ExtraView 110 portable workstation
that has a high resolution, 12.1-in. display with full SPARCstation
5 performance.  For more information, contact: RDI, 2300 Faraday
Ave., Carlsbad, CA 92008; Tel: 619/929-0992, Fax: 619/929-9702,

Desktop Market Is
Wide Open to LCDs

Two factors are bringing the liquid crystal display closer to the
CRT in the lucrative desktop market.  One is improving performance
of the LCD and the other, possibly more important, is the gradual
reduction in LCD monitor prices.  As the two key types of displays
get closer, pressure is mounting on the CRT.

A key advantage of flat panels is, and has always been, the need
for less space.  Recently, the New York Stock Exchange upgraded its
trading floor and, in the process, replaced their CRTs with LCDs
made by Sharp.  This is a prime example of how these flat panels
are being adapted even though the price is several times that of
the conventional CRT.  Another advantage that led to the
replacement of cathode ray tubes in a hospital is the fact that
LCDs do not present magnetic interference problems with medical
equipment.

Now that the laptop market is close to saturation, LCD makers such
as Sharp Electronics are saying that replacement of the CRT desktop
computer monitors will begin in the fourth quarter.  Sharp uses
some rough calculations about relative prices that we have also
heard from other companies and industry watchers.  For example, if
prices of LCDs fall to 3 times that of CRTs, there will be a market
potential of 5% of the desktop monitor market or 3 million units by
1997.  If LCD prices drop to 2 times the CRTs, the potential
increases to 15% or approximately 9 million units.  Most industry
experts agree that if price parity were to be achieved, the LCD
would be far ahead of the CRT in the desktop market.

Sharp isn't the only company playing in this field.  Others,
including Compaq and NEC, are also looking at the vast potential in
the desktop market.  Aerospace, graphic design and medical imaging
are emerging markets for the LCD desktop monitors.  But Sharp
recently opened an advanced manufacturing facility in Japan and
third generation manufacturing techniques will mass produce large
format LCDs.  Competition is heating up and, with all the emphasis
on reduced production cost, our guess is that it won't be long
until the CRT is under more pressure from LCD desktop units.

Memory Capabilities
Can Be Improved

Ferroelectric chiral smectic liquid crystals with improved contrast
ratios and memory capabilities, developed by scientists at Sumitomo
Chemical Co., Ltd. (Sumitomo Bldg., 5-33 Kitahama, 4-Chome, Chuo-
ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6/220 3272, Fax: 6/220 3345), are
intended for use in optical shutters and liquid crystal displays
(LCDs).  Among the advantages of LCDs, reports Chizu Sekine in U.S.
Patent 5,545,345, are a thin profile, light weight, a low driving
voltage, and low power demand.

Two types of driving systems, active matrix-addressed and passive
matrix-addressed, are commonly used.  In active matrix-addressed
systems, a thin film transistor or diode made of polysilicon or
amorphous silicon is connected to each picture element.  The
drawbacks of active matrix-addressed systems include problems in
assembling large area displays with good memory density.  Achieving
reasonable production costs is difficult, too--manufacturing is
complicated, and yields are low.

Passive matrix-addressed systems include two types: twisted nematic
and supertwisted nematic LCDs.  The optical response of such a
device is based on the average orientation of the molecular axis of
the liquid crystal in a specific direction, based on anisotropy of
the dielectric constant of the liquid crystal molecule, which, in
turn, is caused by the application of an electric field.  As a
result, the device's optical response speed is measured in
milliseconds, far too slow for the computers of the future.

The new Sumitomo Chemical ferroelectric chiral liquid crystals are
characterized by bistability, a property that causes such a
crystal, when held between a pair of glass plates--each carrying a
transparent electrode--to have two different optically stable
states, depending on directions of the applied electric field.  The
two optically stable states are maintained after the removal of the
electric fields.  As a result, such devices do not suffer from
decreased contrast ratios or cross-talk, even when the number of
scanning lines is increased.

Another advantage of the ferroelectric liquid crystals is their
high response speed, about 1,000 times faster than those of twisted
nematic and supertwisted nematic LCDs.  The crystals are based on
an alkyl group with 5-15 carbon atoms.  They also include a second
alkyl group with 1-10 carbon atoms or an alkoxyalkyl group with 2-
10 carbon atoms, of which one may be replaced by a halogen atom.

Sanyo Electric (Tokyo, Japan) has done something unique to its 3-D
monitor that is intended to make it more practical.  The company
offers an option to 2-D viewing as well.

The 3-D display is based on Sanyo's image splitters, which are
extensions of a technology developed by Japan's government-owned
broadcasting network, NHK.  But viewers have difficulty in reading
text in 3-D so Sanyo added the 2-D function.  If, for example, the
3-D monitor is used with a PC, the operator can specify one portion
of the screen as 3-D and another as 2-D, thus separating objects
that will be seen in 3-D from text.

Switching back and forth is done with the assistance of special on-
off shutters.  When the switch is on, the splitters divide the
right and left eye images which creates the 3-D effect.  When the
switch is off, the image becomes 2-D.  The shutter is a single
sheet that can easily be added to the 3-D monitors.

Markets include medical applications, where a CAT scan image can be
shown in 3-D and the patient's chart could be read in two
dimensions.  The education field also offers numerous opportunities
for this technology with images in 3-D and explanatory text in 2-D.
Games are also seen as a potential market.

Microlens Arrays
Improve Lighting

Light throughput in a helmet mounted display has been increased by
two orders of magnitude through the use of microlens arrays
according to researchers at Hughes Danbury Optical Systems (HDOS,
Danbury, CT).  The company is developing a subtractive color
display that includes a lamp, polarizers and three 1024 x 1024
active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs).

In a typical display of this type, there is a loss of light that
lowers brightness and contrast since light passes from one pixel on
the first AMLCD through several pixels on the second and third
AMLCDs.  To overcome this problem, the researchers sandwich the
AMLCDs between microlens arrays that focus light into the active
area of each pixel.  There is a microlens before and after each
pixel in the light path.

There is one major problem, however.  Diffractive microlens arrays
are not totally effective because of the small size of each lens
and some light scattering problems.  To solve this dilemma, HDOS
researchers designed and made, by a proprietary process, analog
refractive elements.  The minimum center-to-center spacing of these
microlenses is about 10 um, and they are supposedly working better
than diffractive optics.

To compare the difference using the arrays, about 30% of the
illumination reaches the screen location, as opposed to less than
1% with no microlenses.  The company is looking into additional
applications for these lenses.

Active Matrix Color
Touch Monitor

National Integration Services (Rochester, NY) a leader in
customized touchscreen products, introduced the 1040VTT, a new
10.4-in. TFT Active Matrix LCD touch monitor.  Offering users plug-
and-play simplicity in a stylized, injection molded ABS housing,
the new product weighs only 6 lbs., is compact (11.9 x 4.9 x 10.9
in.), and is a low consumer of power.  Built around a bright,
crisp, quarter-million color TFT display, the stand-alone touch
monitor is configurable in both vertical and horizontal
orientations.  Accepting direct VBG input at 640 x 480 screen
resolution from a standard PC or Mac, no special video controller
is needed.  On screen display provides simple and quick set up.  A
five year touchscreen warrantee reflects the durability of the
touchscreen surface.  A magnetic stripe card reader is optional and
is useful for storing or updating device settings.

"LCD touch control offers big advantages in Industrial and Process
Control applications," said National Integration president Jim
Odorczyk.  "Their touch-what-you-want simplicity reduces training
time and costs.  They are easy to reconfigure by simply updating
the software.  Input is quick, and they are durable, reliable, easy
to clean, and resistant to heavy workplace abuse.  The 1040VTT is
unique because of its sleek, strong housing, low process, easy set-
up and mounting versatility.  Equipment space is always at a
premium in process control-type applications and our LCD
touchscreen needs only 5 in. of depth when using the optional
vertical mounting plate."

Other benefits include sealed case resistance to liquids and input
accuracy with any stylus such as a finger, gloved hand or pen.
Direct VGA input allows for unlimited distance from the PC and this
keeps the working area free of bulky master units.  The device's
light weight makes for easy mounting on a remote flexible arm.
Replacing both a mouse and a keyboard, its location is not limited
to flat surfaces.  In addition, the LCD is not impacted by magnetic
or electrical fields nearby as are conventional computer monitors.


NIS has comprehensive technical support in the form of plug and
play packages.  Current users of NIS products include Kodak, NASA,
Xerox and Johnson Controls.  The 1040VTTs can be used as individual
units or linked together with other microprocessor-based equipment.

Keeping Tabs
on Soldering Iron

A product called Look, made by Japan Boncoat Co., is an industrial
soldering iron that has a liquid crystal display to graphically
depict real-time temperature variations at the tip of the iron.
The product is aimed at manufacturers of computer equipment.

The company claims several key advantages to users of Look.  It can
improve quality control, increase soldering productivity and lower
the cost of training new workers.  Since changes in temperature and
soldering duration at each site are seen in real time, there are
fewer mistakes and less wasted time, according to the company.

Temperature variations during soldering operations are detected by
a heat sensor at the tip of the iron, and adjustments are made
through a patented "on-load temperature management" method, which
the company is trying to make into an industry standard.

Information is displayed in graphic form on an LCD panel and can be
printed out.  The soldering iron can function as a teaching tool
since it can collect data on the soldering operations of a seasoned
worker and this data can be made into guidelines for new employees.


Japan Boncoat expects to sell 1,000-2,000 units at about $1,100 the
first year in Asia and North America.  Responses from companies
using this new device have been positive.

New Method
Drives AMLCD

The Semiconductor Energy Laboratory Co. Ltd. in Japan was awarded
U.S. Patent 5,543,947 for devising a new way to drive an active
matrix LCD with short pulses for gray scale.

The method consists of driving a liquid crystal electro-optical
device in such a way that the device produces accurate gray tones
with high reproducibility. In this device, a complementary TFT
(thin film transistor) configuration consisting of at least one p-
channel TFT and at least one n-channel TFT is formed per pixel
electrode. One of the input/output terminals of this configuration
is connected to the pixel electrode. The other is connected to a
first signal line.

All the gate electrodes of the TFTs of the configuration are
connected to a second signal line. High-speed pulses are applied to
one of the input/output terminals of the TFT configuration via the
first signal line. A high-speed bipolar signal is applied to the
gate electrodes in synchronism with the pulses, to electrically
charge the pixel.  After the completion of the charging, the
bipolar signal is again applied to the gate electrodes to discharge
the pixel. This series of operations is repeated to produce
halftones.

Production of TV
Monitors Moved Up

In recent additions of DTN, we have reported the rather long range
plans of many plasma panel makers to get into production of TV
displays by 1997 and 1998.  Now it appears there are two updates to
this story: mass production of TV panels is set for this fall, and
many manufacturers are expecting to make plasma displays for the
desktop market.

Plasma display panels are thinner and larger than LCDs and are also
lightweight.  A 40-in. panel is only 10-12 cm thick making this
technology the favorite for wall mounted TVs and placing it in
contention for the desk top market.  Although many in the industry
agree that plasma technology will eventually share the desk top
market with LCDs, they predict it will be a gradual process because
of the high plasma display prices (just over $9,000 for a panel at
the current time).

But plasma makers are building facilities.  Fujitsu Ltd. is
building a 20 billion yen manufacturing plant in southern Japan
that is expected to begin production of 42-in. screens in October
or November of this year.  By 2000, the company expects to invest
another 20 billion yen in production facilities.

Other companies are also expanding.  Pioneer Electronic Corp. has
broken ground in a location northwest of Tokyo that will be able to
make 10,000 panels per month.  They are targeted for production in
March, 1997.  Hitachi Ltd. is building a new production line in
Yokohama that will produce 26- and 40-in. displays.  By 1997, the
company plans to enter the 26-in. version in the desktop market.
NEC Corp. plans to spend 25 billion yen on a new plant in Kagoshima
Prefecture that will be able to make 10,000 screens per month by
1998.  NEC has been making 1,000 panels per month at its Kawasaki
plant since June.

Asahi Glass, which already produces glass substrates for LCDs, will
begin commercial production of substrates for these plasma systems
within a month.  The company expects plasma to become the dominant
technology for screens larger than 40 in.  Asahi is planning
monthly production of 100,000 glass substrates for 42-in. plasma
displays.

Another company, Dai Nippon Printing, is also planning to produce
substrates for large plasma screens by the end of 1997.  In
addition, Corning Inc. and Cie de Saint-Gobain have plans to start
production of large screen plasma display substrates later this
fall.

Despite all this activity, there is a general note of caution in
the plasma display sector.  Demand is still not as strong as many
would like and much of it is focused on public displays such as
those used in train stations and hospitals.  But the large size
screen, thin construction and light weight are advantages that will
assist plasma technology in finding a market.

Organic Panel
Needs Less Power

Idemitsu Kosan Co. (Tokyo) researchers have developed a multicolor,
organic EL display that may portend lower power consumption, full
color displays that will be practical for mobile multimedia
applications.  The company plans to sell the material and license
the technology used to make the display, and reports that it has
already supplied material to several potential customers.

Idemitsu wants companies to evaluate their technology.  According
to a senior researcher, VGA resolution is possible on an
experimental basis, but the driver circuitry and production
technology for a large screen must be developed at the display
manufacturers side.

EL displays that use inorganic materials for the emitting layer
are already on the market and are typically in green or orange and
black configurations.  Organic EL displays are capable of bright
colors, good brightness and contrast, and a better viewing angle
than LCDs.  Idemitsu's EL research started about 10 years ago when
the petroleum refining company began working with an organic
material called DPVBi which emitted a blue light.

The current EL device developed at the Idemitsu Central Research
Labs is a 5-in. square prototype with limited resolution of 16 x 16
pixels.  It has five layers: metal cathodes, an electron
transporting layer, an emitting layer, a hole transporting layer,
and a hole injection layer, topped with anodes made of indium tin
oxide.  This entire sandwich is only 200 nm thick.

A dopant added to the emitting layer improves the emission of a
bright blue light, reaching a peak wavelength of 468 nm.  At 5 V,
the brightness level was approximately 100 candela.  With a 10 V
field, the level rose to about 10,000 candela.

Idemitsu decided against developing multiple emitting materials
that could, on their own, emit red, blue and green.  The process
was considered to be too expensive.  Instead, the blue light
generated by the emissive layer passes through phosphor layers that
act as color filters, changing the blue light to red and to green.
The phosphors absorb a portion of the high energy blue light and
emit green or red light.

The prototype display has 256 square pixels measuring 4.5 mm on a
side.  They consist of three 1.5 x 4.5 mm subpixels of red, blue
and green phosphor stripes.  Most organic materials deteriorate
rapidly, but the material used at Idemitsu has a long life.  The
prototype's half-life is more than 10,000 hrs.

Other companies that are working on organic displays include Sanyo
Electric and Pioneer Electronics.

High Luminance Devices
Use Oxide Phosphors

Researchers at the Electron Device System Lab (Kanazawa Institute
of Technology, Ishikawa, Japan) have demonstrated that oxide
phosphors, which exhibit higher chemical stability than sulphide
phosphors, show promise as emitting layers for thin film
electroluminescent (TFEL) devices.  Zinc gallate (ZnGa204), which
has received attention as a blue-emitting phosphor for vacuum
fluorescent (VFDs) and field emission displays (FEDs), has been
developed for a thin film emitting layer combined with a thick
barium titanate (BaTi03) ceramic sheet insulating layer.

The researchers used a non-symmetrical single insulating layer
device in their study of this material.  Every constituent, except
the back electrode (thermally evaporated aluminum) of this device
was an oxide material.  The emitting layer, insulating layers and
transparent electrode, were composed of ZnGa204 phosphor thin
films, thick BaTi03 ceramic sheet and aluminum-doped zinc oxide
(Zn0:Al) transparent conducting thin film, respectively.

Zinc gallate phosphor thin films were deposited by rf magnetron
sputtering onto the polished barium titanate ceramic sheets.  The
thickness of the films deposited was controlled almost to a
constant 1500 nm.  The phosphor thin films were post-annealed at
1020 C in an argon gas atmosphere.  Luminances as high as 630 and
200 cd/m2 for green emission were obtained for a manganese-
activated zinc gallate device.  Multicolor emission was also
realized through the use of other dopants.

A detailed description of this project is available in the July
issue of the Journal of the Society for Information Display (Santa
Ana, CA 92705, Tel: 714/545-1526, Fax: 714/545-1547).

development of an organic electroluminescent material which can
function at temperatures up to 140C with a turn-on voltage of 2.1
V and an efficiency of 1.25 lm/W.

These materials are being looked to as active components of flat
panel displays but to date the organic electroluminescent materials
have been plagued by degradation of the hole transporting layer,
probably due to Joule heating from the high injection current
utilized for the device operation.  The Toyota group has
synthesized a new hole transporting material, a triphenylamine
tetramer, with a glass temperature of 130C, which permits
operation of the organic electroluminescent device with uniform
light emission.  A typical emitting material, tris (8-
quinolinolato) aluminum (Alq) was used in the device.

Light Valve TV
Relies on Elastomer

A projector that uses an elastomer film inside of a CRT has been
developed in the U.K.  The elastomer layer is placed on the inside
face plate of an electron beam tube.  Then, a mirror is deposited
over the layer, followed by a second elastomer layer.  The layers
are then covered with a dielectric layer which is more rigid than
the elastomers.

The mirror is used as one electrode and the charge pattern
deposited by the electron beam on the dielectric layer makes up the
other electrode.  The electrostatic forces that result deform the
mirror and produce ripples or grooves.  When the mirror is flat,
incident light from the lamp will be reflected and imaged on the
schlieren stop which blocks it and causes the screen to become
black.  When grooves are written, however, incident light will be
diffracted at an angle, lets it miss the stop, and a bright spot is
projected on the screen.  Gray scale can be effected by varying the
magnitude of the charge.  TV pictures are projected by scanning and
modulating the electron beam with video signals.  The charge
pattern and grooves can be removed or erased by secondary electron
emission.

Elastomers can be used inside the vacuum tubes without impacting
the life of the cathode or the electron beam environment.
Prototypes of the modulator have been developed and plans are in
place to build an electron beam-addressed projector.  The
development cost is anticipated to be lower than devices using
active matrix addressing.

Philips Licenses
Light-Emitting Polymer

Philips Components B.V. is the first licensee for a new light-
emitting polymer (LEP) display technique developed by Cambridge
Display Technology Ltd. (CDT), Cambridge, England.  CDT is in
discussions with other major companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia
and expects to make a second announcement concerning a European
company soon.  It has placed manufacturing plans on hold, however,
in favor of a licensing technology.

Philips will pay CDT an upfront licensing fee together with a
royalty on every LEP product it sells, in return for a non-
exclusive right to use the patented technology.  The companies
would not discuss financial details of the agreement which does not
cover any technology transfer.  Philips was already working on LEPs
independently so the agreement should help the company
commercialize devices and develop manufacturing techniques.

Mark Gostick, CDT business development manager, said he expected
that a licensee would commercialize the LEP technology within the
next two years.  CDT plans to build a prototype color-graphics
screen by the end of the decade.

The new emphasis on licensing has scrapped CDT's original plans for
a pilot plant with Xyratex Ltd. (Havant, U.K.).  "We are not going
into manufacturing," said Danny Chapchal, CEO.  "Shortly after I
came on board, it became sensible to pursue a licensing and
technology transfer strategy as the best way to accelerate
introduction of LEP technology.

Philips is not saying how quickly it will use its new license.
"Philips is a major player in displays, and as such we explore all
new technologies," said Robert-Jan Visser, head of polymers and
organic chemistry at Philips Research Labs (Eindhoven, the
Netherlands), which has been working on LEP technology for more
than three years.  "But we do think this technology has a lot to
offer."  The advantages include high luminous efficiency and simple
physical construction.  Since the materials used are plastics, they
should be easier to manufacture.

CDT hopes the technology will find an early, high-volume
application such as a backlight for LCDs.  The revenue generated
from this could help develop high resolution displays.

Lucent Donates
$2M in Equipment

Lucent Technologies recently announced the donation of $2 million
in display manufacturing equipment to the Liquid Crystal Institute.
The gift gives Kent State the distinction of being the first
university in the U.S. to house a complete display manufacturing
line.  The equipment was part of an LCD manufacturing pilot line at
Bell Labs, the R&D arm of Lucent Technologies.

"We believe that this donation will help Kent State University
continue to make important contributions to the advancement of
liquid crystal technology for the benefit of all U.S. industry,"
said Bill Brinkman, executive director of physical sciences and
engineering at Bell Labs.

The pilot line will be transferred to the Institute's new $13.2
million headquarters which will be completed this fall.  "Bell Labs
has a long and distinguished record of liquid crystal research.
Kent State University is honored and enormously grateful to receive
a donation of this importance from Lucent Technologies," said
president Carol A. Cartwright.  "The gift, coupled with a recent
$2.5 million grant from the Ohio Board of Regents, will provide the
Liquid Crystal Institute with a manufacturing line for high-
resolution, flat panel displays that is comparable to the best
among U.S. industry," she added.

Bell Labs used the equipment to develop a better understanding of
display design and manufacturing capabilities and constraints.
University and State of Ohio officials believe that the pilot line,
when combined with technologies under development at the LCI, holds
the potential to enhance manufacturing in Northeast Ohio.  There
should also be new opportunities to work with industry.

Micron Reports
Income Decline

Micron Technology Inc. (Boise, Idaho) reported net income of $593
million, or $2.76 per fully diluted share, on net sales of $3,654
million for the fiscal year ended Aug. 29, 1996.  Fiscal 1995's net
income was $844 million, or $3.90 per fully diluted share, on net
sales of $2,953 million.  Net income for fiscal 1996 declined 30%
from 1995 as the semiconductor memory business was impacted by
sharp declines in average selling prices.

Micron Technology Inc. and its subsidiaries manufacture DRAMs,
SRAMs, FLASH and other semiconductor memory components, remote
intelligent communications (RIC) products, complex printed circuit
board assemblies, field emissive displays, and personal computer
systems.

Fiscal 1996 results were adversely affected by a one-time $30
million pre-tax restructuring charge for discontinuing sales of
ZEOS brand PC systems and closing related PC manufacturing
operations in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the second fiscal quarter.
The restructuring charge reduced 1996 fully diluted earnings per
share by approximately $0.11.

The company's net sales increased 24% in fiscal 1996 compared to
fiscal 1995 as a result of growth in personal computer sales and a
significant increase in megabits of semiconductor memory sold.  PC
system sales increased primarily due to greater acceptance of
Micron brand desktop systems, a higher level of government sales,
and an increase in sales of notebook systems.  The effect on net
sales of the increase in megabits of semiconductor memory produced
was offset by a severe decline (over 75%) in average selling prices
for semiconductor memory.

Steve Appleton, chairman, president and CEO, commented on the
fiscal 1996 results, saying, "We are extremely proud of our team's
outstanding efforts resulting in the second most profitable year in
the company's history.  The execution of the conversion to 8-in.
wafer processing and the transition to the 16 Meg DRAM as our
primary product has been phenomenal.  The emergence of Micron
Electronics as a major competitor in the personal computer direct
sales channel is additionally a significant accomplishment."

Bacteria Form
Display Mask

Astralux Inc. (Boulder, CO), is using bacteria to make quantum
boxes for thin flat panel displays.  Some kinds of bacteria produce
a protein layer that contains an array of identically shaped pores.
Following harvest, this protein layer can be used to make a ceramic
mask for producing silicon boxes.  The array of boxes, patterned by
the mask, is identical and cylindrical.  The pores, and the boxes,
can have diameters from 0.3-10.0 nm depending upon which bacterial
species is used.  Astralux has made 2-nm quantum boxes and
fabricated preliminary electroluminescent (EL) devices.  They also
used the protein layer of bacteria to form a nanostructured
titanium oxide mask with lattice spacing of the holes at 20 nm.

The Ballistic Missile Defense Org. (BMDO) funded this work as part
of its Nanotechnology: Products for the Material World program.
BMDO nanotechnology research focuses on the very small world of
products that are being created using materials or techniques 100
nanometers or less.

Silicon is a good material for this flat panel display project
since it can emit white light, a mixture of all visible light, when
activated optically or electrically.  The masks make silicon
quantum boxes with a uniform size and shape, which can't be done
with porous silicon.  The confinement of the box narrows the
emission spectrum so different colors are emitted by different size
boxes.  This makes the light emission tunable and makes possible
full-color displays.

Astralux is seeking partners to continue its Small Business
Industrial Research (SBIR) funding for the development of
prototypes.

Future Displays
May Be Switched

Researchers at Deacon Research (2440 Embarcadaro Way Palo Alto, CA
94303; Tel: 415/493-6100) have invented a brand new way to
construct flat panel displays.  The display is based on a new
switching technology for routing laser light among a set of optical
waveguides and coupling the light toward the viewer.  Essentially,
the device is an electrically-switchable mirror.  The novel
switching method is based on poled domains established in electro-
optical crystals, such as lithium niobate.  Using this technology,
Deacon claims that both miniature high resolution displays and
large screen display for television formats can be manufactured.

Problems with existing waveguide flat panel display technology are
that compact high resolution displays can not be fabricated due to
the large pixel spacing, inefficient "waveguide taps" limit the
brightness of the display, the power efficiency is low because of
the optical losses, and power cannot be efficiently switched into
another waveguide.

The electrically-controlled switching element is a poled grating,
consisting of alternating poled domains of opposite sign in the
electro-optical crystal.  Within the poled domains of a
ferroelectric crystal such as lithium niobate the electric dipoles
are aligned in the poling direction.  The pattern of poled domains
may be established using an electric field, in-diffusion, or ion-
exchange.

After the poled domains are a set of waveguides fabricated in or on
the substrate.  Typically for lithium niobate, annealed proton
exchange is used to fabricate waveguide structures in the substrate
volume.  The waveguides traverse (are not parallel to) the poled
gratings.  Electrodes are laid to control the gratings; when an
electric field is applied across the grating structure, the
refractive index of the grating region is modulated, depending upon
the direction of the domain poling.

The poled region must extent far enough into the substrate to
interact with the light propagating through the waveguide.  When
the field is off, the refractive index is not modulated, and the
propagating light is not affected.  The propagating beam can be
coupled to another element of the same substrate, or it can become
an output beam toward the observer.  An antireflection coating is
applied at the output point.  The refractive index grating
structures may be tuned by a number of methods.  Further details
can be found in U.S. Patent 5,544,268.

According to Dave Deacon, president of Deacon Research, Deacon
Research recently formed a new company to spin-off this technology
and develop products for market.

Plastic Emits
Laser Light

Several years ago, scientists in Cambridge, England, discovered
that a plastic called PPV gives off light when electricity passes
through it.  This material is one type of polymer that is being
developed as light emitting diodes (LEDs) for use in displays.  Now
that it has produced laser light, the material has proven itself to
be good for light emission, a fact that was questioned by some in
the scientific community, according to Richard H. Friend of the
Cavendish Lab in Cambridge.

To achieve this feat, scientists sandwiched the PPV between two
mirrors.  They consisted of a thin silver film and a layered
material called a distributed Bragg reflector, which reflects
visible light with nearly 100% efficiency.  This kind of device
produces light by stimulated emission.  Shining light through the
reflector causes the PPV to emit photons, some of which are
reflected back and forth between the mirrors which starts a cascade
of more photons.  These photons are not reflected but pass through
the silver film.  They have a single wavelength and are in phase,
thus forming the coherent laser beam.

Although the emitted light was a yellow-green color, polymer laser
light could cover a range of visible wavelengths according to the
Cambridge researchers.  The next step is to develop polymer lasers
that can be excited by electricity rather than light.

A key driver in the use of this material for displays is the fact
that it can be easily deposited over large areas which comes in
handy when making large, flat LED panels such as billboards or even
computer screens.

Work Progresses on
Retinal Displays

At the University of Washington's Human Interface Technology Lab
(Seattle, WA), researchers funded by Microvision Inc., a Seattle-
based electro-optics company, are developing the ability to create
"virtual retinal displays."  Images are projected pixel by pixel,
or point of light by point of light, from an outside source
directly onto the retina of a viewer's eye.

These kinds of displays allow viewers to see information on what
appears to be a translucent computer screen hanging a few feet in
front of them.  The reality is that there is no screen--the image
exists only inside the eye.  Application examples abound.  Surgeons
will be able to call up high-resolution x-rays of patients as they
lie on an operating table and, in the military, soldiers will be
able to use virtual displays to see mines as they are projected
from helmet mounted, ground penetrating radar.

Support for this technology is strong as research continues.
Microvision hopes to eventually mount a retinal scanning device on
a platform as small as an eyeglass frame.  Prototypes should be
available within two years.

University of Washington researchers are working on ways to project
almost a million pixels on the retina (300,000 each of red, blue
and green), one pixel at a time, thus creating 60 full retinal
screens, or images, each second.  Anything less will cause flicker.
The lab currently has a table-top retinal display apparatus, which
uses gas lasers or laser diodes that create laser light beams, to
break down video images into green, blue and red streams of light.
The light streams are then manipulated by the system's electronics
and combined using a series of mirrors and lenses onto a fiber
optic cable.

Following this, the merged beam is channeled to small horizontal
and vertical scanners that "paint" the image onto the retina.  The
viewer sees a high-resolution image that appears to be focused
several feet in the distance.  In addition, the display can be
projected from a hand-held device onto the retina.  In that
instance, however, the image appears to originate inside the
device.

CRTs have created an image pixel by pixel to create images.  What's
different in the virtual display is beaming light directly onto the
retina to create pixels that form an image.  According to the
researchers, the retinal display produces a brighter, higher-
resolution image that the CRT or LCDs.  Since the image comes from
low intensity lasers, it doesn't damage the eye.

The Army seems eager to start testing these displays.  The Pentagon
has been funding LCDs and other flat panel technologies for three
years, but a retinal display presents the possibility of higher
resolution at the same cost.  And, since they are virtual
projections, virtual displays don't block the viewer's forward
vision.  Microvision seems to be targeting the high-end military
and medical markets.  Estimated costs of these displays is placed
between $5,000 and $50,000 each.

Polymer Makes
All Plastic Electrodes

Al-Coat Ltd. (Ness-Ziona, Israel) has developed a process in which
a conductive transparent polymer is applied as an electrode in a
PDLC device.  So far, the new polymer has been a successful
substitute for indium tin oxide (ITO).

In the process, two PET substrates, approximately 200-microns
thick, are each coated on the inside with 100 nm of the conductive
polymer thus building "all plastic" transparent electrodes.  The
PDLC layer in the middle is separated from the electrodes on both
sides by a 0.5-um thick electric insulating layer.  The electro-
optical properties of this device match those of the conventional
ITO-based devices.

The all plastic electrodes provide mechanical flexibility to the
device and reduce electrical current in the on-state.  This
condition implies a low energy consumption when the device is
turned on.

Selective Ion
Source Developed

A scientist at the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has developed a new selective ion source
that improves the semiconductor manufacturing process and could
decrease the cost of flat-panel displays.  The inventor of the new
process is Ka-Ngo Leung, leader of the Plasma and Ion Source
Technology Group in the Lab's Accelerator and Fusion Research
Division.  "Although the new technology can help improve the
manufacture of conventional silicon-based semiconductors,"  Leung
says "its primary application will be the manufacture of flat-panel
displays.

 Leung's solution to a variety of manufacturing problems was to
develop an ion source technology that uses just enough energy to
selectively ionize only the phosphine (PH3) (or diborine, B2H6, or
other gas), but not enough to ionize the hydrogen gas.  This
eliminates most of the unwanted impurities from the ion stream
because they are electrically neutral, and reduces both excess
heating and the charging problem.

Flat-panel displays consist of many pixels, each of which is
controlled by transistors,  Leung said.  The transistors are formed
from semiconductors consisting of silicon doped with phosphorus or
boron.  One way to dope a layer of silicon with phosphorus, arsenic
or boron ions is to aim a stream of dopant ions into the silicon,
a process called ion implantation.

He went on to explain that the manufacturing process must ensure
that the dopant is pure and as free as possible from unwanted ions.
Conventional implantation might start with a beam of phosphorus or
boron scanning the silicon wafer to dope it uniformly.  However,
flat panel displays start with a panel of glass that is too big to
use the conventional method effectively.  So, a technique called
ion shower is used, which employs large beam of phosphorus or
boron.  The panel is immersed in the shower, which implants the
entire panel with the dopant, requiring a large ion source.

The source generates a stream of dopant ions such as phosphorus
using the phosphorus-containing gas.  However, phosphine is so
toxic that it is always sold heavily diluted, often in a mixture of
95% hydrogen gas and 5% phosphine.  Used as a conventional ion
source most of the ions coming out are hydrogen, creating two
problems.  One is that the energy of the beam is so high that the
silicon-coated glass blank is heated too much by the accelerated
hydrogen ions causing damage to the glass surface.  A second
problem is damage caused by the buildup of excessive electrical
charges in the plate from the unwanted ions.

The new technology solves yet another problem.  Conventional
sources use a tungsten filament to inject the gas with electrons.
However the tungsten is an impurity that is easy to ionize, a
source of contamination.  So the researchers inject electrons using
a principle called radio frequency (RF) induction discharge.  "We
create plasma using RF induction discharge and then inject
electrons into the main chamber to ionize the source gas," he says.
"The device is called an RF plasma cathode."

 Leung also has another invention which consists of an apparatus
for creating a large-diameter ion beam from a small-diameter
diverging beam.  In conjunction with the selective ion source, this
invention can be used to generate a beam appropriate for ion
implantation of large areas of material such as those used in flat-
panel displays.

Developmental work on the selective ion source is supported by a
corporate sponsor under a cooperative research and development
agreement with DOE.  The University of California was awarded U.S.
patent number 5,517,084 for  Leung's selective ionization
invention.  Patents are pending for his RF plasma cathode and large
diameter ion beam apparatus.  The three patents are available for
licensing from Berkeley Lab's Technology Transfer Department.

Electrochemical
Etching Perfected

A new electrochemical etching-based method of making silicon
carbide (SiC) semiconductor optoelectronic devices has been
developed by scientists at NASA's Lewis Research Center (21000
Brookpark Rd., Cleveland, OH 44135; Tel: 216/433-5568, Fax:
216/433-3344).  The technique, reports Joseph S. Shor, who
performed the work for NASA, may facilitate the building of
ultraviolet light-emitting diodes, ultraviolet lasers, blue
electroluminescent devices, and filters for solid state chemical
sensors.  The electrochemical etching method provides for the
formation of selected porous regions with variable macrostructures,
microstructures, and compositions in SiC wafers.

In the NASA process, a SiC wafer is mounted in a carrier with a
nickel electrical contact and covered with black wax everywhere
except for an opening at the designated surface location of the
region to be made porous.  The wax prevents etching everywhere
except at the exposed area.  The carrier is placed on a pedestal in
a polytetrafluoroethylene vessel filled with an etching solution of
dilute (normally 2.5%) hydrofluoric acid.  A saturated calomel
electrode and a platinum wire counter-electrode are immersed in the
solution,  Through the nickel contact, a variable voltage DC power
supply circuit applies a bias voltage to the wafer.  A control
circuit maintains the bias at a prescribed voltage with respect to
the saturated calomel electrode.

If, for example, the SiC is doped with electron donor atoms (n-
doped), the exposed surface of the wafer is illuminated through a
sapphire window at the top of the vessel, while the SiC is
maintained at an anodic potential of 1.8-2.8 volts to promote
photoinduced corrosion.  If the SiC is doped with electron
acceptors (p-doped), it can be etched in the dark at 0-2 volts.
The depth and structure of the porous region is determined by
factors such as the anodization time, the applied potential, the
intensity of the ultraviolet light (if used), the pH of the
solution, and the concentration of the dopant.

In the fabrication of a SiC p/n-junction diode supported by a
broad, electrically insulating substrate, for example, engineers
can take advantage of the fact that porous SiC may be oxidized to
silicon dioxide (SiO2) at a rate much greater than that of solid
SiC, because the pores present a much greater surface area for
oxidation.

A wafer is fabricated by the chemical vapor deposition of a p-doped
SiC epilayer, and then an n-doped SiC epilayer on an n-doped SiC
substrate.  A mask is placed on the top n-doped epilayer and then
patterned photolithographically.  The electrochemical etching
method makes the part of the n-doped epilayer not covered by the
mask porous and, as a result, highly susceptible to oxidation.

The resulting porous part of the layer is oxidized to SiO2 to make
it highly susceptible to etching using hydrofluoric acid.  It is
then etched, leaving a mesa of n-doped SiC.  The electrochemical
etching method is then used again, this time with process
conditions selected to impart porosity to the exposed part of the
p-doped SiC.  Then the porous material is oxidized to SiO2, leaving
a 2-layer, n-doped/p-doped mesa. The electrochemical etching
technique is then applied, this time under process conditions that
impart porosity to the n-doped SiC substrate only.  Finally, the
porous substrate is oxidized to SiO2, which is electrically
insulating.

Contract to Develop
Storage System

The U.S. Display Consortium (USDC) awarded a contract to PRI
Automation (Billerica, MA) to develop an automated storage and
retrieval system for work-in-process for flat panel display
manufacturing.  The USDC will fund $820,000 of the $1.6 billion
total cost.

PRI will develop a stocker system that will store work-in-process
cassettes or pods vertically in units up to 12 ft. high.  The goal
is to more efficiently utilize cleanroom space that is presently
occupied by carts and storage racks.  Each stocker will feature a
high-lift capacity robot to store and retrieve cassettes under host
or operator control.  The stockers will be designed to operate in
a Class 10 cleanroom environment.

PRI's stockers will accommodate all standard cassette and pod sizes
being developed under other USDC contracts, including the next
generation 600 x 720 mm glass size, and they will be compatible
with Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), Manual Guided Vehicles
(MGVs) and host communications software specified by the USDC
project team.  The USDC and PRI previously collaborated on the
development of a standard laser marking and tracking system.

MKS Intros Mass
Flow Controller

MKS Instruments (Andover, MA) introduced a new pressure-based mass
flow controller, known as the Type 1153, designed to provide
precise delivery of vapors from complex solids and liquids with
vapor pressures as low as 2.5 Torr at temperatures as high as
200C.  The flow of vapor is controlled via a pressure-based
technique using two pressure transducers tradenamed Baratron, a
choked flow nozzle and a high temperature solenoid valve.  An
onboard CPU provides control of flow from the choked, to the non-
choked regions of flow, providing a wide usable control range.
Full scale flow is process dependent, but can range up to 10 slm.
Both flow temperatures are controlled via 0-5 V analog signals or
RS-232.

The MKS Type 1153 allows microelectronics/semiconductor, and flat
panel display manufacturers to deliver low vapor pressure liquid
and solid precursors to a CVD chamber to deposit barrier, high k
and low k dielectric films.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE OPENS IMAGING UP
Vendors Should Look to Specialized Markets in 1996 

     The emergence of imaging as an electronic commerce tool will offer
new opportunities this year to vendors savvy enough to meet the needs of
the extended enterprise, as businesses seek to use the Internet for
moving the paper associated with marketing, distribution, sales and
purchasing, industry experts say.
     The goal will be "passing information between vendors ... via E-
mail or the Internet," says Ed McIerney, vice president of software
business with Wang Laboratories Inc. of Billerica, Mass.    
     Another big factor to look for in 1996 is more cooperation among
vendors as the industry seeks to deal with the consequences of its
consolidation last year.  Companies will have to work together on
developing software and faster- peripheral products, to address users'
demands, we're told.  
     Collaboration also will help the industry come up with new
innovations more quickly, simplifying the offerings for systems
integrators who are often left to choose between a large number of
companies to create a complete solution, says Harold Gubnitsky,
director with Cambridge, Mass.-based Cambridge Technology Partners'
Intelligent Document Management division.    

Ally with Large Partners

     Alliances with large partners who plan to take advantage of
electronic commerce opportunities will enable mid-sized imaging
vendors to make a name for themselves.  
     Previously hidden behind the giants, they now can begin to shine,
the experts say.  Be advised vendors must choose, however, which
segment of the market to shine in, or be left behind.
     Vendors who choose a specific market for their imaging products
will provide their customers with greater value-add than those who do
not strengthen their hands by finding a specialty to serve within an
already niche- marketplace.  Health care providers will know they are
getting the best imaging system designed for health care, for example;
the same will be true for the financial area, say the experts.
     Both users and vendors are looking toward the "commoditization"
or interoperability of imaging components.  Experts predict more and
more components will be off-the-shelf next year.  In addition, the
emergence of more standards will help propel further growth,
particularly in the storage arena.
     Look for the Internet to play a much larger role in the
development this year of imaging technology as an increasingly mobile
workforce demands links not only to text, but also images.  "How you
route the image, share the indexing information about a file not only
within a department, but within regions or districts around the world,
will play a significant part of the document management" and imaging
marketplace, says Gubnitsky.
     David Skok, president of Burlington, Mass.-based Watermark says
in agreement:  "The keys to success in 1996 will be the Internet/Web
enabling of imaging, document management and workflow products." 
     Simplifying the industry from one saturated with too many imaging
vendors in all segments of the business, to one with only a few large
players means that systems integrators and users will find it easier
to choose a complete imaging solution.  "Most potential buyers are not
able to make informed decisions, relying instead on serendipity," says
Gubnitsky.
     Only three major platform vendors will dominate production-level
imaging this year, predicts Suresh Shenoy, vice president with
Information Management Consultants, based in McLean, Va.  They are: 
FileNet  and its acquisition Watermark, Microsoft  and its alliance
with Billerica, Mass.-based Wang and the combination of IBM and
acquired Lotus.  He says mid-sized vendors will cooperate for
solutions at all levels of the enterprise.
     "The challenge for the mid-tiered [companies] will be to find a
maturing channel and name recognition for themselves," adds Erik
Brown, senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research. 
This name recognition will tie a vendor nicely with what has become a
more segmented or specialized marketplace.

Specialized Market Segments To Grow

     Many analysts agree that vendors are going to have to specialize
in specific market segments in order to make a name for themselves. 
For instance, Brown says it won't matter whether or not your
processing system works in two-tenths of a second or one-tenth of a
second.  
     The real challenge for 1996 will be in how a vendor adds value to
its imaging product line.  This will be achieved by "choosing a
particular      
application within the technology," he says.  Otherwise, "the door
will close." 
     What does this mean for those already working within an industry
segment? 
     It means that companies such as Dallas-based BancTec, which
merged with Recognition last year, is poised to work even more closely
with its partners in the financial marketplace.  With BancTec already
a player in remittance processing, you can expect it to work more
closely with community banks, spokesman George Christian told us.  

Storage Technology Set To Advance

     According to industry insiders, the advancement of imaging
technology continues to develop.  In particular, vendors are expecting
better interoperability for Computer Output to Laser Disk (COLD)
storage this year as standards are perfected. 
     BancTec plans to concentrate on what Christian calls
open/archiving.  This is a concept designed for customer service, he
says. 
     For example, a request is scanned into an imaging system and
stored on the hard disk for up to three days.  Then, the data will be
moved to an optical media for up to 60 days, after which it will be
transferred to either linear tape or some other inexpensive device for
one year's storage.  
     The reason for this new technology?  Many customers tell BancTec
that 80 percent of all their requests are received within the first 30
days of processing, so after 30 days the information does not need to
be immediately accessible, says Christian.
     "COLD technology is one that has not had as much attention [as
others],"  says Gubnitsky.  The challenge will be to separate COLD
with traditional document management, he says.  

Commoditization of Imaging:  Help or Hurt?

     It's hard to predict whether or not commoditization of imaging
technology will help or hurt the industry.  Experts differ in their
opinions, particularly those involved most directly with designing
systems.  McIerney says commoditization will provide his company with
many opportunities in 1996.  The free-bundled imaging now available
with Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT, for example, will provide
users previously unfamiliar with imaging a taste of it.
     "People will work with images, like it, enjoy it, start using it
more, then discover they have a disk full of images," he says.  What
this means is a need for more storage.  Wang will now be able to
provide a storage solution through its recent acquisition of Avail of
Colo.  In addition, Wang will be poised to handle any calls requesting
imaging upgrades--something the stockholders are counting on, says
McIerney.  

Where Does Document Management Fit?

     Vendors look to 1996 to be the year that users apply new found
understanding of document management to purchasing decisions.  The
experts agree that document management is more of a process, under
which technologies as imaging, workflow, faxing and storage operate as
component parts.
     Shenoy explains that document management is not imaging and it is
not workflow.  "Document management is being able to manage the
production, revision, storage, access, presentation and distribution
of information created in such an imaging system," he says.

INTRAFED ACTS AS VAR AND ITS OWN SUPPLIER 

     Bethesda-Md.-based INTRAFED's efforts to position itself as a
large-scale image capture vendor should help the company compete
against new rival, San Jose, Calif.-based Cornerstone.  Jeff
Meshinksy, one of the founders of INTRAFED, along with his father,
says his company plans to "use its installed base" as its major
resource against its competitors like Cornerstone and Irvine, Calif.-
based Kofax. 
     INTRAFED is a developer of software capture systems and acts as
both a value added reseller (VAR), as well as competes as an
individual vendor for  contracts in both the commercial and government
arena.  
     INTRAFED has "good reference lists" for a shrink-wrapped product,
says Kimra Hawley, vice president and general manager of software
tools and input systems division with Cornerstone (see related story,
p. 5).  If the user wants to purchase all the component parts for
image capture from one company INTRAFED is the choice for them because
its product is "straight-forward and very production oriented," she
says.  This type of component-based system will help save money and
time because users don't have to build the systems themselves.

Areas Served:  Commercial, government (30 percent federal)
Customers:  U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Federal Express

Choosing Multiple Partners

     INTRAFED has made it a point to work with 36 different suppliers,
integrating their products directly into the INTRAFED image capture
solution, in particular Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak's scanners.  
     Dan Elam, consultant with Imaging Consulting of Saluda, Va. says
INTRAFED has worked exclusively with Kodak for some time now.  This
relationship is something to follow as INTRAFED moves toward a more
open-architecture strategy to include any scanner as the front-end to
its imaging solution, he says. 

Gulf War Continues to Bring in Dollars

     One of its original production-level systems in 1990 was for
Desert Storm during the Gulf War--scanning and processing more than 12
million intelligence documents in two-and-a-half months.  The U.S.
Army needed intelligence data available to them in the bunkers about
the Iraqis, which before would have been decrypted by hand, says
Meshinsky.  Using Kodak scanners, INTRAFED uploaded the data into an
IBM ImagePlus retrieval system, integrating the intelligence
information quickly for the solders' retrieval, says Meshinsky.
     Another project expected to continue the Gulf War work for
INTRAFED is the Declassification program.  It involves converting 17
million pages of records from the Gulf War operations to images. 
These records will be used to research potential causes of the
illnesses experienced by Gulf War veterans, often referred to as the
"Gulf War Syndrome."  
     The U.S. Army is intent upon putting this declassified
information onto the Internet and the World Wide Web for medical
personnel to evaluate and review for possible cures.  Up to 20,000
document images will be converted per day, according to INTRAFED.  For
the high-speed capture of the images, INTRAFED's PowerScan software
controls two Kodak 500 ImageLink scanners, which will produce
electronic image files and related indexing information.  Images then
are passed directly to StageWorks for quality control, rescanning if
necessary, image enhancement--such as deskewing, optical character
recognition and directly to the Excalibur EFS Format Bridge.  
     This bridge--a point of pride for INTRAFED according to
Meshinsky--formats image, text and index data for use in a
specifically designated indexing system.  

INTRAFED Allies with ICS

     INTRAFED recently allied took a partner in the conversion
business, Image Conversion Systems based in Arlington Heights, Ill. 
ICS was a division of Anacomp, also of Arlington Heights.  Its focus
has been on image conversion, but John Messinger, formerly with
Anacomp, wanted to buy out the ICS division to stand on its own.  The
buyout took place Nov. 1.
     As part of the new alliance with ICS, INTRAFED will help the
company upgrade its 11 conversion centers in such cities as San Diego,
Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis.  ICS will use a combination of
PowerScan and StageWorks to convert 52 million images per year.  (Jeff
Meshinsky, INTRAFED, 301/564-5600; Kimra Hawley, Cornerstone, 408/325-
3840, Dan Elam, Imaging Consulting, 804/758-5755.) 

CORNERSTONE RELEASES INPUTACCEL

     It may seem that San Jose, Calif.-based Cornerstone's InputAccel
has been on the market for some time because of the company hyping it
for so long, but it was finally released at the end of last year.  The
modular image capture solution was pre-announced in April, 1994, to
"signal the market" that Cornerstone was entering the image capture
market.  It also enabled the peripherals vendors to begin making their
products compatible with InputAccel, Kimra Hawley, vice president and
general manager for the software tools and input systems division,
said.
     The product was six months late from a development standpoint,
says Hawley--although it was held on purpose.  After bringing in
representatives from service bureaus, systems integrator and scanning
operators, Cornerstone decided to make some changes to the product
based on the users' feedback.  "Fortunately, we weren't in need of
revenue," says Hawley, so we could afford to wait.
     Hawley describes the possible solutions in the input capture
market in four categories:

     * A modular approach--such as InputAccel which includes server,
scan, image processing, OCR and image export.
     * Shrinkwrapped--hard-coded systems offered by INTRAFED or Kofax. 
     * Monolithic suppliers, such as FileNet, may already have an
imaging installation--they will most likely just "add-on" the image
capture portion of the system.
     * Toolkits--Users can build their own system from the ground up
with DiamondHead or Imagination Software's products.

     Cornerstone can plug and play its "modules" in InputAccel with up
to 33 different image capture vendors' products without the integrator
having to do any programming, says Hawley.  The product was designed
based upon extensive interviews with systems integrator like Price
Waterhouse and Grumman, which were looking for a less expensive, less
time-consuming solution to the image capture industry. 
     Cornerstone's first customers are:  CTB-McGraw Hill, CADPAC of
Ohio, and Stanford Health Services of Palo Alto, Calif.  (Cornerstone,
408/325-3840.)

FEDERAL EXPRESS CHOOSES BLUERIDGE FOR AIRCRAFT RECORDS. 

 Blueridge Technologies of Flint Hill, Va., installed its OPTIX
Document Management System at Memphis, Tenn.-based Federal Express Air
Operations Department.  The system is used to store, retrieve and
manage engineering and maintenance records for FedEx's fleet of more
than 500 aircraft.  FedEx has accumulated over 700,000 aperture cards,
with a backlog of "several million documents" according to company
executives.  As many as 165 employees at FedEx headquarters have
access to the records archived on the OPTIX system.  Engineers in
remote locations may retrieve records in seconds by means of a dial-in
connection, say executives at FedEx.  FedEx serves more than 325
airports and more than 200 countries.  OPTIX helped the company solve
a problem directly from the Charles DeGaul airport in Paris when
technicians misplaced a serviceable tag on an oxygen tank.  Using
OPTIX, a copy of the serviceable tag was "pulled up" on the system and
faxed to Paris, enabling the plane to continue its route.  Otherwise,
the plane would have been grounded, said company executives.

AIIM SEARCHES FOR NEW LEADER IN 1996 

The Association for Information and Image Management International
(AIIM) faces a crossroads in the loss of its 20-year veteran,
president Sue Wolk even as the market is shifting from proprietary- to
client-server- and open-systems.  
     In what several AIIM members say will be a large leadership gap
to fill as one who was always far ahead of the power curve, Wolk
leaves AIIM at an important time in the history of imaging, says
Thorton May, consultant with Cambridge, Mass.-based Cambridge
Technology Partners.  
     Wolk plans to stay through the end of April.  The goal is to find
a replacement by the time the yearly AIIM convention convenes in
Chicago this March 31 to April 3.  If they do not meet that goal, Wolk
says she will stay a little longer.
     The board of directors has established a search committee and put
in place a management transition team, with Wolk aiding the team.  The
committee will work directly with Washington, D.C.-based Foster
Partners, a division of Washington, D.C.-based KPMG Peat Marwick,
AIIM's auditing firm.  

AIIM's Diversity Adds to Search

     In addition to this historic shift in the industry from large
proprietary systems to more workstation, client-server-based systems,
Wolk says AIIM has become a very diverse organization with both
corporate members and end-user members.  "This [diversity] is what
makes us successful," she says.  
     This diversity requires a leader who will not go along routinely
with the board of directors, as one member said Wolk has done.  Yet
the new president will have to balance new leadership with recognition
of AIIm's advancement under Wolk, the same member told DIR. 
     As the chief staff officer for the last eight years, Wolk is
credited with taking AIIM to a leadership position in the work
management and workflow arena.  Her accomplishiments at AIIM include: 
significant gains in membership, product offerings and increasing the
number of regions served by AIIM, according to the association.
     AIIM's membership includes 600 corporate trade vendors with a
total of 9,000 members in 150 countries.  AIIM members and others who
wish to provide input to the search committee, may contact Dann
Stringer, senior managing director with Foster at 202/467-3093. 
Resumes and credentials may be faxed directly to Foster at 202/785-
0683.  (AIIM, 301/587-8202 or http://www.aiim.org.)

COMPUTER SECURITY: HOW TO HACKER-PROOF YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS; MCI PROVIDES
TOP 10 TIPS TO HELP PROTECT COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM UNWANTED INTRUSIONS

During the holiday season, it's especially important to review the
security precautions for business computer systems that are connected to
the Internet. Ongoing reviews by MCI's Internet Security Department
indicate widespread attempts by ill-intentioned hackers to break into
business computer systems via the Internet.  With this in mind, MCI's
Internet security experts have developed some security guidelines that
will help businesses protect their systems.

"It is important for companies to do a thorough security audit of their
computer systems and to keep these systems up-to-date in order to thwart
computer hackers," said Robert Hagens, director of Internet Engineering
for MCI's Data Services Division.  "Computer hackers are constantly
sharpening their skills and inventing new schemes to break into company
computer systems.  Businesses also need to ensure that they continue to
stay one step ahead of the bad guys in securing their systems."

According to MCI's Internet Security Department, most of the successful
computer break-ins are the result of exercising old, known weaknesses in
operating systems which system administrators and managers have not
remedied.  Despite the best efforts of the Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT) and others, many system operators have shown remarkable
complacence about security until they are hit by a hacker.  MCI hopes this
message will encourage more pro-active efforts by managers of systems on
the Internet.

MCI has identified the Top 10 Threats that businesses should be aware of
and the Top 10 Precautions that businesses can take to protect their
computer systems.

TOP 10 THREATS
1. FIREWALL & SYSTEM PROBING
Hackers are using sophisticated, automated tools to scan for
vulnerabilities of a company's corporate firewall and systems behind the
firewall.  These hacker tools have proved to be quite effective, with the
average computer scan taking less than three minutes to identify and
compromise security.

Companies can prevent this by ensuring that their systems sit behind a
network firewall and any services available through this firewall are
carefully monitored for potential security exposures.

2. NETWORK FILE SYSTEMS (NFS) APPLICATION ATTACKS
Hackers attempt to exploit well known vulnerabilities in the Network File
System application which is used to share files between systems.  These
attacks, usually through network firewalls, can result in compromised
administrator access.

To combat this, ensure systems do not allow NFS through the firewall, and
enable NFS protections to restrict who can access files.

3. ELECTRONIC MAIL ATTACKS
Hackers can compromise network systems by simply sending an e-mail to it.
Companies who accept e-mail from the Internet and who have exposed
versions of the sendmail program are potential targets from this attack.
Last year more than 20,000 systems were compromised due to this exposure.

To prevent this from occurring, check with vendors to ensure systems are
running a correct version of sendmail or some more secure mail product.

4. VENDOR DEFAULT PASSWORD ATTACKS
Systems of all types come with vendor installed usernames and passwords.
Hackers are well educated on these default usernames and passwords and use
these accounts to gain unauthorized administrative access to systems.

Protect systems by ensuring that all vendor passwords have been changed.

5. SPOOFING, SNIFFING, FRAGMENTATION & SPLICING ATTACKS
Recently computer hackers have been using sophisticated techniques and
tools at their disposal to identify and expose vulnerabilities on Internet
networks.  These tools and techniques can be used to capture names and
passwords, as well as compromise trusted systems through the firewall.

To protect systems from this type of attack, check with computer and
firewall vendors to identify possible security precautions.

6. SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS
Hackers will attempt to gain sensitive or confidential information from
companies by placing calls to employees and pretending to be another
employee.  These types of attacks can be effective in gaining usernames
and passwords as well as other sensitive information.

Train employees to use a "call-back" procedure to verify the distribution
of any sensitive information over the phone.

7. EASY-TO-GUESS PASSWORD COMPROMISE
Most passwords that are easy to remember are also easy to guess. These
include words in the dictionary, common names, slang words, song titles,
etc.  Computer hackers will attempt to gain access to systems using these
easy-to-guess passwords usually via automated attacks.

Protect systems by ensuring that passwords are not easy to guess, that
they are at least eight characters long, contain special characters and
utilize both uppercase and lowercase characters.

8. DESTRUCTIVE COMPUTER VIRUSES
Computer viruses can infect systems on a widespread basis in a very short
period of time.  These viruses can be responsible for erasing system data.

Protect systems from computer viruses by using anti-virus software to
detect and remove computer viruses.

9. PREFIX SCANNING
Computer hackers will be scanning company telephone numbers looking for
modem lines, which they can use to gain access to internal systems.  These
modem lines bypass network firewalls and usually bypass most security
policies.  These "backdoors" can easily be used to compromise internal
systems.

Protect against this intrusion by ensuring modems are protected from brute
force attacks.  Place these modems behind firewalls; make use of one-time
passwords; or have these modems disabled.

10. TROJAN HORSES
Hackers will install "backdoor" or "Trojan Horse" programs on businesses
computer systems, allowing for unrestricted access into internal systems,
which will bypass security monitoring and auditing policies.

Conduct regular security analysis audits to identify potential security
vulnerabilities and to identify security exposures.

TOP 10 SECURITY PRECAUTIONS
1. FIREWALL SENSITIVE SYSTEMS
Ensure corporate systems are protected from Internet attacks. Deploy a
firewall between these systems and the Internet to guard against network
scans and intrusions.

2. OBTAIN SECURITY ALERT INFORMATION
Subscribe to security alert mailing lists to identify potential security
exposures before they become problems.  CERT (Computer Emergency Response
Team at Carnegie Mellon University) is a good place to start.  The URL for
CERT's Web site is cert-advisory-requestcert.org.  The e-mail address is
certcert.org.

3. REVIEW SYSTEM AUDIT TRAILS REGULARLY
Regularly check logging data and audit trails to look for unusual or
suspicious activity.

4. BACKUP DATA
Don't be a victim of accidental or malicious data erasure. Backup all
sensitive data on a regular basis.

5. PURCHASE & DEPLOY ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE
Computer viruses can spread throughout a system in minutes. Check systems
for viruses on a regular basis.

6. CHANGE PASSWORDS ON A REGULAR ROTATIONAL BASIS
Don't pick easy to remember passwords and change them often. Consider the
use of one-time password tokens to avoid password compromise threats.

7. DEPLOY VENDOR SECURITY PATCHES
Consult with vendors and obtain any system security patches that can be
used to add additional layers of protection.

8. ESTABLISH & ENFORCE A SECURITY POLICY
Develop and enforce a company-wide computer and physical security policy.

9. EMPLOYEE AWARENESS
Ensure all employees and management are briefed regularly on security
threats, policies, corrective measures and incident reporting procedures.

10. MAKE USE OF PUBLIC DOMAIN SECURITY TOOLS
A wide variety of public domain security tools exist on the Internet, many
of which can be used to assist in the protection of computer systems.

The above information was developed by MCI's Internet Security Department.

available to combat security threats, view the MCI security homepage at

WINDOWS 95: REMOVE-IT FOR WINDOWS 95 SHIPS JANUARY 1; VERTISOFT SYSTEMS
INC. DELIVERS THE SAFEST & EASIEST WAY TO UNINSTALL APPLICATIONS IN
WINDOWS 95.

Vertisoft Systems Inc., a recognized innovator in utilities software, will
ship Remove-IT for Windows 95, a new 32-bit version of its top-rated
uninstall utility on January 1.

Remove-IT 95 is the most comprehensive removal system available to safely
and accurately remove any 32-bit or 16-bit application. Remove-IT 95 fully
supports long filenames, the Windows 95 System Registry, drag-and-drop and
other Windows 95 features.

"Users may not realize that their computers are being bombarded with
garbage until one day the whole system starts to slow down, or they begin
to run out of resources," explained Elliott Lowe, vice president/marketing
at Vertisoft Systems Inc.  "But every time you install an application, go
online, install a CD-ROM or receive a fax, you can wind up with useless
bits of electronic debris that can quickly clutter up your hard drive.
That's why you need Remove-IT 95.  It's the best way to safely clean up
that garbage and keep your system at peak performance."

Remove-IT 95 is now completing beta testing, and will be on store shelves
nationwide about January 1.  Remove-IT 95 is expected to retail for
$39.95; the retail package includes Remove-IT 95, Remove-IT 2 for Windows
3.X and the Upgrade Assistant which helps users upgrade from Windows 3.X
to Windows 95.  Registered users who purchased Remove-IT 2 at retail after
November 1 will receive a free upgrade to Remove-IT 95.  In addition,
users who purchase Remove-IT 95 between January 1 and March 30 will
receive a $10 manufacturer's mail-in rebate coupon and a certificate that
allows them to purchase Vertisoft Zip-IT or Name-IT at half-price.

Remove-IT was originally introduced in 1994; Remove-IT 95 is the third
product release in the series.  Remove-IT has consistently earned rave
reviews from editors and end users alike.  Remove-IT has also achieved
significant sales milestones, earning the No. 1 spot in PC Magazine's
retail software survey in August, 1995, and was a finalist in the 1995 MVP
Awards sponsored by PC/Computing.

NEW FEATURES IN REMOVE-IT 95
Like the award-winning Remove-IT 2, Remove-IT 95 allows users to increase
hard disk space by safely removing unnecessary applications, duplicate
files, unneeded fonts, orphan and garbage files, etc.  New and enhanced
features in Remove-IT 95 include:

Enhanced Clean-IT now tracks Cyber-Junk as a result of downloads from
online services, the Internet and received faxes.

New Move-IT function allows for easy movement of applications to any
directory or drive -- including network drives.

Enhanced Log-IT Monitor automatically records both 32-bit and 16-bit
program installations as well as changes made to the Windows System
Registry.

Enhanced Smart Disk Agent notifies users if system resources get too low,
if applications or files go unused too long, and if unneeded files get too
numerous.  Users set thresholds for each type of alert.

Find-IT and the new Find-IT Assistant locate duplicate files and help to
determine which duplicates to keep and which can be safely removed.

One of the most valuable features in Remove-IT 95, Lowe adds, is the
ability to compress an application while leaving the icon active.
Remove-IT 95's unique active application archiving saves hard disk space
by creating a compressed backup while leaving the program icon on the
desktop.  To run the application, just double-click on the icon.

Remove-IT 95 automatically retrieves it from the archive, decompresses it
on the fly, and has things ready to run in seconds. When it's time to
close the application, Remove-IT 95 offers the option of returning the
application to "cold storage" by returning it to the archive, or leaving
it decompressed and active.

Founded in 1988, Vertisoft is a leading developer and marketer of PC
utility software.  Other popular titles from Vertisoft Systems Inc.
include Remove-IT 2 (the No. 1 rated intelligent storage management
utility and uninstaller), Vertisoft Zip-IT (the easiest way to zip and
unzip files in Windows 95, Windows 3.X and Windows NT), and Name-IT (the
seamless way to use long filenames in Windows 3.X applications running
under Windows 95).  Vertisoft has licensed technology to Microsoft for use
in its operating systems, used by millions worldwide.

Vertisoft is one of the few utility software companies to offer consumers
a no-questions-asked satisfaction guarantee on its products.  Users who
are unhappy for any reason can return products within 30 days for a prompt
refund.

HTML: EASILY CREATE INTERNET HTML FILES WITH ROBOHELP 95

Blue Sky Software Thursday announced the new 32-bit RoboHELP HTML Plug-in
for RoboHELP 95, award-winning Help authoring tool for Windows 95 and
Windows NT.

The new RoboHELP HTML Plug-in used with RoboHELP 95 turns Microsoft Word 7
and Word 6 32-bit into full-featured hypertext authoring tools capable of
creating HTML files and Windows Help systems simultaneously.

RoboHELP 95 is the only Help authoring tool supporting this
state-of-the-art plug-in architecture, thereby providing simultaneous Help
and HTML creation from a single source.

With the new RoboHELP HTML Plug-in based on Blue Sky Software's unique
Help-to-HTML technology, there is no learning curve to create HTML files.
The new RoboHELP HTML Plug-in automates the process of creating HTML files
needed to build World Wide Web (WWW) sites.

NEW HTML SUPPORT
RoboHELP's visual environment provides an easy way to create Windows Help
features such as jumps, topics, graphics, multiple hotspot graphics,
Contents Tab, and more.  The RoboHELP HTML Plug-in automatically converts
these Help features into corresponding HTML features -- no programming is
needed!

The RoboHELP HTML Plug-in automatically creates:
o An HTML Home Page based on the Contents Tab or the Contents Topic of a
Windows Help file;

o An HTML file for each Help topic;
o Links to HTML files based on Help topic jumps and pop-ups;
o A Web graphic file (GIF) for each bitmap;
o A Web graphic file (GIF) with corresponding image map files for each
hotspot graphic.

HELP-TO-HTML KIT
The RoboHELP HTML Plug-in is part of the new Help-to-HTML Kit, which also
includes the Help-to-HTML Converter.  The Help-to-HTML Converter is based
on the same Help-to-HTML technology as used by the RoboHELP HTML Plug-in.
However, the Help-to-HTML Converter converts any Windows 3.1 or Windows 95
Help files into HTML files, regardless of the Help authoring tool used to
create them.

PRICING & AVAILABILITY
The Help-to-HTML Kit will be available in January 1996 at a $199
introductory price (list price:  $398).  RoboHELP 95 is now available at a
suggested retail price of $499.  Special competitive upgrade pricing is
now available for users of competitors' Help authoring tools.

ACQUISITION: HP TO ACQUIRE ELSEWARE

Hewlett-Packard Company and ElseWare Corp. announced that HP has acquired
ElseWare.  Seattle-based ElseWare develops printing and publishing
software.  Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

The acquisition of ElseWare is part of HP's strategy to introduce laser
printers that deliver more capability at a lower price.  It will enhance
HP's ability to offer customers improved performance and ease of use for
its industry-leading LaserJet printers.

The FontSmart product, which ElseWare developed for HP, delivers software
that contains innovative font-compression technology and font-management
capability.  FontSmart was introduced with HP's LaserJet 5L, 5P and 5Si
printers and provides Windows customers with 110 fonts and easy-to-use
font-management capability -- all in the space of a single disc.  ElseWare
technology also offers opportunities for future enhancements to HP's
LaserJet printer solutions.

"Software solutions are becoming increasingly important to HP's
laser-printer strategy," said Richard L. Raimondi, general manager of HP's
Business LaserJet Division.  "ElseWare's software-development expertise
and the quality of its management and technical staff will contribute
significantly to our ability to satisfy LaserJet printer customers."

"This acquisition broadens our opportunity to provide ElseWare software
technology to a wide range of customers," said Ben Bauermeister, ElseWare
founder and president.  "We're pleased that these customers will benefit
from the combination of our software technology and HP's LaserJet
printers."

Ben Bauermeister and Clyde McQueen, who had worked together at Aldus,
founded ElseWare in 1990.  The company has 20 employees and is expected to
remain in Seattle.  It now is a research-and-development section of HP's
Business LaserJet Division.

ANTI VIRUS: CHEYENNE SHIPS INOCULAN 1.01 FOR WINDOWS NT SERVERS &
WORKSTATION; INDUSTRY'S FIRST REAL-TIME VIRUS SCANNING FOR WINDOWS NT

Cheyenne Software, Inc., a world leader in the development of
enterprise-wide software solutions, today shipped InocuLAN 1.01 for the
Microsoft Windows NT Operating System.  This latest version of InocuLAN,
which just received the "Designed for Microsoft BackOffice" logo, is the
first product on the market with the ability to scan Windows NT based
computers for viruses in real-time. InocuLAN is the first and only
anti-virus solution to receive the "Designed for Microsoft BackOffice"
designation.

InocuLAN 1.01 sets the standard for Windows NT-based virus protection.
Like the previous version of the product (Version 1.0 - Windows NT
Magazine's Editor's Choice award, Oct.  '95), the new release is a 32-bit,
multithreaded, client/server application that protects against over 6000
viruses, including virtually all viruses 'found in the wild'.  The new
version not only scans in real-time, it is also able to scan compressed
files - allowing viruses to be detected without users having to risk
decompressing those files. InocuLAN 1.01 runs on Windows NT for Intel,
MIPS and Alpha platforms. "Windows NT Server provides a secure, reliable
operating system for distributed computing," said Rich Tong, general
manager in the business systems division at Microsoft.  "By delivering a
real-time virus detection product Cheyenne is helping further strengthen
this promise.  And because InocuLAN carries the Microsoft BackOffice logo
customers can be assured that it will integrate into their BackOffice
environment."

Behind InocuLAN's Windows 95-like interface is a state of the art,
heuristic-based, polymorphic scanner that detects nearly all known viruses
as certified by the National Software Testing Laboratories (NSTL).
InocuLAN detects, identifies and cures -- boot, file, multipartite,
stealth, polymorphic, and macro viruses.  When a virus is detected,
InocuLAN notifies the user immediately, as well as sends an alert via
Microsoft Mail, alphanumeric pager, SNMP, network broadcast, fax, or
printed trouble ticket.  InocuLAN maintains a detailed activity log of all
virus scans across the network.  The product also records to the Windows
NT system event log.

InocuLAN 1.01 for Windows NT is unique in that it allows administrators to
manage an entire network of InocuLAN hosts from a central Windows NT
Server or Workstation.  Unlike competitive products, it is implemented as
a service that can provide enterprise-wide remote management, including
unattended remote virus scans, even when the remote workstation is not
logged into the network.  In addition, InocuLAN further integrates with
Microsoft BackOffice by supporting long file names and Universal Naming
Convention (UNC) and is Unicode compliant.  InocuLAN utilizes a kernel
mode device driver to allow it to scan incoming and outgoing files in
real-time.

"Cheyenne's expertise in providing enterprise tools allows us to take the
lead in helping administrators deploy anti-virus measures across the
enterprise", said Rei Jane Huai, president and CEO for Cheyenne Software.
"Cheyenne will continue to work closely with Microsoft to make BackOffice
a secure environment and to support mission critical applications."

Cheyenne Software, Inc. is an international developer of essential
software solutions for NetWare, Windows NT, UNIX, Macintosh and OS/2
networks.  Its enterprise-wide offerings include an array of storage
management, security and communications products, including Cheyenne HSM,
JETserve, InocuLAN, FAXserve, Monitrix and its flagship product line, the
ARCserve family of network backup software.  Cheyenne can be contacted at
(800) 243-9462 (US or Canada) or (516) 282-5110.

VIRTUAL OFFICE: FOR BUSINESSMEN CONSTANTLY ON THE GO: CHICAGO COMPANY
CREATES FIRST VIRTUAL OFFICE FOR THEIR NEEDS

There is nothing like the Office Club.

They are opening all over the country.  They will have local virtual
offices (not necessary though because a client never visits the Office
Club).  Here's how it works:

You are assigned an e-mail number, voice mail box and fax number.
Hypothetically, you are a national sales manager for a company that is
based in New York and you are in San Francisco.  You can e-mail the Office
Club with copy for a new contract that needs to go to a prospective
customer.  They will type, overnight, fax or e-mail (serve as your
office).  There is no need to talk with the Office Club; everything can be
done by e-mail.  A copy of the contract is e-mailed back to your mailbox
so you know it has been done.  The Office Club customer messages and faxes
are e-mailed to the customer.

The Office Club home page has doors assigned to different services:
hotels, restaurants, voice mail, e-mail, fax, airlines. The client opens
the home page door to one of these services and e-mails to the Office Club
which will arrange (like their office would do), receive e-mail, make a
hotel reservation, etc.

Al Misale, founder, has taken a HQ concept or a home office and made it
virtual/interactive.

CHIPS: CYRIX TO WRITE OFF 486 PROCESSOR INVENTORY; COMPANY TO FOCUS EFFORT
ON FLAGSHIP 6X86 PROCESSOR FOR 1996

Cyrix Corp. will report a loss for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 1995, due
to poor pricing and sales of 486 products and a write-off of remaining 486
inventory.

While the amount of the fourth quarter loss has not been determined, the
company expects that it could exceed $0.40 per share. Cyrix reported net
income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 1995, of $25.5 million, or
$1.28 per share.

"While this first-time loss for Cyrix is a tremendous disappointment, and
it will put us into default of covenants contained in our credit
agreements, we have taken action to close out the 486 business and begin
1996, a year that will depend almost entirely on the market strength of
the 6x86 processor," said Cyrix President and Chief Executive Officer
Jerry Rogers.  "We can now concentrate on producing and selling as many
6x86 processors as possible in 1996."

Cyrix Corp., headquartered in Richardson, is a leading supplier of
high-performance processors to the personal computer industry. Founded in
1988, the company designs, manufactures and markets innovative, x86
software-compatible processors for the desktop and mobile computer
markets.

The financial report of company operations for the Dec. 31, 1995, quarter
will be distributed on Jan. 18, 1996, after the close of the market.

WINDOWS 95: VERTISOFT ZIP-IT SHIPS JANUARY 1; POWERFUL NEW UTILITY FOR
WINDOWS 95 & WINDOWS 3.X ELIMINATES FILE COMPRESSION DRUDGERY

Vertisoft Systems Inc., the recognized innovator in utilities software,
has begun shipments of Vertisoft Zip-IT, the easiest way to zip and unzip
files in Windows 95, Windows 3.X and Windows NT.  Many files can be
reduced in size by as much as 98 percent -- a big savings in hard drive
space or upload/download time.

"Anyone who uses online services or the Internet knows that file
compression is an absolute necessity," says Elliott Lowe, vice
president/marketing at Vertisoft Systems Inc.  "Until now, however, file
compression was anything but simple.  Vertisoft Zip-IT changes that.
Zip-IT represents a tremendous advance in the ease-of-use for file
compression utilities.  There's nothing like it available anywhere else."

Vertisoft Zip-IT will be on store shelves nationwide about January 1,
1996, and is expected to retail for $39.95.  In a special promotion during
January, February and March, 1996, users who purchase Vertisoft's
Remove-IT 95 at retail (expected street price: $39.95) can purchase Zip-IT
for half-price.

VERTISOFT ZIP-IT
Vertisoft Zip-IT makes managing compressed files simple.  No other file
compression utility is as comprehensive and easy-to-use. Zip-IT
automatically adds itself to the Windows 95 Explorer and the Windows 3.X
File Manager interface, so file compression, viewing or extraction is a
simple point-and-click operation.

Vertisoft Zip-IT lets users view files within any archive without having
to extract them.  For the first time, users can view, edit or even run
files that are still zipped.  "Users familiar with old-fashioned DOS-based
compression utilities are amazed when they see Zip-IT," Mr. Lowe adds.
"Everything is a simple point-and-click operation.

"You can work with multiple ZIP files at the same time.  If you want to
get a single file out of an entire ZIP archive, just point-and-click on
the file you want.  And if you need to work with extra-large files, just
use Zip-IT's Span Disk feature to automatically back up zipped archives
across multiple diskettes."

VERTISOFT ZIP-IT GIVES USERS:
o Simple drag-and-drop file compression.

o Exclusive Zip-IT Plus feature to create self-extracting ZIP files that
are executable under Windows and DOS -- so co-workers and friends don't
need their own file compression utility.

o 100% compatibility with the PKZIP standard, so users can unzip files
with PKZIP or Zip-IT, regardless of which application was used to zip
them.

o View, edit and run zipped files from within Vertisoft Zip-IT. Zip-IT
includes a built-in viewer or allows access to Windows 95's QuickView.

o Point-and-click file unzipping.

o Integration with the Windows 3.X File Manager or Windows 95 Explorer.

o A built-in Search feature to help locate files inside the ZIP files on
your hard drive in a flash.

o Zip Options menu to let users customize the way files are archived.

Founded in 1988, Vertisoft is a leading developer and marketer of PC
utility software.  Other popular titles from Vertisoft Systems Inc.
include Remove-IT 2 (the No. 1 rated intelligent storage management
utility and uninstaller), Remove-IT 95 (the most comprehensive removal
system available to safely and accurately remove any 32-bit or 16-bit
application), and Name-IT (the seamless way to use long filenames in
Windows 3.X applications running under Windows 95).  Vertisoft has
licensed technology to Microsoft for use in its operating systems, used by
millions worldwide.

Vertisoft is one of the few utility software companies to offer consumers
a no-questions-asked satisfaction guarantee on its products.  Users who
are unhappy for any reason can return products within 30 days for a prompt
refund.

ORACLE TO SHOW OFF ITS NETWORK COMPUTER

The center piece in Oracle's plans to put an affordable
networking computer in every household will make its first
appearance amidst both hype and controversy.
     A prototype of the Newton-based network computer (NC) -
also dubbed the US$500 'communications box' -- will be
demonstrated this February in San Francisco, California.
     NC will feature word processing, Internet access and
possibly videoconferencing.  And for about US$30 a month,
customers would subscribe to 'Web TV,' a simplified and
streamlined network that provides quick access to news
bites, the ability to download video on high quality lines,
surf the Net or send e-Mail.
     "Web TV will be available by the end of the first
quarter, or in the second quarter," said Oracle CEO Larry
Ellison.  "It [Oracle's network computer] will video-enable
the Internet."
     The kind of information that would be on Web TV would
be informative, fast-changing news such as the stock market.
Also the entertainment industry could utilize Web TV as an
advertising tool.
     "Companies like Time Warner would make great suppliers
of content, (News Corp's) Rupert Murdoch's stuff would be
good, Disney, and news organizations. There'd be no risk;
they would control their own servers," said Ellison, a
staunch believer that education and electronic commerce
would be the most successful interactive TV ventures.
     NC would also get its 'brains' from the servers. The
communications box will have no hard disc, software or
floppy disc.  Each time users turned on their NC, it
would download the latest network upgrades.
     Recently LSI Logic Corporation recently unveiled a
microchip technology intended to support a US$500
Internet device.  The company already specializes in
integrating functions on a single affordable chip,
prompting such popular low-cost products as Sony's
PlayStation.
According to LSI, it will be able to design a chip for
as little as US$50 that, when combined with a US$100
memory chip, will provide the core of an Internet device.
  PC's have long been a relatively expensive commodity
whose cheapest price for a new stripped down machine is
still around US$2,000.  And many industry analysts agreed
that the price of the machines would not drop below the
US$1,000 floor because of the ripple effect it would have
on the rest of the computer industry.
     "To get to a US$500 point would probably mean
inventing a new business model, new OS, new
microprocessor, new group of competitors and new ballgame
with entirely new rules," said Mark Stahlman, president
of market research firm New Media Associates based in New
York.
     The cheap PC is also nothing new to the computer
industry.  The most successful machine via the now
defunct Commodore Amiga had the fastest sales ramp-up in
PC history. Although Commodore failed, the computer
industry today is spurred by the need to bring multimedia
telecommunications en masse.
     Frontiers such as video-conferencing, educational
interactive TV and electronic commerce make it ripe for
brave new worlds.
  "Can the industry withstand a new set of rules?" said
Stahlman.  "It might be here sooner than you think."
     Maybe in February.

THE RACE FOR 'DATABASE ON THE NET' HEATS UP

  The race to become the leader in managing data on the
Web heated up when two prominent Silicon Valley database
management companies agreed to a merger.
     Database software leader Informix Corp. will
purchase for about US$332 million Illustra Information
Technologies, a California-based information management
tool vendor.  The merger was spurred by the World Wide
Web's need for sophisticated software to manage complex
types of data such as audio, video, 3-D graphics and time-
series 'stock markettype' information.
     Roughly 12.9 million shares of Informix stock will
be issued to acquire all outstanding shares of Illustra.
And an additional 2.1 million will be reserved for
Illustra's stock options.  The value of the deal was in
the neighborhood of US$332 million when plans for the
merger were announced.  The actual price tag will be
determined by Informix stock price when the deal finally
is signed.
   "In addition to our shared visions and markets, the
synergy with Illustra's technology gives us a significant
time-to-market advantage," said Phil White, Informix CEO
and chairman.
     Although Informix had been developing its own tools
to handle complex data types, Illustra has slightly more
comprehensive technology and should help Informix' speed
to market by as much as a half-a-year.
     The challenge now facing the two companies is to
integrate their different database products into one line
-in this case, Illustra's management system and Informix'
core parallel database technology known as the Dynamic
Scaleable Architecture (DSA).
     Currently the Illustra tools are compatible with DSA
as a layered environment, requiring developers to
recognize they are dealing with two different products.
A complete integration of the two is expected later this
year and should be a more intelligent repository,
according to Dan Kusnetzky, industry analyst at market
research firm International Data Corporation.
     The companies plan to hire 1,500 to 2,000 new
employees, and have the new integrated product on the
market by October 1996.
     "On one hand I see it as advanced technology and put
them in position of having a very modular environment,"
said Kusnetzky. "But I also feel that maybe Informix may
have paid too much."
     The market for relational database software is
currently anywhere from US$6 billion to US$8 billion,
according to Informix.  That figure is expected to
increase ten-fold within five years due largely in part
to the advent of the World Wide Web.
     The big three database vendors -- Sybase, Oracle and
Informix -- have been jockeying of late for position in
the
fast-growing Internet market.
     Informix also recently announced a linking of its
database offering with Netscape's browser and teamed with
Internet software provider net.Genesis Corp. in a multi-
year bundling agreement.
     The bundled package will include Informix-SE, a
'loadand-go database server; net.Genesis' net.Form, an
automated forms processing engine for the Web; and
net.Genesis' net.Thread, a software product that creates
and manages interactive discussion forums on Web sites.
   The package, carrying the promise to make Web sites
more functional for both consumers and suppliers, will be
introduced sometime in the first quarter 1996.

FIBRE CHANNEL PRODUCTS STARTING TO SHIP

     Users can expect to see much more of Fibre Channel
technology over the next few months as products are
finally starting to ship and industry confidence has been
raised a notch.
     Fibre Channel -an American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) developed standard- was designed as a
single high performance interconnect for use in
enterprise network settings. Fibre Channel is essentially
touted as a highspeed interface for linking mainframes
and peripherals.
     The almost year-and-a-half old standard vendors say
provides for scalability, high performance as well as
interoperability with existing network technologies like
SCSI and TCP/IP. At the most basic level, Fibre Channel
transports data between one buffer at the source device
and another buffer at the end, or destination device.
  The speed and scalability of Fibre Channel, said Doug
Anderson, product manager for Fibre Channel switch
supplier Ancor Communications, are two of the
technology's big perks. Fibre Channel switches, as well
as adapters provide 266Mbps to 1 Gbps per port. Customers
are able to scale of to tens of thousands of ports with
relatively little hassle.
     More so, Fibre Channel offers a high level of
reliability through a credit-based flow control feature.
     "Fibre Channel combines all of the positive
     properties
of both channels and LANs into a single fabric that does
not have any of the disadvantages associated with
either," Anderson said. You are guaranteeing that all
data that is sent is always received...channels offer
very high reliability so you don't end up with dropped
data."
     Proponents of Fibre Channel say that the technology
can practically be used in a LAN as a way of moving
missioncritical traffic over a network, and to storage
and cluster environments.
     But Michael Howard, president of consultancy
Infonetics Research, said that Fibre Channel looks
somewhat limited in its use, and has a long way to go as
far as gaining widespread acceptance within the industry.
At this point there is "a lot more awareness" of
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)  technology than there
is of Fibre Channel.
     "The real use for Fibre Channel is really in a data
center, not as a hub to hub connector or backbone for
your LAN," Howard said. "Other than H-P, there are no
router or hub companies that are [incorporating] Fibre
Channel. That would say to me that the applications are
in the data center."
     On the product front, two major disk drive
manufacturers have begun jumping on the Fibre Channel
bandwagon. Seagate Technology and Western Digital are now
shipping product based on a jointly developed Fibre
Channel interconnect specification that enables high
speed data
transfer between CPUs and their drives.
     One of the main advantages to the Fibre Channel
connectors will be that network managers can add storage to
their systems without actually having to take the server
offline. The interconnect specification has been a joint
effort of Western Digital, AMP Inc., Compaq Computer Corp.
and Sun Microsystems.
     From the systems builders, Compaq said it will use the
technology for storage applications which require large
application systems. The company will include a Fibre
Channel connector on each of its four server clusters that
are due out sometime next year. The servers, analysts say,
are likely to include support for Unix as well as Windows
NT operating systems.
   The companies are touting the connector specification
as key to enterprise computing environments where making
changes to mission-critical systems are made on a regular
basis. By being "hot pluggable" the Fibre Channel
technology assures companies of fault-tolerance in their
systems.
    By having a Fibre Channel connector specification,
users can now count on lower cost systems. Before, users
were required to purchase systems which had proprietary
connectors, which hiked up costs. According to Bryan
Yunker, engineering manager at Western Digital, the Fibre
Channel spec will ultimately give users more storage for
less cost.
     "[With Fibre Channel] you can have a lot of storage
attached, very simply," Yunker said. "You can attach large
quantities of disk drive capacity to a very simple daisy
chain BUS...you can create very cost-effective clusters."
     Jeff Vogel, director of marketing at Western, the
specification "removes what we believe to be the last
bandwidth barrier" for users. "Users will feel more
comfortable now knowing there is a significant
infrastructure in place for their high-speed interconnect
needs," he said.

IBM TO PUMP-UP WAR CHEST, HAS ANALYSTS GUESSING

     Still digesting its new Lotus subsidiary, IBM could
be moving towards yet another - and possibly even bigger
acquisition.
   IBM recently filed papers with the the US regulatory
body, the Securities and Exchange Commission, that say it
wants to add US$1.7 billion to its already massive US$7
billion war chest.
     The filing ignited speculation amongst industry
analysts that plans for Big Blue's often referred to 'King
Kong' acquisition may be in the works.
     IBM quietly registered to issue up the added amount
of stock, debt or warrent just before Christmas.  As word
of the filing spread, analysts quickly became divided on
the motivations behind the company.
   "It doesn't surprise me because IBM will need to make
another acquisition," said Mark Magillivray, president of
H&M Consulting.  "It's no secret IBM is trying to buy its
way into the markets, it constantly talks to companies
behind the scenes."
     Last year, US sources say IBM's offer of US$4.5
billion for Apple was rebuked.  IBM was also believed to
have looked at Novell with or without its WordPerfect
subsidiary.
    Any plans it had of taking on the WordPerfect line
appeared to be failing as a management group backed by
venture capital money is reported to be the front-runner.
     According to Magillivray, the stockpile of cash also
offers important acquisition advantages over borrowed
money. The former gives IBM the option to pursue hostile
power
plays similar to the one in the Lotus deal.
     "Whatever they decide to buy, they will pretty much
get it," said Magillivray.  "And although it may not be
tomorrow, IBM is still interested in Apple... and IBM is
wise to be getting cash together to buy Apple if and when
they get in trouble."
     But not all analysts agreed the 'King Kong'
acquisition -- a term used by IBM's then-Chief Financial
Officer Jerome York after the Lotus buyout who maintained
that this was not the 'King Kong' acquisition IBM hinted
at earlier -- is Apple or any other company.
     One insider, who wished to remain anonymous, believes
IBM may be saving up for a telecommunications company,
while others speculate the company is simply trying to
initiate a stock buyback or firm up its bottom line.
     Another analyst is skeptical of the filing believing
it to be an empty shell.
   "I don't think IBM would have an interest in any mega
deals," said Bob Djurdjevic, lon-time IBM watcher and head
of research firm Annex Research.  "I don't see a reason to
bother with Novell, and although I see an opportunity for
them to get together with Apple, why take on all those
manufacturing problems?"
     Despite the $US3.0 billion acquisition of Lotus and
the over $US4.0 billion of common stock repurchases
completed during 1995, IBM has maintained excellent
liquidity.  And, as IBM continues to improve, the company
will have the increased ability to dedicate a portion of
its internally generated cash flow toward other
discretionary uses.

HIGH-TECH COMPANIES DELIGHTED AFTER CLINTON VETO OVERRIDE

     The U.S. Congress overturned a veto by President
Clinton for the first time... and Silicon Valley's high-
tech companies are celebrating.
     The reason is that the new law Congress passed is
intended to protect companies from frivolous lawsuits.
     High-tech companies are frequent targets of
     securities
fraud lawsuits as a direct result of volatile stock prices
and disgruntled investors.
     A letter from the industry lobby group American
Electronics Association directed to the president and
signed by over 200 companies including 3Com, Hewlett-
Packard and Apple, included a statement from an
unidentified Silicon Valley CEO.
     "There are only two kinds of California technology
companies - those that have been sued, and those about to
be sued," he wrote.
     President Clinton's veto took the AEA by surprise.
In his veto message, Clinton voiced concerns regarding
the difficulty for shareholders to file lawsuits and the
avoidance of liability by high-tech companies for faulty
financial projections.
     Nearly 53 percent of technology companies located
in the Silicon Valley have been sued under current
securities law, including each of the top ten
corporations.
     Estimates total over $600 million in settlements,
     one
third of which was spent on legal fees.
     The Securities Litigation Reform Act will
accomplish increases in corporate disclosure
requirements, including information concerning economic
downturns.
     The bill also provides judges with the mechanism to
force plaintiffs to post bond to cover expenses in
advance of trial.
     In addition the plaintiffs will be required to
submit documentation that a company's conduct was
intentional or
reckless.
     Congressman Sam Farr, a Democrat from California,
spoke on the House floor in support of the bill following
President Clinton's unexpected veto.
     "We need to keep America competitive. Technology
development depends on risk-taking. This bill allows risks
to be taken and rights to be protected. I was shocked by
this veto... I am going to vote to override it. I urge my
colleagues who supported it in the first instance to do so
in the latter."
     Securities legislation was designated as a priority
for the House Republican's "Contract With America" and has
since attracted strong bipartisan support in a political
climate focused on U.S. tort law reformation.
     Mr. Kenneth Glueck, Vice-president of Financial and
Regulatory Affairs for AEA said the organization was
stunned by President Clinton's veto.
     "It was not on anyone's radar screen," Glueck said.
"We were never given any indication."
     Mr. Kevin Richardson, Vice-president of Government
Relations for the Electronics Industry Association,
another industry group, was not surprised by the veto.
   "In the president's weighing of a variety of factors
both substantive and political, he came down on the wrong
side, in favor of the plaintiff bar rather than the
technology market."
     Richardson said he was equally delighted by the
prompt Congressional override as he was disappointed by
Clinton's veto.

PC SALES SOAR TO SENIORS

   PC companies are honing in on a new group of buyers -
people who are 55 plus.
     According to Census Bureau data, 22 percent of adults
over the age of 55 use personal computers, with the most
popular applications being word processing, home/personal
finance and telecommunications.
     The numbers of senior users are only increasing,
according to a recently released Times-Mirror poll, which
indicates a two point percentage gain from just 18 months
ago, totaling 600,000 users age 65 or older.
     The purchasing power of those over 55, who control 40
percent of all discretionary income, has prompted vendors
to try to entice more seniors to the PC marketplace.
     Packard Bell conducted a recent survey of 1,700 PC
households, finding that senior citizens spend more time
on the computer than all other family members, an average
of 12 hours per week conducting personal business. The
survey also found that senior citizens go on-line 3.9
hours a week.
     Packard Bell's arch-rival, Compaq Computer Corp. last
month introduced an advertising campaign with television
spots featuring a pair of older women using a Compaq
system to fax recipes to each other.
   A spokeswoman from Compaq's marketing group said this
does not indicate a move by the company to specifically
target the senior citizen demographic, although the Wall
Street Journal cited a Compaq survey which determined that
11 percent of purchasers of consumer models in the first
half of 1995 were over the age of 55.
     Acer is currently running a print ad featuring an
older male user on-line with the caption, "I surf with my
friends
in Orlando and Sun City." Both these cities are in
Florida's retirement belt.
     An Acer spokesperson said the company "definitely
recognizes that the senior citizen market is booming."
     Acer also recently partnered with Intel to provide
     100
Pentium-processor-based Aspire computers to SeniorNet, a
San Francisco-based non-profit organization, which boasts
nearly 19,000 members and 78 centers nation-wide since its
formation a decade ago.
     Free classes offered through SeniorNet have trained
more than 65,000 older adults age 55 to 101 across the
U.S. Founder and president Dr. Mary Furlong attributes the
success of SeniorNet to "steady growth of on-line use by
seniors... (we) expect this to grow as our population ages
and as we continue adding more services and features to
SeniorNet."
     The volunteer-operated SeniorNet estimates that
computer use among the elderly population has increased by
15 percent on an annual basis since 1990.
     In coordination with Furlong's organization, the
Microsoft Network launched SeniorNet on-line in late
August 1995.
Pathways to Learning, the primary SeniorNet service,
functions as an on-line educational series focusing on
computer literacy and the Internet.
     SeniorNet also encourages senior users to compile
living archives, personal on-line accounts and
perspectives on historical events available for access by
younger users.
     Every major on-line provider offers senior-specific
services, from Prodigy's Seniors Bulletin Board to
CompuServe's Retirement Living Forum.
     World Wide Web sites established for senior
cybersurfers aim at providing educational, medical and
financial resources from a variety of sponsors.

3-D WORLD DEBUTS ON THE WEB

     The newly available commercial three-dimensional
virtual reality environment for the World Wide Web -- the
first of its kind -- is touted by its makers to jump-start
electronic commerce through glossy graphics and greater
customer appeal.
     The environment, called UB World, was created by
California-based UB Networks Inc. -- an independently
operated subsidiary of Tandem Computers.  UB World is a
futuristic three-dimensional environment where multiple
visitors can take on the characteristics of a generic
avatar or a 3-D symbol and traverse a myriad of pathways
through an evolving community.  UB 'virtual employees'
will assist in answering questions or giving directions.
Users can also launch off to other Web sites in UB World.
The environment employs text, graphic and embedded video
clips.
     "In a world of information overload, it is
increasingly difficult to find the data you need," said
Tim Wild, vice president of interactive initiatives for UB
Networks.  "We are providing a 3-D reality-based context,
so visitors can navigate easily with the help of signposts
rather than getting lost in a labyrinth of HTML pages."
     But the world is also a front-end advertisement for
UB Network's line of products.
     UB World will also promote 3-D technology and UB
Network products.  The 'world' has an Interactive
Initiatives pyramid where visitors can go and find out
about the technology behind other electronic offerings
from UB Networks.  Users can also retrieve information
about the UB line of products from the Services pavilion,
whose
architecture is inspired by the company's GeoLan/500
product.  The pavilion will automatically link into the UB
home page.
     Interested parties can download UB World free of
charge from UB Networks' Website at http://www.ub.com.
The product will also become available on CD-Rom in the
near future.

GIGABIT ETHERNET PLANS IN THE WORKS

     Sun Microsystems, Compaq Computer Corp. and 3Com
Corp. are hedging their bets that Gigabit Ethernet is to
be the next hottest backbone technology on the market.
     Gigabit Ethernet - which would provide a ten-fold
performance increase over 100 megabit Ethernet - is still
in the idea stage, said Les Poltrack, director of network
connectivity marketing for Sun Microsystems.
     Though there are no designs or standards in place at
this point, Poltrack said that Gigabit Ethernet is seen as
potentially attractive backbone technology for users with
Ethernet networks already in place. At the same time,
Gigabit Ethernet would be a technology nicely complemented
by companies who have started slowly incorporating
Asynchronous Transfer Mode into the network.
      In short, Ethernet could become for users a
technology applicable to the desktop all the way up to the
backbone, with 10 megabit up to one gigabit transmission
speeds.
   The idea of Gigabit Ethernet has been proposed to the
IEEE as a LAN standard, but there reportedly is still not
a working group in place to draft the standard. The
standards process could take years to complete, let alone
crafting a viable specification. Sun could not provide any
timeline for when Gigabit Ethernet might reach the market.
     Achieving Gigabit Ethernet is at least a couple of
years away, said Michael Howard, president of consultancy
Infonetics research.
     Work has been done in the laboratory to achieve
gigabit speeds, but at very short distances. As such,
feasibility of Gigabit Ethernet is still not a sure thing.
     Although ATM is slated to finally take off in late
1996, the concept of Gigabit Ethernet would be a nice
alternative for companies looking to stick with an
existing infrastructure.
     "The real ATM market has not hit yet," Howard said.
"There are a lot of smaller and medium sized companies and
portions of larger companies that are counting on doing as
much as they can with Ethernet. [With Gigabit Ethernet]
users have the hope that they can built very fast
backbones with Ethernet."

MICROSOFT BACK IN THE GAME WITH INTERNET PLAN

There were a few surprises when Microsoft finally
announced its Internet game plan.
    It included an intention to license technology from
competitors Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp., and the
promise of creating a "community" on the Internet with its
Microsoft Network (MSN) on-line network.
     Microsoft has detailed a number of plans which it
hopes will help paint Netscape and others out of the
picture. In the broadest sense, Microsoft's strategy is
one of integration.
     For example, it has plans to incorporate Internet
access into virtually all of its "mainstay" PC products
such as Windows 95, Windows NT and 3.1, Excel and
Microsoft Word. Microsoft also plans to deliver to users
of Microsoft and Macintosh computer systems free Internet
software. The Internet will become an integral part of
Microsoft's development in every area.
   "You won't see us having an Internet division," said
Microsoft's CEO Bill Gates at a industry briefing. "That
would be like having an electricity division. The Internet
has become pervasive in everything we are doing."
     On to Explorer, Microsoft's Internet browser: the
company is touting several key features with Explorer that
make it a superior technology over competitors.
     For example, multi-threading and progressive
rendering features help with responsiveness of the user
interface to complex Web pages. A proprietary Place Holder
Mode allows for text to be downloaded quickly and easily
before graphics are so users do not have to entertain
themselves in the meantime.
     Unlike other browsers, Explorer supports advanced
multimedia and 3-D capabilities. Explorer 2.0 includes
inline AVIs for embedded videos, scrolling banners,
background audio, context-sensitive menus, as well as
inline Virtual Reality Markup Language for fast viewing of
3-D objects and animation.     The company has also made
official an intent to deliver its previously named
"Blackbird" electronic publishing tool kit to users in the
first part of 1996.
     With a release expected in March of next year,
Blackbird, now renamed "Internet Studio," will serve as a
tool for site developers to create interactive multimedia
pages, without any programming or HTML coding. With
Internet Studio, developers can expect the task of
creating similar static web pages to be made easier, and
at the same time be able to jazz up those pages that need
be more snazzy, said Mike Conte, group manager for
Microsoft's personal systems division.
     "It turns out a lot of people are just using text
editors to create content for their site which is a very
primitive way of doing it," Conte said. "This is a big
step forward, it allows you to create a rich interactive
site without having to know HTML or how to program."
     Sound, graphics, animation and other features are
easily integrated simply by dragging and dropping objects.
The design of a page is essentially separated from the
content of a page, so designers can easily "refresh"
information on a page with little effort. Microsoft claims
that with Internet Studio, businesses are expected to save
time and money it terms of web site maintenance.
     "With Internet Studio, you can create a format once
and simply flow new content into it without having to re-
author your site," Conte said. "It takes care of creating
links between stories and so on... its quite a time saver
for creating stories of equal impact but also have some
tools for creating more exciting sites than you are able
to do today."
     Finally, another "bit" of Internet news: Microsoft's
just announced partnership with the National Broadcasting
Company to deliver an interactive computer news service
and a 24-hour news channel.
     The venture, which from the onset looks to cost in
the whereabouts of $420 million, holds the promise of
providing comprehensive news and a plethora of archived
information for the viewer. Data such as photographs,
videos, historical data and like will be available for
viewers wanting more than just a 30 second news bite.
     According to industry analyst Rob Enderle with
research
firm Giga Information Group, Microsoft's just-revised
Internet strategy is a giant step in the right direction.
Though Netscape is in the headlines now, Enderle warned
that there is still plenty of room for other vendors to
capitalize on the promise of the Internet.
     "The Net is still very new as far as a cultural
mainstay or icon," Enderle said. "The final impact is
still a long way off. We've got a number of years to flush
it out and for vendors to emerge. Netscape was one of the
early players, but its not often that the early players
survive the entire generation."
     At the same time Enderle gave Microsoft high marks
for its company-wide involvement and effort surrounding
the Internet. "It's a level of commitment for a company
Microsoft's size that's pretty unheard of. I think about
six or seven months ago they were completely off track but
they've done a great job of refocusing."

CABLE TELEVISION INDUSTRY EXTENDS TECHNOLOGY TO THE NET

    With lines running past 97% of residential America,
cable TV has the potential to put the Internet at the
fingertips of anyone with a remote control at a speed
1,000 times faster than telephone lines.
     CableLabs, the American cable television industry's
research and development consortium, announced a move to
standardize modem connections with cable systems by April.
     At least 63 million sites already exist as part of
     the
half century-old cable TV infrastructure, which will have
to be overhauled and revamped in order to accommodate the
high market demand for set-top box technology.
     Mike Schwartz, vice-president of Communications,
describes the CableLabs project as a non-profit,
cooperative information clearing house and technology
watchdog.
     "We're not competing with anybody, frankly. We want
to foster an open process for standard specifications
which will bring production costs down."
     There are eight interfaces which CableLabs will
specify: the connection to the consumer's personal
computer; the consumer radio frequency interface,
connecting the cable network to the home; five interfaces
within the cable headend or distribution hub including
router and operation support system interfaces; and an
interface from the headend to wide area networks, to
include Internet backbones and other global data networks.
     CableLabs chairman Dr. John C. Malone acknowledges
that cable operators have already purchased thousands of
cable modems to date, however he says these modems are not
interoperable.
"We applaud the research that went into today's modems,
and obviously wish to use it to get into the marketplace
first. But in the next generation of modems, we look for
more commonality in cable so that vendors may enjoy mass
market sales."
   Plans to unveil the standard specifications for cable
modems, or set-top boxes, may not come early enough for
vendors and manufacturers. Those cable operators reluctant
to wait until April will not be disappointed.
     Motorola has already accepted 500,000 orders for its
CyberSURFER modems and Hewlett-Packard is also contracted
to produce 150,000 set-top boxes before the April
deadline.
    A resulting de facto standard from these models is
anticipated by Rick Lehtinen, senior analyst for In-Stat's
MultiMedia Group. He remains skeptical of CableLabs' April
deadline. According to Lehtinen, "In the face of
prevailing buzzes, I saw nothing to dance in the streets
about," at the
1995 Western Cable Show in Anaheim, California, where
CableLabs made the standardization announcement.
     Malone sees the new initiative on high-speed cable
data modems in a different light. In his announcement at
the Western Cable Show, Malone said "This international
specification will take the World Wide Web a step further,
bringing broadband interconnections into homes worldwide."
     However Lehtinen perceives difficulty in the
     modulation
and inception cable backbone which currently exists.
"There is a finite number of channels available through
cable, whereas wireless cable advanced modulation systems
and satellite systems have achieved phenomenal
penetration."
     Although coaxial connections offer 1,000 times the
bandwidth of the fastest available telephone network
connection, according to Lehtinen, this by no means
indicates a plethora of alternatives. He says that the
nation's cable TV network, which has primarily been used
for "downstream" or one-way transmissions, is subject to
interference from police scanners, CB radios and even
Christmas lights.
     A pilot scheme, Project Agora is designed to test
these and other problems in large-scale, "upstream" or two-
way use of set-top boxes. Continental Cablevision, the
fourth largest cable operator in the U.S., is sponsoring
the test, using Boston College faculty and students as a
focal group.
     Continental furnished 6,600 dormitories, 2,500
classrooms and 400 offices on the campus with cable modems
for a period of several months. The company found that on
line users prefer the speed of cable modems for functions
such as downloading graphics and massive files.
     Telephone companies are currently in the process of
launching a competitive alternative to cable modems,
offering a service known as ISDN, dedicated lines which
will carry digital data at higher speeds, but still not
comparable to the speed which set-top boxes provide.
     The question remains, however, who shall lead and
eventually dominate the cable TV industry's onramp to the
information super highway, exacting monthly tolls of
anywhere from $20 to $30 for leasing the modem alone.
Estimated rate projections fluctuate from $30 to $40 per
month for service providers, which the cable television
industry hopes to become.

DESKTOP VIDEOCONFERENCING STILL NOT SET TO TAKE OFF

   1995 was touted as the year desktop videoconferencing
would blossom as prices dropped and standards were
solidified.
   Not so and now some industry watchers are painting a
gloomy picture for the technology's future.
     The hardware and software costs for desktop
videoconferencing are falling, but analysts point to the
hidden costs of installing and managing videoconferencing
on the network as a source of discouragement amongst MIS
managers. More so, there are simply are not enough
applications available for companies to deem desktop
videoconferencing an essential component on the network.
     TeleSpan Publishing Corporation indicates there was a
slump in worldwide desktop videoconferencing shipments
from the second to third quarter of 1995: in the second
quarter, 19,693 units were shipped, whereas in the third
quarter, 17,176 units were shipped, a 12.8 percent drop.
     On the other hand, a wide angle look at the market
shows much more promise: TeleSpan reports that in the
third quarter of 1994, shipments totaled 7,013 - there has
been a 120 percent jump over the past year.
     Tom Pincince, analyst with Massachusetts based
research firm Forrester Research, said that desktop
videoconferencing has not taken off because it has not
become an essential part of conducting day to day
business. For the most part, such units are typically
installed for only the top 10 or so executives in a
company.
     "There is just not this compelling need for everyone
to go out and get it on their desktop," Pincince said.
"It's a really sexy application, but if you are an MIS
manager trying to figure out whether or not this is an
application that you want to deploy on thousands of
desktops...it's not hard to figure out the answer is no."
   A study conducted by Forrester further indicates that
desktop videoconferencing has a long way to go before
receiving universal acceptance. The company just presented
50 Fortune 1,000 data communications and
telecommunications managers with the following question:
"What would it take for you to put videoconferencing on
your LAN?"
    For the most part, responses indicated that lack of
applications, lack of bandwidth, and the high cost of
overhauling a network to include video to the desktop mean
desktop videoconferencing will not become prevalent on the
LAN for five years. Forrester concluded that even when it
does become commonplace, videoconferencing will not
transform business interaction.
     In terms of costs, Forrester estimates that in order
to successfully implement video at the desktop, total
costs to lay the foundation for videoconferencing will run
in the whereabouts of US$6,000 per seat. The costs include
not only the video equipment: camera, software and sound
equipment, but a router upgrade, "people time," a switched
workgroup, a video LAN/WAN gateway, and Pentium-class
machine with a fast monitor.
     "[Hesitancy] used to be about cost and complexity;
that has gotten fixed over time," Pincince said. "The real
issue is that there is a big hidden cost in LAN-based
videoconferencing. Even if they zero out the cost of the
desktop, there is still a significant infrastructure
cost."
     Other industry watchers say that though desktop
videoconferencing has been slow to gain momentum,
proliferation will take less than five years.
     Ultimately, the prices for the basic
hardware/software components will become so attractive
over the next few years that "everybody is going to jump
into [videoconferencing]," said Will Strauss, president of
research Forward Concepts. Now though, Strauss said market
growth has been "painfully slow," and Forward Concepts is
"in total dismay with the way things are going."
     Though companies like Forrester claim that there is a
high price to pay for video on the desktop, Strauss said
it is simply a matter of sacrificing quality. Users will
not in every case require the best possible conditions to
deploy videoconferencing.
     A survey conducted by Forward Concepts of more than
250 end users indicated that a majority of users will be
satisfied with video over the plain old telephone lines
(POTS) and will want video to the desktop as an option.
The company predicts that LAN pipelines and ISDN will
proliferate as well, and in the next three years two-way
cable TV will prove a popular videoconferencing pipeline
option.
   "We've got [interoperability] industry standards like
H.324 which will enable a lot of people to call up each
other and see some incredibly bad video," Strauss said.
"What we have found is nobody wants it
[videoconferencing], but everybody will use it if the
price is close to free."
     As it stands, basic software/hardware costs will
decline over the next few years, Strauss reports. This
year, Strauss predicts that the cost of a
videoconferencing "essentials" will be US$1,948. Next
year, that cost will be down to US$598, and by the year
2000, that will price will be around US$207, Strauss
claims.
     On the applications front, analysts have mixed
opinions of how and when desktop videoconferencing will be
useful. On one hand, Pincince emphasizes that "the
business applications where you need to see someone's face
are really limited." Even though data collaboration is
becoming a more popular reason to utilizing
videoconferencing equipment, analysts say the time spent
actually looking at one another on the screen is usually
very little. Still, many employees will desire
videoconferencing capabilities to avoid travel and to
maintain contact with key associates.
     Outside of a traditional business setting, desktop
videoconferencing will increasingly become an important
tool in specialized fields, such as for telemedicine
applications.
     Beyond staring at a jittery picture of business
partner's face, Forrester predicts in the future - beyond
the year 2000 - there will be more unique ways of
utilizing video to the desktop. For example, businesses
might create "virtual environments" somewhat like those
created for games like Doom where a number of players - or
in this case business partners - can interact by taking on
the persona of a character of a machine. Far out maybe,
but not far off, Forrester predicts.
   Of course, the vendors themselves do not admit to any
disappointing figures in terms of desktop
videoconferencing units. Intel, for example, says that the
next year, and years beyond look bright.
     Intel with its ProShare videoconferencing system,
along with companies PictureTel, Compression Labs Inc. and
the like are promising users increased functionality,
lowered prices and better computing power to deliver
higher quality systems this year - all over the globe.
     Intel, for example, says its videoconferencing units
have been deployed in around 28 countries across the globe
to date, including locations in North America, Latin
America, the Asia Pacific and European regions said Scott
Darling, director of marketing for Intel communications.
Many countries of course have a different level of
requirements based on factors like the sophistication of
the network.
     "There are subtleties in each country by media type
and other various factors," Darling said. "More
importantly, the critical thing to do is work with
customers around defining applications."
     "It's not a matter of going in and selling
conferencing as a broad, horizontal capability... it's
important to go in and talk about specific applications
and what the return on investment for those applications
is," he continued.
    Intel said in terms of a desktop videoconferencing
strategy, the whole point is to further make the PC a
"communicating PC," providing users with every possible
option to make communication easier. As such, video would
become as commonplace as the modem.

Plain Talk On What's Ahead For Taiwan's Chip Business -- Industry
leaders speak out on fab plans, technology alliances, and strategies
for the next decade


Taiwan's semiconductor industry is headed for sales of $6.5
billion in 1995, according to a Dataquest Taiwan estimate.
That's still only about half of Intel's annual revenue, but
it represents growth of more than 50% over 1994. It is clear
that the island's chip makers are emerging as a force in the
world market. In the next few years, we will be hearing a lot
more from the executives behind these fast-growing companies,
but these execs are not well-known names in U.S. business circles
today.

For that reason, in this first edition of Marketplace Taiwan
for 1996, Electronic Buyers' News has brought together four
executives who are playing major roles in Taiwan's drive to
become a semiconductor production powerhouse: Morris Chang,
Chin Wu, Miin Wu, and D.Y. Yang.

Morris Chang, chairman, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
Ltd., Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp., and Wyse
Technology Inc.

One of the architects of Taiwan's IC business, Chang has held
many top posts in the island's high-technology companies. He
is currently chairman of three companies: TSMC, the world's
largest wafer foundry company; Vanguard, a dynamic RAM (DRAM)
startup; and Wyse, a supplier of X86-based servers.

Chin Wu, president, Acer Laboratories Inc. (ALI)

ALI, a subsidiary of Acer Inc., is one of Taiwan's largest design
houses, providing core logic, Super I/O, and other products.

Miin Wu, president, Macronix International Co. Ltd.

Macronix is Taiwan's largest supplier of nonvolatile memories,
including flash, EPROMs, and ROMs.

D.Y. Yang, president, Winbond Electronics Corp.

Winbond is Taiwan's largest maker of static RAMs (SRAMs). The
company recently entered a foundry and technology alliance
for DRAMs with Toshiba Corp.

Electronic Buyers' News (EBN): Taiwan's semiconductor industry
is one of the fastest-growing in the world, with somewhere
between 15 and 20 8-in. wafer fabs under construction or in
the planning stage-with most scheduled to come online by 2000.
Are the island's chip makers having any second thoughts about
the world market? Are there concerns about a glut of capacity?

Morris Chang: I'm optimistic about the worldwide chip business.
I believe the world IC market will grow an average of 20% per
year in the next five years, and will reach $300 billion by
the year 2000. While supply will catch up with demand in the
late 1990s, I do not see a capacity glut at that time.

Miin Wu: By the year 2000, compared to 1995, the chip business
will double. The semiconductor demand is very strong because
PC prices are going down fast, and other factors.

D.Y. Yang: In the long run, the chip business will continue
to show strong growth. Some basic drivers will be personal
computers, wireless phones, and all the features that make
the PC user-friendly. The basic issue facing the industry is
supply and demand. The industry has been investing for some
time, but there have been product shortages, thereby causing
prices to stabilize. Suddenly, companies [chip makers] find
themselves very profitable, and then they've tended to increase
investment. So maybe during the next two years we could see
some of this capacity catching up with demand. But in general,
we don't foresee an oversupply.

EBN: Taiwan's semiconductor industry has experienced double
digit growth in recent years, and many analysts expect that
again this year. Can the industry continue to sustain that
pace of growth in 1996 and beyond?

Morris Chang: In recent years, the world IC industry has grown
at a rate of 25% plus per year, and Taiwan's IC industry has
grown at an even higher rate every year. Looking ahead at the
next few years, I think that worldwide IC growth will moderate
to about 20% per year, and Taiwan's growth will be correspondingly
moderate. However, I think Taiwan's IC industry will still
grow faster than the worldwide total, because Taiwan has been
investing more than average, and the availability of talent
at all levels and functions is still greater in Taiwan than
in many other parts of the world.

Chin Wu: For Taiwan's chip makers, it heavily depends on the
PC business, because Taiwan's IC companies supply a lot of
PC-related products, such as SRAMs for core logic. Even [foundry]
TSMC has many PC-related customers who are in the graphics
I/O market and so on. So the outlook for Taiwan's IC industry
seems promising, since the PC market is still showing 20% growth.

Miin Wu: It's going to be difficult to sustain the growth rate
from the last couple of years, but it's difficult to predict
the future. If you look at the total capacity output from Taiwan,
it still has a small part in the world IC market, less than
10% market share. But many Taiwan companies believe they can
have a piece of the pie. That's why there are almost 20 fabs
being built in Taiwan. If you look at these 20 fabs, some companies
are doing foundry. Some companies are doing DRAM. If the market
is big enough to support those companies, everybody will be
successful. If not, this may create a problem.

D.Y. Yang: In Taiwan, there's been a lot of announcements of
new fabs. But basically, those new fabs are foundries. So that
means we have an increase in capacity. However, many of the
U.S. companies are coming to Taiwan and using the foundry capacity
here. We shouldn't be too worried about those new fabs.

EBN: How concerned are Taiwan chip makers about Intel's push
into the motherboard and chip-set business?

Chin Wu: The core-logic market could experience 20% growth,
or just under 30% growth, this year. If Intel takes 50% or
60% of that market, the overall core market is smaller. This
will have a lot of impact on the individual core-logic supplier.
Let's say there's going to be 60 to 70 million PCs shipped
next year. At least 10% of those shipments will be PowerPC
based systems from Apple. We'll still have at least 55 to 60
million sets with an equal number of PC chip sets. No doubt
Intel could get half of those shipments, perhaps a 50% to 60%
market share.

Miin Wu: There may not be a major impact in the long run, because
we are seeing the bigger players dominate the local PC industry.
Smaller companies are dying out, because of cost and quality
factors. In the long run, this will make Taiwan's PC industry
healthier.

D.Y. Yang: Looking at the bigger picture, Intel is doing a favor
for the entire industry by trying to improve the price/performance
of the PC.

Intel is improving the performance while cutting down the cost
of the CPU. Intel's priority is to maintain growth and enlarge
the demand for personal computers. Of course, since they are
a leader, all the players have to watch the leader's behavior
very closely. There's a saying: "If you are dancing with an
elephant, it's your responsibility not to get stepped on."

EBN: Taiwan's electronics business, much like Korea's and Singapore's,
has reached the point where it can no longer compete on low
cost manufacturing. Now it takes real investment in R&D, serious
money, and companies have to compete on technology that they
themselves have developed. Can Taiwan's chip makers compete
on that level against Japanese and U.S. companies?

Morris Chang: Let me limit my answer to Taiwan. In the next
few years, I believe low-cost manufacturing will still be a
key strength of Taiwan. Low-cost manufacturing is very important
in the chip business. It is the ever lower cost per electronic
function that makes Moore's Law a reality.

To develop ever more advanced submicron technology in order
to achieve ever higher performance and lower cost per function,
heavy R&D spending is required, and Taiwan is investing in
that.

Chin Wu: In the past two or three years, Taiwan's design houses
have demonstrated they have the technology to compete in the
worldwide chip-set market. In the graphics controller segment,
S3, Cirrus Logic, and ATI are the leading vendors. But ALI
and SIS [Silicon Integrated Systems Corp.] can make a product
as good or better than the market leaders. What Taiwan's design
houses need to do is to be more involved in talking with U.S.
customers and more involved in associations to find the right
trends.

Miin Wu: To survive in this business in the long run, Taiwan
has to move into more value-added products. At Macronix, we
have a different strategy than other companies in Taiwan: We
want to be a leader in value-added product development. But
it's up to every company to decide what strategy to follow.
If Taiwan companies continue to believe in the manufacturing
or foundry philosophy, then Taiwan will be in trouble later
on. Manufacturing or foundry has a lower barrier to entry in
the semiconductor industry. But China, and most recently Malaysia,
are catching up very quickly in the semiconductor business.
If [China, Malaysia, and other nations] move into the foundry
business, they don't have to worry about product, or even process
technology; the customer provides this. If they want to build
up their volumes, they could someday undercut the prices of
Taiwan's manufacturers.

D.Y. Yang: Taiwan has proven its excellence in manufacturing,
in terms of technology and engineering. For example, we can
improve the yields, and we are also capable in terms of manufacturing
management, that is, cycle time and so on. But there's room
for improvement in design and product development.

There are very few countries-maybe none-that can compete with
the U.S. in that regard. The U.S. is still the leader in developing
digital and information technologies. Our objective is to minimize
the gap, and to try to follow U.S. trends as closely as possible.

EBN: We've seen some chip partnerships between Taiwan and multinational
chip makers, like TI-Acer, Powerchip Semiconductor, TSMC, and
others. Is that kind of partnership business model going to
be necessary for Taiwan semiconductor makers to succeed as
the technology stakes get higher?

Chin Wu: When you advance from 0.5-micron to 0.35-micron and
down to 0.25-micron, you need more and more investment. You
will need certain economies of scale. If you don't have economies
of scale, then you may have to partner with others to offset
some of your risk.

D. Y. Yang: International alliances are a trend in this business,
because of the huge capital investments involved. The requirements
for capital expenditures have increased so fast. So there's
very few companies-maybe only Intel-that are profitable enough
to generate the necessary capital to sustain the growth. Because
we cannot establish the design capabilities in a very short
time, we can move into the industry by doing foundry or forming
a joint venture in DRAMs. You don't need product in these two
businesses. You need capital.

EBN: Should we expect to see Taiwan IC companies investing in
fabs or making acquisitions in the United States in the future,
much like Korean chip makers?

Morris Chang: TSMC is investing in a foundry company in the
U.S. However, I don't see this as a trend yet for Taiwan's
IC industry.

Chin Wu: We haven't seen many successful mergers in the electronics
industry. But I could see more joint ventures developing between
Asian and U.S. or European companies.

Miin Wu: It makes sense to develop some future expansion plan
outside Taiwan. At this point, we'll keep our eyes open, but
we have no firm plans yet.

D.Y. Yang: The Koreans have their own DRAM design and technology.
So they can move their manufacturing to a lower-cost site or
a place to gain market access. We must seriously study the
advantages before we move a fab outside Taiwan. On the other
hand, we may have to look outside Taiwan. Taiwan is perhaps
running into some infrastructure issues-not now, maybe in the
next two, three, or five years. For example, we are running
out of qualified people and engineers. We also have shortages
of water and electricity.

EBN: Singapore's IC industry is tiny but very aggressive right
now, especially in the foundry business. Government there is
putting the infrastructure in place for two or three "fab parks"
that could accommodate 25 to 30 fabs. Do you see Singapore
posing a threat to Taiwan's semiconductor industry?

Chin Wu: First, let me say that Taiwan's success in electronics
is due to several factors. Taiwan has 20 million people. The
people from the operator to the engineer and to the management
have learned through solid education and experience during
the last decade. Also, a lot of Taiwan people who went abroad
to study or work have come back to Taiwan. Most of the people
from Taiwan who went to the U.S. are more technically oriented,
compared to people in Singapore. Singapore is limited in resources
and technical people. They are successful in running corporations
like Chartered [Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd.], but
that's small-scale. Up to now, they are only running 20,000
wafers per month. However, the companies in Singapore are well
managed. That is their strength.

Miin Wu: In some areas in the semiconductor industry, Taiwan
companies are better. In other areas, Singapore companies are
better. Over all, Singapore is as good as Taiwan. Also, Singapore
has been known as a financial center, which will attract a
lot of multinational [semiconductor] companies.

Actually, Singapore may be in a better position than Taiwan,
because of its political stability and the freedom of the financial
community. Certainly, I think Singapore will be a threat to
Taiwan. So I think that's another reason why Taiwan has to
move into more value-added products instead of staying on the
manufacturing-only side.

D.Y. Yang: We can't underestimate the aggressiveness of the
Singapore government. The government has been the driving force
behind all the success we've seen in Singapore. I believe they
will become a serious competitor in doing at least the foundry
business. Over all, Singapore may not be a threat, but they
will certainly become a competitor. But Singapore needs to
resolve one issue: Where will the qualified people and engineers
coming from? Even if they hire some people from China, is that
going to be enough to support 30 fabs?

EBN: Taiwan's government has played an important role in the
establishment and growth of the island's semiconductor industry,
both as a financial backer and through organizations like the
Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Electronics
Industry Service Organization. Will ITRI and ERSO continue
to play an important role in the industry's growth? Have your
own views on industrial policy changed over time?

Morris Chang: While ITRI/ERSO played a significant role in Taiwan's
IC development, it has recently shifted its emphasis away from
MOS ICs. The reason is that the private sector is sufficiently
developed and should grow on its own. I don't foresee a major
role for ITRI/ERSO in future MOS IC development.

Chin Wu: In the past, the government has contributed to Taiwan's
success. ITRI/ERSO formed the nucleus of the semiconductor
industry, including TSMC and UMC. The government also established
the Hsinchu Science Park. Now, Taiwan's semiconductor industry
no longer needs a sector like ITRI/ERSO.

Miin Wu: Certainly, Taiwan's semiconductor industry has been
fully supported by the government, and government did an excellent
job in creating this opportunity. It minimized the risk for
the private sector in the beginning, but [the private sector]
has since been able to bring out advanced products and technology.
In the future, ERSO will have a difficult time to position
itself.

D.Y. Yang: I believe Taiwan's IC industry is too big for the
government to support. The industry is capable of being on
its own. ERSO can do some coordination or provide some marketing
information. So that means its role has been reduced, and it
won't play a significant role in the future. ITRI's existence
is due to the weakness of the industry. But the industry is
very strong [now]. In terms of research, some universities
in Taiwan may take over the role of ITRI; it is a self-destructing
institution.

EBN: What are your views on the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement?
Should it lapse?

Miin Wu: This is difficult to answer, but I believe in free
competition. If every country opens up its market for people
to freely compete, there's no need for any agreements. Right
now, the Japanese believe they are buying enough from overseas,
so there's no need for an agreement. We should look at the
facts, and whether or not Japan is really doing that. If things
go the wrong way and Japan closes its door, then I'm sure the
U.S. government will come back again.

The Next Wave -- A new generation of chip makers targets foundries
and DRAMs to compete with neighbors Korea and Japan

By:
Mark LaPedus

Taiwan's semiconductor industry accounted for a mere 3% of the
world market last year. But while the island's IC entrepreneurs
may not yet pose a threat to Asia's two chip-making powerhouses,
Japan and Korea, it is clear they soon will be a force to reckon
with. The island's semiconductor revenue is expected to reach
$6.5 billion in 1996, a 54.7% jump from 1995, according to
Ben Lee, an analyst with Dataquest Taiwan, Taipei.

The pace of change in the island's IC sector during the past
18 months can only be described as frantic. With startups,
technology alliances, and joint ventures being announced on
a monthly and sometimes weekly basis, U.S. OEMs looking for
opportunities in Taiwan's chip industry need a scorecard just
to keep track of who the players are and who owns what company.

Only 18 months ago, the island's entire IC industry consisted
of eight companies with fabs, plus a dozen or so design houses.
But booming sales in the chip market worldwide, coupled with
readily accessible and affordable capital in Taipei, have led
to the launch over the past year and a half of eight semiconductor
companies with plans to build fabs. Put those new makers' plans
together with expansion at the island's original eight and
you have some 15 to 20 8-in. fabs now being planned for the
near future.

Taiwan's new wave of chip hopefuls is focusing on the two hottest
sectors in the business: dynamic RAMs (DRAMs) and foundry services.
These new contenders, some with little or no experience in
the semiconductor business-one calls itself a "Livestock Corp."
are certainly not household names. Some are a mystery even
to industry analysts who track Asian business. However, they
cannot be ignored.

That's why EBN has prepared its own scorecard-a Directory of
Taiwan's Semiconductor Industry-which follows this introduction.

A thumbnail sketch shows that in 1994, Taiwan's industry consisted
of two DRAM makers-Mosel-Vitelic Inc. and Texas Instruments
Acer Inc., a joint venture between TI and Acer. During the
past 18 months, three more DRAM companies have been launched
 Nan Ya Technology Corp., Powerchip Semiconductor Corp., and
Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp.

Nan Ya's parent company, Nan Ya Plastics Corp., is Taiwan's
largest printed-circuit-board maker, while Powerchip is a joint
venture invested in by Taiwan's Umax Group and Japan's Mitsubishi
Electric Corp. and Kanematsu Corp. A little more than a year
ago, Vanguard was a government-owned R&D facility. The fab
was spun off to become a commercial DRAM maker, thanks in part
to a group of investors led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. Ltd. (TSMC)

Two old-timers in Taiwan's IC industry, United Microelectronics
Corp. (UMC) and Winbond Electronics Corp., also plan to jump
into the DRAM business by 1997.

To complicate matters, UMC and several fabless IC houses have
recently announced the launch of three joint-venture companies
in the wafer foundry business: United Semiconductor Corp.,
United Silicon Corp., and a yet-to-be-named foundry.

Another wafer foundry service launched earlier this year is
Asia Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., not to be confused
with TSMC. The Hsinchu Science-Based Park foundry will operate
an 8-in. wafer fab that is scheduled to start production in
1997.

Perhaps the most bizarre entrant in the chip business this year
is the Chia Hsin Livestock Corp. Little is known about the
company other than the fact its primary investor is Hualon
Microelectronics Corp., a Taiwan IC maker whose parent company
is one of the largest textile concerns on the island.

Buyers sourcing chips in Taiwan are advised to obtain copies
of product guidebooks from local trade associations such as
the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association
(TEEMA), which can be reached by telephone at 886-2-999-2828,

Big Distribs Woo Small Customers -- HH, Others Boost Telesales
Programs

By:
Barbara Jorgensen

Boston - As more business is channeled through distribution
and the big customers continue to get bigger, top-tier distributors
have had to find ways of servicing small customers or risk
losing them to second-tier distributors, catalog houses, and
independents.

Most recently, Avnet Inc. has upgraded a telesales initiative
which includes Hamilton Hallmark Express Service-that began
in 1992. Other distributors with similar programs include Future
Electronics Inc., which launched its Future Active Industrial
(FAI) effort two years ago, and Bell Industries Inc., which
created a telesales/account development program five years
ago. Marshall Industries launched its effort around the same
time.

Centralization efforts in the middle to late 1980s, which pulled
inventory and sales- people into regional "hubs," led to increased
customer traffic at fewer locations and placed tremendous demand
on inside salespeople. The small accounts got poor service
or none at all. One distribution insider recalls faxes constantly
getting misplaced and quotes taking days. And since salespeople
usually are commissioned, large orders received the most attention.

By their own accounts, the efforts of Hamilton Hallmark, Bell,
and Future are working. Avnet telesales is tracking 20,000
incoming calls per week. Bell Industries' account development
program has grown from $8 million in 1991 to $50 million this
year. Although Future declined to disclose sales figures, its
FAI program has grown from 47 to 55 locations and from 400
to 500 FAI account executives in the past year.

Admittedly, these efforts were designed in part to offload traffic
from inside salespeople, but they've also educated distributors
on the small-customer base. For example, instead of the one
piece or two-piece MRO orders Avnet thought could be served
by a catalog, the company discovered otherwise, said Gary Berg,
vice president and national director of telesales.

"At launch [of telesales], we did not distinguish catalog sales
from small customers," he said. "But we didn't get the base
we expected. Instead of one- or two-piece orders, we got customers
with large DTAMs [distribution total available markets] not
doing business with Avnet."

The ultimate goal of these programs is not to hand customers
off-although customers may feel differently-but to dedicate
a group of people taking ownership of "their" customer base.
Each approach is a bit different.

Hamilton Hallmark Express Service and Time Electronics Regional
Support, both of which are under Avnet EMG, are handled by
the same two sites: Tempe, Ariz., and Peabody, Mass. Despite
sharing these resources, Hamilton Hallmark and Time handle
customers differently. While both organizations handle incoming
calls directed to their respective reps, Time's salespeople
are more actively involved in external marketing, including
direct mail followup calls.

Hamilton Hallmark Express Service has grown to become a $75
million operation and generates 500 new or re-emerging accounts
per month. Although average orders are about $361, orders of
up to $50,000 are handled by the operation, said Lloyd Kaplan,
Hamilton Hallmark's senior vice president of marketing.

Sales reps have phone and PC integration. Caller ID shows the
number of the caller, and a window automatically pops on the
PC screen with the caller's sales history, the customer's profile,
account number, notes, address, buyer contacts, and other information.

Incoming calls are automatically routed to the next available
rep, but can also go to a particular rep or product specialist
if the customer prefers. Express Service has approximately
70 sales reps, all handling "generic" calls, although Express
Service is realizing the need to specialize. Supplier representatives,
called supplier advocates, train telesales people to handle
supplier-specific calls. Time's reps receive intensive product
training on its interconnect, passive, and electromechanical
products, said Time president Burt Katz.

Sales reps are salaried, which discourages competition between
Express Service and field salespeople. Bonuses are based on
customer-satisfaction reviews.

Express Service customers needing technical assistance can be
conferenced in to Hamilton Hallmark's Technical Support Center
in Chandler, Ariz. Telesales can also arrange for customers
to be called on by either a technical or field sales rep, although
that customer can still be supported by telesales.

Orders, including parts that are design-registered, are flagged,
and field offices are notified (because design wins are subject
to special relationships with suppliers), as are customers
that a supplier may not sell to. For example, Motorola SPS,
Phoenix, has asked its distributors not to sell to certain
non-OEMs, and incoming calls from those customers are flagged.

In development is a technology to directly route incoming calls
to the last rep to whom a customer spoke. All the information
generated in the telesales database will eventually be downloaded
to a master Customer Contact Database, which will track customer
information and be used, among other things, to generate relevant
information for the distributor and the customer.

Bell Industries realized about five years ago it could not be
all things to all customers, said Bonnie Cunningham, vice president
for account development at the Los Angeles distributor. Bell
constructed its account development program with two goals
in mind: to allow Bell's outside and inside sales forces to
partner on the largest customers, but to also dedicate a group
for which developing customers is the most important goal.
Although customers sometimes are referred to inside or outside
salespeople, Bell reps may stay with a customer no matter how
large the account becomes.

The account development group is located in Bell's Los Angeles
headquarters and acts as an extension of the field sales organization.
Reps have their own geographies and frequently cooperate with
their respective field salespeople. The customer can be serviced
either locally or through Los Angeles, an arrangement generally
transparent to the customer.

Bell maintains that these accounts have the best of both worlds
 regional support plus a toll-free number and the West Coast
time zone. With corporate buyers, product managers, and other
support in Los Angeles, telesales can often get answers more
quickly and with fewer phone calls.

Account development reps are salaried plus commissioned, and
handle both incoming and outgoing sales calls.

Reps are networked with Bell's divisions, and through its Contact
Management software they keep customer records, notes, phone
numbers, and fax numbers in a file that can be accessed by
anyone taking the call. Caller ID is in the works.

Future's FAI program "has had a significant positive impact
on our ability to service our tier-2 and tier-3 customer base,
and our emerging accounts," said E. Stephen Segal, executive
vice president of the Pointe Claire, Quebec, distributor.

FAI began in 1993 and was designed to be more than a telephone
based operation. "Each local division has FAI," Segal explained.
"They are part of the branch but dedicated to that customer
base. People are account executives and visit their customers.
In fact, they are required to do some face-to-face meetings."
This is the key differentiator from other programs, Segal said.

Every North American branch has FAI reps, as do several locations
where Future does not have a branch. Small customers can also
get access to technical support: their FAI rep will "qualify"
them and can recommend support from field application engineers.

Vendors Shun SDRAM 'Lite'

By:
Anthony Cataldo

San Mateo, Calif. - NEC Corp.'s bid to promote a stripped-down
version of the synchronous DRAM is losing support from other
major vendors, which are opting to offer a full-featured SDRAM
instead.

Hitachi Ltd. and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. are among those
that have declined to build the SDRAM lite, which NEC bills
as a low-cost SDRAM solution for PC makers wishing to adopt
synchronous memory technology by early next year.

Conceived as a way to reduce the high test costs associated
with the JEDEC-standard SDRAM, the SDRAM lite uses a subset
of the JEDEC architecture and is compatible with standard DRAM
test equipment and techniques.

Some memory makers expect to rein in test costs during high
volume SDRAM production. "In the long term, there isn't enough
cost difference to justify two types of SDRAMs," said Jim Sogas,
product manager for the Semiconductor & IC Division of Hitachi
America Ltd., Brisbane, Calif. "I think the whole industry
is better served by dropping the concept of a low-calorie SDRAM,
and I think most other manufacturers are coming to the same
conclusion."

NEC has been lobbying other DRAM makers to gain support for
SDRAM lite, which is said to be easier to make than the full
standard SDRAM. "It's a challenging part to make," said Jim
Handy, principal analyst at Dataquest Inc., San Jose. "People
were finding out they could not get [full-standard SDRAM] parts
to yield to such a high clock cycle. [But] those who can field
a fast part don't need the SDRAM-lite spec."

The different SDRAM types should pose no compatibility conflicts
for desktop PCs, although there may be some difficulty in swapping
the two designs for other applications such as set-top boxes
and workstations, said Mark Ellsberry, vice president of marketing
for Samsung, San Jose. "Our part will be fully compatible with
SDRAM lite," he said. But SDRAM lite "won't be fully compatible
with ours because it's a subset of the [JEDEC standard]."

Samsung chose to stick with the full-standard design after concluding
it could eliminate any price premium by the time significant
volume shipments begin in 1997, Ellsberry said. Analysts said
that low yields and the accompanying higher selling prices
have hampered the efforts of other memory makers to lower SDRAM
prices. "We've determined that in the first half of 1996, volume
will still be relatively small," Ellsberry said. "I think we're
going to see some wholesale switches in '97."

But NEC said demand for SDRAMs will crop up earlier, creating
demand for both versions of the part. NEC now offers both SDRAM
versions.

"We think the market is real for SDRAMs before 1997," said Kevin
Krehbiel, DRAM product marketing manager for NEC Electronics
Inc., Mountain View, Calif. "We're trying to reduce costs to
enable price-sensitive markets such as PCs to adopt SDRAMs
as early as possible."

NEC hopes to offer its SDRAM lite for a 5% premium over the
standard DRAM by the first half of 1996, while Samsung is aiming
for an 18% premium for the full SDRAM over the standard DRAM.
Samsung will close that gap further in the second half of 1996
by selling the parts for 8% above standard DRAMs, Ellsberry
said. And by 1997 the parts will be offered with no price penalty
over standard DRAMs, he said.

Sogas said PC makers are also becoming more interested in using
some of the functions removed from the full SDRAM to create
SDRAM lite, such as additional timing variations.

PCBs Face Materials Shortage

By:
Diane Norman

Chicago - Printed-circuit-board manufacturers can expect higher
prices and longer lead times next year for laminates based
on fiberglass, as shortages of the critical material are expected
to worsen.

Even board makers that produce their own laminates will be pinched
by restricted fiberglass supplies, which will worsen when the
market's leading glass manufacturers shut existing furnaces
to perform necessary maintenance.

"The board business is going to be kind of bleak over the next
four or five months," said Robert Herring, president of Herco
Technology Inc., a $48 million board maker in San Diego. "Our
glass suppliers tell us we are only going to be able to get
80% of what we want. Meanwhile, our board business is expanding."

Herco has held the line on board prices even though its material
costs increased 12% this year, Herring said. Other board makers
said they have also kept prices stable because the market is
so competitive and customers strongly resist any increases.

But Advanced Flex Inc., a $30 million printed-circuit-board
maker in Minnetonka, Minn., has told its customers to expect
a price increase after the first of the year. The company did
not provide specifics.

Advanced Flex is quoting lead times of eight weeks, compared
with lead times of four to five weeks that were common earlier
this year. "We've asked our laminate suppliers to increase
our inventory, but they said no, " said general sales manager
Butch Chayer. "If you don't have an alliance or some sort of
agreement with your supplier, you could be in a little trouble."

Resin-coated fiberglass cloths are widely used as laminates
in printed-circuit boards. The leading domestic suppliers of
fiberglass strands-Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., Toledo, Ohio,
and PPG Industries, Pittsburgh-have announced plans to close
some of their lines in 1996 to perform routine maintenance,
a process that can close a furnace for two to three months,
analysts said. "They have been milking the [equipment] along,
but now they are at the point where they are going to have
to take some of them down," said Dave Bergman, technical director
of the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic
Circuits (IPC), Northbrook, Ill.

Neither glass supplier returned calls for comment last week.

Owens-Corning will spend $105 million over the next three years
in addition to its standard $100 million annual investment
to increase its production of composite materials, but company
chairman Glen H. Hiner warned customers against expecting immediate
additional supplies. "Most of the additional capacity [is]
expected to come on line in 1997," he said.

About 10% of fiberglass material is sold to laminate suppliers
for printed-circuit-board applications, with the remainder
used in other industries.

"There has been incredible demand for fiberglass materials because
the printed-circuit-board market is very strong," Bergman said.
"Demand is higher, not just in the United States, but worldwide."

Printed-circuit-board sales last October increased 18.7% compared
with October 1994, and bookings increased 29.9% for the same
period, according to the IPC. Year-to-date sales had increased
15.8% and bookings were up 21.5%, the trade group reported.

If fiberglass shortages continue, Bergman believes the material
will be placed on allocation next year.

Ed Henderson, president of Henderson Ventures, Los Altos, Calif.,
saidboard customers are not likely to see major price increases
in the first half of 1996, but may see them later. "Manufacturers
are under continued pressure to keep prices elastic, but they
will be pushed to raise prices as materials costs increase,"
he said.

Kalmus & Associates Inc., a $16.8 million printed-circuit-board
maker, has avoided severe delivery problems due to its good
relationships with laminate suppliers, said Hank Kalmus, president
of the Broadview, Ill., company. "We've maintained very long
and important relationships with our laminators, and hope this
will pay back as we go into this period of severe shortages,"
he said.

Kalmus is also looking into composite epoxy materials as an
alternative to fiberglass. Such materials use fewer glass strands
than current eight-ply products and are competitive in price
to fiberglass-based laminates, he said. "The composite materials
are already gaining acceptance in Japan. I think people might
shift over to composites if the shortages become too severe."

AT&T Kills LCD R&D Program

By:
Jack Robertson

Washington - In a double blow to hopes for a U.S. flat-panel
display industry, AT&T has axed any immediate plans for active
matrix LCD production, and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
Ltd. of Japan is negotiating to buy Plasmaco Inc., a plasma
display manufacturer in Highland, N.Y.

A spokesman for AT&T Bell Laboratories last week confirmed that
the company's AM-LCD development program was being scrapped.
That effort, along with AT&T's companion FPD packaging program
at Princeton, N.J., had been touted by former Pentagon flat
panel chief Kenneth Flamm as a "manufacturing testbed to allow
a faster startup of production." AT&T is continuing the FPD
packaging efforts.

But the fast production startup won't happen at AT&T anytime
soon, as the company is drastically cutting back to gain a
better financial posture in preparation for its upcoming split
into three companies and subsequent initial public offering,
sources said.

Separately, it was learned that Matsushita was negotiating to
acquire Plasmaco for an unidentified amount. Larry Weber, chief
executive of Plasmaco, was out of his office last week, and
the company's financial officers had not returned calls by
press time.

Matsushita is very interested in Plasmaco's AC plasma-display
technology because its DC plasma display faces strong competition
from NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd., both of which sell displays
that use AC technology. Plasmaco has developed a 21-in. plasma
television screen, and is working on a 30-in. prototype with
1,2801,024 line resolution.

If Plasmaco were acquired, it is uncertain if Matsushita would
retain the operation at its present site, consolidate it with
other Matsushita facilities in the United States, or transfer
the technology back to Japan for future production.

An AT&T decision against AM-LCD production closes the door on
one of U.S. industry's best hopes for a giant electronics company
to jump into the market. The Defense Department's Advanced
Research Projects Agency (ARPA) earlier awarded $50 million
to a joint venture of AT&T, Xerox, and Standish Industries
to set up a "manufacturing testbed" in the hope it would be
expanded to full-scale production.

The AT&T Bell Labs AM-LCD development program was also expected
to funnel technology into an anticipated production operation.
Until this fall the research program had a 'dotted line' reporting
connection to Richard Archambault, AT&T's vice president of
high-resolution technologies in manufacturing.

Mark Hartney, ARPA director of High-Definition Display Programs,
is hopeful the preliminary production data gathered at the
testbed could help other potential U.S.-based AM-LCD manufacturers.

The ARPA-funded joint venture work continues with limited screen
assembly at Princeton, where AT&T packages AM-LCD panels made
by Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and Standish
Industries into final products. AT&T wants to expand its FPD
contract assembly operation if it can secure work from other
panel fabricators, sources said.

With AT&T's dropout, sources said Xerox may expand into some
initial production using leading-edge AM-LCD technology at
PARC. Xerox has studied the possibility of producing high-performance,
high-resolution displays for document reading, map displays,
and medical imaging, said Malcolm Thomson, PARC's chief technologist.

A few U.S. suppliers build limited quantities of conventional
AM-LCDs for the military and avionics markets. The pending
purchase of Plasmaco by Matsushita would further curtail U.S.
hopes of penetrating the global FPD market. Plasmaco reported
revenue of $800,000 in 1994, down 20% from $1 million the previous
year. Plasmaco was founded in 1987 and acquired plasma-display
production equipment and technology from IBM Corp. It had hoped
to sell displays back to IBM, but the computer maker chose
Matsushita to supply plasma panels for its early laptop computers.

A Closer Look: The Year 2000 Doesn't Compute

By:
Jack Robertson

Washington - Just as you are recovering from the New Year's
celebration, here's a new hangover headache for you:

When the Times Square sphere falls four years from now, it could
usher in more than a new century. At the stroke of midnight,
billions of lines of computer code could go haywire, unless
corrected.

While humans are putting up a new-century calendar page, computers
will be internally clicking to a new "00" annual date. But
unless they are told otherwise, computers see "00" as the year
1900, not the dawn of a new millennium.

That's not a problem for newer PCs, servers, and mainframes
running programs written in the last several years. The "00"
time bomb is ticking away in mountains of old 8-bit and 16
bit spreadsheet programs and countless antiquated applications
that are still running on even the most modern PCs. The "00"
fuse is even shorter for tons of old COBOL and mainframe software
still chugging away.

In recent years, software developers foresaw the Year 2000 snafu
and adjusted code to reflect the 21st century. But even if
modern operating software has corrected the Year 2000 wipeout,
untold storage vaults of critical archival data with unmodified
"00" code are out there waiting to corrupt or crash programs.

These programs were written so long ago that developers considered
2000 as distant science fiction. Memory was tight in those
days (if you can believe it), and abbreviating the year to
only two digits in computer code seemed an ideal solution.

John Phelps, a consultant with The Gartner Group, said software
fixes to the Year 2000 blowup are simple enough. "The real
crisis is finding the code that must be fixed," he said. With
new client-server interrelated networks, vulnerable code can
be lurking almost anywhere in the system.

Some systems will be immune, and the witching hour for old Unix
based software isn't 2000 but 2036. Like most computer code,
Unix keeps track of time by the number of seconds that have
elapsed since a baseline date was established for the system.
Unix operating software will keep ticking away until 2036,
when the timing word length runs out of bits to account for
the number of seconds from the original baseline date. But
aside from these systems, a good number of miscounting systems
must still be accounted for.

No, it's not Stanley Kubrick's 2001 computer time warp that
should rivet our attention. It's the warped "00" time hacks
of the past that haunt us. Unless corrected, on Jan. 1, 2000,
some computer programs aren't going to be as up to date as
our futurists proclaim.

Blue Christmas For 800 At Augat

By:
Bettyann Liotta

New York - Holiday spirits were crushed at Augat Inc. when the
company said it would eliminate up to 800 jobs by consolidating
manufacturing operations at its Interconnection Products Division
(IPD) and Automotive Division to improve the profitability
of those units.

Augat, Mansfield, Mass., said the restructuring would be completed
by the end of 1996. The company also said it is exiting the
market for low-margin commodity IC sockets. Augat's results
for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 1995, will include charges
totaling $23 million related to the consolidations and its
exit from the socket market.

To reach its $1 billion sales goal by2000, Augat wants to change
its sales mix. The company reported sales of $531 million in
fiscal 1994 and currently derives 40% to 45% of revenue from
its automotive division, about 27% from the Communications
Products Business Division, and about 28% to 33% from IPD.

In the future, Augat wants to obtain 50% of its sales from its
communications division-which sells coaxial, fiber-optic, and
broadband products-with the remaining sales split between automotive
and IPD, according to Ellen B. Richstone, chief financial officer
for Augat.

"The communications division will grow at a very fast rate,
and we will continue to grow, albeit slower, the IPD and automotive
divisions," she said. "All three divisions [will be] focused
on moving up the technology chain, providing more value-added
and increased global penetration."

Augat will transfer IC socket production from its facility in
Mashpee, Mass., to operations in Sanford, Maine, and Lugano,
Switzerland. The Mashpee plant will close by September 1996.
"[IPD] will focus on existing product lines, including terminal
blocks, switches, miniaturized connectors, and customized sockets,"
Richstone said. "We are only exiting the low-margin commodity
socket lines that are available from many other companies."

Automotive division operations in Montgomery, Ala., will be
closed by the end of this year. Those production lines will
be transferred primarily to Mexico, with some moving to Detroit.

About 800 workers will be affected by the company's decision
to shut these locations, but Augat's head count will only decline
by 100 since the company will add workers at its other facilities,
Richstone said. Though some workers will be offered relocation
positions, Richstone said she would be surprised if 50 to 75
workers out of the 800 actually moved.

Augat's restructuring follows disappointing financial results
for the third quarter of 1995. Net income fell to $4.2 million
in that quarter from $6.4 million in the prior year's third
quarter. Sales for the quarter were $132 million compared with
$128 million for the year-ago quarter. The company blamed the
results on "weakness" in its automotive business, which sells
custom automotive electrical power distribution systems and
interconnect products.

Augat also noted that sales for the IPD demonstrated real growth
and improved performance in the quarter vs. the prior year's
quarter. IPD's sales had increased 12% from $31.6 million to
$35.3 million during the third quarter. While the company said
it was pleased with the division's progress, it was not yet
performing at its long-term targets, which includes operating
profits of 10% vs. 2% at present.

"Next year, including restructuring benefits, we expect sales
to grow 10% to 14%, and net income to grow roughly 30% before
the restructuring. Most of the benefits from the restructuring
won't be seen until 1997," she said.

In a separate move, Augat said it would acquire certain assets
of Lindsay Specialty Products, a supplier of RF distribution
products. Located in Lindsay, Canada, Lindsay Specialty Products
sells to the CATV, wired communications, and wireless industries.

Powell Names New President

By:
Diane Norman

Chicago - Powell Electronics Inc. has selected Ernest Schilling
as its new president. He will replace Millard Brown II, who
will resign his post effective Feb. 15.

Schilling, who has been with the company for 27 years, currently
serves as senior vice president of Powell's Midwest division.
As president, he will report to founder and chairman Harold
Powell.

No major changes in the Philadelphia company's direction are
expected, Schilling said. "My objective will be to play a significant
role in the art of distribution in its traditional, classic
form," he said. "We will pay attention to sales and marketing,
line cards, and customer penetration."

The value-added distributor of connectors, switches, and other
electromechanical components is projecting sales of $70 million
in 1995, and 15% growth in 1996. "Some adjustments will be
looked at," Schilling said. "We have some areas that are more
dynamic than others."

Brown has been president of Powell since 1991. He directed a
successful re-engineering of the company's internal, external,
and international operations. Brown will remain on Powell's
board while pursuing other interests and opportunities.

Cirrus Reports Clouds In 3rd Qtr. -- Earnings, Revenue Below
Expectations

By:
Jonathan Cassell

San Mateo, Calif. - Cirrus Logic Inc. last week said results
for its third quarter will be hurt by slowness in the home
computer and Taiwan PC markets, news that cast a cloud over
a new manufacturing relationship with Digital Equipment Corp
(DEC)

Cirrus said earnings for the third fiscal quarter ended Dec.
30 will be 13 cents to 19 cents per share, and revenue will
be between $290 million and $300 million, well below some Wall
Street predictions of 41 cents per share in earnings and $330
million in revenue.

This marks the second time Cirrus has lowered expectations for
its third quarter, following an announcement in November that
the company's earnings would be affected by a reduced order
from a large customer. Analysts have identified that customer
as Packard Bell, a major buyer of Intel Corp. motherboards
containing Cirrus graphics chips. This time, Cirrus blamed
the poor results on slower than anticipated growth in the home
PC market and the somewhat related softness in its Taiwan business,
which combined to reduce demand for the company's graphics,
audio, and modem products.

Sales of audio and graphics chips declined, while growth in
revenue from Cirrus' modem business did not meet expectations,
said George Alexy, senior vice president of marketing for Cirrus,
Fremont, Calif. Meanwhile, Cirrus' sales of PC products not
directly targeted at home systems-such as mass storage-grew
in the third quarter, Alexy said.

Analysts don't believe Cirrus' results reflect a weakness in
the home PC market.

"The home PC market is not weak, but it may be softer than expected,"
said Drew Peck, analyst with Cowen & Co., Boston. "What's hurting
Cirrus is an industrywide problem of high inventories for PC
products due to summer's huge order activity. The other issue
is that Cirrus is in the midst of a transition between its
first-generation 64-bit graphics controllers, which are getting
long in the tooth, and its second-generation controllers."

Peck said the Taiwan market has become important to Cirrus because
it is trying to dispose of its older 64-bit graphics controllers
there.

The downbeat earnings news came just one week after Cirrus added
DEC to a growing list of manufacturers that the company has
partnered with in a $2 billion, five-year effort to increase
ownership of its production resources. Under terms of the agreement,
which still awaits approval, Cirrus will provide to DEC about
$355 million worth of equipment that will be used in DEC's
8-in. wafer Fab 6 in Hudson, Mass.

In October, Cirrus revealed pacts with a group of semiconductor
manufacturers, including AT&T Microelectronics and Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., as well as the expansion of its relationship
with IBM Microelectronics.

Alexy said third-quarter results will not harm its manufacturing
partnership plan, but will let Cirrus cut costs and offset
that period's poor earnings.

"We were able to make modifications in our capacity investment
program that reduced forecasted cash use by $600 million over
the next five years without [affecting] the program," Alexy
said. "DEC was expected to be a joint venture. But it hasn't
ended up [that way], so we can reduce our cash requirements
to the tune of $100 million."

Alexy said Cirrus also lowered projected expenditures by $500
million in a manufacturing deal with another partner-cutting
expenses over the next five years by $600 million.

AMD, Cyruix Have X86 Shot At Intel

By:
Jonathan Cassell

San Mateo, Calif. - Despite announcements from Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp. that fourth-quarter results will
be hurt by a declining 486 market, analysts and industry observers
said the two companies are likely to re-emerge soon as viable
competitors to Intel Corp. in the X86 business.

AMD, Sunnyvale, Calif., said it expects earnings for the fourth
quarter to be below those in the third, due to lower-than-expected
shipments of 486 microprocessors.The company's revenue will
rise for the quarter, but not enough to offset depreciation
and startup costs from AMD's new Fab 25 in Austin, Texas, said
W.J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive.

Cyrix announced it will report a loss in the fourth quarter
due to poor prices in the 486 market and a write-off of inventory
of that microprocessor, despite the company's long-planned
move to exit the 486 business. The loss-the first in Cyrix's
history-will cause the company to default on some repayments
of debts to creditors, according to Jerry Rogers, president
and chief executive of Cyrix, Richardson, Texas.

Meanwhile, as AMD and Cyrix struggle, X86 leader Intel is continuing
to hit the jackpot, with the company expected to report record
earnings for the fourth quarter, according to Alex. Brown &
Sons Inc., San Francisco.

Analysts said AMD and Cyrix's problems are a result of Intel
using its prodigious manufacturing might to reduce microprocessor
prices and rapidly transition the market to the Pentium and
away from the 486.

"Intel changed the rules of the game in 1995 by accelerating
Moore's law," said John Marren, an analyst with Alex. Brown
& Sons. "Intel now can deliver doubled performance every year,
instead of every 18 months. It has made it difficult for other
suppliers, as Intel has driven the margins out of the 486 business.
It's a real scorched-earth strategy."

In the past, AMD and Cyrix were able to carve out a market niche
simply by offering lower-performance products that undercut
Intel's pricing, said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst for Dataquest
Inc., San Jose. However, companies who want to compete in the
X86 market must offer an equivalent or higher-performing microprocessor
that costs about the same as what Intel offers, Brookwood said.

"There are a lot of companies out there that will buy from an
Intel competitor, if they can deliver a working product," Brookwood
said. "The challenge for AMD, Cyrix, and others is to deliver
a product that gives their customers a competitive advantage."

Using this strategy, non-Intel X86 vendors still have the opportunity
to claim from 10% to 25% of the market in the future, he estimated.

Analysts said Cyrix is the first company that is likely to make
a comeback in the X86 market as it ramps production of its
6x86 microprocessor in 1996. Cyrix's new 120-MHz 6X86, which
analysts view as a Pentium-class microprocessor because of
its Pentium-style pinout, is expected to outperform Intel's
upcoming 150-MHz Pentium, according to Steve Tobak, vice president
of corporate marketing for Cyrix.

Cyrix will begin volume shipment of the 6X86 in the first quarter
and could ship as many as 200,000 units during that time, Tobak
said. Tobak said Cyrix is targeting shipment of 2 million to
3 million 6X86 microprocessors in 1996.

Analysts said Cyrix's main challenge in the short term will
be moving mass production of the 6X86 to a smaller die. Cyrix
already has converted all production of the 6X86 performed
by its manufacturing partner IBM to a smaller, five-layer-metal
die that is 50% smaller and far less expensive to manufacture
than before, according to the company. Tobak said he was confident
that Cyrix's second manufacturer, SGS-Thomson, will be able
to begin volume production of the die-shrunk 6X86 in the second
quarter of 1996.

AMD can still be a viable player in the Pentium Pro-class market
in 1997 if it successfully completes its acquisition of NexGen
Inc. and completes development of its K6 microprocessor, Brookwood
said. Analysts agreed that the Nx586 AMD obtained from its
acquisition of Nexgen and its own K5 microprocessor-which will
be introduced in 1996-are unlikely to be high-volume products.
The K6, really a rebadged NexGen NX686, will offer the performance
advantage over Pentium Pro that an X86 competitor needs to
compete with Intel, Brookwood said.

Chips Galore At Vegas CES

By:
Mark Hachman

San Mateo, Calif. - Chip makers won't be left out in the cold
this week at the winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
Not only are semiconductor manufacturers the star players in
a host of end products, but the show has become the spot to
discover the next killer application.

A recent study conducted by International Data Corp., Framingham,
Mass., and Semico Research, Phoenix, found that 15.2% of 1995's
$147 billion worldwide semiconductor market will be used in
consumer applications.

"I think it's right to say that due to the increasing value
of semiconductor content in products such as those featured
at the [CES] show, more semiconductor manufacturers find it
important to attend," said Todd Mozer, president of Sensory
Circuits Inc., San Jose. Indeed, Sensory's voice-recognition
chip-called Voice Password-has been designed into the products
of at least four attendees of the show. Voice Password's recognition
algorithm can be limited to a unique voice, making it suitable
for security applications. Sensory is not displaying products
on the show floor, but potential customers can see demonstrations
in an off-site hospitality suite.

Representatives of Samsung Semiconductor Inc. are attending
the show "to find out what people are doing," said John Weekley,
associate director of microproducts marketing for the San Jose
company. "The whole consumer electronics market has become
so semiconductor-oriented that we can't figure out all the
uses for something like an LCD or a microcontroller," Weekley
said.

Last year's consumer electronics sales-from electronic typewriters
to personal copiers-totaled over $55 billion, said Joseph P.
Clayton, executive vice president of marketing and sales for
the Americas and Asian/Pacific regions of Thomson Consumer
Electronics, and chairman of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing
Association (CEMA) Board of Directors and Executive Committee,
Arlington, Va.

However, increasing integration has produced lowered costs.
"While other products on the Consumer Price Index have escalated
in cost [by more than] 45% since 1984, consumer electronics
prices continue to decline. A color TV, which had an average
retail price of $430 10 years ago, now carries a suggested
retail price of $350-a decrease exceeding 22%," Clayton said
in a recent CEMA report.

AT&T Microelectronics hopes to make a splash at the show by
introducing digital signal processors for the first all-digital
speakerphones with built-in answering systems. AT&T will demonstrate
its DSPhone digital speakerphone and FlashTAD telephone-answering
device ICs. Both the LJ30 NAND FlashTAD subsystem and the LF30
NAND FlashTAD with DSPhone incorporate AT&T's DSP1605 device.
The LJ30, however, provides functionality for all-digital answering
systems, while the LF30 is designed for digital answering systems
with integrated acoustic-echo-canceling speakerphone.

The LJ30 is the first DSP that manages the use of both NAND
and NOR flash memory devices, according to an AT&T spokesman.
Voice prompts and messages can be stored in the flash memory
of both subsystems, eliminating the need for OGM chips, analog
speakerphone ICs, dual-tone multiple frequency receiver ICs,
and voice synthesis ICs, and reducing system costs for OEMs.
The DSPs are offered in a 68-pin PLCC or 80-pin MQFP, and cost
less than $8.50 in quantities of 100,000.

Zilog Corp. is aiming to take a big bite out of the market for
digital telephone answering devices (DTADs) as that business
builds volume in 1996. The Campbell, Calif., microcontroller
maker will show at CES this week its new generation of DTAD
controllers, the Z89175 and Z89176.

Building market share in the DTAD business will depend on providing
OEMs with a cost structure that will allow them to compete
with the rock-bottom prices of tape-based answering machines,
said Philip Levine, Zilog's tactical marketing manager for
DTAD products. "The other half of that equation is to add features
and improve voice quality at the same time you cut prices,"
he added. Zilog says its Z89175 solution will allow OEMs to
achieve a $29.95 retail price.

The Z89175 and Z89176 offer a single chip plus memory solution
with recording times of six to 10 minutes; enhanced voice quality
from the previous-generation Z89165 solution; multiple memory
support of ARAM or flash memory devices; and caller ID.

"Perception is the problem in moving consumers from tape-based
answering machines to digital machines," said Gerry Kaufhold,
vice president of ThorKa Research, Dayton, Ohio. "You can go
out and buy a tape machine that gives you 15 minutes or more
of message time for $19.95. Add a cassette player and you get
30 minutes. But to do that with a digital telephone answering
machine, you're talking about $100 or more-so the price barrier
remains a problem."

The Z89175 and Z89176 are sampling and will be available in
volume before the end of this year's first quarter, said Alan
Zhu, technical marketing manager of DTAD products at Zilog.
Zhu said pricing will depend on order size, but that a good
rule of thumb would be $6.30 each in quantities of 50,000.

IDT In S. Korean SRAM Partnership

By:
Mark LaPedus

Taipei, Taiwan - Integrated Device Technology Inc. has formed
an alliance with a little-known South Korean company, the Iljin
Group, which will use IDT's technology to enter the SRAM business
next year.

Under terms of the deal, IDT, Santa Clara, Calif., will license
its SRAM, RISC-based processor, and other IC designs to Iljin,
a maker of aluminum, cable, and various telecommunications
products that hopes to follow in the footsteps of Korea's three
IC giants: Hyundai Electronics Co., LG Semicon Inc. (formerly
GoldStar), and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.

To do so, Iljin has licensed IDT's CMOS process technology,
and will use it to build an 8-in. wafer fab in Suwon, Korea.
The fab, to begin production by the third quarter of 1997,
will be capable of making 15,000 wafers per month. The initial
cost of the fab is about $777.6 million.

The move represents Iljin's entry into the semiconductor business,
according to S.K. Park, manager of strategic planning for the
Seoul concern, a 20-year-old company with revenue of about
$640 million last year. "We are scheduled to break ground on
the fab in March [of 1996]," Park said. "As for the alliance
with IDT, we have the option to license any products from IDT's
portfolio within the next year."

He declined to elaborate on Iljin's future product plans or
timetables, but sources indicated the company has the rights
to license IDT's SRAM lines, including its high-speed, synchronous
products. Reports also surfaced that Iljin could license IDT's
RISC-based processor line built around the technology licensed
from Mips Technologies Inc.

In the meantime, IDT will begin the technology transfer process
after it completes the deal with Iljin by the end of January.
Additionally, IDT will provide technical training and support
to Iljin employees, primarily in the U.S. company's new wafer
fab in Hillsboro, Ore., the companies said.

Iljin, which has no experience in the chip business, in early
1995 formed a team to find a suitable partner to propel it
into the IC business.

"We are pleased that Iljin selected IDT as its source for process
and product technology," said Len Perham, IDT's president and
chief executive. In return, IDT will be able to expand its
SRAM capacity in the long term, and possibly get a stronger
foothold in the Korean semiconductor market, analysts said.

Iljin's move into the IC business was viewed by analysts as
somewhat unusual, in that Korea's semiconductor industry is
dominated by three large conglomerates, or chaebols: Hyundai,
LG, and Samsung.

However, there appears to be a change in Korea's corporate culture,
as other, smaller concerns are also looking at the IC business.

In fact, Korea's total IC production is expected to jump from
$13.6 billion in 1995 to $21 billion to $22 billion in 1996,
a 38.2% growth rate, said Jonathan Dutton, senior analyst with
S.G. Warburg Securities Ltd., Seoul.

Still, Iljin faces an uphill battle in the IC market, he added.
Aside from no experience in the IC business, Iljin hopes to
move into the SRAM and other markets amid stiff competition
from several companies, including Samsung. Prices for SRAMs
are also expected to tumble this year. Reports surfaced in
Taiwan last week that 1-Mbit SRAM products could drop to as
low as $7 per unit next month.

Relays To Get Mil-Spec Quality

By:
Diane Norman

Chicago - Two relay manufacturers expect to have their lines
fully qualified to military specifications by the end of the
year, offering relief to buyers plagued by long lead times
for the last 12 months.

Magnecraft/Struthers Dunn (MSD), Darlington, S.C., will have
some relays qualified to MIL-R-83536 in late March, and Communications
Instruments Inc., Fairview, N.C., will have a complete line
of MIL-R-39016 and MIL-R-28776 relays qualified in the first
half of this year. Communications Instruments is already shipping
some MIL-R-39016 relays.

The companies are trying to pick up the pieces of the market
dropped by Struthers Dunn/Hi-G after it ran into testing problems
and economic difficulties that forced it to close in June 1994.
The military relay market has fought long lead times since
that supplier's unceremonious exit. "We created a real void
in the marketplace," said Bruce Armstrong, former general manager
of Struthers Dunn/Hi-G. "There is a real demand from buyers
for mil-spec relays."

Last February, Magnecraft Electric Co. purchased the medium
power relay line once built by Struthers Dunn to MIL-R-83536
specifications. Communication Instruments last year purchased
the MIL-R-39016 and MIL-R-28776 low-level switching signal
relays formerly built by Hi-G.

The merged Struthers Dunn/Hi-G voluntarily suspended shipments
of some military relays in 1991 because the devices did not
meet government testing requirements. Though it resumed shipments
in 1992, the company never fully recovered from that setback.

Military products must be requalified when they change ownership
or when their production is moved to a new location. The relays
now in the hands of MSD were never a part of their previous
owner's voluntary suspension.

MSD plans to have its 2-pole, 10-amp, and 4-pole, 10-A medium
power relays qualified in late March. Other MIL-R-83536 parts
will be qualified by the end of the year, said Armstrong, who
is now national sales manager of MSD.

MSD is already shipping noncertified relays for high-reliability
applications. "Our catalog [nonqualified] parts are built on
the same production lines and meet the same [MIL-R-83536] specifications,"
Armstrong said.

Communication Instruments is quoting 26-week to 30-week lead
times today for its mil-spec relays, which are comparable to
the lead times of other suppliers of the same parts, the company
said. The supplier will qualify the rest of its relays in the
first half of the year, and it expects to reduce its lead times
to 16 weeks to 18 weeks by midyear. It currently offers nonqualified
versions of relays that conform to the military specifications,
the company said.

The market will benefit from newly qualified suppliers, said
Jim Bedell, director of marketing for Deutsch Relays Inc.,
East Northport, N.Y., a competing military relay supplier.
Deutsch is now quoting 22-week lead times, and is working to
reduce them further from a high of 28 weeks at the beginning
of last year.

"At first there wasn't a big reaction when Struthers Dunn/Hi
G closed, but then reality kicked in," Bedell said. "When we
saw what was happening, we ramped up production and now are
running two shifts, six days a week."

The market for military power relays is growing between 4% and
5% a year, Armstrong said. "For us, the big challenge is to
recapture market share."

The company is working on a "re-entry strategy" that includes
maintaining profit margins while qualifying the relay products,
targeting catalog sales as well as military sales, and operating
with a smaller sales network, Armstrong said.

MSD has cut its distributor lineup from 10 to five regional
companies and has also eliminated its direct sales force. "We
want to keep things simple with a low overhead," Armstrong
said. "We want to be the low-cost producer of military relays."

Corrections



 Volume production of NEC Electronics Inc.'s 8-Mbit Rambus DRAMs
is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 1996. The date
listed in the Dec. 11 issue was incorrect.

 A story in the Dec. 18 issue should have said that Nu Horizons
Electronics Corp. has one field applications engineer for every
six outside salespeople.

 Samtec Inc.'s CLS series socket strips are priced at 3.5 cents
per line. The price listed in the Nov. 20 issue was incorrect.

 The Top Components Suppliers supplement in the Nov. 6 issue
should have listed Nichicon America Corp. as a capacitor maker.

Heard: Shift To Plastic Packages Spells Woe For Alcoa



In a piece of good news for electronics purchasers and bad news
for Alcoa Electronics Packaging Inc., Intel Corp. said it will
migrate the majority of its microprocessor product line from
ceramic to plastic packages. By moving to plastic, Intel will
spend $29.50 less on each microprocessor and be able to reduce
the cost of the products, an Intel spokesman said. As much
as 80% of Intel's microprocessors are now packaged in ceramic.
The move to plastic was made possible by the superb heat and
power dissipation characteristics of Intel's 0.35-micron process,
the spokesman said. Alcoa will lay off 1,200 workers at its
facility in San Diego because Intel will not be ordering any
more ceramic packages from the company.-J.C.

Bell made it clear last year that it intended to pursue growth
by acquisition after its offer to merge with Sterling Electronics,
Houston, was rebuffed in September. Although the merger was
generally viewed favorably by analysts, Sterling opted to remain
solo and took measures to protect itself from possible future

After five years of declines, consumer electronics output will
increase in Japan in 1996 due to the creation of new products
such as car navigation systems and other digital devices, according
to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, which represents
600 companies.

Total production of electronics in 1996 will be 23.68 trillion
yen ($234 billion), up 5.7% over a projected 22.413 trillion
yen this year. Leading the way will be higher production of
semiconductors and components to fuel booming worldwide demand
for chips from makers of computers and mobile phones.-M.L.

Bottom Line: Cherry 3Q Earnings Decline


While Cherry Corp.'s third- quarter sales grew 17% to $107.2
million, earnings declined to $3.1 million, compared with $4.3
million a year ago. Nine-month earnings for the period ended
Nov. 30 were $8.9 million on sales of $314.7 million. That
compared with nine-month earnings of $9.9 million and sales
of $245.4 million last year. The Waukegan, Ill., company attributed
the third-quarter earnings decline to continuing high production
costs, slower semiconductor sales growth, and margin pressures.

Some Sectors Have Urge To Merge

By:
Ismini Scouras

New York - Increased consolidation in major segments of the
electronics industry will continue this year-with activity
coming from many sectors, including distribution, software,
and telecommunications, industry analysts said.

Additional mergers and acquisitions (M&As) among electronics
distributors should come as no surprise, since consolidation
has been occurring in that sector for more than three years,
said Clarke Walser, principal of Walser & Associates, Chicago.
The most recent deals include specialty distributor Richey
Electronics Inc.'s acquisition of Deanco Inc., and All American
Semiconductor Inc.'s acquisitions of Added Value Electronic
Distribution Inc. and A.V.E.D.-Rocky Mountain Inc. Global distributor
Avnet Inc. intends to add more companies to its list of acquisitions
in its 1996 fiscal year; in the United States alone, Avnet
acquired Penstock, Avnet Cable Technologies, and Sertek in
fiscal 1995.

The forces moving the distribution industry toward consolidation
cutting costs and providing value-added services for the customer
and supplier-are as strong as ever. "The economies of scale
that we've seen over Arrow's acquisitions in the last few years
suggest there are operating-efficiency advantages by intelligent
merger and acquisitions," Walser said.

But some OEMs wonder whether combined companies can operate
as efficiently as they did before they consummated, Walser
said. "We've seen cases where the merger of two distributors
has caused customers to find another source of supply," Walser
said, pointing to the Hamilton Hallmark and Avnet marriage.
"During the transition period, there's concern over loss of
supply."

Although some M&As are not successful, high-tech companies join
hands in hopes that theirs will be. In fact, 1995 was a blockbuster
year for M&As in the information technology (IT) industry.
Deals in that sector exceeded 1,400, compared with 750 in 1994,
said Janet Swift, director of marketing at Broadview Associates
L.P., a Fort Lee, N.J., M&A advisory firm that focuses on information
technology.

As the entire IT market gets more competitive and product cycles
shrink, many companies are looking to establish market dominance
sooner, said Larry Lenihan, principal with Broadview. Therefore,
the ability for an IT company to fund or compete purely on
internal development is nearly impossible, Lenihan noted. "You're
seeing a lot of technology companies looking to acquire hot
technology and product diversification where they can expand
the use of their infrastructure and channel mass," he said.

M&As in the electronics industry this year will be more actively
pursued by software product and services companies and telecommunications
concerns than by hardware firms, according to Broadview Associates'
study of U.S. companies.

Of the 150 U.S. IT companies surveyed for the Broadview study,
64% are "very likely" to pursue M&As this year. Roughly one
third of the software and telecom companies questioned reported
they are "more likely" to aim for M&A activity in the next
12 months than in 1995. Software has traditionally led the
number of deals that are done in IT; telecom is now close behind,
Lenihan said. "In telecom, you've been seeing the concept of
mass and getting big to compete, and infrastructure has been
key. Smaller vendors really can't compete, so they're being
bought out and we're going to see that market concentrating
especially Internet service providers, where there will only
be a handful left," Lenihan said.

While the number of Internet service providers dwindles, the
number of vendors that provide the channel to get to the Internet
keeps growing. An increasing number of companies, such as Hewlett
Packard and Fujitsu, have jumped into the PC scene, making
product differentiation more difficult.

Analysts said that consolidation in the PC industry is highly
unlikely, but if one company were to be acquired, Apple Computer
Inc. would be the most likely. "Apple makes an attractive target,
not only for its installed base but also for its technology,"
Lenihan said. In addition to interesting software technology,
Apple has a strong presence in unique markets, which the other
traditional hardware PC companies don't have, Lenihan added.

Although the PC industry will not see any major strategic deals,
cash-strapped companies may continue to sell themselves to
foreign competitors that are looking to enter the U.S. market,
Lenihan said. An example of that this past year was the AST
Research/Samsung deal, in which Samsung acquired 40% of AST.

Since the top dozen PC players account for more than 55% of
the worldwide market-with scores of other PC companies following
behind-it isn't unusual to believe that consolidation should
occur, said Richard Chu, managing director with Cowen & Co.,
Boston. "The fact is that the industry's conditions have been
reasonably benign; there has not been any economic pressure
for consolidation in the past year," Chu said.

The semiconductor industry should not experience any more M&A
action this year than it did last, analysts said. The most
notable deal was Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s acquisition
of NexGen Inc., to build muscle against Intel Corp. "As far
as seeing other high-profile public acquisitions like we saw
with AMD and NexGen, it's hard to say-those are harder to accomplish,"
said Mark Edelstone, senior semiconductor analyst at Prudential
Securities Research, San Francisco. "The dynamics in the industry
would have to change before you see a lot of M&A activity."

Lenihan foresees M&As occurring with specialized semiconductor
companies. There have been several public specialized semiconductor
companies acquiring private companies-such as Exar Corp.'s
acquisition of Startech Semiconductor Inc. and Oak Technology
Inc.'s acquisition of Pixel Magic-which the industry could
see more of, Edelstone said.

Stockholder Lawsuit Bill OK'd

By:
Jack Robertson

Washington - Industry executives rejoiced last week as Congress
overrode President Clinton's veto of legislation curbing stockholder
class-action lawsuits based on financial projections.

The bill, which goes into law this week, protects companies
from liability concerning earnings and sales projections as
long as they are accompanied by a warning about factors that
might upset the predictions. It would also reduce the statute
of limitations for such suits to three years from the current
five years.

The law has been a major legislative priority of the high-tech
industry, which complained that companies are being inundated
by alleged frivolous class-action lawsuits by disgruntled stockholders.

It was unclear what political impact the president's veto would
have on his support by high-tech companies, which up to now
have supported him because he has supported high-tech programs.

With the stockholder-lawsuit curb now passed at the federal
level, lobbying activity has intensified on the state level,
where companies might still be subject to what they call frivolous
legal actions.

Expansion Slows

By:
Ismini Scouras

New York - The electronics industry continued to grow in December,
but experienced the slowest rate of expansion in more than
two years, according to purchasing managers surveyed for EBN's
QUEST report.

The study's composite index fell to 52.3 from 53.6 in November
and 53 in October, the lowest reading since the index registered
52.2 in November 1993. The index's average for the three months
ended in December was 52.96, down from 54.13 in November and
54.46 in October. Still, the index is above 50, as it has been
since early 1992, suggesting industry growth is still healthy
but stabilizing. A reading above 50 indicates expansion; a
reading below 50 means contraction.

"The industry is still strong, but probably transitioning to
a more sustainable pace," said Vladi Catto, chief economist
at Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas. Catto believes the industry
can maintain this pace through 1996, as well as the remainder
of the decade. And he does not expect the index to fluctuate
as sharply as it has in the past.

Although QUEST's production index dropped to 52.5 from 54.2
in November, the new electronics orders index inched up to
53 from 52.6, while the new export orders index grew to 51.2
from 50, indicating continued growth in the industry.

Growth in the PC market, an industry toward which the overall
electronics industry is heavily weighted, has moderated in
the past quarter, negatively influencing the overall expansion
rate.

"Computers are clearly driving the [composite] index, and when
you look at the strength in orders, that reflects the strength
in the PC market," Catto said. QUEST's computer index dropped
another 3 points to 45 in December, compared with 48 in November
and 53 in October.

Communications is a key sector that has affected the rate of
expansion, Catto said. The communications index for December
was 53.2, compared with 52.7 in November and 43.6 in October.
The military index rebounded to 57 from 53.2 in November and
a low 41.6 in July. The components and industrial controls
composite indexes were 55.2 and 53.6 in December, respectively.

In addition to an uptick in the orders index, another positive
sign is the electronics materials inventories index, which
was 48.7 in December, down from 49.3 the prior month, reflecting
lower inventory levels, Catto said.

However, some economists said that a general slowdown in the
U.S. economy will affect manufacturing and build up inventory
levels, causing companies to cut back production and lay off
employees.

"What we're seeing and expecting is a general slowdown, and
while the electronics industry has been fairly strong, we are
looking for that to slow some," said Marlene Grabau, economist
with Hong Kong, Shanghai Bank Corp. Washington Analysis, Washington.

When manufacturing and production levels fall, it usually creates
fear and uncertainty among consumers, who will then be frugal
in their spending habits. The cautious spending will ultimately
hurt sales of big-ticket electronics products. "It all ties
together, so the consumption of everything slows-but electronics
even more so because it is more of a discretionary item," Grabau
said.

Despite the slowdown, TI's Catto predicts the U.S. economy,
as well as the economy in other regions of the world, will
improve as the year progresses and once interest rates are
lowered, which most economists expect.

"Japan appears to be recovering and is getting stronger as we
speak, and Europe is holding its own," Catto said. "Asia-Pacific
continues to be strong."

Economic conditions in the United States and abroad have been
some of the key elements affecting electronics production,
analysts said. But the connection between economic progress
and the electronics industry will grow even stronger as worldwide
markets become more liberal and technology advances through
the decade, according to a Henderson Ventures report.

BusLogic And Mylex Agree To Merger

By:
Mark Hachman

San Mateo, Calif. - Mylex Corp. and BusLogic Inc. have agreed
to join forces, merging two successful I/O companies in a deal
company executives call unusually synergistic.

Mylex, which specializes in RAID disk controller and network
management products, signed an agreement to purchase BusLogic
an SCSI card manufacturer competing with suppliers such as
Adaptec Inc.-in exchange for approximately 2.7 million shares
of Mylex common stock, worth about $50.4 million. Additional
stock options, exercised after the agreement, could tack on
up to $11 million more.

Pending approval by BusLogic shareholders later this month,
BusLogic would continue to operate under its name and at its
present location as a wholly owned subsidiary of Mylex.

Mylex president and chief executive Al Montross noted that the
lack of technology overlap should spark gains in the quality
of future product releases as well as market share. "I can
think of only four positions [between the two companies] that
overlap," Montross said from the company's Fremont, Calif.,
headquarters, "and there is no overlap in our product line,
as well. We expect this deal to help our OEM sales to current
customers, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Siemens. It's
a great fit in terms of sales power and engineering resources
and costs."

According to Disk/Trend Inc., Mountain View, Calif., Mylex shipped
60% of all RAID controllers to the network, minicomputer, and
multiuser systems markets. In 1994, the market for RAID controllers
grew 125%, with Mylex's share increasing nearly 20%

Both companies are free of debt, Montross said. Mylex reports
$34 million in liquid cash assets, while the privately held
BusLogic has reportedly been debt-free for 22 straight quarters,
with $5 million in cash currently on hand, Montross said. The
short distance between Mylex and BusLogic, Santa Clara, Calif.,
is an added bonus, he said.

BusLogic also indicated it would turn the new partnership into
an increased share in the OEM marketplace. "The positive synergy
created by the joining of Mylex and BusLogic will result in
a significantly enhanced market presence for both companies,"
said Jesse Chen, president and chief executive of BusLogic.
"Both organizations will be able to broaden their product offerings,
better serve their existing customers, and offer increasingly
more competitive products and customer service."

BusLogic, whose proprietary MultiMaster bus-mastering ASIC technology
allows for a common driver to be used for major bus architectures
including Peripheral Component Interconnect, EISA, VESA, and
Micro Channel, recently announced a PCI Ultra-SCSI host adapter
for personal workstations.

"This is a merger of two successful independent entities," said
Tom Lahive, industry analyst with the Storage Research Group
of International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. "The combination
will allow BusLogic and Mylex to more effectively compete in
the accelerating storage marketplace."

FED Startup Seeking Mfg. Partners, Funding

By:
Anthony Cataldo

San Mateo, Calif. - Field-emission- display (FED) startup Silicon
Video Corp. (SVC) is looking to enlist two manufacturing partners
and to add its own high-volume production facility in order
to square off with active-matrix LCD (AM-LCD) suppliers by
1997.

In addition, the San Jose company hopes to collect $80 million
in funding in 1996 to support the cash-hungry development of
prototype 3-in. displays, which will serve as a precursor to
larger panels for notebook computers.

Though no manufacturing partners have signed on yet, the company
hinted that Hewlett-Packard Co., which has been the company's
largest investor, may commit to building the FEDs. "They have
that option," said David L. Bergeron, SVC's vice president
of manufacturing.

To meet its manufacturing goals, the company will eventually
need the backing of two manufacturers that are willing to invest
in developing the process to build FED screens, which promise
to combine the high quality of cathode-ray tubes with the low
power and small-form factor of flat panels.

"The idea would be to get two partners as early as possible,"
Bergeron said. "It becomes unmanageable to have more than two."

The partners must also be willing to build the FEDs in high
volume to ensure reliable second sourcing. "You don't want
a company that views this as an appendage, because they may
end up killing it," he said. "You don't want to focus on people
who want the AM-LCD fab investment."

What SVC does want is partners who can bring key manufacturing
technology to the table, particularly in the areas of robotics
and floor control. SVC points out that 85% of the FED manufacturing
process is based on standard tool sets, while the rest requires
special equipment. "They would help define the process and
put the plan in place," Bergeron said.

By adhering to standard tool sets for the majority of the manufacturing
process, the company hopes to keep costs low enough to be competitive
with AM-LCDs. And unlike AM-LCDs, the FEDs will be built without
using a costly stepper.

Furthermore, Bergeron said the company will achieve yields equal
to AM-LCDs while offering superior brightness. That's because
each FED subpixel contains 1,000 emitters that are 0.2-micron
in width, which allows a high margin of error for failed emitters,
said Nicholas G. Sturiale, SVC's director of marketing.

SVC plans to show off a 5-in. prototype display at the Display
Works conference in February, an event that the company said
will prove that the technology is not only feasible but manufacture
ready. "It will be a demonstration of the process technology,"
Sturiale said. "Most other companies show a demo first, raise
some money, then go out and build it."

The flip side to SVC's early emphasis on developing process
technology is that it has consumed a lot of cash. To begin
mass production by 1997, the company needs to raise about $80
million next year, nearly the same amount it has gathered since
its founding in 1991. Eventually, the company hopes to take
in a total of $300 million from outside investors by 1998,
Sturiale said.

"The pace of development is extremely fast," he said. "We're
burning a lot of dough."

If all goes as planned, the company will have secured two manufacturing
partners in time to start sampling its 5-in. Edison product
by the end of 1996. The company also plans to ramp up a new
100,000-sq.-ft. manufacturing plant of its own by 1997.

Edison is slated to be succeeded by a 12-in. DaVinci display
and the 7-in. Edison II screen in 1997. SVC also plans to start
sampling a 15-in. screen, dubbed Michelangelo, in 1998.

Though SVC insists that its FEDs will be competitively priced
with AM-LCDs once they are in full production, Japanese and
Korean manufacturers continue to drive AM-LCD prices down to
near-cost levels through heavy capital investments.

"The ability to get to low-cost manufacturing to a large extent
comes from building lots of products," said Joel M. Pollack,
senior product marketing manager of display products for Sharp
Electronics Corp., the largest supplier of AM-LCDs. "That sort
of experience hasn't even begun in the area of FEDs."

Even so, some AM-LCD makers are hedging their bets by keeping
FED technology at arm's length. "We have our eyes on the technology,"
said Robert Biega, program manager of mobile computing for
IBM Corp., which is producing AM-LCDs with Toshiba through
a joint venture. "Right now it's still in our research division
and hasn't come down to product planning."

Asia Watch: Wafer Fabs As National Policy

By:
Tom Mcale

In the 1980s, U.S. semiconductor makers debated whether government
should play a role in promoting development of the industry
with funding for programs like Sematech. But Washington's toe
in-the-water approach to high-tech policy pales in comparison
to what is happening in Singapore today.

The tiny Asian Tiger has virtually made wafer fab construction
and the development of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing
processes the centerpiece of its national economic policy for
the 21st century.

In a series of announcements during the past two months, officials
have made it clear that the country's electronics industry
which accounted for 50% of the island's manufacturing output
last year-must quickly move to higher value-added businesses.
That means a move away from dependence on the disk drive business,
which is moving to Malaysia, Thailand, and other lower-cost
countries in the region, and a new focus on wafer fabs.

The plan calls for Singapore to have at least 25 fabs in operation
by the turn of the century or very soon after. Land, a highly
precious commodity in a country with an area of only 600 sq.
km, is already being set aside for two fab parks at Woodlands
and Tampines, and light-industrial operations there are being
moved out. A third park will be named later. Each of the parks
will accommodate up to 10 fabs.

Today, Singapore has only four fabs in operation, but another
six are in the pipeline. Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing
Pte. Ltd., a government-funded foundry operation, has two fabs
running, a third in construction, and recently announced plans
to have three more fabs running by 2000.

Tech Semiconductor, a DRAM joint venture of the government's
Economic Development Board, Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and Texas
Instruments, has one fab running, one scheduled to come on
line in 1997, and a third scheduled for 1998.

SGS-Thomson Microelectronics last month announced a $35 million
expansion plan for its Singapore fab, and sources say the chip
maker is soon likely to announce plans for a second fab.

The big question now is who is going to pay for the fabs that
will carry an estimated price tag of $32 billion. The answer
is a combination of government and private investment, mostly
from U.S. and Japanese chip makers.

To succeed in having 25 fabs up and running by 2000, Singapore
will need to see at least half a dozen investment announcements
this year. But industry watchers across Asia tend to agree
that if any country can pull it off, it will be Singapore.

Taiwan Computer Industry To Undergo Growth In 1996 -- But Motherboard
Business May Move At Slower Rate

By:
Mark LaPedus

Taipei, Taiwan - Taiwan's computer industry is expected to grow
more than 27% this year, but local companies will lose some
market share in at least one of the industry's mainstays.

Total revenue of Taiwan's computer and peripherals industry
is projected to hit $27.13 billion in 1996, up from $21.3 billion
in 1995, according to the government-sponsored Market Intelligence
Center, based in Taipei. By 1998, Taiwan's computer industry
will reach $40.9 billion, according to MIC.

"1996 will be a good year," said Stan Shih, chairman and chief
executive of Acer Inc., Taiwan's largest PC company. "We expect
double-digit growth this year, maybe more than 20%."

On the downside, motherboard production in Taiwan will grow
only 15%, from 20.86 million units in 1995 to 23.9 million
units in 1996, according to MIC.

Taiwan's worldwide market share in the merchant motherboard
business actually dropped to 65% last year from about 81% in
1994, MIC said. Some analysts blamed the shortfall on Intel
Corp.'s thrust into the motherboard business.

On a positive note, Taiwan's desktop and notebook computer production
will jump from 7.16 million units in 1995 to 9.44 million units
in 1996, a 32% growth rate, according to MIC.

Desktop PC production will increase from 4.57 million units
in 1995 to 6.12 million in 1996, and notebook PC production
will jump from 2.59 million units in 1995 to 3.32 million in
1996, according to MIC, which added that Taiwan will continue
to be the world's leading producer of portable computers.

Harris Updates Older MPUs

By:
Darrell Dunn

Dallas - Strengthening demand for X86 microprocessors for embedded
applications has Harris Corp.'s Semiconductor Sector increasing
fab allocation to production of its decade-old 8086 and 286
product line, increasing packaging options, and looking to
complete a licensing deal for 386- and 486-generation devices.

"We're producing more than twice as many of these devices as
we did 18 to 20 months ago," said Jay Muns, product marketing
manager for microprocessor products at Harris, Melbourne, Fla.

"In the next six months, we're going to add another 50% to the
capacity dedicated to this product line, and over the next
18 months, we're hoping to add another 50% to 100% on top of
that," he said.

Harris' move comes at a time when companies such as Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. have dropped RISC processors in favor of
embedded 386 and 486 MCUs. While many other manufacturers of
X86 microprocessors have abandoned their efforts in the 8086
and 286 generations, Harris said the need for them continues
to remain strong.

"Most of our head-to-head competition in CMOS has upgraded fabs,
and when they've done that they are using more state-of-the
art process and are developing new products and haven't gone
back to redesign some of the more mature products," Muns said.

Harris is increasing the speeds of its devices, as well as adding
new packaging options, such as surface-mount packages, he said.

Including the processors and peripheral devices, such as timer
circuits and direct-memory-access controllers, Harris sold
more than 5 million of the 8086 and 286 devices in 1995.

"The company strategy is that we recognize this is a base business
that is profitable and we are committed to those products,"
a Harris spokesman said.

"They provide a good earnings stream. As we invest in new technologies
for wireless, multimedia, automotive, and power control, we
recognize that [the embedded X86] business is very important
to keep money coming into the company and helping us define
our future in other areas," the spokesman said.

Muns said Harris is currently "evaluating the possibility of
migrating to the next generations of X86 processors," although
he declined to specify what company Harris has been negotiating
with.

"We've been making these parts for many, many years now, but
we're seeing demand increase to the point that we've had to
go back in and reallocate fab capacity, and we are investing
significant money in new speed upgrades and package types,"
he said. "We are committed to this business."

Briefs: TI, TranSwitch Sign License



TranSwitch Corp., Shelton, Conn., has reached agreement with
Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas, to repurchase a license granted
to TI in 1991. The parties also entered into a new foundry
agreement making TI a foundry source for TranSwitch for the
next five years.

The license repurchase arrangement terminates a May 1991 agreement
that granted TI the right to manufacture and sell certain TranSwitch
PDH and SONET/SDH products in exchange for license and royalty
payments to TranSwitch.

Details of the repurchase agreement are confidential, but include
a one-time fee of $2.13 million and royalty payments from TranSwitch
through 1998. Under the foundry agreement, TranSwitch will
be able to access TI's manufacturing facilities for existing
products and for sourcing a certain number of new products
each year for the next five years.

In addition to TI's, TranSwitch also uses three other foundries,
including one offshore. TranSwitch plans to develop additional
sources in the future.

Briefs: Logic Devices Gets More Capacity



Logic Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., has entered into an agreement
with Zentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden GmbH (ZMD) to obtain processed
silicon wafers for delivery during the 1996 calendar year,
with an option to extend the agreement into 1997 and beyond.

Strong near-term demand is not being adequately supported by
existing wafer suppliers, the company said. The relationship
with ZMD will allow Logic Devices to catch up with, and support,
demand for digital-signal-processing products as well as provide
for the ongoing growth and evolution of its DSP product line
as ZMD's process technology evolves.

ZMD's process capabilities compare favorably with the existing
wafer sources, the company said. This will allow Logic Devices
to retool quickly a portion of its product line to utilize
this capacity commitment, said Bill Volz, president of Logic
Devices.

Briefs: Chips Deals With Chartered


Chips and Technologies Inc., San Jose, has signed a production
agreement with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd.,
Singapore. The agreement will provide Chips with guaranteed
production capacity support through 2000.

As part of the agreement, Chips will make deposits to Chartered
totaling $20 million over the next three years. These deposits
will enable Chips to have access to state-of-the-art 8-in.
submicron wafer manufacturing capacity through 2000. This is
especially important in light of the expected demand on capacity
for this type of fabrication through the rest of the decade.

ISD's 4Q Not Up To Snuff -- Revenue Shortfall Due To Particular
Memory Chip


San Mateo, Calif. - Information Storage Devices Inc. said last
week that it expects revenue for the fourth quarter ending
Dec. 31, 1995, to be below analysts' expectations.

ISD management said in a prepared statement that they were satisfied
with the number and quality of new design wins in the consumer
electronics area that focus on ISD's analog memory chips.

However, several of the San Jose company's key customers indicated
that they have not received production releases from their
own customers due to uncertainty regarding consumer spending
trends, ISD said.

ISD said the revenue shortfall was limited to the memory chip
with a 20-second recording time. Within the shortfall, sales
of a telephone-answering chip manufactured by one of the company's
distributors in Japan declined sharply, contributing to the
lower-than-anticipated quarterly revenue.

The distributor/manufacturer has advised that it expects sales
to return to normal levels in early 1996.

The company said that sales of all its other products are meeting
expectations, and that demand for its products used in communication
applications remains strong and it is currently shifting wafer
starts toward these applications. The company anticipates adequate
product supply in the first quarter of 1996.

Tech Talk: SDRAM: The Speedmeister Of Digital Systems

By:
Reggie Huff

DRAM has always been a cheap form of memory. Should be. It forgets
what it was told to remember in 50 or 60 milliseconds. So,
in order to reap the dramatic cost-per-bit savings, one merely
needs to check with each memory cell about 20 times per second
to ask it what it was supposed to remember, and then remind
it to remember that!

Analog systems, once the premier platform of electronic design,
have been driven to near extinction by the "asynchrocidal"
digital revolution. Revolutionist leaders have implicitly insisted
that the greater good would be served when every circuit would
finally conform to the tick of a single clock. Memory chips
(bless their defiant souls) have traditionally retained the
freedom and independence that asynchronicity affords. No longer.
Today's frantic pace and ever-expanding "to do" list has finally
driven even the forgetful DRAM into fully synchronized operation.

Without the use of geometric reductions, refined lithography,
or breakthroughs in materials science, synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)
provides unprecedented silicon data transfer rates. In fact,
SDRAM is capable of supporting today's 100-MHz microprocessors
without cache, without multichip expense, and without the speed
curbing frustration of the dreaded wait state. Synchronous
DRAM blows the lid off system speeds by integrating multichip
memory management strategies into blazing monolithic solutions.

SDRAM functionality is principally distinguished by four features

 Synchronous Operation: The system clock gates all SDRAM operations.
(Conventional DRAM has no clock input.)

 Cell Banks: Internally, memory cells are divided into independently
accessed "cell banks," which may be treated as if they were
separate memory chips. This makes it possible to address a
location in one bank while simultaneously reading the data
requested during a previous cycle from another bank. While
the first read cycle is as long as a typical DRAM's, subsequent
cycles conduct the address input and data output delays concurrently,
resulting in increased data transfer rates. This method is
called pipelining.

 Burst Mode: This rapid data- transfer technique is accomplished
through the use of an Internal Column Address Generator. Once
the column address for the first memory location is set, subsequent
addresses are automatically generated internally. Either sequential
(for Motorola CPUs) or interleaved (for Intel CPUs) address
sequences may be programmed for automatic generation. Burst
mode may be applied for data transfers into memory (burst write)
or out of memory (burst read). The number of words to be transferred
with each "burst" can also be specified.

 Command (Mode) Storage Registers: These internal registers
are loaded with system configuration command codes upon power
up which define column-address strobe latency, the burst type
and burst length desired, addressing mode, test mode, and various
supplier-specific options to optimize the SDRAM performance
in a wide variety of applications.

If doing more things faster with fewer chips is our aspiration,
then SDRAM will be an architecture which, along with process
technology advancements, will pioneer the frontiers of throughput
right into the next revolution.

Semico Sees Larger Semi Market, Lower DRAM Prices

By:
Mark Hachman

San Mateo, Calif. - Within the booming semiconductor industry,
a tight memory supply will persist, thanks to increasing silicon
content in end products, said researchers at Semico Research.

A preholiday 1995 seminar on the desktop PC hosted by International
Data Corp. (IDC), Framingham, Mass., revealed a 1995 worldwide
semiconductor market estimated at $146.8 billion, up 44.1%
compared with 1994.

There's more good news in addition to the overall growth of
the market, Semico said. Not only are the end markets themselves
growing, but semiconductor content has grown from 9% in 1985
to 20% in 1995, and will grow to 25% by 1999, said Jim Feldhan,
president of Semico, Phoenix.

Investments in capacity will also be among the most important
events in the coming year. While OEMs may turn an anxious eye
toward their suppliers' manufacturing efforts, chip makers
appear to be maintaining a conservative approach to new fab
development, Feldhan said. Rather than the 15% to 20% of sales
invested in manufacturing during the "big '80s," silicon vendors
appear to have returned to historical levels of about 15% of
sales.

To no one's surprise, IDC is predicting that levels of silicon
content on PC motherboards will nearly double in 1998 due to
increased memory demands. Yet while the average PC memory will
break 30 Mbytes by 1998, doubling the value of silicon content
from $600 to more than $1,200, DRAM prices should finally begin
to decline, Feldhan said.

"In 1995, we've had a PC boom together with slowed Windows expectations.
Nevertheless, prices increased [in 1995] during a period of
expected decline," Feldhan said, indicating that he was speaking
of the fundamental decline in DRAM pricing over the last five
years. Feldhan expects a 5% to 7% decline per quarter in overall
DRAM pricing during the next year.

However, the increased use of DRAMs may not be a universal phenomenon,
particularly for older DRAM generations that have been enjoying
strong demand long past their projected lifetimes.

Feldhan warned that inventory re- adjustments by PC vendors
Packard Bell and AST Research, together with AT&T's exit from
the PC market, could spell spot fluctuations in 4-Mbit pricing
for the first quarter of 1996.

The continued transition from fast-page-mode to extended data
out memory adds additional uncertainty to spot markets, he
said.

Feldhan also noted that a warm welcome to the 64-Mbit generation,
together with high yields and competitive pricing, could make
unified memory architecture offerings "go away."

First CardBus-Complaint 3-V FPGA Is Sampling -- Xilinx Entry
Suitable For Telecom, Datacom Areas



San Mateo, Calif. - Xilinx Inc. has introduced the industry's
first 3-volt CardBus-compliant field-programmable gate array
(FPGA)

The introduction allows the company to triple its 3-V device,
speed, and package combinations from 17 to more than 50.

The Xilinx XC3100L-2 is the first FPGA device to support both
the emerging CardBus PC Card and 3-V Peripheral Component Interconnect
(PCI) Local Bus specifications, Xilinx said.

CardBus, which merges the PCMCIA form factor and the PCI-bus
electrical standard, is becoming widely accepted for portable
and mobile applications that demand both high performance and
3-V operation, according to the company.

Based on 0.6-micron TLM process technology, the XC3100L family
operates at up to 85 MHz and reduces system power consumption
by over 50% when compared to 5-V devices. The XC3100L family
is pinout- and bitstream-compatible with the XC3000A and XC3100A
devices, providing easy migration from 5-V to 3-V versions.

Additional 3-V choices include the XC4000L family. With gate
densities up to 20,000 usable gates, the XC4000L family is
suitable for replacing low-end gate arrays in more complex,
low-power designs. Previously, designers had limited choices
for low-voltage devices greater than 10,000 gates.

"Until now, 3-V designs were mostly limited to laptops and cellular
phone applications," said Chuck Fox, vice president of product
marketing at the San Jose company. "Now we see major design
activity in the mainstream telecom, datacom, and instrumentation
areas. Xilinx's expansion of its 3-V portfolio addresses this
growing market need," Fox added.

Both the XC3100L and the XC4000L families are sampling now,
and volume production is expected in the first quarter of 1996.

Devices are available in a variety of packages, including PLCC,
PQFP, VQFP, TQFP, and BGA.

Prices for the new devices in the XC3100L family start at $31
for the XC3142L in 100-piece quantities. Prices for the XC4000L
family start at $54 for the XC4005L device, also in 100-piece
quantities.

Keyboards Seek More Functions -- Adding Value Is Critical To
Successful Marketing

By:
Mark Hachman

San Mateo, Calif. - The trustworthy keyboard is in no danger
of extinction, but the threat of commodity status has forced
keyboard makers to integrate ever-increasing levels of functionality
into their products.

With suggested retail prices hovering at $30 or less for a standard
104-key keyboard, system manufacturers and consumers now regard
the keyboard as a throwaway item.

A sales executive at a leading mail-order PC vendor was clearly
puzzled when asked if a customer could opt not to buy a keyboard.
"That'll save you $16, but I don't get it," he said. "This
[PC] product is going to cost you more than that in shipping
alone."

Some manufacturers were able to claim a slight premium with
their recently introduced 104-key keyboard with three special
function keys designed to provide shortcuts for Microsoft's
Windows 95 operating system. The quest for any competitive
advantage quickly prompted virtually all of the industry's
players to follow suit with the configuration.

"That was probably the most exciting industry event since the
introduction of the number pad," one executive ironically observed.

While a business model based on volume shipments remains viable,
keyboard makers know well that integration means added value
and higher profit per unit.

The GlidePoint touchpad of Cirque Corp. migrated from notebook
trackpad to desktop keyboard. "While not everyone can follow
suit, Microsoft proved that you can sell keyboards if you can
add value," said Jim O'Callaghan, executive vice president
of marketing for Cirque, Salt Lake City.

Manufactured by Alps Electric (U.S.A.) Inc., San Jose, the 108
key Cirque GlidePoint Wave Keyboard carries a retail price
of $129. While conceding that price is still the deciding factor
for buyers, O'Callaghan touted the keyboard's ergonomic features
something of a new religion in keyboard design.

The Cirque keyboard is split to allow a more "natural" posture
when entering data, O'Callaghan said. Extra backspace, tab,
and mouse keys have been added, as well as the integrated GlidePoint
touchpad and wrist rest.

"As stress-related injuries become more prevalent, there is
a growing need for manufacturers to provide responsibly designed
products for computer users," O'Callaghan said. "[With] ourWave
Keyboard, we now meet our customers' comfort requirements for
both keyboard and pointing device input."

Manufacturing a standard keyboard for a rugged environment is
the route chosen by Advanced Input Devices, Coeur d'Alene,
Idaho. The company recently introduced the PKD-101, a sealed
101-key keyboard for industrial environments.

Taking integration to a new level, NMB Technologies Inc. boasts
of transforming the keyboard into a genuine subsystem. The
Chatsworth, Calif., company, which claims to be the highest
volume keyboard manufacturer in the world, recently introduced
its ConcertMaster line of keyboards.

NMB has integrated two shielded speakers into its standard 104
key keyboard, plus a 2+2 watt amplifier. Approved for compatibility
with both Windows 95 and Creative Labs' SoundBlaster sound
card, the keyboard also integrates surround sound functionality
with jacks for subwoofer, microphone, and internal speakers,
plus a volume control.

U.S. Takes The Biggest Piece


The United States is the largest geographic market for pressure
sensors, and U.S.-based companies are the world's leading suppliers
of the devices, according to Frost & Sullivan Inc., Mountain
View, Calif. U.S. companies own competitive advantages such
as broad product lines and technologies, substantial manufacturing
capabilities, and international facilities, the research company
said. The increasing globalization of customer operations requires
suppliers to serve customers within and outside their home
markets. The market for pressure sensors will grow at a compound
annual rate of 7.2% between 1994 and 1999, Frost & Sullivan
said.

Array Prefers Specialty Market -- Company Finds A Niche With
Circular Connectors

By:
Diane Norman

Chicago - Formed six years ago by the merging of three disparate
companies, Array Connector Corp. has become a specialty supplier
in the fiercely competitive connector market.

After struggling for years to carve out a piece of a market
dominated by big- name suppliers and served by scores of smaller
players, Array has narrowed its offerings to circular connectors
built to MIL-C-26482 specifications.

About 40% of the company's sales are to military/aerospace applications.
Array also builds circular connectors that "conform to" but
do not meet the MIL-C-26482 specs. These are sold to commercial
applications in the heavy-industrial and transportation markets,
and make up approximately 60% of Array's sales.

Founded in 1989 when the assets of three small companies-a distributor,
a defunct connector maker, and a machine shop-were merged,
the company initially offered a broad range of connector products
while it worked to integrate the three businesses.

Array expects sales of $6 million in 1995, and is forecasting
30% compound annual growth over the next four years.

Part of that growth will be fueled by an acquisition and a license
agreement with offshore producers, said sales and marketing
director David Shaff, Miami.

The company is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire
the assets of a connector company in Europe, Shaff said. Array
also plans to sign a license agreement with a Japanese connector
company that would expand its circular connector product line.
Shaff also indicated that Array will continue to introduce
new products for the military and commercial markets.

The company offers both standard and custom products and prides
itself on quick response time, he said. Because Array is small,
management operates with a "hands on" entrepreneurial style,
Shaff said.

"Our marketing strategy is to use MIL-C-26482 as a foundation
for a variety of connectors."

The vertically integrated company runs in-house plastic molding,
metal fabrication, machine shop, assembly lines, and a quality
assurance test laboratory, he said. It employs 60 workers and
houses its operations in a 20,000- sq.-ft. facility.

Most of Array's business comes from sales in the North American
market, but the company expects to expand in global markets
through the aforementioned joint ventures and licensing agreements,
Shaff said.

Array plans to sign several new distributors and sales representatives
in 1996 to help achieve its expansion goals, he added.

CalSwitch Moves, Adds Three Lines -- Connector, LED, And Switch
Offerings Expand

By:
Ann R. Thryft

San Mateo, Calif. - Regional electromechanical specialist California
Switch & Signal Inc. has relocated from Gardena, Calif., to
Carson, Calif., effective Jan. 1, and has added three product
lines.

The new product lines expand Cal- Switch's offerings in connectors,
switches, and LEDs.

"We've asked our customers what they're looking for, and the
addition of Kycon, Alps, and Kingbright was the result," said
Mark Poncher, the company's vice president.

CalSwitch will carry connectors, sockets, and custom-molded
cables from Kycon Cable and Connector Inc., San Jose; switches
and potentiometers from Alps Components, San Jose, a business
unit of Alps Electric (U.S.A.) Inc.; and LED lamps and displays
from Kingbright Corp., City of Industry, Calif.

"Alps expands our switch lines, and moves us more into potentiometers,
where we don't have as many lines as we'd like. Alps is one
of the industry standards for slide pots for the audio market,"
Poncher said.

CalSwitch is also expanding heavily into LEDs, carried by Kingbright,
bringing its LED line total to 12. "In the last year, we've
added three new LED manufacturers," Poncher said. "It's a huge
market, and it's snowballing. The market is so big that many
of these suppliers can't keep up with it, so we're helping
them find outlets for their supply."

CalSwitch's new facility in Carson has 83,000 sq. ft. "We've
now got 23,000 sq. ft. of office space, compared to 8,000 in
the old building," Poncher said. "Our warehouse space has doubled,
from about 30,000 sq. ft. to 60,000 in the new building," he
said.

Although the main reason for expansion was additional room,
it was also easier to accomplish computer and phone system
upgrades in the new building, along with adding electronic
data interchange, electronic mail, and a direct Internet connection,
Poncher said. "We would have had to rewire the entire building

The assembly department will also be much more organized because
it's now all under one roof, he added.

Richey Finishes Deanco Deal



Boston - Richey Electronics Inc. has completed the acquisition
of Deanco Inc. for approximately $60 million.

Deanco, Santa Clara, Calif., is a multi-regional distributor
of interconnect, electromechanical, and passive components.
Together, Richey and Deanco will be present in 17 states through
22 sales offices, seven of which are in the same market.

Combined, Richey and Deanco's estimated sales for 1995 total
approximately $221 million, making it one of the larger passives,
interconnect, and value-added distributors in North America.
The two distributors have complementary businesses and line
cards, and analysts have generally looked favorably on the
acquisition since Richey announced it last November.

For the first nine months of 1995, Deanco generated approximately
$77.8 million in revenue from 17 sales offices located predominantly
in the major western and eastern markets.

Under terms of the agreement, Richey, Garden Grove, Calif.,
acquired all the capital stock of Electrical Distribution Acquisition
Company (EDAC), which owns 100% of Deanco. The consideration
for the acquisition was composed of approximately $34.1 million
as the stock purchase price, approximately $6.6 million for
the redemption of EDAC stockholder notes, and the assumption
of $19.3 million of Deanco debt.

Richey, which does business as RicheyCypress Electronics, funded
the purchase consideration by drawing upon its $75 million
revolving credit and term-loan facility.

"We are delighted with this acquisition, which positions Richey
as one of the leading multiregional distributors serving 20
of the 31 key North American markets," said Bill Cacciatore,
Richey president and chief executive. "This acquisition generates
significant operating leverage and expands both our product
offering and market coverage, while leaving open the prospect
of future growth through geographic expansion and acquisition."

Consolidation of redundant operations and benefits of complementary
customers' bases will spread expenses over a much larger sales
base, Cacciatore added. "We expect to drive additional earnings
leverage by cross-selling our expanded product line and service
capabilities to a customer base that will have more than doubled
to approximately 20,000 customers."

Richardson Posts Strong First Half



Boston - As Richardson Electronics Ltd. had announced a few
weeks ago, the company achieved strong sales growth in all
its divisions for the period ended Nov. 30.

Total sales reached $61.7 million from $51 million a year ago.
Net income totaled $2.2 million, compared with $1.1 million
in the prior-year period.

Sales for the six-month period were $118.9 million, a 22% increase
from $97.4 million the prior year.

Each of the company's Strategic Business Units recorded sales
gains for the quarter. The Security Systems Division's sales
more than doubled to $6.7 million; the Solid State and Components'
unit increased its sales 46% to 17.8 million.

Richardson's Electronic Device Group's sales rose to $28.5 million
from $27.1 million the prior year, and the Display Products
Group's sales were $8.7 million, up from $8.5 million a year
ago.

Gross margins for the quarter improved to 29.1%, compared with
28.6% the prior year, reflecting higher distribution margins
primarily in Europe and the phase-down of the manufacturing
unit there completed in 1995. SG&A (sales, general, and administrative)
expenses as a percentage of sales also decreased to 21.4% from
22.6% the prior year.

"I am pleased with our first-half results," said Edward J. Richardson,
chairman and chief executive of the LaFox, Ill., company, "both
in terms of sales growth and improved margins. This momentum
should carry forward into the second half of fiscal 1996."

Switch Breaks $1/Node Barrier

By:
Darrell Dunn

Dallas - Dallas Semiconductor Corp. is shipping a dual-addressable
switch with 1 Kbit of EPROM that breaks the $1-per-node cost
for distributed system monitoring and control.

The DS2407 sensor/actuator chip can activate a switch and can
also monitor the presence or absence of voltage. The company
expects the device to find use in burglar alarms, factory automation,
comfort control, irrigation control, greenhouses, and vending
machines.

Two voltage sensors and two output transistors inside the DS2407
can be dynamically configured for operation as one sensor and
one switch, as two sensors, or as two switches.

"This chip was designed to exploit the computational, display,
and connectivity features of the PC," said Michael Bolan, vice
president of product development for Dallas. "From the serial
port of the PC, a twisted-pair telephone wire can be routed
up to 300 meters to multiple addressable switches. One signal
plus ground provides the digital communications link as well
as the power for the sensors and actuators."

The DS2407 draws its power from the communication line, so no
external power supply is required.

Each device is individually addressable, and dozens of chips
can be put on the same twisted pair, where a central processor
can turn them on and off individually.

This is made possible by a guaranteed-unique serial number that
is laser-etched into each chip that serves as a node address,
and by an on-chip multidrop network controller.

The DS2407 provides a simple way to build a closed-loop system,
Bolan said. The device sensor responds to a stimulus and reports
it to the processor. The processor makes a decision based on
the sensor input and the switch turns on or off to control
the process.

The flexibility of the DS2407 is enhanced by 1 Kbit of user
programmable and write-protectable EPROM. Data stored in memory
can describe a physical location, identify the controlled equipment,
calibrate the sensor, or reference the actuator to a specific
sensor.

Because it is dual-channel, the DS2407 can drive bidirectional
opto-isolators. One channel can light the LED while the other
senses the response. This feature is used to build electrically
safe opto-isolated interfaces to control high-power devices
such as electric motors or heating and air-conditioning systems.

The DS2407 is available in either a 6-pin, C-leaded surface
mount package, or as a single-channel version in a TO-92 package.
The dual-channel DS2407 is priced at $1.96 in quantities of
5,000, which works out to less than $1 per input/output node.

Isotek Ships Low-Ohmic Surface-Mount Resistors -- Devices Intended
For Use In Current-Sensing Apps

By:
Bettyann Liotta

New York - Isotek Inc. has unveiled two low-ohmic surface-mount
resistors for use in current-sensing applications.

"The low-ohmic feature is important for current sensing because
it offers the ability to sense high levels of current while
having relatively low power loss," said Isotek president Bill
Poisson.

The two-terminal SMR resistor and the four-terminal SMV device
are both rated at 3 watts and measure 6 mm x 12 mm x 3.4 mm
and require only 7.2 cm of space on a circuit board.

The SMR is available in values from 10 milliohms to 4.7 ohms
with a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of less
than 50 ppm/C from 20C to 60C. The SMV is available with resistance
values from 1 m to 1 with a TCR of less than 30 ppm/C. Both
models are available with tolerances of 0.5%, 1%, or 5%

As members of Isotek's ISA-PLAN family of precision resistors,
the SM resistors feature etched manganin foil resistor elements
to facilitate long-term stability, and sport low TCRs and low
inductance of less than 10 nanohenries. Heavy copper-alloy
lead frames and massive copper power terminals serve as heat
sinks to the PC board.

Isotek is the sole distributor of the devices in the United
States, though the resistors are manufactured by Isabellenhutte
GmbH of Dillenburg, Germany. Isabellenhutte developed the alloy
manganin foil used in the products more than 100 years ago,
Poisson said. "Most competitors utilize nickel chrome alloy.[Our]
manganin material has the benefit of very low TCRs at these
low ohmic levels," he said. "As you get down to very low ohms,
the TCRs go up exponentially with nickel chrome. We have low
ohms and low TCRs. And, unlike wirewound resistors, the ISO
PLAN technology is a flat foil, so it has much lower inductance
than wirewound resistors."

SM series resistors are intended for current-sensing applications
found in automotive controls, stepping and servo motor controllers,
power converters, power supplies, digital multimeters, and
medical instrumentation. They are packaged in standard EIA
481 24-mm tape.

Prices vary by resistance value and tolerance. A 100-m SMR with
5% tolerance is priced at $1.74 in 1,000s. A 10-m SMV with
1% tolerance is priced at $2.02 in the same quantities. Delivery
is within 12 weeks.

Macronix Debuts Controllers

By:
Mark LaPedus

Hsinchu, Taiwan - Taiwan's Macronix International Co. Ltd. has
entered the RISC embedded-controller market with a trio of
products built around R3000 processor technology licensed from
Mips Technologies Inc.

Though Macronix licensed the technology in 1992, no generally
available products resulted from the agreement until now. Macronix's
R3000-based controllers are designed for 32-bit embedded applications
such as laser printers, car navigation systems, and handheld
equipment, said vice president Chris Kao.

Other applications for the R3000-based controllers include local
area networking equipment such as bridges, routers, and related
products, Kao said. Macronix is also looking to develop a separate
line of RISC microcontroller units for the set-top-box market.

The 3.3-volt MXR3500 is an entry-level controller with a 40
MHz clock rate and 28-million-instruction-per-secondperformance.
"It also has built-in power management features, making it
ideal for handheld devices," said Albert Sun, department manager
for Macronix's custom design department.

The MXR3500 is also available as an ASIC core, which is Macronix's
second 32-bit embedded offering. The core measures 5.2 mm2,
making it the world's smallest 32-bit RISC core for the embedded
market, positioned against the products of AT&T, Advanced RISC
Machines, Hitachi, NEC, and others, according to the company.

The third controller is the 3.3-V 40-MHz MXR3520 with power
management features and on-chip cache memory. Priced around
$10 in quantities, the device comes in a 100-pin PQFP. The
single-chip device will ship in the third quarter of 1996.

The MXR3500 is packaged in a 128-pin PQFP, but price was not
disclosed. Both the MXR3500 and the MXR3500-based ASIC core
are now available.

More Comfortable Ride In 1996 -- Capacitor prices are expected
to stabilize, and availability will improve, barring severe
materials shortages

By:
Gina M. Roos

On a roller coaster for the past year, the capacitor market
has been coping with capacity constraints and high demand in
addition to raw-material shortages and price increases. As
a result, several capacitor makers raised prices more than
20% in 1995, and placed capacitors, particularly tantalum chips,
on allocation. This year, capacitor producers expect prices
to stabilize and availability to improve as more capacity continues
to come on line.

After concentrating on capacity expansion last year, the capacitor
market will likely resume its focus on reducing costs and packing
more capacitance in smaller case sizes. Buyers can typically
expect a price reduction as a result of this downsizing, in
addition to improvements in capacitor performance, including
higher operating temperatures, higher capacitance, and low
equivalent series resistance (ESR)

This year, many suppliers expect double-digit growth in all
dielectrics due to exceptional demand. AVX Corp. anticipates
20% growth, Philips Components predicts its aluminum electrolytic
business will grow 20% to 30%, and film supplier ITW Paktron
believes its dollar sales will rise 22%. NEC Electronics hopes
to report 25% growth for its fiscal year ending in April.

Demand remains strong from the communications, disk drive, and
computer markets, particularly as faster systems require more
passive devices. The exception is the cellular telephone market,
expected this year to show modest growth compared with the
breakneck pace of the past few years. More moderate growth
in the cellular business should considerably ease the demand
for tantalum-chip capacitors, some suppliers noted.

Last year's severe shortage of tantalum chips appears to have
subsided. "The supply situation is approaching demand. We've
gotten off the life-support system as far as critical shortages
are concerned, but we are still at a critical stage," said
Ed Bost, vice president of tantalum marketing at Kemet Electronics
Corp., Greenville, S.C. But an unexpected spike in the cellular
market could cause spot shortages, Bost added.

Recent capacity additions should help suppliers cope with surprises.
Some examples:

 Ceramic-capacitor maker Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd. has increased
capacity by 30% in 1995, with another 25% coming this year.

 Kemet will boost both its ceramic and tantalum production by
30%.

 Tantalum-chip maker NEC Electronics Inc. plans to add about
10% to 15% capacity.

 Vishay Electronic Components has added roughly 40% to 50% to
its tantalum-chip capacity.

However, tantalum-chip lead times are not back to normal. New
customers are unlikely to receive products in less than 14
to 16 weeks, although lead times also vary by capacitor value,
said Judy Hausman, product marketing manager at NEC Electronics
Inc., Mountain View, Calif. The most popular capacitors are
1-microfarad, 16-volt devices in an A case size; 10-F, 16-V
components in an EIA B case size; and 10-F, 20-V parts in an
EIA B case.

Because of the tantalum-chip shortage, users have started substituting
ceramic and aluminum electrolytic capacitors. A few suppliers
think the use of substitutes has eased with the added capacity;
some maintain that the alternatives could compromise system
performance.

"I think it's a stopgap measure and not a permanent move to
use them in place of tantalums," Hausman said. Aluminums do
not offer a wide operating- temperature range. And ceramic
capacitors' capacitance value changes with variations in temperature,
although they are cheaper than tantalums and will not catch
fire when inserted backward, she said.

Still, others expect the switch to substitutes to be permanent.
As long as ceramics are priced competitively and meet performance
requirements, they will be used instead of tantalum chips,
said David Kirk, manager of marketing and engineering for electronic
infrastructure products, Murata Electronics North America Inc.,
Smyrna, Ga. In addition, ceramic-capacitor lead times are holding
steady at four to six weeks. Murata's ceramic capacitor business
picked up for values between 1 F to 10 F during the period
of critical tantalum-chip shortages, he said.

Kemet's Bost also saw users shifting to leaded tantalum devices.
Although unit consumption of leaded tantalum devices is declining
about 3% to 4% a year, Kemet will remain in the market to fill
the void left by manufacturers shifting capacity to surface
mount lines or no longer supporting the leaded market, he said.
Bost expects leaded prices to climb about 3% a year.

Tantalum-powder suppliers Cabot Performance Materials and HC
Starck would not comment on pricing strategies for 1996. But
Vishay president Don Alfson said tantalum suppliers have told
him to expect hikes of 6% to 10%. Vishay and its competitors
are negotiating with powder suppliers.

Tantalum powder averages $150 per pound and accounts for 10%
of a tantalum capacitor's cost, said Hongju Chang, manager
of R&D at Cabot Performance Materials, Boyertown, Pa.

NEC, which increased its prices 10% to 20% in 1995 because of
exchange rates and tight supply, is expecting tags to stabilize
barring a sharp rise in tantalum-powder prices, Hausman said.

However, Kemet is looking at potential price hikes of roughly
12%, although a portion of the increase will be offset by the
use of higher-charged powders, Bost said.

Pricey Palladium

Most of the raw-material cost in multilayer ceramic capacitors
comes from palladium. As a result of higher prices of that
metal, coupled with scarce production capacity during the first
half of 1995, ceramic-capacitor prices rose 5% to 10%

Palladium prices eased in late 1995, settling in the range of
$130 to $140 a troy ounce, after having doubled from $89 a
troy ounce in 1992 to $180 a troy ounce in 1995, according
to Gordon Bassett, general manager for the Precious Metal Marketing
Division of Johnson Matthey Inc., Valley Forge, Pa.

"As additional capacity comes on board, we anticipate seeing
price pressures in those areas, but the cost of palladium has
also fallen a little bit. We'll see some price pressures if
the cost of palladium doesn't accelerate again," said John
Sarvis, manager of product marketing for ceramics at AVX Corp.,
located in Myrtle Beach, S.C.

As a result of the rising cost of palladium, many ceramic-capacitor
suppliers are considering alternatives. Some are using other
base metals, such as nickel, to replace palladium in the inner
electrode systems. Murata Electronics has developed ceramic
capacitors made with nickel inner electrodes.

When there are many layers, the cost difference between nickel
and palladium becomes significant; for the high-layer parts,
the savings is about 5%, Murata's Kirk said. Ceramics made
of nickel inner electrode could now account for as much as
10% of Murata's ceramic-capacitor business, according to Kirk.

Aluminum foils used to manufacture aluminum-electrolytic capacitors
are still in limited supply from major Japanese producers,
and lead times have stretched in some cases to 24 to 26 weeks.
Heavy demand from the power-supply market has fueled shortages
of large-can, high-voltage aluminum electrolytic capacitors.
These parts also go into motor control and industrial applications.

Prices are also on the rise. Philips Components increased aluminum
electrolytic prices by as much as 15% to 25% last year. The
company may again increase prices because of higher raw-material
costs, according to Al Sembos, marketing manager for aluminum
electrolytic capacitors at Philips Components, Columbia, S.C.
But currency is not a major factor. "The increase reflects
the attempt by the foil suppliers to improve their financial
situation, and the demand is so strong, especially from the
Far East, that it has caused a shortage," he said.

Limited supply has resulted in Philips Components placing aluminum
 electrolytic capacitors on allocation for the last nine months,
and the company is not accepting additional customers. "The
difficulty with the aluminum foil is more acute in the high
voltage range-200 V and up-impacting both screw- terminal and
snap-in products, which are significant in size and require
large amounts of foil," Sembos said.

Lead times at Illinois Capacitor Inc. are six months, said Mike
Shade, operations manager at the aluminum-electrolytic and
film supplier, located in Lincolnwood, Ill. The company is
trying to stock as many high-voltage parts in its standard
line as possible. "We are hoping the material crunch will let
up, but we don't expect marked improvement in 1996," Shade
said.

According to Tom Green, vice president of sales and marketing
at North American Capacitor Co., Indianapolis, another price
hike is possible for 300-V to 450-V aluminum-electrolytic capacitors.
The limited number of facilities that can etch and form high
voltage aluminum foil has led to the shortage, he said.

Another dielectric that has taken a turn for the worse is polycarbonate,
used to manufacture specialty film capacitors. Reportedly,
supply is severely limited since its sole producer, Bayer in
Germany, sold the technology and equipment to Electronic Concepts
Inc., Eatontown, N.J. In addition, suppliers report that prices
have doubled. Electronic Concepts could not be reached.

The polycarbonate is typically used in applications requiring
stability at high temperatures or over a wide temperature range,
with tight tolerances of 1%, Shade said. He believes many engineers
have moved away from the material in favor of polypropylene.

There is some interest in polypheny-lenesulfide (PPS) as a replacement
for polycarbonate because of similar characteristics. PPS use
has risen because it is a high-performing dielectric that can
be used in resonant-filter capacitors for power supplies, said
Dick Slocum, sales and marketing manager for ITW Paktron, Lynchburg,
Va. Unfortunately, the cost of PPS is four times that of polyester,
according to film supplier DuPont Electronics, Wilmington,
Del.

DuPont expects to cut the price of polyethyleneaphthalate (PEN)
film this year. The monomer used to produce the film is expected
to drop from $5.50 per pound to $1.50/lb. when Amoco Chemical's
new plant comes on line. The biggest advantage of PEN: It can
be dipped in molten solder in the wave solder process, said
Mike Popowich, business manager for the films for the Americas
and Far East at DuPont Electronics' films division.

More In Less Space

Capacitor makers are packing more capacitance in the same unit
area across all dielectrics. In tantalum capacitors, suppliers
are looking for higher-charged powders to give them an extra
boost. Any capacitance/voltage per gram (CV/gram) rating above
40,000 is considered high-charged.

"We try to use the highest-charged powders to get the smallest
packages. We're at a point where we can't go on until the tantalum
powder producers improve their technology," Hausman said. Currently,
NEC makes tantalum in an 0805 case size designed for consumer
products.

The main driver is achieving a higher charge per gram and per
unit volume, said Chang at Cabot Performance Materials. The
highest-charged powder available is 40,000 CV/gram, which can
reach 100,000 CV/gram in two years, he said. Cabot is in pilot
production with tantalum powder at 65,000 CV/gram. But there
are safety and purity issues with the higher-charged powders,
he said.

Tantalum-powder supplier HC Starck Inc., Newton, Mass., is also
developing a 60,000-plus CV/gram powder. Terrance B. Tripp,
manager for powder R&D, said most powders used today are in
the 20,000-class range, and the industry is rapidly moving
to 30,000 CV/gram.

Aluminum-electrolytic capacitor makers are also in the game
for more CV. "Everyone is attempting to increase the number
of microfarads they can realize in a unit area of foil. We
can utilize less material and be able to build more pieces,"
Sembos said.

There has also been a move to lower- voltage parts driven primarily
by the portable communication and computer markets. "A lot
of computers are being designed to run at 3.3 V, which has
had a dramatic impact on capacitor voltages, typically at a
standard 50 V and 100 V," Sarvis said. "Those voltages are
being driven down to 16 V and 10 V, and eventually to 6.3 V,
which was unheard of three years ago," he said.

AVX reports increased interest from the computer market for
its integrated passive component lines.

Introduced in late 1995, these devices are similar to resistor
arrays, and integrate two or four capacitors in a surface-mount
package.

Although downsizing to save space will continue, demand for
larger case sizes will not disappear, particularly at high
CV values. AVX maintains that its 10-F product is still the
main driver for the 1210 case size, and values of 1 F, 2.2
F, 3.3 F, and 4.7 F are the 1206 leaders. Still, products of
1 F and less are moving into 0805 and 0603 sizes.

AVX sees a trend this year to broaden the range of the 0805
and 0603s, which could affect the number of 1206s sold next
year. The tiny 0402 is still not cost-effective, and the primary
markets remain applications with very tight space requirements,
such as communications and hearing aids.

Leaded aluminum-electrolytic and film capacitors are still in
demand because the devices do not easily lend themselves to
surface-mount technology.

"Films still have a long way to go for us to realistically address
anything smaller than a 1812 case size, so we're going in the
other direction: packing a lot of capacitance in 1812 and 2824
sizes," Slocum said.

In addition, polyester, the most widely used material for films,
is now available in the thinnest gauge, which has allowed the
company to pack more capacitance into standard sizes.

"We've expended our energies during the last three to four months
on making polyester, which has a rather low melting point,
[and is] more survivable in infrared reflow," Slocum said.

ITW Paktron expects to release a polyester-film line of surface
mount chip films in the larger case sizes with increased voltage
ratings of up to 100 VDC, targeting the high-frequency power
supply market with 1-F and 2.2-F parts. Slocum said you cannot
get those values in a chip that is going to survive IR with
other film materials.

With capacity problems behind them, capacitor suppliers will
refocus their efforts on R&D. A number of new products are
lined up for this year.

Illinois Capacitor is introducing a line of snubber caps. The
updated design provides more current handling and better dV
dt ratings in a smaller package. The company also is standardizing
three of its power-cap lines.

In addition, it will introduce two aluminum-electrolytic lines
 the LSR series of low-ESR capacitors for switch-mode power
supply applications and the SAK series aimed at applications
with low-height requirements.

Philips reports good results in developing longer-life and higher
temperature caps. Watch for a new product release in the first
quarter of 1996.

Also expect a new low-ESR tantalum series in April,which will
be available in several values in A to D case sizes from NEC
Electronics.

Opinion: Never A Dull Moment -- Plenty of questions to answer in new
year

By:
Hugh G. Willett

I can't say we at EBN get all the most exciting assignments
while covering the electronics and computer industry. Compared
with journalists covering troop deployments to Bosnia or the
budget battle on Capitol Hill, the latest components might
seem a little boring. But don't forget: While they get to wear
flak vests and talk to anonymous sources in darkened garages,
we get to cover the Information Revolution as it happens.

And I think 1996 is going to be quite interesting for those
of us covering the high-tech business. In fact, I'll bet that
we have some of the most exciting stories to hit our industry
in a long time.

First of all, we have the component shortages to think about.
For the last couple of years this story has been a no-brainer
to cover. Shortages, shortages, shortages-we basically could
fly on automatic pilot for a while. This year the component
drought is supposed to break, but which shortages are going
toease up and which components are actually going to be in
oversupply?

In the SRAM markets, I think some of us are already talking
about a balance in supply and demand that will eliminate the
kind of price gouging that was going on last year. Sure, every
system shipped will have cache, but the supply of such parts
is already meeting demand and more suppliers are coming on
line. Look for at least a couple of stories in the coming year
about new suppliers, cache RAM alternatives, and on-board cache
schemes from Intel's P6 to Cypress Semi's cache/logic chip
sets and how all of these relate to the supply/ demand balance
in the SRAM markets. I would not be surprised to see big changes
by midyear.

Calling the turning points in the DRAM market could be a little
trickier than in SRAMs because there seems to be such elasticity
of demand that any time the supply increases enough to have
an effect on pricing, demand soars again. For example, I needed
8 Mbytes of RAM to run Windows 95, but I wanted 16 Mbytes to
really run it well. When I found out I could afford 16 Mbytes,
I jumped at it. When the PC support people said they could
leave the old 4-Mbyte module in place for a total of 20 Mbytes,
I again said yes. If they had asked me if they could put in
another 4 Mbytes, I'd also have said yes. I've figured out
that you can't have too much RAM, and sooner or later I'll
need more.

My guess is that the market will go through turmoil this year
as we shift from supply balance to falling prices and back
to strong demand and stable prices and back to rising prices
on some types of DRAMs. If everybody drops out of 4-Mbit DRAMs
because the margins have fallen, then 4-Mbit chips become more
scarce and prices rise again. The organizational mix within
the various densities will make keeping track of what's scarce
and what's not a full-time job for reporters, analysts, and
OEMs. The old "parts is parts" line just doesn't hold true
in the DRAM market anymore. We're ready for the "big memory
crash of '96" story, but I hope we don't get fooled on this
one. The big story for the past two months has been DRAM prices
declining, but I am not fully convinced we've turned the corner
on this one just yet. At this stage, I'd be resisting the urge
to play payback with my suppliers until I'm sure.

One thing is for sure. We won't get the story exactly right
until after it's already happened; no one will, it's just too
hard to see into the future. So we'll do our best and try to
help OEMs make better buying decisions while the suppliers
claim we're too low on our price predictions and the big OEMs
say our price predictions are too high. Maybe I'll get to wear
that flak vest after all?

CyberAgents Automate Network Tasks



New York - FTP Software Inc. announced availability of its CyberAgent
Software Development Kit (SDK) for building and managing intelligent
agents to perform critical, delegated tasks across enterprise
networks and the Internet.

Intelligent agents are autonomous and adaptive software programs
that accomplish their tasks by traveling the network and executing
preassigned commands remotely. System administrators, network
managers, and software developers can use the CyberAgent SDK
to create and manage intelligent agents to execute critical
processes including hardware and software asset management,
virus protection, and information search and retrieval.

The CyberAgent SDK is first in the family of CyberAgent Technology
products from FTP Software's Intelligent Agents Business Unit.
It features an integrated development environment for creating
agents, an Agent Manager for deploying and managing agents
across a network, and sample, ready-to-run intelligent agents.

"System administrators and software developers who deploy intelligent
agents developed with the CyberAgent SDK will be able to effectively
manage and automate network tasks previously performed manually,"
said David French, general manager of FTP Software's Intelligent
Agents Business Unit, Andover, Mass.

The integrated development environment of the CyberAgent SDK
includes a Visual Editor, an agent scripting language, debugging
tools, and sample source code.

The Visual Editor simplifies the development and debugging of
agents by providing button bars for point-and-click agent construction;
context-sensitive help; syntax highlighting; and debugging
tools. The CyberAgent Manager launches, listens for, runs,
and routes agents.

In addition, it provides the critical security mechanism that
allows only authorized agents to run. When agents have completed
their tasks, the CyberAgent Manager can display reported results.

The CyberAgent SDK, compliant with the Windows Sockets Standard,
runs on Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows 95.
The CyberAgent Software Development Kit will be available in
mid-January with a list price of $495.

Templar Program Enables Secure EDI Over The Net



New York - Premenos Corp., a leading provider of electronic
data interchange software solutions for electronic commerce
applications, announced its Templar Certification Program.
The program will allow interested EDI vendors to incorporate
Templar with their translation software to offer secure EDI
over the Internet.

Premenos, Concord, Calif., is encouraging the use of open-network
communication vehicles to further advance the EDI industry.
Now, with the Templar Certification Program, all customers
who have implemented EDI can utilize the Internet as an inexpensive,
high-bandwidth form for EDI communications.

Templar is a suite of standards-based software, service, and
network solutions designed to enable the secure transmission
of end-to-end EDI documents over open networks. Templar software
is the layer between the mail agent, such as SMTP/MIME, and
the EDI translation software to ensure confidentiality, integrity,
authentication, and nonrepudiation of both origin and receipt.

Templar software also provides operations management, including
trading-partner setup, designation of communication and security
requirements, key management, and transaction tracking. Templar
incorporates RSA's public-key cryptography technology integrated
at the application layer-the layer closest to the data.

The Templar Certification Program is available to vendors from
UNIX, AS/400, and MVS mainframe EDI translation software companies.

Since EDI is a standards-based industry and all of Premenos'
products adhere to the standards-including MIME, RSA, and AUT
ACK-the Templar interoperability is quick and easy.

The first to participate are PC EDI translation vendors APL
Group and TSI International, both of Wilton, Conn., and DNS
Worldwide, Burlington, Mass.

"We consider Templar to be the new standard for secure, reliable
network communications," said Stuart Sawabini, president of
the APL Group. "Now we can offer a powerful PC translation
product that, when teamed up with Templar, provides users with
the convenience and cost savings of conducting business transactions
using national data standards over the Internet."

MPEG-2 Encoder Set For Less

By:
Jonathan Cassell

San Mateo, Calif. - In the semiconductor industry's latest step
to discount the cost of real-time compression of broadcast
quality digital video, Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc.
has introduced a low-priced MPEG-2 encoding chip set.

The Mitsubishi set can encode main- profile, main-level video
at resolutions up to 720 480 pixels and at rates as high as
30 frames per second, providing full conformance with the ITU's
601 standard.

The chip set requires only 10 devices to achieve such performance
and costs $6,000 in 1,000s, or $7,000 as part of an evaluation
board, according to Mitsubishi Electronics America, the Sunnyvale,
Calif., subsidiary of Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Tokyo. With
that price point, the Mitsubishi set could serve as the basis
of a low-cost digital video-encoding system or as part of a
future MPEG-2 decompression add-in card for personal computers.

The ability to build low-cost compression systems based on the
Mitsubishi chip set contrasts sharply with the state of the
market at the beginning of 1995, when a low-cost MPEG-2 encoding
end system cost around $100,000.

During 1995, several companies offered lower-cost MPEG-2 encoders,
hoping to capture a piece of the burgeoning market for video
compression systems used in applications ranging from digital
cable- and direct-broadcast satellite television networks to
advertisement insertion at local cable head-ends.

C-Cube Microsystems Inc. in April introduced the CLM4400, which
was priced at $1,950 in 100s, as opposed to the company's older
MPEG-2 compression chip set-the CLM4700-which was priced at
$12,000 for a version that supports main-profile, main-level
encoding. The CLM4400 could achieve such a low cost by halving
horizontal resolution, allowing a complete compression system
based on just four chips.

IBM in March introduced a $700 MPEG-2 encoder that reduced costs
by exclusively performing I-frame compression and omitting
motion-estimation functions.

Unlike the C-Cube CLM4400, the Mitsubishi chip set supports
full-resolution display. The Mitsubishi set also supports all
MPEG-2 prediction modes, including I-, P-, and B-frames, in
contrast to the IBM chip.

To perform MPEG-2 compression with full-frame prediction and
main-profile and main-level support, the Mitsubishi chip set
requires at minimum a single M65722FP pixel processor, a M65721FP
controller, and eight M65727FP motion estimators. Another feature
of the Mitsubishi chip set is a built-in interface to synchronous
DRAM.

The M65722FP pixel-processor and M65727FP motion-estimator chips
are available now, while the M65721FP controller will be available
later this month. The motion estimator by itself is priced
at $500 in 1,000s. Mitsubishi will begin selling evaluation
boards in February.

Briefs: Philips, Sony Ease DVD Restrictions



Philips Electronics N.V., Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and Sony
Corp., Tokyo, have agreed to allow potential buyers of their
Digital Video Disk (DVD) technology to license to others the
more than 40 patents the two share. Buyers will have the right
to license the DVD patents to individuals or groups. The companies
also will cut DVD licensing fees by about 15%

The two companies made the announcement at the behest of the
U.S. Justice Department, which has subjected the Philips/Sony
partnership to a 20-month antitrust investigation. Moreover,
the partners said that due to lowered manufacturing costs,
licensing fees will remain fixed at 5 cents per disk, rather
than escalating with inflation.

Points Of Convergence: Rapid Silicon Advances Push PC Chip Suppliers

By:
Lewis Eggebrecht

Major improvements in process and packaging technology now allow
chip designers to easily integrate multiple PC functions on
a single chip. This new capability is forcing chip companies
to obtain more pieces of the PC technology pie to stay in the
business. As chips add more and more functions, the PC technology
pie increasingly is being split into fewer and fewer pieces.
For PC chip suppliers, the key question is: How will the PC's
silicon pie be split between the traditional suppliers, and
who will be left standing when the music stops?

We have seen silicon process technology advance rapidly from
1.0-micron drawing rules to 0.35-micron geometry. Chip packaging
has now evolved so that 208-pin and 240-pin PQFPs are common
and much higher pin-count devices are possible with ball-grid
array packaging. This rapid technology advancement has caught
many suppliers of PC chips off guard.

Some companies find they now need new technology pieces to continue
their participation in the market. Many companies are scrambling
either to develop or to acquire new technologies just to remain
a player.

Traditionally, PC chip suppliers were partitioned by the functional
blocks of the PC, i.e., processor companies, memory companies,
core-logic companies, and peripheral-chip companies. These
suppliers took advantage of advancements in process technology
and in packaging to improve the performance and functionality
of products within their narrow band of expertise.

Silicon process technology has advanced more rapidly than performance,
however, and functional enhancements have been developed for
individual PC functions. To fill this silicon vacuum, major
functional blocks are now being combined in a single device.

It's unclear who the winners and losers will be in this silicon
convergence. Will microprocessor companies such as Intel, Cyrix,
Advanced Micro Devices, and others absorb much of the PC's
function into their products? Intel has tried this with little
success in its SL family of products, which added peripheral
logic to the microprocessor die.

By pushing the concept of Native Signal Processing, Intel indirectly
is absorbing functions into the processor by enabling software
to perform traditional peripheral functions such as audio,
video, and graphics. Multimedia microprocessor instruction
set extensions, i.e., digital-signal-processor-like instructions,
now are being planned by most processor suppliers. This is
another example of how the microprocessor camp is claiming
more of the PC's functionality.

A more direct example of microprocessor/PC integration is Cyrix
Corp.'s new CG5x86 chip, which contains a high-performance
486 CPU, a memory and cache controller, a Peripheral Component
Interconnect bridge, and a VGA graphics accelerator with video
processing. his chip also has multimedia instruction set enhancements
and a special virtual-processor mode enabling software emulation
of legacy I/O devices.

Core-logic suppliers are now developing peripheral-chip technology
to integrate into core logic. Several suppliers now provide
sound functionality and VGA acceleration both as separate chips
and as an integrated part of their core-logic offerings.

Peripheral-chip suppliers are also responding by integrating
multiple peripheral functions onto a single chip and by developing
core-logic chip sets.

The new NVidia Corp. chip set, for example, integrates VGA acceleration,
sound generation and recording, game controller, and 3-D graphics
functions. Modem-chip manufacturers have also been quick to
add sound capability to their chips.

To achieve true single-chip integration, suppliers need to integrate
analog functions such as phased-lock-loop clock generators,
clock and data separators, codecs, ADCs, DACs, and RAMDACs
onto their products.

Without access to these mixed-signal technologies, true single
chip solutions are not possible. Integrated Circuit Systems
and other companies with expertise in mixed-signal technologies
are also acquiring peripheral-device blocks that are necessary
to compete in this highly integrated converging environment.

In the face of the move by traditional suppliers to integrate
existing fixed functional blocks into products, a new approach
to integrating PC functionality is being developed. Several
companies are developing multimedia processors that they claim
are sufficiently powerful to absorb much of the PC's multimedia
and peripheral functions into a single multimedia processor
chip.

Some of these broadband media processors basically are downloadable
DSPs with RISC-processor-like enhancements, and have features
including pipelining, superscalar execution, very long word
instructions, along with partitioned arithmetic logic units
to better handle graphics and video data types.

No approach will totally win. The PC is expanding into so many
different application areas that multiple architectures and
partitioning will proliferate. In other words, there is more
than one pie to split. But it is clear that if the traditional
PC chip suppliers are to survive, they will need to acquire
or develop more of the pieces of the PC pies.

Lewis Eggebrecht is chief scientist for Integrated Circuit Systems
Inc., San Jose.

VLSI: Interconnect's The Thing -- Says Industry Needs Different
Benchmarks

By:
Anthony Cataldo

San Mateo, Calif. - For those who still judge a device by its
line width, VLSI Technology Inc. has a message: Why don't you
consider the interconnect?

While line width has traditionally been the chief technology
yardstick for ICs, the true test of performance depends largely
on how tightly a vendor can pack the signal lines that transfer
data among stacked metal layers, especially for deep submicron
devices, said Robert Payne, chief technology officer for VLSI
Technology, San Jose.

The problem, Payne feels, is that the industry still hasn't
caught on. "The modes in which people talk about technology
have been turned into meaningless marketing hype," Payne said.
"We need a new way to talk about the technology that is more
meaningful to our customers."

He especially takes exception when ASIC vendors boast about
their feature size while keeping their metal pitch-the measure
of interconnect density-under wraps.

"Anybody that discloses process technology and doesn't disclose
their interconnect hasn't disclosed anything," he said. "For
someone to claim they are a member of the 0.25-micron generation
while they have metal pitches that barely qualify them for
0.35-micron is ludicrous.

"If guys were to throw around financial numbers with the same
degree of casual claims, it would land them in court with the
SEC," he said. "This isn't harmless marketing mischief."

What the industry needs, he said, is a new set of benchmarks
for submicron designs in order to keep everyone honest. That
means putting an end to quoting how many gates can be stuffed
on a 4-sq.-cm die area when most customers would dare not touch
a chip that large. Furthermore, vendors should quit padding
their gate counts by including memory gates, which are more
dense than logic gates, he said.

Joyce Putscher, analyst at In-Stat Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz.,
agreed that there are "new rules" governing process technology
at the deep submicron level.

"I think [VLSI has] made some valid points," she said. "They
obviously believe that the industry needs new benchmarks and
they are making a good case for that."

But some observers noted that VLSI is also trying to undermine
LSI Logic Corp., one of VLSI's chief rivals in cell-based design,
a technology that enables ASIC vendors to stitch together different
logic cores on a single chip. LSI Logic recently announced
a 0.25-micron process technology, while VLSI uses a 0.35-micron
process that it co-developed with Hitachi.

Steve Roddy, product manager for LSI Logic, Milpitas, Calif.,
agreed that connecting up to five metal layers on a die presents
a fundamental problem for ICs.

Though Roddy indicated that LSI's metal pitch for 0.35-micron
and 0.25-micron design rules equals or surpasses those from
VLSI, he would not disclose actual specifications. The company
does share metal-pitch information with its customers, he noted.

And though benchmarks may have some usefulness, they only can
go so far. More important is how closely an ASIC vendor can
work with the customer, Roddy said.

"Many of our customers have very extensive questions. We will
go through months-long evaluations with them on the technology."

ASML In Deep UV Stepper Set

By:
Jack Robertson

Washington - ASM Lithography, Veldhoven, the Netherlands, next
week will unveil its first deep ultraviolet wafer stepper to
jump into the fray for 0.25-micron-resolution systems.

ASML joins perennial Japanese lithography rivals Nikon and Canon,
which introduced deep UV steppers earlier and are already sold
out on quarter-micron systems for 1996.

All three use a krypton fluorine 248-nanometer wavelength excimer
laser to achieve the 0.25-micron line geometry resolution.
All three use the deep UV illumination with the traditional
step-and-repeat lithography process.

In addition, Nikon has introduced a step-and-scan deep UV machine,
which industry sources said has been tested at Intel and is
under evaluation for the 256-Mbit DRAM joint venture of IBM,
Toshiba, and Siemens at IBM's facility in East Fishkill, N.Y.

Richard George, manager of the ASML deep UV stepper program,
said his company will unveil the PAS5500/300 excimer-laser
system, and claimed it has the industry's fastest processing
rate. The system is said to process more than 80 200-mm wafers
an hour at quarter-micron resolution.

Silicon Valley Group Lithography, Wilton, Conn., uses a mercury
lamp for its deep UV step-and-scan Micrascan-II system, which
can reach 0.3-micron resolution. SVGL claims Micrascan-II can
reach quarter-micron line widths for some R&D laboratory processing.
The company also is developing an excimer-laser version for
a Micrascan-III system for production-level quarter-micron
processing. No introduction date has been set.

Yoshinoir Hariu, international marketing manager for Nikon's
IC and LCD Equipment Division, Tokyo, said lithography suppliers
have been surprised by the strong demand for deep UV steppers.
Nikon has more than 50 orders for excimer-laser steppers, inundating
production, he said.

"Deliveries are stretched out to 20 months," he said. "Although
Nikon is expanding its own production as rapidly as possible,
we don't see [it] catching up with the big demand for deep
UV steppers before 1998."

Philip Ware, a U.S. marketing manager for Canon Inc., concurred
that the initial rush of orders for deep UV steppers carries
the company into 1997.

All agreed that just meeting the deep UV stepper demands of
existing longtime chip-maker customers precludes them from
taking on new accounts for any significant orders. Nikon's
Hariu said it is agonizing to be forced to defer potential
new customers, "but we must serve our traditional customers
first."

Even with the surge in deep UV stepper orders, the equipment
makers expect continued strong demand in traditional I-line
optical steppers. "Deep UV tools will be used for critical
quarter-micron layers of a wafer, which may be only three or
four layers at most. All the remaining noncritical layers will
use I-line steppers. We will be selling as many or more I-steppers
as ever, through the turn of the century," said Canon's Ware.

Hariu of Nikon agreed. Nikon shipped 450 I-line steppers worldwide
in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, a 50% increase over
the previous fiscal year.

Briefs: MRS Technology Seeks Investor



MRS Technology, Chelmsford, Mass., is seeking an investment
partner to help fund development of next-generation systems.
The maker of flat-panel display lithography steppers said it
had failed to sell a single lithography system in the last
quarter, and hasn't sold a system in the current quarter.

MRS has sold its systems to most U.S. flat-panel developers,
including AT&T Bell Laboratories, Xerox Palo Alto Research
Park, the IBM LCD research program at Watson Research Laboratories,
OIS Optical Imaging Systems, and Image Quest Technology.

Japanese panel makers, however, have largely shunned MRS, instead
buying lithography systems from Japanese suppliers Nikon and
Canon. MRS earlier sold several steppers to Hitachi and another
unidentified Japanese producer for development laboratories.

In other U.S. FPD equipment activity, Watkins-Johnson Co. Flat
Panel Display Operations, Scotts Valley, Calif., named David
Leksell manager of process systems. He was commercialization
manager for Westinghouse Microsystems, Pittsburgh. Leksell
also was a founder of Panelvision Corp., a U.S. pioneer in
active-matrix LCD development.

Briefs: Electroglas Sells System To Motorola



Electroglas Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., has installed its Horizon
4060X automatic wafer probing system at Motorola Semiconductor
Products Group's ultrathin 6-in. wafer line in Phoenix.

The new Motorola wafers, as thin as 120 microns, are used in
the company's cellular telephone and pager products. Richard
Earle, Motorola's manager of manufacturing operations for the
new line, said wafer prober handling is extremely critical
because of the very fragile nature of the wafers.

The Horizon 4060X uses an automated handling system with up
to three wafer cassettes, and links the probe tester to a computer
network of tester application packages and factory information
management.

1996 Picture Unclear For Indies

By:
Barbara Jorgensen and Darrell Dunn

Boston - Predictions of a more balanced supply and demand picture
this year have independent distributors hedging on their business
expectations for 1996.

In general, independents-which thrive during periods of shortage
are expecting high demand to continue. Some, however, noted
a correction at the end of last year that indicated the seller's
market of 1995 may be at an end.

"We've seen a correction in supply and demand that has been
so out of balance for so long," said Michael Benjamin Galinksi,
chairman of American II Group, Clearwater, Fla. November was
a particularly hard month for many independents, Galinksi said.
His company has had to become more proactive.

"There were times in 1995 where our sales reps didn't have 10
minutes an hour to make an outgoing phone call," he said. "We're
having to reverse our strategy a bit and spend more time making
those outgoing calls."

Galinski believes that independents will see consolidation if
the market becomes more competitive. "There is going to be
somewhat of a shakeout in the industry. The strong will survive
and be very profitable, and others who can't compete are going
to get run out of the industry. If you look around, you'll
see a lot of independents scrambling to stay afloat. They're
trying to get into passives, or tantulum capacitors, or crystal
oscillators, or even sports memorabilia."

Leland Ackerley, vice president of Smith & Associates, Houston,
is anticipating a slowdown in 1996. The company saw tremendous
sales growth since 1994, but "we have reservations about the
climate for next year. We're not sure how it's going to shake
out."

Memory and other commodity products are going to become more
readily available in 1996, Ackerley said. And like Galinski,
Ackerley foresees a market that will drive some players out.
"There are almost an infinite number of independent distributors
right now, many of which have just started in the past year.
In the past, when business turns down, the best ones survive."

Others maintain there will be enough business to go around,
and have higher expectations for 1996. "We see the market continuing
to be healthy," said Susan Humerian, general manager of Commodity
Components International Inc., Peabody, Mass. Although lead
times for power MOSFETs and discretes recently have decreased,
"we're still moving a lot of them," she said.

For microprocessors, price and margin pressure will continue.
"They are truly a commodity and buyers know the price to the
penny," she said.

"Obviously [additional fab] capacity will be a factor next year,"
Humerian pointed out, "but there's always something that suffers.
If suppliers put money into a wafer fab for memory, something
else will be short."

Universal Integrated Circuits, Carol Stream, Ill., saw business
drop precipitously at the end of 1995, said president Hamilton
Rice. "I think it's because of the holiday. People were gearing
down because they manufactured all the stuff they needed. By
the end of January, things will be gearing up and we'll start
seeing the same trends [as last year]."

But leftover components following the holiday-related product
manufacturing could be a problem for independents if OEMs dump
them into the channel.

The last few months of 1995 were a boom for Advanced MP Technology,
San Clemente, Calif. "We haven't had any setback," said Kamran
Malek, corporate vice president. Richard Kwartek, vice president
of sales, expects 1996 to be strong. "Our customers are forecasting
tremendous growth in 1996. The economy will be strong: interest
rates are going down. Our customers are bullish."

But no matter which way the economy goes, Advanced MP is counting
on the inherent imperfections of the industry to keep independents
in business. "One major factor is JIT [just-in-time]," Kwartek
said. "If manufacturers have experienced an upturn, the organizations
out there are not in tune, and that kicks everything into hell."

The DRAM Price Balloon Pops, Finally

By:
Anthony Cataldo

San Mateo, Calif. - Buyers can take heart: The days of paying
inflated prices for commodity DRAMs appear to be over.

In stark contrast to last summer's DRAM price peak, open-market
costs for 4-Mbit parts in every flavor, as well as the more
rare 1-M16 parts, have dropped over the past several months,
thanks to OEMs dumping excess inventories into the nonfranchised
market.

But before taking a hard-line stance when negotiating the next
volume purchase from an independent, buyers should be aware
that faster extended data out (EDO) parts are still in high
demand and holding their value.

Prices for 4-Mbit parts have fallen from about $15 a month ago
down to between $3 and $4, said Rudy Hartmann, vice president
of sales for Leo Electronics Inc., Torrance, Calif. Although
sales are generally stagnant during the end of the year, prices
have taken more of a beating this time around, he said.

A similar situation is taking shape at the San Jose branch of
Classic Components Corp., where the price for a standard 4
Mbit has dipped from about $19 to $13 during the past several
months.

"There's a lot more product available and prices have gone down
a tad," said Jason Croteau, purchasing agent for Classic, Gardena,
Calif.

As for the moribund 1-Mbit parts, it is a fire sale. "One-Mbits
have dropped even more because they are becoming marginally
used," said Leo Electronics' Hartmann.

Several forces have helped push prices down, although observers
differ on which should be given the most credit. In general,
the quick switch to faster EDO parts, disappointing sales of
Windows 95, a yen-to-dollar exchange rate correction, and over
optimistic PC sales forecasts are commonly cited.

The rapid transition to EDO DRAMs was sparked by Intel's introduction
of the EDO-compatible Triton chip set, which spurred the Santa
Clara, Calif., company to buy large volumes of EDO parts for
use in its motherboards. In response, memory vendors shifted
their production lines in favor of the faster parts, said Jim
Handy, analyst at Dataquest Inc., San Jose.

"Intel is a phenomenally large DRAM consumer," he said. "When
somebody that major switches over, there's always a hiccup.
This is the hiccup."

Handy also said DRAM costs have softened recently because suppliers
are feeling pressure from customers to reduce prices next quarter
now that $1 can again buy more than 100 yen.

Others said OEMs have been forced to sell excess DRAM because
sales of Windows 95, which was supposed to cause a surge in
memory upgrades, were not as strong as expected.

The price drops are causing anxiety among brokers, who rely
heavily on DRAM sales. Recent price drops for flash and cache
RAM devices have made it even more difficult, Hartmann said.

That means that Leo Electronics, which garners about 40% of
its sales from DRAMs, will have to delay until next year any
decisions to expand or add staff, Hartmann said.

"Everyone-even the big boys-are nervous about picking up any
quantities of DRAMs," he said.

Brokers said that for now, they can only keep buying DRAMs and
hope that prices will not drop any further. There is already
some indication that prices are beginning to plateau, they
said.

Almost One-Quarter Of OEMs Sell To Independents



Almost one-quarter of the OEMs surveyed by EBN for its annual
Customer Issues In Distribution report said they sell surplus
components to nonfranchised or independent distributors. OEMs
that do so indicate these are components that cannot be returned
to their supplier or distributor, although anecdotal evidence
suggests that allocated and hard-to-find parts also find their
way into the independent channel.

A Telesales Sampler



Following is a sampling of sales and support programs provided
by large distributors.

Marshall Industries, El Monte, Calif.: Marshall has a variety
of options for customers and does not classify them by size.
Marshall has had a telesales operation for about six years,
but also provides service through a 24-hour service center
and the Internet. "We don't pay commissions to our salespeople,
so we don't spend an inordinate amount of time classifying
our customers," said president and chief executive Robert Rodin.

Telemarketing is a demand-creation center for the entire company,
and accounts may be supported by field sales as well.

Wyle Electronics Inc., Irvine, Calif.: Wyle has a dedicated
telesales group in Santa Clara, Calif., and in Boston, serving
their respective regions, and a third group in Utah. The distributor
also offers support through a "technical select" program offering
quick fax responses for technical data requests. "We try to
profile customer needs and supplement that with outside sales,"
said Ralph Ozorkiewicz, president and chief executive. Wyle
also has an account development program, and Ozorkiewicz stresses
flexibility in customer service.

TTI Inc., Fort Worth, Texas: TTI's teleservices is the fastest
growing portion of TTI's business, according to Craig Conrad,
vice president and director of sales. Small or new customers
are usually handled by teleservices to allow branches to focus
on existing customers. TTI dedicated a group to new or emerging
accounts two and a half years ago to support customers that
did business with TTI but were not getting adequate service
and account development.

Teleservices has reported 99% on- time delivery and its first
call response is also very high, Conrad said. Reps are also
trained in product knowledge

Pioneer-Standard Electronics Inc., Cleveland: The company confirmed
it has a dedicated group for small and emerging accounts, but
details were unavailable by press time.

Arrow Electronics Inc., Melville, N.Y.: The distributor offers
small and emerging customer-support programs, but declines
to discuss them.

Consumer electronics world hopes dvd spurs comeback -- CES to
take digital turn

By:
Junko Yoshida and George Leopold

Las Vegas - This week's Consumer Electronics Show will open
a window on the digital consumer products that are expected
to drive the electronics industry for years to come. But product
launches could be delayed-even scrubbed-if hardware vendors,
content developers and policy-makers fail to achieve common
ground on thorny intellectual-property issues.

Copyright questions notwithstanding, equipment makers are readying
a raft of digital products. Digital TV could debut in the United
States as early as this year, and Japanese companies are already
preparing second-generation "combo boxes," marrying digital
video-disk playback with other digital functions, for introduction
in 1997.

Consumer-electronics vendors-left reeling by the home-PC boom,
the cutthroat price competition in 32-/64-bit videogame platforms
and the reversal of fortune of the cable set-top box-have pegged
this their comeback year.  They've stockpiled an arsenal of
digital offerings, centering on digital video disk (DVD) player
prototypes, camcorders, VCRs, direct broadcast satellite (DBS)
decoders, TVs and even low-cost TV top platforms for surfing the
Net story, below)

New digital formats and specifications are coming together that
will allow TVs, disk and tape to "go digital" seemingly simultaneously.
Such companies as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Sony
Corp., Philips Electronics, Thomson Multimedia and Toshiba
Corp. all hope to ride the digital video wave-primarily on
the DVD platform-to merge products, redefine consumer-device
features and spin off intelligent combo gadgets.

Semiconductor executives at SGS-Thomson, VLSI Technology Inc.,
LSI Logic Corp. and Motorola Inc. have acknowledged in recent
interviews that they are already competing for design slots
in second-generation combo DVD boxes. The discrete chips that
debut this year in first-generation standalone DVD models could
be displaced in 1997 by highly integrated two-chip sets or
even single-chip DVD offerings.

The combo box may take a number of forms, merging DVD functions
with a digital satellite decoder, next-generation game platform
or digital VCR. "No two DVD product designs we've looked at
are alike," said Roger Kozlowski, vice president and technical
director of the consumer segment at Motorola Semiconductor
Products Sector.

He added that "most consumer companies see DVD as a great opportunity
to put their margins back into their business" and are looking
for ways to prevent DVD from becoming just another low-cost,
commodity product.

Some DVD-system vendors are designing network-interface-module
slots into their second-generation boxes that will allow the
systems to function as set-tops based on various networks.
Telephone/cable set-top vendors have floated a similar strategy
in recent years, albeit without turning around product.

Kozlowski, in fact, said many consumer-electronics vendors consider
DVD "a vehicle to ruin the set-top business. And Kishore Manghnani,
marketing manager of LSI Logic's Consumer Product Division,
called DVD "a means to effectively compete against multimedia
PCs."

Beating the bushes

DVD-system vendors are beating the bushes for chip companies
with systems know-how and a range of key building blocks for
DVD front and back ends. Those building blocks include optics
interface chips; demodulation and error correction for the
front end; MPEG-2 video, MPEG-2 audio and AC-3 decoders; and
NTSC/PAL encoder chips, with an anti-copy system for the back
end.

The challenge for silicon vendors is to find solid system partners
for strategic DVD development. A number of alliances have been
struck in recent months.

Motorola claims to be closely working with three Japanese companies
and to be working on a DVD system design for a U.S.-based company.

Jeff Hendy, vice president and general manager of VLSI Technology's
Consumer and Industrial Products Division (San Jose, Calif.),
said his company is "currently partnered with two of our digital
satellite-decoder customers in Japan to provide silicon solutions
for their first- and second-generation DVD boxes."

Sources at LSI Logic would not identify partners but said that
one of the company's Japanese allies will launch a DVD player
based on its two-chip DVD solution before year's end.

Highly integrated DVD system solutions proposed by a variety
of chip companies include designs based on ARM processors,
MIPS processors, proprietary digital signal processors (DSPs)
and Motorola's Coldfire embedded RISC offering.

Property wrangle

One cloud looming over the parade of digital activity is the
issue of intellectual-property protection-considered essential
if players, recorders and cameras are to be sold globally.
The outcome of delicate negotiations now under way between
U.S. equipment makers and Hollywood interests over copy-protection
systems will likely set the parameters for proposed legislation.

Proposed changes to U.S. copyright laws contained in a Commerce
Department white paper have already drawn heavy fire from such
groups as the Digital Future Coalition and the Electronic Industries
Association (see Nov. 27, page 1). The groups insist that the
changes will stifle innovation and erode "fair use" provisions,
which permit limited copying of protected material.

EIA officials said last week that the association has joined
the coalition in opposing proposed copyright changes.

Meanwhile, the EIA is in the midst of talks with the Motion
Picture Industry Association of America on compromise legislation
that would influence the design of digital recorders. Both
sides declined to elaborate, but the EIA does oppose an anti
circumvention provision that would make it illegal to sell
products that could bypass copy-protection systems. The provision
would make a whole range of digital consumer products illegal,
said the EIA's Gary Shapiro.

Several copy-protection schemes are on the table. The December
compromise between the two DVD camps included a draft format
for a copy-protection method, originally proposed by Philips,
called the Copy Generation Management System (CGMS). Rob Van
Eijk, senior program manager of standards and formats at Philips
Key Modules, said CGMS is a 2-bit code, implemented in the
video stream, that can specify one of three provisions: no
copying, one copy only or unlimited copies.

Besides CGMS, DVD manufacturers have agreed to use Macrovision
6.1, the newest version of the anti-copy system developed by
Macrovision Corp. (Mountain View, Calif.). Macrovision's approach
prevents illegal VCR recording of copy-protected video signals.

Macrovision vice president Mark Belinsky said version 6.1 employs
two anti-copy processes-one based on automatic gain control
and the other on color stripes.

The first relies on a fundamental difference between the automatic
gain-control systems employed in TVs and VCRs. By adding bright
white pulses to the video signal on vertical blanking intervals,
the process confuses the VCR's automatic-gain-control circuit,
thereby degrading recordings of protected material.

The second anti-copy process exploits the fact that while the
color-burst component of a video signal is used in a TV set
only for subcarrier regeneration, in a VCR it is also used
for timebase error correction.

By inverting a small number of color bars in each screen, the
process confuses the VCR's velocity-error-correction system,
embedding the color stripes in an illegal copy.

Macrovision's anti-copy system can embed the two processes in
DVD players and most digital set-top decoders. The Macrovision
waveform generator is included as part of the NTSC/PAL encoder
IC inside a DVD or a digital set-top box.

Currently, 10 chip companies-including Philips Semiconductors,
GEC Plessey Semiconductors and SGS-Thomson Microelectronics
are Macrovision-authorized component suppliers of NTSC/PAL
encoder chips. System vendors seeking to implement the approach
must license the technology from Macrovision.

In Japan, a standards group is preparing to propose CGMS as
an international standard, according an Electronic Industries
Association of Japan spokesman.

Masakatsu Ueda, a consumer-electronics consultant at CES International
Corp., said CGMS works as a "combination of software and hardware,
and it could serve [as] a simple and effective copy-protection
system."

Japanese observers agreed that reaching a consensus on the CGMS
specification is crucial if DVD systems are to reach the market
on schedule. Sony, Toshiba and Matsushita are said to be taking
the lead in working on the copy-protection issue.

Copy protection is badly needed not only for the rewritable
DVD RAM now under development but also for ROM systems. "If
copy protection is not legislated in the United States, the
software industry would not release the DVD software at the
time of introduction of the DVD players and DVD drives," a
Matsushita manager said.

Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home Video Inc. (Burbank,
Calif.), said protection schemes will be embedded in nearly
all DVD disks, with the outcome likely to be one-time-only
copying of audio disks. For video disks, copy protection and,
in some cases, parental lockout codes will be added.

Many of the parties interested in intellectual-property issues
are expected to come together next week at a forum intended
to identify requirements for technological solutions to digital
copyright protection. The Interactive Media Association (Annapolis,
Md.), with the backing of the U.S. Copyright Office, has been
seeking industry comment since last summer on technology requirements
and has spearheaded the forum.

"By assembling requirements, we are laying groundwork for solutions
that balance the needs of content owners fearful of losing
control of their intellectual property as well as end users
interested in fast, inexpensive and legitimate access to information,"
said forum organizer Brian Kahin, the association's general
counsel.

Organizers said their goal is to develop a framework for achieving
a technology-based intellectual-property-management system.
Differing industry practices have slowed licensing of multimedia
products. Hence, organizers said, access to digital content
will require automated licensing configured to accommodate
uniform resource and user addresses, header descriptors and
interaction between billing and licensing servers.

"We are looking at definition problems, architecture problems
not proprietary solutions," Kahin said.

Despite those concerns, most leading consumer-electronics manufacturers
are champing at the bit to release first-generation DVD products
this year and to come up with winning formulas for second-generation,
combo boxes. Chip vendors, for their part, are being pressured
to work concurrently on several different silicon designs rather
than on single, simple, standard DVD chip sets.

Motorola will supply three or four DVD silicon options, using
its DSP 56009 as a reference platform, said Kozlowski. The
derivatives will provide PCM, AC-3 and MPEG audio-decoding
features.

Motorola also hopes to keep a high profile in advanced interactive
DVD systems. Kozlowski said the company is developing a single
chip DVD system based on its Coldfire 5200-an embedded 32-bit
mini-RISC processor-for a system to be introduced in 1997.
The chip will offer error correction, system de-multiplexing,
program-elementary-stream decoding, PCM, MPEG audio, MPEG-2
video decoding and fairly advanced 3-D graphics capabilities.

Leverage silicon

Despite the complexity of system-level integration requirements,
one blessing for IC vendors is that companies well-versed in
digital set-top-box designs can leverage some of their set
top silicon technology for DVD products.

When comparing a DVD player with any digital set-top or high
speed videogame machine, said LSI Logic's Manghnani, the guts
of the system-microprocessor, source decoder, graphics IC and
memories-remain largely the same. The only difference is in
the channel decoder. "We see DVD as a superset of set-top,"
he said.

For that superset, LSI Logic is using the company's coreware
capability to integrate a DVD's channel-decoder block into
one chip and the source decoder for another chip based on its
32-bit MIPS RISC core. The company's two-chip-set DVD will
be ready for system integration this year, Manghnani promised.

SGS-Thomson also is poised to take full advantage of its expertise
in the digital set-top decoder market. Armed with its STI3520
audio/video MPEG-2 decoder-already available in volume-SGS
Thomson plans to pitch its ST20 proprietary 32-bit RISC core,
PAL/NTSC encoder embedded with the Macrovision anti-copy system,
and other link ICs as a chip set in 1996.

The company's road map calls for further integration of the
back end, as well as development of a highly integrated front
end DVD system for 1997 introduction, said Paul Bromley, SGS
Thomson's chief of multimedia architectures and corporate strategy.
Particularly for front-end system integration, Bromley said,
"we will leverage our hard-disk-drive controller experience;
mixed-signal, analog/digital design technology; and BiCMOS
0.5-micron production capability."

SGS-Thomson also has a development program for a completely
software-based media processor that would work much like Philips's
TriMedia processor, Bromley disclosed. When available late
in 1997, it could serve as a core for flexible DVD-based multimedia
devices.

Despite similarities between the DVD back ends and digital set
top boxes, DVD adds some new wrinkles to keep chip vendors
on their toes. For one, DVD must be able to decode both MPEG
audio and AC-3. Chip vendors lacking AC-3 capabilities in their
current MPEG-decoder offerings plan quick fixes, based on proprietary
DSPs, for first-generation boxes. But the technical challenge
for second-generation chips is "how to optimize the integration
of MPEG-2-level audio with AC-3 most cost-effectively," said
VLSI's Hendy. VLSI is reportedly working on a solution that
tightly couples RISC and digital signal processing.

Another technical challenge is how to conserve overall memory
at the system level. Because DVD players are the first fully
digital products to handle variable bit rates (VBR) off a disk,
the systems must include as much as 3 Mbits of extra memory
for VBR buffering.

SGS-Thomson sources said the company is addressing that issue
by developing its back-end DVD architecture to cut the memory
required for MPEG-2 decoding to 10.5 Mbits in NTSC and 12 Mbits
in PAL. Thus, when a 16-Mbit synchronous DRAM is used for a
DVD system, a minimum of 4 Mbits is available for VBR buffering,
an SGS-Thomson spokesman said.

Startup takes tiny vias to packaging market

By:
Ron Wilson

San Jose, Calif. - Prolinx, a two-year-old technology startup
here, has accomplished a unique technology transfer-adapting
field-programmable gate-array technology to printed-circuit
boards and ball-grid-array packages (BGAs)

The result could substantially improve the size and performance
of BGAs in the short term and rapidly change the capabilities
of pc boards over the next few years.

But a major improvement in packaging was not on the agenda when
the company started. "We began in October 1993 with technology
people who had antifuse experience at Actel Corp.," said Prolinx
president and CEO Richard Nathan. "Our idea then was to develop
a programmable antifuse that could be fabricated on a pcb,
rather than on a chip. With a sufficiently small pcb antifuse,
we could put a programmable via at every point where wires
crossed over each other, and make a fully programmable circuit
board. Unlike companies that were doing programmable interconnect
in chips, where speed and cost were serious problems, we intended
to do the antifuses on the circuit board, where they could
be large enough to have very low resistance, yet could be built
as part of the board-fabrication process."

In discussions with prospective customers, Prolinx found less
than-overwhelming interest in a programmable circuit board.
There were potential applications, but they lay on the other
side of a great expanse of missionary work. On the other hand,
the very small size of the programmable vias-4 to 8 mils-got
people excited.

"We came to realize that there was a long-term market for the
programmability of our via," Nathan said. "But there was a
much greater short-term need for any kind of via that was as
small as ours."

The initial application Prolinx identified was for pc boards
in such compact systems as pagers and cellular phones. The
company quickly recognized that it was far too small to meet
the demand for such circuit boards, however, and chose to exploit
that market by licensing the via technology to pc-board houses.

But packaging provided a market that Prolinx could handle directly.
"Even with 50-mil spacing, the little circuit board that holds
the die and has the solder bumps on it really stresses laminate
technology," said Nathan.

Under the pads

Nathan said that Prolinx can do a single-layer board with the
vias that fit under the bonding pads. This board holds the
die on one side and the solder bumps on the other side. "Our
goal is to achieve cost parity with high-pin-count PQFPs [plastic
quad flat packs] using laminated packaging BGAs," Nathan said.

Prolinx plans this year to begin supplying substrates to BGA
packaging vendors and receiving license revenue from pc-board
companies. "We intend to be in production with qualified product
in the second or third quarter of 1996," Nathan said.

The via that makes this possible begins with a photo-imaged
or screen-printed hole in the laminate material. The hole now
can be as small as 4 mils, but Prolinx vice president of engineering
Paul Wu said the company has a road map that would take the
hole down to at most 2 mils.

The hole is filled with a proprietary material, forming what
Prolinx calls a Microfilled Via (MFV). Then, the via is electrically
placed into a conduction mode, as would be done for an antifuse.
"Unprogrammed, the via is virtually an open circuit," Nathan
said. "Once programmed, it can be less than 10 m."

The fabrication process imposes no restrictions on normal circuit
board techniques, Wu said. Ground planes can be fabricated
over vias for shielding. The vias can be stacked and other
high-density or high-frequency techniques can be employed.

The small vias are opening another degree of freedom for BGA
vendors besides just simplicity, Wu said. "One of the tools
we are developing along with the MFV technology is a package
for nearly automatic BGA design. You will plug in the parameters
of the package and out will come the laminate design for the
package," said Wu.

CES to see low-cost Internet box for TV

By:
Junko Yoshida

Las Vegas - Net surfers can catch the first wave of low-cost
Internet-access systems this week at the Consumer Electronics
Show. Several computer and consumer-electronics manufacturers
are reportedly working on Internet-access boxes that would
plug into a TV and sell for under $300.

First out of the chute in what could become the vanguard of
a new category of convergence designs is ViewCall America (Norcross,
Ga.) and sister company ViewCall Europe (London). Their WEBster
system is said to give consumers direct access to the Internet
and on-line services through their televisions. R.W. Coughlin,
director at ViewCall America, noted that the company will privately
demonstrate the box to predetermined guests in a hotel suite
at CES.

Coughlin confirmed that the idea and design-based on the ARM
processor-come from ViewCall Europe and its investor, John
Bentley. However, Coughlin declined to say who will make the
boxes: "We are in the midst of negotiations with a variety
of hardware vendors."

Steven Brightfield, worldwide marketing manager for Media Business
Unit at chip maker GEC Plessey Semiconductors, said, "This
kind of low- cost Internet box is obviously still in its very
early days. But we are expecting to see more than a few prototypes
at this CES."

The notion of bringing the Internet-access capability, with
other multimedia on-line services, to low-cost home appliances
is catching fire among consumer-electronics companies in Japan.
Their plan is to build game consoles or low-cost set-tops that
would allow mass consumers to access the Net.

Joint venture

Late last fall, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT), Sega
Enterprises Ltd., Sony Corp., JVC and Yamaha Corp. established
a joint venture called GrR HomeNet Corp. in Tokyo. The mission
is to provide an on-line multimedia communications service
that includes not only Internet access but also electronic
conferencing, karaoke, videogames, music listening, shopping
and news-all on-line. The service can be received via home
PCs, game consoles, TVs and other set-tops.

"Building low-cost Internet-access boxes-whether it's an additional
feature to our game consoles or TVs-is not a problem," said
a Japanese executive, explaining his company's intention to
invest in the new venture. "We felt that we need to make sure
that consumers will be able to get, via this box, a number
of entertainment services besides just Web browsing." Among
the five investors, Sony is a developer of its 32-bit Playstation
game-console system, while JVC and Yamaha make Sega's 32-bit
Saturn game consoles.

The GrR HomeNet will have its service up and running around
midyear in Japan. Presumably, those who have invested will
be preparing to launch game consoles or other low-cost boxes
that can be connected to the on-line multimedia service.

For its part, GEC Plessey has developed an NTSC/PAL encoding
chip for a low-cost Internet box that would allow graphics
 originally created for a VGA screen display-to look sharper
on an interlaced TV screen. The chip integrates comb filter,
interpolation filter and a raster-to-interlace converter. Brightfield
could not be reached last week for comment on whether the chip
is designed into WEBster box. But he hinted that the chip is
designed into at least one Internet terminal to be shown at
CES.

Meanwhile, researchers at Apple Computer are said to be defining
their version of a low-cost Web box. The company has defined
its Pippin system, a sub-$1,000 Macintosh derivative it will
promote to OEMs, including Bandai of Japan, which is preparing
an on-line service for Pippin.

In addition, General Magic Inc. is believed to be recruiting
senior staff to bolster a plan to ride the Internet-terminal
wave by leveraging both its proprietary Telescript agent technology
and Sun Microsystems' Java.

Philips Electronics has already launched in the U.K. a CD-interactive
player with Internet access. The Dutch giant is also expected
to launch its next-generation CD-I platform this year. By using
Silicon Graphics Inc.'s MIPS-based Magic Carpet chip set, Philips's
advanced CD-I platform can take advantage of the latest Web
technologies: VRML, Java and Java-Script, co-defined by SGI,
Sun Microsystems and Netscape.

Those developments lengthen a list of plans for Internet-access
devices that already included Oracle and IBM. Database-software
vendor Oracle (Redwood Shores, Calif.) has said its partners
will launch in April versions of its Network Computer concept,
a $500 terminal that draws its computing power from new Oracle
software running on back-end servers.

Simple design

While most of those systems are still in R&D labs, ViewCall
will formally launch WEBster, a menu-driven system, this week.
The converted set-top box uses Advanced RISC Machines Ltd.'s
ARM RISC as its main processor. The system features a simple
design: one port goes into the phone jack and another into
the TV.

While WEBster gets under way this month with a trial at Northern
Telecom, ViewCall is negotiating with content providers for
partnerships. ViewCall has already partnered with U.S. Internet
infrastructure companies Netscape and Sun. And ViewCall's box
will use the browser developed by Netscape.I

Beleaguered Avant! rolls ArcCell-XO

By:
Richard Goering

Sunnyvale, Calif. - Forging ahead in spite of a civil suit from
Cadence Design Systems (San Jose, Calif.) and a continuing
criminal investigation, Avant! this week will announce ArcCell
XO, a timing-driven layout system for cell-based ICs with up
to six layers of metal. Cadence claims that the existing ArcCell
product and the new ArcCell-XO option both contain its proprietary
source code (see Dec. 11, page 1; Dec. 18, page 1)

As an option that adds area-based routing to the basic ArcCell
product, ArcCell-XO is a significant product move for Avant!,
because it places the company in what it calls the "structured
custom" segment of the cell-based layout market. This fast
growing niche, currently dominated by Cadence's Cell3 layout
tool, includes next-generation microprocessors and complex
application-specific standard products.

But ArcCell-XO is under a potential legal cloud, given that
Cadence is seeking an injunction against the sale of both layout
products. Although Cadence hopes for an "expedited" request
for injunctive relief, there are no legal barriers to the sale
of these products today, and no sign of any imminent civil
or criminal actions.

Moreover, Cadence maintains that Avant! is waging a "continued
public disinformation campaign" by making false claims about
Cell3. Cadence representatives said that Cell3 has completed
hundreds of five- and six-layer designs, and that it already
has several advantages claimed by Avant!, such as a hierarchical
database and all-path timing-driven layout.

Avant!, for its part, is continuing a "business as usual" stance,
and has provided customer testimonials for ArcCell-XO from
Alcatel and Matsushita. The company revealed that it intends
to announce a floor planner in early 1996 and an embedded-array
placement and routing tool in mid-1996, all using the same
database as ArcCell.

Conflicting claims

The Dec. 5 police search was carried out by the Santa Clara
County district attorney's high-tech crime unit. One day later,
Cadence filed a civil suit against Avant!, alleging copyright
infringement, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade
secrets, conspiracy, breach of contract and false advertising.
Avant! subsequently announced its intent to file a countersuit
against Cadence.

Of particular relevance to the ArcCell-XO introduction is an
affidavit in the Cadence civil suit from Michael LaBouff, director
of corporate CAD at Cypress Semiconductor, saying that he had
found 4,000 matching character strings between ArcCell-XO and
Cell3. "I am convinced the ArcSys product contains Cadence
proprietary information," he wrote.

Chi-Ping Hsu, vice president for product management at Avant!,
said there could be many other explanations for matching character
strings. He said that many IC CAD programs use public-domain
software from programs such as Timberwolf, and that most EDA
software uses the same license manager. "Even if you compare
Synopsys software against our software, you will see matching
character strings," Hsu said.

Throughout the controversy, Avant! has maintained its innocence,
and insisted that the Cadence suit was driven by that vendor's
loss of market share and technology leadership to Avant!.

The most significant aspect of ArcCell-XO is its addition of
area-based routing to Avant!'s repertoire. Channel-based routing,
available in ArcCell-BV (Basic Version), interconnects signal
pins lined up in rows. Area-based routing, in contrast, interconnects
signal pins throughout the die without any such restrictions.

The big advantage of area routers is their ability to handle
more than three layers of interconnect. According to Gary Smith,
analyst at Dataquest Inc. (San Jose), chips with four, five
and six layers of metal are just starting to appear, but they'll
become more and more prevalent over the next year or two. For
this reason, Cadence, Silicon Valley Research and Compass Design
Automation have all introduced area-based routers.

But area-based routers are generally harder to use than channel
based routers, and 100 percent completion can't be guaranteed.
However, Avant! foresees a gradual transition to the new technology.
Because the transition is expected to be gradual, customers
can use ArcCell-BV and ArcCell-XO in tandem. ArcCell-XO requires
the basic ArcCell product and uses the same hierarchical database.

A technology that accompanies area-based routing is quadratic
placement. Contrasted to simulated-annealing technology, which
takes a probabilistic approach, quadratic placement solves
sparse linear equations in order to find a globally optimal
solution. Cadence's QPlace product and ArcCell-XO both offer
quadratic placement.

Since several vendors now offer quadratic placement and multilayer,
area-based routing, Avant! is taking pains to portray ArcCell
XO as a technically superior solution. The company's entire
competitive focus seems to be aimed at Cell3, which both Avant!
and Cadence identify as the dominant tool in the structured
custom cell-based market.

One argument is hierarchy. "Cell3 is area-based, but it doesn't
have any concept of hierarchy in the database," said Erach
Desai, Avant! member of business staff. "It can just support
bottom-up design, while we can go top-down and bottom-up. We
can dive into hierarchical blocks and generate a complete RC
tree, while other tools will stop at the boundary of the macro."

Not so, responded Tom Katsioulas, director of marketing for
placement and routing at Cadence. "We have a hierarchical database
through Preview [floor planner] and Cell3. It allows you to
partition the logical hierarchy and at the same time do physical
partitioning."

Avant! also claims uniqueness through its ability to put constraints
on every path, using "slack-graph" representations. That's
already present in ArcCell-BV but is especially important for
area routing, Desai said. He claimed that run-time overhead
is no more than 30 percent with constraints on every path.

Katsioulas, however, said that Cell3 has had an all-path, slack
based timing capability for over a year, and that customer
benchmarks have shown "identical" run times compared with ArcCell.

One argument Katsioulas couldn't counter is that Cadence products
such as Cell Ensemble, Cell3 and Preview use different databases.
Avant! views its single database as a competitive advantage.

Avant! claims a closer link to Synopsys synthesis tools because
it can directly read Synopsys timing models. "We do the same
and we think we do a little better, because we do it at the
floor-planning level," said Katsioulas.

Quadratic placement

Desai also said that Avant!'s quadratic placement technology
is a "third generation" version of the public-domain technology
that formed the basis of Cadence's QPlace. He said that ArcCell
XO, unlike QPlace, supports congestion optimization. But Katsioulas
argued that Cadence has significantly enhanced its own quadratic
placement technology, and he said that QPlace now supports
global and local congestion optimization.

Minimizing die size is the most pressing customer concern, and
Avant! is armed with customer benchmarks that claim area advantages
of 7 to 18 percent over Cell3. Katsioulas, however, claimed
that "Cell3 has never lost a technical benchmark to ArcCell."

ArcCell-XO is available now on Unix platforms as an option to
ArcCell-BV, starting as a $165,000 upgrade.

Employers across the board will be hiring big-time this year
-- Job outlook for '96 best ever

By:
Robert Bellinger

Wow! What a year for landing a job in the electronics industry.

No, not 1995; we're talking 1996.

While "1995 was a phenomenal year for the industry," said Dan
Spencer, principal at Spencer Search (Austin, Texas), which
specializes in the semiconductor field, 1996 "has the potential
to be even better."

Employers in semiconductors, communications and computers each
brought on hundreds, even thousands, of EEs, software engineers,
ASIC designers and RF experts last year. And employers are
telling recruiters-and EE Times-they intend to bring on still
more.

Patrick Murphy, who specializes in IC recruiting for Technical
Employment Consultants, said 1995 "was as good as it's ever
been, and 1996 will get better. Everyone's making money. I
don't see it stopping soon."

Semiconductor CEOs have told Spencer they are very bullish about
1996. Virtually all need at least 100 engineers, and the biggest
players talk in the thousands.

This is creating some fabulous news for engineers, though it
could prove costly for the employers. Signing bonuses are now
part of many hiring packages.

An RF engineer with three to five years of experience under
his or her belt might get an initial $3,000 to $7,000 upon
signing, Spencer said. And he just placed a general manager
of a $100-million division into a job that came with a $35,000
signing bonus. Many packages come with stock options and other
incentives. That's how competitive the market has gotten.

Spencer has listings ranging from DSP design engineers to CAD
development managers to ASIC design engineers to layout engineers.
Depending on the job and the title, of course, senior salaries
can routinely hit $80,000 to $100,000.

Said Technical Consultants' Murphy: "Companies are doing what
they have to."

Quite a turnaround from the early and mid-1990s.

Recruitment managers admit that the surge of hiring in 1995
caught them with their guard down.

"We thought it would be very active," said Intel's Charlotte
Wells. "But it was more active than we anticipated." Intel
brought on 10,000 people in 1995. And though Wells hasn't set
any hiring estimate in stone for '96, "it feels like we'll
have a similar year."

Katherine Fairbanks, staffing manager for Altera Corp., the
programmable-logic vendor, said corporations understand that
the "candidate pool is getting narrower and narrower. It's
a very, very competitive job market. It's getting tough to
find the number of people they need." Companies are resorting
to international hiring, expanded college recruitment and "creative"
lures to attract qualified people.

Following are openings in the chip arena.

Intel

"The greatest need is in manufacturing, for wafer fab, assembling
testing, and in board manufacturing," said Wells. Intel is
expanding its Rio Rancho, N.M., fab, opening another facility
in Washington state and needs to backfill at other sites.

Circuit design is another very active area. "There's lots of
need," said Wells, for engineers with chip-set, logic, architectural
and circuit-design backgrounds. Asked about skills sets and
experience levels, she added simply that Intel seeks people
"across the board," including fresh college graduates.

Software people with computer-science and computer-engineering
backgrounds are also in demand at Intel. In addition to openings
in Oregon, Intel has software positions in Sacramento and the
Valley.

Xilinx

Programmable-logic developer Xilinx plans to hire 400 people
in 1996, including some 260 engineers and software people,
said Ray Madorin, vice president of human resources.

"It's pretty robust" on the hiring front today, he added.

Right now, Xilinx has about 100 open requisitions, of which
65 are for technical people. The corporation, which has experienced
40 percent annual growth for the past 11 years, seeks BS/MS
EEs and computer-science people typically with four to six
years of experience. Xilinx looks at higher levels of experience
as well. "If they have experience in programmable logic, that's
gravy," said Madorin. Xilinx would like to see people who designed
FPGAs or at least worked extensively with them, who have C
C++ and synthesis.

Altera

One reflection of the hiring boom at Altera is the expansion
of the recruitment staff. At the beginning of 1995, three people
handled recruitment; today, 16 people, including outside contractors,
are scouring the country for qualified, experienced BSEEs and
computer-science people, as well as college graduates.

Staffing manager Fairbanks estimates that Altera will hire 400
people throughout 1996, some 300 of them engineers and technical
people. That's a substantial task for a company of 850 employees.

The positions open now, and over the next 12 months, include
software, design, device, product and applications engineers.
There are also needs for managers.

Design engineers should have five years' experience in high
speed CMOS design and some exposure to PLD and FPGA design.
Software engineers should know C++ and have some background
in Unix.

Cyrix

Cyrix staffing director Margaret Quinn said she has 50 open
requisitions now for engineers in all different areas of the
Richardson, Texas-based company.

Cyrix thinks its small size-only 400 people compared with the
vastly larger competitor, Intel-is an advantage.

Senior engineering vice president Kevin McDonough said that
engineers who've been on 300-person design teams find their
roles restricted and narrowed. They enjoy the challenge of
joining a company where the latest M1-6X86 team never got higher
than 30 people, requiring everyone to take on multiple tasks.

Generally, Cyrix looks for engineers with three to 10 years'
experience, especially ones who've been doing transistor-level
custom design and who have been working at the high-MHz level.
C and some Unix exposure are welcomed. Engineers with design
verification, circuit, logic design and ASIC backgrounds also
can apply.

Texas Instruments

The semiconductor group of Texas Instruments anticipates hiring
more than 500 experienced engineers and computer-science people
in the next year. James Mitchell, staffing director, describes
the hiring environment as a "bit more aggressive" this year
over 1995, which was a very good year.

TI doesn't see a letup ahead, either, even though the semiconductor
industry is traditionally cyclical. "We're betting on times
being good a lot longer," said Mitchell. "We're cautiously
optimistic."

One difference between 1995 and 1996 is that TI's other divisions
are doing so well that Mitchell won't be able to draw as many
internal transfers as previously. All the major groups-software,
systems and personal products-are hiring in 1996.

In demand in the semiconductor sector, of course, are EEs with
DSP experience. Texas Instruments is a digital-signal-processing
pioneer and continues to hire in this arena. "The whole world
is hiring RF and wireless engineers," Mitchell said, and "TI
is no exception." Any RF/wireless engineer who seeks a lower
cost of living might check out the Dallas area, he added. The
cost of living index is as much as 40 points below that of
Silicon Valley.

IBM Microelectronics

At IBM Microelectronics, "this will be the most significant
hiring year since the late 1980s," said Jack Sinnott, vice
president of human resources.

While 1995 was a good year, "our needs are even greater in 1996,"
he added. IBM Microelectronics plans to add 450 to 500 engineers,
about 200 technicians and 1,000 production people. About 25
to 30 percent of the hires will be experienced people, mostly
for positions as product engineers, semiconductor engineers
and marketing and sales. Within those areas, demand is high
for experienced engineers in applications, logic, system architecture
and manufacturing and equipment engineering.

Ground was broken on a joint-venture fab in Manassas, Va. Other
locations are expanding.

Late News: Intergraph to spin out EDA unit



Huntsville, Ala. - Intergraph Corp. has decided to spin out
its EDA business into a separate company and will make an announcement
this month, industry sources said. Company representatives
would not comment but did not deny the reports.

The company presumably will market the VeriBest line of synthesis,
Verilog simulation and pc-board CAD tools sold by the Intergraph
Electronics division. Headquarters is expected to be in Boulder,
Colo. and be mostly owned by Intergraph.

A separate company will provide more independence and autonomy
for Intergraph's EDA software business, which is a small portion
of its total revenue. In 1994, according to Intergraph sources,
EDA software generated $28 million in revenue, while Intergraph
Corp. totaled about $1 billion.

Dataquest analyst Gary Smith said that Intergraph has been considering
such a spinoff about a year. While the company has had a rocky
history in EDA, that sector performed well in 1995, Smith noted.
One of the company's strengths is its recent emphasis on Windows
NT and on "scalable" software that runs across different hardware
platforms.

Intergraph sells both hardware and software and provides architectural
and mechanical CAD solutions. The company developed pc-board
CAD software in the 1980s and purchased the bankrupt Dazix,
the remnants of the Daisy Systems-Cadnetix merger of 1990.

Late News: DVD player aims at pay-per-view



Los Angeles - Zoom TV, a startup backed by Circuit City and
founded by a group of lawyers with strong ties to Hollywood
studios, is making progress developing a DVD player designed
for rental purposes (see Aug. 28, page 8)

Motorola is reportedly working on the chip set for the player.
The box is expected to be marketed by Circuit City. The player,
with a key and built-in modem, is designed to play back encrypted
disks on a pay-per-view basis.

Circuit City officials would not comment either on the company's
deal with Zoom TV or on manufacturing sources for the DVD player.

Last week, observers speculated that Flextronics International
a contract manufacturer headquartered in Singapore and San
Jose, Calif.-won the the deal for product design and manufacturing.
Circuit City chairman Richard Sharp sits on the Flextronics
board. A Flextronics spokesman would not comment.

Late News: Telecom-reform legislation stalls



Washington - Prospects for completing telecom-reform legislation
by year's end faded late last week, as congressional conferees
and the White House remained at odds over broadcast-ownership
rules and the fate of an Internet anti-smut provision.

Senate sources said that the bill was as good as done, but House
members insisted no deal will be reached until bill backers
can round up enough signatures on a conference report. Negotiations
could extend to the end of January or longer, observers said.

There was also last-minute jockeying on the cyberporn provision,
as conservatives tried to give the FCC greater oversight of
the Net. Industry groups vehemently oppose the anti-smut measure.
Some legal observers believe the measure is unconstitutional.

Late News: IBM launches high-I/O FPGA



Hopewell Junction, N.Y. - IBM Microelectronics has quietly entered
the FPGA arena, providing high-density chips with high I/O
counts.

The entry is based on intellectual property developed at Concurrent
Logic and licensed by IBM, industry sources said. Thus, like
the Concurrent offering, the new FPGAs are not only SRAM-based
but also reconfigurable on the fly. This means, for instance,
that a processing pipeline can be reconfigured as data moves
through it, permitting one chip to implement various processing
elements at different stages in a task. The Concurrent FPGAs
were also unusually rich in flip-flops and next-neighbor interconnect,
adapting them to very efficient implementation of pipelines.
IBM is believed to have preserved this feature.

The first IBM offering, which is now in beta release, is reportedly
a 16,000-gate device with an unusually high 448 signal I/O
pins. It comes in an IBM 624-pin plastic BGA.

Sources indicated that IBM has used basic concepts from the
Concurrent architecture but made important changes to the implementation,
increasing the I/O capability.

The company plans to reach full production this year. Its tool
strategy includes use of Cadence Figaro for back-end design
and conventional gate-array tools for design capture and simulation.

Late News: Corrections



In "Superscalar's rocky four-way street" (see Dec. 15, 1995,
page 4), it was stated that the Advanced Micro Devices K5 processor
has been dropped. That is not correct. The K5 has been delayed
but is still planned for release. It was the K6, the successor
to the K5, that was dropped.

In "Minc buys IST in FPGA synthesis push" (see Dec. 18, page
18), Dataquest was quoted as estimating Minc's revenue at $1
million. Dataquest analyst Gary Smith later updated that to
$8 million.

In "IBM shows multipoint video via the Net" (see Dec. 11, page
16), IBM's collaboration was entirely with Argonne National
Laboratory, not with Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Late News: Sanyo pickup reads DVDs, CDs



Tokyo - Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. has developed an optical pickup
for digital video disks (DVDs) that can read both compact and
DVD disks. An LCD shutter changes the numerical aperture (NA)
for backward compatibility with the CD standard.

Sanyo offers yet another approach to backward compatibility
from the 4.7-Gbyte DVDs to the 640-Mbyte compact disks. Earlier,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said it would employ a hologram
enhanced pickup to ensure backward compatibility and Toshiba
said it would use two pickups that could be electronically
switched depending on whether a DVD or CD disk was in the player
or drive.

Sanyo uses a 635-nm laser with 5-mW power, with a numerical
aperture of 0.6, to focus on the DVD disk. Sanyo will sample
in March and go to volume production in August.

When it reads a CD disk, the pickup physically moves 0.2 mm
closer to the disk, and the LCD shutter behind the lens sharpens
the focus by trimming the outer edges of the beam. At that
point, the NA changes to 0.35 and the laser power at the surface
is reduced to about one-third, said Tateo Toyama, general manager
of Sanyo R&D.

Late News: Intel pulls back on 486 CPUs



Chandler, Ariz. - Essentially withdrawing from the 486 CPU personal
computer business, Intel Corp. announced last week that it
was transferring that product family to its embedded-computing
group here. In the move, some 486 products will face end-of
life status, while others will remain in active manufacturing,
but for embedded computing.

Commercial-grade SX2 and DX processors will be phased out over
the next two years. Intel will offer 486SX, DX2 and DX4 CPUs,
as well as the new ultralow-power SX.

The company said it will continue to develop CPUs for the embedded
environment and to support 486 processors in embedded applications.
Intel is working with chip-set vendors on system-level solutions
for using the 486 in embedded designs. Intel will also continue
to make military-grade and special-environment 486DX chips.

Late News: Nichia laser pulses bluish-purple light



Tokyo - Nichia Chemical Industries Ltd. has developed a laser
that emits pulsed (non-continuous) bluish-purple light of 410
nm wavelength at room temperature.

The laser uses multiple layers of aluminum, indium, gallium
and nitrogen. "We finally found a layer structure that can
emit light efficiently," said Shuji Nakamura, chief researcher
at Nichia, who first looked seriously at using gallium nitride
in solid-state lasers.

"Theoretically, this material combination can emit light from
360 nm to 620 nm. In practical terms, creating a layer structure
for 410-nm-wavelength emission was the easiest," said Nakamura.

The laser, about 1 mm2, emits bluish-purple light in 1-microsecond
pulses. Pulsation begins at 4 kA/cm2 and the maximum power
of the laser is about 50 mW.

Nichia (Anan, Tokushima) is the largest supplier of phosphor
for TV picture tubes. It announced a blue LED, which has 1
candela of brightness, in 1993.

In February 1994, Sony researchers said they had developed a
greenish-blue laser that emits a 489.9-nm-wave- length light
continuously at room temperature.

Late News: Foreign chips post gains in Japan



San Jose, Calif. - Market share for foreign chip makers in Japan
climbed 3.3 percentage points in the third quarter of 1995,
bringing foreign share to a record 26.2 percent, the Semiconductor
Industry Association (SIA) said last week.

The increase from the previous quarter marked the second-largest
quarterly jump, the SIA reported. The largest rise occurred
in the fourth quarter of 1992, when foreign share rose 4.3
percentage points.

Spread spectrum makes scene at CES

By:
Loring Wirbel

Las Vegas - Wireless Logic Inc., a three-year-old San Jose,
Calif., company founded by DSP Group veterans, will use this
week's Consumer Electronics Show as a coming-out party for
its spread-spectrum DSP and RF modular products. While initial
applications will concentrate on cordless phones based on CT
1 technologies, Wireless Logic is putting a heavy emphasis
on CES, rather than a cellular-telephone or PCS show, because
of the broad range of applications for its chip set and its
low-cost, high-volume orientation.

In simplex mode, the set could be used for simple one-way functions
such as baby monitors and cordless speakers. In duplex mode,
the set is appropriate for everything from higher-performance
cordless phones to wireless PBXs.

But Wireless Logic defies some industry wisdom by sticking with
analog-cordless telephony, improving performance with direct
sequence spread-spectrum radio methods, rather than moving
directly to a digital-cordless architecture. The company also
has elected to perform despreading at RF frequencies, rather
than at baseband, as in common spread-spectrum designs.

In fact, most features in the WL9009 chip set have been optimized
for a high-volume, low-cost alternative to the 40- to 49-MHz
bands currently used for analog cordless phones, by moving
to the FCC's unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical
(ISM) bands.

John Lee, founder and president of Wireless Logic, said that
he became familiar with several Asian OEMs in the late 1980s
and early '90s, while developing digital telephone-answering
devices for DSP Group.

OEM invitation

"It was at the invitation of many of these same OEMs that I
moved in this direction with the spread-spectrum technology,"
Lee said. The company designed a microcontroller/DSP device
for modulation and developed an RF device with unprecedented
process-gain specs.

The vice president of engineering, Dan Babitch, came from Trimble
Navigation to put together an RF design team that Lee described
as "second to none."

In early December, Wireless Logic brought in Andy Varadi, founder
of Sierra Semiconductor and Sierra Wireless, as a board member
and executive vice president. Varadi said he has been exploring
a full 3-kHz voice channel in cordless telephones for its data
transfer characteristics. Unlike vocoder compression used in
cellular phones, the Wireless Logic spread-spectrum radio preserves
the full-frequency channel of a wire-line analog phone.

"Once you have a genuine 3-kHz voice channel, you can think
about using regular wireline modems, with add-in cards or portable
motherboards incorporating something to take you from the notebook
PC port to the wireline base station," Varadi said. Lee said
that a major computer corporation, which he said he was not
permitted to identify, had just signed a development pact with
Wireless Logic to explore that application of the technology.

Varadi cautioned, however, that the company's first goal would
be to offer a broad range of chip sets and design services
for cordless markets. Data transport over in-building ISM bands
would come next, followed by in-building business-phone and
PBX applications.

AT&T digital answering machines get DSP upgrade

By:
Junko Yoshida

Las Vegas - AT&T Microelectronics is fielding a suite of low
cost system-level DSP subsystems for digital telephone-answering
systems and echo-canceling speakerphones. The products will
debut here this week at the Consumer Electronics Show.

The application-specific subsystems, based on AT&T's DSP 160X
digital signal processors, are claimed to offer consumer-electronics
manufacturers improved sound quality and flexibility, as well
as enhanced storage time and faster time-to-market.

The new DSP telephone-answering devices support such storage
devices as audio-grade RAMs (ARAMs) and NOR- and NAND-type
flash memories. AT&T has also added RCELP-a next-generation,
lower-bit-rate speech coder-and will provide support for near
full- and full-duplex speaker phones.

Digitizing the telephone-answering function enables consumer
electronics developers to "improve the sound quality, suck
more features into the system and simplify the system design
by further integration," said Ken Brizel, manager of microelectronics
consumer marketing at AT&T Microelectronics.

Brizel said system vendors increasingly expect silicon vendors
to anticipate system advancements by paving the way to higher
system integration, building more features into subsystems
and addressing nascent system applications before the demand
for them is clear. He said silicon vendors must provide a broad
selection of features from which systems companies can choose.

Brizel asserted that the DSP1605-based products offer a level
of flexibility "that cannot be seen in other chip vendors'
offerings," including the support ARAM grades A through D.
In addition to the NOR-type flash-memory support introduced
a year ago, the new solutions extend flash support to such
NAND devices as the 4- and 8-Mbit flash offerings of Samsung
and Toshiba/National Semiconductor (in each case, the 8-Mbit
flash comprises two 4-Mbit devices)

AT&T Microelectronics is also providing a host of system applications
software, including CELP+ and RCELP speech coders. The latter,
lower-bit-rate coder typically enables telephone-answering
devices to expand storage time from 16 to 27 minutes without
sacrificing speech quality, Brizel said.

Speakerphone capabilities have also been added, with both near
full- and full-duplex operation supported. The near-full-duplex
speakerphone "offers better sound quality than conventional,
analog-switch speakerphones by suppressing a person's talking
when another breaks into the conversation," Brizel said. The
full-duplex mode offers a "wide-open, digital switch quality
where one person can yell back to the other person's yelling."

Other features include variable-speed playback, which can slow
down messages without changing the tone quality, and fast forward
and rewind.

JVC to bring $2,200 camera to consumer show -- Digital video
Vegas-bound

By:
David Lammers

Tokyo - Japan's consumer-electronics companies, buoyed by strong
demand at home, will bring digital video cameras to the Winter
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. But doubts
persist about how many people in North America will spend more
than $2,000 for the acknowledged superior quality of digital
video.

JVC set out to make its digital video camera smaller, and the
design engineers there succeeded in creating the latest testament
to Japan's genius at miniaturization. While the digital video
cameras from Sony, Matsushita Electric and Sharp are light
and easy to carry, some are nearly as large as the early analog
camcorder models that were hoisted onto the shoulder.

Taking advantage of the matchbox size of the 60-minute Mini
DV cassette, JVC engineers built a video camera that weighs
but a single pound and is no bigger than a paperback novel.
Two six-layer pc boards hold 1,005 components, and the zoom
lens weighs only 1.925 ounces.

One-hand operation

With its light weight and vertical design, the JVC unit can
be held and operated with one hand (image-stabilization circuitry
is built in), and the company's marketers believe business
people will use the camera as a "digital notebook" to record
meetings. It costs $2,200 and goes on sale in the United States
in April.

Since appearing on the market last autumn, digital video cameras
have appealed because they deliver superior images and pulse
code-modulation audio, with 500 lines of resolution, better
colors and digital reduction of signal noise.

However, these first-generation systems output video to a television,
not to a computer. Sony included a "digital out/in" port on
a $4,000 model, but the other digital video cameras do not
easily connect to a personal computer. That will come later,
after the 55-member DVC consortium finishes its work on how
the IEEE's "1394" standard serial interface will be incorporated.
Until the 1394 standard is agreed upon, moving digital video
clips to a PC requires an A/V capture board.

SRAM player aims at embedded DRAM graphics

By:
Ron Wilson

San Jose, Calif. - Alliance Semiconductor Corp. will draw on
its earnings in cache SRAM, its ownership in a new United Microelectronics
Corp. (UMC) fab and its foothold in the graphics-accelerator
market to embark on an embedded DRAM program, the company said
last week.

"We believe that we are now number four in the personal-computer
graphics business, leading the pack that follows after S3,
Cirrus Logic and Trident," said Alliance vice president of
marketing Sid Agrawal. "We intend to be one of the top two
companies in graphics by 1998. To do that, we will combine
our DRAM-design and graphics-chip-design expertise."

Alliance comes by its DRAM expertise from its beginnings as
a DRAM design house, providing engineering to NMB Semiconductor
and acting as a fabless DRAM vendor itself. As the DRAM market
tightened, Alliance moved on to the fast SRAM business, where
the growth in demand has taken the company into the $200 million
range for 1995.

Ironically, the company's strategy will now take it back into
DRAMs. "We already have prototype high-density DRAMs in house,"
Agrawal said. "We will be a full participant in the market
again by the second half of 1996."

New design

Alliance is relying on a new design that Agrawal said has a
very compact die relative to that of the DRAM giants. The company
also has capacity. Alliance owns a substantial portion of the
output of one of the 0.35-micron, 8-inch CMOS fabs under construction
at UMC. This output will be used primarily for DRAM-based products,
which UMC will also have the right to manufacture and sell.
The fab comes on-line in late 1997.

But the company is not planning just to beat its head against
the commodity DRAM market. "We don't intend to ignore the mass
main-memory market-that is where the innovation gets driven,"
Agrawal said.

"We see ourselves getting market share quickly with this integrated
approach," Agrawal said. "We already have a prototype high
density DRAM. It is a relatively small matter to pull off half
the DRAM and put on logic. There are other key issues, such
as embedding testability in the logic, that we are working
on."

At least one corporate relationship will exploit the embedded
DRAM technology as soon as possible. That is Alliance's technical
cooperation agreement with 3Dfx Interactive Inc. The latter
company recently announced its multichip, but high-speed, 3
D rendering engine. Currently, the 3Dfx VooDoo Graphics chip
set requires three separate frame-buffer memories-one for graphics,
one for 3-D triangles and one for Z-buffer and texture-map
data. The separation of the memories is brought about by, among
other things, the very high bandwidth demands the chip set
places on the frame buffers.

Embedded DRAM, which can supply hundreds or thousands of bits
to the logic in each cycle, could eliminate the bandwidth problems,
permitting 3Dfx to operate from a single on-chip DRAM and perhaps
a slower external memory.

DSP solutions for videoconferencing readied

By:
Ashok Bindra

Houston - Texas Instruments Inc. has expanded a relationship
with Precision Digital Images (PDI) and IAT A.G. to secure
an early foothold in the videoconferencing market. The partners
plan to pool their hardware and software expertise to generate
low-cost, TMS320C8X-based digital signal-processing subsystems
for desktop PCs and videophones.

A reference-design platform and a manufacturing kit are being
readied based on a five-chip set that includes TI's C8X DSP
and supports the H.320/H.324 videoconferencing standards. TI
plans a midyear release for the offering.

Rick Rinehart, multimedia-DSP program manager for TI's Semiconductor
Group, said that the approach "will allow us to participate
in a big way when the videoconferencing market ramps up this
year" and will provide OEMs a low-cost path to market entry.

TI is also working with a major consumer-electronics manufacturer
in Japan that plans to introduce a C82-based low-cost videophone
for POTS (plain-old telephone service) applications by year's
end.

A recent teleconferencing study by Forward Concepts Inc. (Tempe,
Ariz.) asserts that the industry is close to achieving the
price levels needed for wide-scale acceptance of videoconferencing.
The study predicts that desktop videoconferencing will log
rapid gains starting this year and grow at an average annual
rate of 68.3 percent.

The report also looks at all the major communications options
and concludes that H.324/POTS users will dominate the videoconferencing
market.

ITU standards are being adopted worldwide to provide acceptable
interoperability, Forward Concepts president Will Strauss said,
adding that improvements in the price/performance ratio are
providing the momentum needed to drive videoconferencing into
the mainstream.

Such other communication pipelines as LANs, ISDN and cable TV
will also experience rapid growth in the next couple of years,
according to the report, which was coauthored by marketing
consultant Andrew Davis (Southborough, Mass.)

The first solution to come from the partners will be based on
the C80 and will be aimed at Integrated Services Digital Network
(ISDN) implementations. That product will be followed by a
C82-based approach for the POTS market. Next up will be a low
cost offering for basic-rate ISDN.

The five chips used in the hardware design include the C8x,
a video-capture chip, an ISDN interface or modem chip, a PDI
developed Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) interface
and memory controller, and a 16-bit codec.

PDI (Redmond, Wash.) is developing the PCI-based reference design
as well as the hardware engine, incorporating the five-chip
set, memory and software drivers. PDI president Wayne Smith
said that his company is "matching its strength with TI's to
create next-generation PC videoconferencing products."

IAT (Bremen, Switzerland) will contribute Windows application
software libraries based on H.320/H.324 videoconferencing specifications.

TI also will field a manufacturing kit, which will incorporate
all the hardware and software needed to implement the subsystem
design in an OEM system.

Sun Micro posts bright future for the Internet

By:
Larry Lange

Mountain View, Calif. - Sun Microsystems has posted on its Web
site a comprehensive study on the future of the Internet, and
the results are sweeping-predicting nearly 197 million sites
by 2005 with revenue of $185 billion.

Sun is both a pioneer and current leader of Internet technology.
In fact, Bill Joy, now head of the Java program at Sun, also
collaborated on Berkeley Unix in the 1970s, an early Internet
platform. Posted in the company's "electronic magazine," called
SunWorld, the report says growth will come in three distinct
"waves," exponentially increasing the bandwidth and population
of the Internet. London-based research group Ovum Ltd. conducted
the study.

The first wave predicted will continue to use existing switched
telephony networks and run at data rates of up to 28 kbits
second. "Currently in use for e-mail, the telephone network
can handle still images fairly well, but it will become overloaded
in the next two years as video and voice-processing applications
become more widespread," state the report's authors, John Moroney
and John Matthews. The second wave, estimated to start in 1997,
will add ISDN technology to provide low-quality moving images
and faster connect times. "But even at 64 Mbits/s, a high-quality
still image will take three seconds to be transmitted," they
add.

Third wave

Finally, the third wave, which is estimated to start in 1998,
will feature broadband capacity at 2 Mbits/s and above, to
provide broadcast-quality moving pictures and high-speed LAN
interconnections. Further broken down, wave 3a will provide
one-way high-bandwidth services, mainly to consumers using
a high-speed (better than 1.5 Mbits/s) link from the service
provider; a second link-a 64-kbit/s return channel-will connect
to a set-top box, which by 1998 will cost less than $300. Then,
around 2002, wave 3b will usher in two-way broadband connectivity.

Both network providers and content providers will shape the
Internet, the report says. The network providers will develop
from today's telephone and cable-TV companies. The telecommunications
companies already benefit from trends in the first two waves
(e-mail and low-level video-image transmission), but there
is pressure to build broadband networks to ready themselves
for the third wave.

The content companies will emerge from existing publishers,
entertainment companies and educational establishments. Content
providers stand to win the most, with 65 percent of revenue
flowing to them by 2002. "The remaining 35 percent must be
sufficient to cover the infrastructure cost incurred by the
network operators to deploy wave 3, or they will roll out the
infrastructure in a slow and patchy manner," the authors say.

By 2005, nearly 197 million sites, either homes or commercial
offices, will be connected. Commercial users will provide most
of the funds, but domestic users will form the largest group
on the wave 3a developments.

Japan pushes 12-in. wafer

By:
David Lammers

Tokyo - A handful of Japanese IC manufacturers this year will
lay the groundwork for the shift to 300-mm (12-inch) wafers,
a move that will more than double the dice yield per wafer.
But doubts persist that the wafer-manufacturing industry, already
capacity-strained on the current, 200-mm (8-inch) generation,
will be able to turn out sufficient quantities of the larger
wafers to satisfy commercial requirements.

NEC Corp., for one, is undaunted. Senior vice president Yuichi
Haneta said the company is building a pilot line for test production
of 1-Gbit DRAMs on 12-inch wafers. The $500 million Sagamihara
ULSI Center will begin processing in 1997, using e-beam and
excimer laser lithography to fabricate 1-Gbit DRAMs in a 0.18
micron process.

"My target is to begin commercial production in 1998 or 1999
with 300-mm wafers for 256-Mbit DRAMs," Haneta said. His boss,
NEC executive vice president Hajime Sasaki, claimed to be "more
conservative. My target is not 1998, but 1999, and even that
depends on having space at NEC Kyushu at that time."

Moto's plans

Motorola Inc. has stuck by its announced plans to use the larger
wafers for microprocessor fabrication by mid-1998. And at the
Semicon Japan show last month, Applied Materials executives
showed a chart claiming that seven IC makers will begin using
300-mm wafers for production within 1998. Though none of the
companies was identified by name, four were identified as Japan
based.

Applied demonstrated a "concept" machine at Semicon that processes
300-mm wafers with four process modules: chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD, or sputtering), etch
and rapid thermal processing.

Wafer manufacturers, for their part, urged caution at Semicon.
Frank Robertson, general manager of the International 300-mm
Initiative-the formal name of the not-for-profit venture recently
established by five member companies of Sematech Nov.  13, page
2)-said a wafer shortage looms this year.  He said the initiative
will propose that a working group be established among device,
wafer and equipment manufacturers to deal with the question.

Robertson said the original idea of creating a pool of wafers
for use by equipment vendors was nixed by Sematech's board
as "too expensive." Instead, the initiative will encourage
regional pools of test wafers for reuse by equipment vendors.

Veteran wafer-industry analysts Dan Rose of Rose Associates
restated his concerns about wafer supplies at Semicon Japan.
In a detailed presentation to about 150 industry leaders at
a "300-mm wafer summit" organized by Semiconductor Materials
and Equipment International (SEMI), Rose said that wafer suppliers
lack the money and engineering resources to develop the larger
wafer generation because they are still working to improve
yields on 8-inch wafers.

With a host of 8-inch fabs slated to go up in the next five
years, Rose said, the wafer industry will need to increase
the 8-inch wafer supply from 465 million square inches to 2.74
billion square inches by 2000. "To simultaneously bring up
the 300-mm generation becomes almost unthinkable," he said.

'Too early'

Referring to the SEMI target of 1999 for initial commercial
production, Rose said that "the 300-mm program is five years
too early from a funding standpoint. The device makers must
release a further tiny fraction of their margins [to wafer
manufacturers] to support the wafer supply."

Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp. chairman Tomosuke Furuno
concurred, arguing that "there should be a 12-year gap between
the [cyclical peak] of the 8- and 12-inch wafer generations.
Remember, just two years ago we suffered from price cutting,
and only now have wafer prices stabilized again."

The larger wafers also may require an epitaxial coating, raising
the price for each wafer to as much as $800 each.

Equipment suppliers at the 300-mm wafer summit argued that increased
capital is already flowing to the wafer suppliers, which are
seeing strong profits after a rough five years.

But Robertson said device manufacturers need the larger wafers
if they are to maximize throughput at new factories, particularly
since skilled manpower to build and operate fabs remains tight.
By most estimates, about 2.5 times more dice will fit on the
larger wafers.

News Briefs: Wacker to increase polysilicon output



Tokyo - Polysilicon leader Wacker Chemicals will gradually expand
production of polycrystalline silicon to about 5,000 tons a
year by 2000.

Wacker now produces about 2,400 tons at its Burghausen, Germany,
plant. About two-thirds of the output will be supplied to wafer
producing subsidiaries Wacker Siltronic GmbH and Wacker Siltronic
Corp. (Portland, Ore)

"If the current demand level continues to increase, there will
surely be a shortage of polysilicon next year," said a Tokyo
based spokesman of Wacker Chemical East Asia Ltd. Wacker had
warned of possible shortages about two years ago, but price
increases were rejected by wafer manufacturers, which had polysilicon
in stock, he said.

News Briefs: SIA predicts rise in tech licensing abroad



San Jose, Calif. - Relaxed export controls on U.S. semiconductors
are expected to speed licensing of U.S. technologies abroad.
The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said the regulations
that took effect Dec. 20 will ease controls on ICs shipped
to China, former Soviet republics and other countries for commercial
use.

The export decontrols stem from action taken by the Commerce
Department.

News Briefs: Pact paves way for U.S. digital radio



Arlington, Va. - The final obstacle to testing of a U.S. digital
audio radio system has been removed with the resolution of
an interference dispute, an industry sponsor said.

The Electronics Industries Association (EIA) filed an amendment
on Dec. 15 to its application for an experimental license that
includes an agreement specifying a test protocol with detailed
frequency coordination procedures to avoid interference with
aircraft testing during digital radio field tests. The agreement
with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(which oversees spectrum issues for the Commerce Department)
and the Aerospace & Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council
is expected to clear the way for Federal Communications Commission
approval of an experimental license.

Field testing of Eureka 147, one of seven proposed digital audio
radio systems, is expected to begin in San Francisco in February
using L-band frequencies (1,452 to 1,492 MHz)

EIA's Digital Audio Radio Subcommittee and a broadcasters group
plan to present their test results to the FCC by midyear.

Earlier disputes over testing procedures threatened to delay
field tests.

News Briefs: Orcad acquires its Japanese distributor



Beaverton, Ore. - Gearing up to serve the Japanese market, Orcad
has announced the acquisition of Intelligent Systems Japan
KK (Yokahama), its exclusive reseller since 1990. Stuart Harrington,
president of Intelligent Systems Japan, will remain as president
of the newly named Orcad Japan.

According to Orcad president Mike Bosworth, the acquisition
involves nine people. He declined to provide a dollar amount.
Bosworth said that about 10 percent of Orcad's revenue is derived
from Japan and that Japanese users account for close to 10
percent of Orcad's installed base, of around 100,000 users.

In bolstering its operations in Japan, Orcad is taking a more
aggressive role in a market that has been dominated by Unix
based tools.

"I believe there are trends in the Japanese economy that will
take the form of more Japanese companies' moving to high-value,
Windows-based systems in the future," Bosworth said.

In addition to distribution, Intelligent Systems has provided
translation services for Orcad documentation and software,
technical support and customization.

Bosworth said Orcad intends to support all PC platforms in Japan,
including those based on NEC and Intel architectures.

Tight 8-in. wafer, polysilicon supply threatens growth -- IC
materials shortage looms

By:
David Lammers and Yoshiko Hara

Tokyo - A shortage of bulk polysilicon and finished 200-mm (8
inch) wafers is almost certain to worsen over the next few
years, as the rapid growth of the IC fabrication industry outpaces
the supply-side increase from the polysilicon and wafer producers.

Semiconductor-materials industry analysts Dan Rose, president
of Rose Associates (Los Altos, Calif.), and Clark Fuhs, of
Dataquest Inc. (San Jose, Calif.), both have weighed in with
reports that detail a wafer supply-demand mismatch that will
extend through the rest of the decade.

However, Jim Glaze, vice president of technology at the Semiconductor
Industry Association, questioned whether the shortage scenarios
are too linear, i.e., failing to sufficiently take into account
the ability of the industry to adapt.

Too many dummies?

Other sources said as many as half of the 8-inch wafers are
now being used as "dummy" wafers for testing new equipment
and process lines. If the industry could cut back on the number
of test wafers, the shortages could be less severe than predicted.

"We are now experiencing the fastest wafer-production ramp-up
in silicon history, with over 80 new 200-mm wafer fabs expected
to be entering production by the end of 1997," said Rose, who
has been following the vagaries of the wafer industry for 25
years. "But wafer manufacturers have not yet mastered the technology
of producing 200-mm slices in high volumes with optimum yield."

Though the polysilicon supply is increasing, Rose predicts a
polysilicon supply shortage last ing four to five years. Dataquest
predicts that a polysilicon shortage would begin to impact
semiconductor companies' operations by the middle or end of
1996.

"The polysilicon shortage is expected to last nine to 10 months,
but this shortage should come to an end with the addition of
new polysilicon market capacity in 1997," Fuhs forecast in
a report titled "Is There a Silicon Shortage Looming?"

In addition to the polysilicon shortage, Dataquest predicts
that a shortage of 200-mm wafers will begin in 1996 and continue
throughout the decade.

Yasumoto Shimizu, who tracks the equipment and materials industries
for Dataquest Japan, said the eight companies that produce
most of the raw polysilicon-including Wacker Chemical, Hemlock
Semiconductor, MEMC, Advanced Silicon, and Japan-based suppliers
such as Tokuyama, HI-Silicon and Sumitomo Sitix-together will
increase the supply of polysilicon from about 12,000 tons in
1995 to about 13,000 tons this year. That rate is not fast
enough to forestall shortages beginning next year, he said.

Of the 11 major wafer manufacturers, nine are based in Japan,
and these Japan-based companies account for about 70 percent
of the total supply of wafers, according to the Japan Society
of New Metals.

Yields at the various wafer manufacturers-the number of usable
wafers cut from the grown ingots-are still increasing for the
200-mm wafers now coming into wide use. Rose Associates estimates
that 200-mm wafer yields per ingot are only 50 to 70 percent
that of the 150-mm (6-inch) wafer generation.

Ingot yields notwithstanding, the more basic problem is that
the production of raw polysilicon is not keeping pace with
the 20 to 40 percent growth rates enjoyed by the IC industry
in recent years.

Takatoshi Itojima, an analyst at the Yamaichi Research Institute,
said the inventory of polysilicon is tightening. "The reserve
stock of polysilicon at Tokuyama was more than three months
worth in October 1994, but over the past year it has gone down
to two months and is still declining."

A source at an industry society that includes all of the Japan
based wafer manufacturers said, "The biggest shortage is not
the wafers themselves, but the polysilicon material. That's
why the wafer manufacturers cannot make enough wafers to meet
the demand."

The source, who asked to remain anonymous, noted that an IC
fab can be built in six months, a wafer-production facility
can be brought on line in a year, but a polysilicon production
line requires a minimum of two years to build.

"We are investing to increase our wafer-manufacturing capacity,
but the commensurate increase in polysilicon capacity is not
keeping pace," said a spokesman at Shin Etsu Handotai Co. Ltd.,
the largest wafer supplier. "Some time ago, the wafer and polysilicon
manufacturers recognized the possibility of shortages developing,
and have taken some action. But whatever we have done won't
be enough for the new IC fabs coming on line next year. For
sure, the polysilicon supply will be a serious problem next
year."

Underlying the problem is a history of red ink at both the polysilicon
and wafer suppliers. A decade ago, the polysilicon manufacturers
were left with huge stockpiles. Itoshima, who tracks the silicon
industry at Yamaichi Research, said "the polysilicon business
requires big investments, but it is not very profitable. After
demand fell off 10 years ago, the price dropped drastically.
At that time, one gram of polysilicon was worth about 10 yen,
but now it is worth only 5 yen per gram."

The investment required to produce a ton of polysilicon is about
$150 million, which directly translates into an investment
of about 15 yen per gram. "Compared to the current price, it
is natural that the manufacturers are hesitating to invest,"
he said.

Because of the tight demand-supply situation, the polysilicon
manufacturers have hiked their prices by 20 percent, from 5
yen per gram to about 6 yen per gram. And the three largest
manufacturers are increasing their polysilicon output. Itojima
estimated that Hemlock (a division of Dow-Corning, based in
Hemlock, Mich.) is making about 2,800 tons a year, while Wacker
Chemical currently is making about 2,400 tons a year. Starting
this month, Tokuyama (based in Yamaguchi, Japan) has expanded
its capacity from 1,650 tons per year to 2,000 tons. All three
have plans in place to increase capacity to 3,000 tons per
year over the medium term, he added.

However, the production increases by the polysilicon manufacturers
are far less than the sharp hikes in demand for silicon wafers
required by the IC manufacturers. Dataquest estimates that
the demand for 8-inch wafers increased 112 percent in 1995,
and will go up another 72 percent in 1996 and 41 percent in
1997. "It is very difficult to decide how much capacity the
polysilicon makers should add. If the expansion is more than
actual demand, it means another period of losses," said Itojima.

Sumitomo Sitix and HI-Silicon Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi
Materials Silicon Corp., are producing polysilicon mainly for
internal use. But the other wafer manufacturers are dependent
on outside supplies from commercial polysilicon manufacturers.

Also, much of the raw polysilicon is wasted. For the 200-mm
wafer generation, only 17 percent of the raw polysilicon is
transformed into usable wafers, compared with 30 percent for
the 150-mm generation, Rose said.

Overall, however, the quick-fix solutions of improving the number
of wafers per ingot, cutting down on polysilicon waste and
using fewer test wafers, can only put a dent in a big problem,
analysts said.

Tomosuke Furuno, chairman of Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp.,
noted that the wafer industry was hit by price cuts on 8-inch
wafers just two years ago. In the early 1990s, the supply of
8-inch wafers exceeded demand, largely because Japan's IC manufacturers
delayed bringing up 8-inch lines-one consequence of the bursting
of Japan's financial bubble. The wafer manufacturers that invested
heavily in 200-mm wafer capacity suffered financial losses
for three of the past five years-1991, 1992 and 1993-according
to the Japan Society of New Metals. Even now, Rose added, Japan's
IC manufacturers are "very reluctant" to pay higher prices
for 8-inch wafers, while U.S. IC makers have been more willing
to pay the higher prices.

At a SEMI-sponsored "summit" on the transition to 300-mm wafers,
Rose argued that the wafer industry has gotten the short end
of the financial stick, investing a relatively high percentage
of its revenues in R&D and manufacturing capacity, for relatively
little financial return.

That is changing, with healthy increases for the stock prices
of many of the Japan-based wafer producers, such as Mitsubishi
Materials and Shin Etsu Chemical, whose subsidiary Shin Etsu
Handotai is the largest wafer producer worldwide. Despite investment
funds flowing to the wafer makers, Rose said he doubts that
the wafer industry can increase the supply quickly.

A shortage of engineers and other skilled technicians is straining
everyone, Rose said, and makes it difficult to increase the
wafer supply quickly even as the financial prospects of the
wafer suppliers improves.

Dataquest's Fuhs said that because of the shortage, "the silicon
industry, which has been a historically lower-margin 'industrial'
business, will migrate to a business model that more closely
resembles the other segments of the semiconductor ecosystem."

However, the prospect of severe shortages are more real for
some companies than others.

Hajime Sasaki, in charge of NEC's semiconductor operations,
said NEC has long-term supply contracts, and noted that one
of the largest wafer manufacturers, Sumitomo Sitix, is a member
of the same Sumitomo Group as NEC. Though Sumitomo Sitix will
not boost its internal polysilicon supply until early 1997,
it plans to increase the supply of 8-inch wafers by 10 percent
or more next year, said Shimizu of Dataquest Japan.

For the IC manufacturers in Taiwan that plan to open about 15
new 8-inch fabs over the next two years, the supply of wafers
has been a major concern, sources at the recent Semicon Japan
show said. Formosa Plastics and Komatsu Electronic Metals Corp.
are building a wafer-production facility in Taiwan that will
begin production in early 1997, which will increase capacity
to about 200,000 8-inch wafers per month over several years.

Shin Etsu Handotai also will build a wafer-fabrication facility
in Taiwan this year that will begin production in 1997, the
spokesman said.

Viewlogic buys Silerity

By:
Richard Goering

Marlboro, Mass. - In a new assault on the ASIC-synthesis marketplace,
Viewlogic Systems Inc. has acquired Silerity (Pasadena, Calif.),
a startup founded by Carver Mead and David Johannsen. When
Will Herman, then Silerity president, returned to Viewlogic
as chief operating officer early last year, the company said
it would buy Silerity.

Viewlogic paid about $5.6 million in cash and payments contingent
on future sales. Johannsen and Richard Doherty, another Silerity
founder, are now Viewlogic employees in the High Level Design
group. Mead, a professor at the California Institute of Technology,
will serve on Viewlogic's technical advisory board.

Last June Silerity introduced PathBlazer for data path optimization.
A supplement to existing synthesis tools, it optimizes data
paths at a high level of abstraction, using process-specific
topology information. Production-quantity shipments are expected
in the third quarter.

The ASIC synthesis market is still dominated by Synopsys Inc.
(Mountain View, Calif.). In 1994, according to Dataquest, Viewlogic
had 6 percent of the synthesis market-but its sales were primarily
in FPGA, said Gary Smith, Dataquest analyst.

Smith called PathBlazer a "great compiler" but noted that ASIC
synthesis signals a new direction for Viewlogic. One challenge,
he said, will be to generate ASIC library support.

Herman said Silerity, with five R&D people, has a lot of technology.
"PathBlazer is the main product right now, but it's only a
subset," he added. "Johannsen, Mead and Doherty have been working
on this stuff for four and a half years, and they've got a
truckload of really neat physically oriented synthesis technology."

Viewlogic, he said, will emphasize physical optimization for
deep-submicron designs.

Yakitori: The digital picture

By:
David Lammers

Tokyo - In 1983, I traveled to Sri Lanka to cover the first
wave of racial violence between the Tamils and Sinhalese. There,
I met a Bangkok-based Associated Press photographer named Jeff
Robbins, who carried a suitcase-sized photo transmitter. (At
customs, he said it was his sample case.)

Jeff hung a "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door of his hotel room,
developed each day's film in the bathroom, and transmitted
his best shots to London or Tokyo. While I was forced to dictate
my copy each night to a grumpy desk editor, Jeff was wired
in, getting front-page play in the big dailies. Our competitors
were really behind the eight ball, being forced to ask returning
tourists to hand-carry rolls of Tri-X back to London or Tokyo.

Hi-res scanner

Akinori Kiribuchi heads the electronic imaging division at Nikon
Corp., which makes a reasonably priced film scanner. The system
uses a high-resolution line sensor to transform a negative
or positive (slide) film image into a digital file. Nowadays,
an AP correspondent going out into the field is likely to carry
a Nikon film scanner and a Powerbook.

Why not simply carry a digital camera? I asked Jim Palmer, the
AP photo editor for Asia. Many digital cameras have fixed wide
angle lenses, and the CCD resolution usually is not high enough
for print reproduction, he replied. Since newspaper editors
like to splash an eye-catching photo across the front page,
they need color and millions of pixels.

So, most AP photographers shoot color negative film, and the
turnaround time isn't bad. By running the film through a portable
film processor (or taking it to a one-hour photo shop), scanning
the best images into a Powerbook and then transmitting a JPEG
compressed image back to the home office, a photographer in
the field can deliver a digital image with high resolution
in under an hour.

Of course, transmitting a compressed image directly from the
camera is faster, and Olympus Optical has a midrange digital
camera that does just that.

Some photojournalists use these digital cameras, which store
the images on flash or SRAM-based memory cards. Nikon makes
a high-end digital camera, costing about $11,000, that accepts
the range of Nikon lenses. However heavy you might find a normal
SLR camera, the digital cameras are about double that, and
they cry out for a tripod. One odd sensation is that you can
open the camera back and not ruin your "film."

Kiribuchi said that Nikon makes only a few hundred professional
use digital cameras each month. Surprisingly, the biggest market
outside of newspapers is research labs, where scientists use
the cameras to document various stages of their work-in-progress.

The sales action is at the low end, and Casio has surprised
everyone with strong sales of its QV-10 digital camera, priced
at only $500 in Japan. Many use it to post low-res images to
the Internet. Casio plans to improve the resolution and to
make the next version in Malaysia, boosting the capacity to
70,000 units/month by next summer.

Kiribuchi said Nikon plans to come out with a complete line
of sub-$1,000 digital cameras early this year. Until yields
on the CCDs-now in the 10 percent range-improve, digital will
have a hard time competing with silver-halide-based photography,
he said. Nevertheless, Nikon predicts that by 2000, about 10
percent of PC buyers will also purchase a digital camera, producing
a market of more than 10 million cameras. This year will probably
be the one in which digital still cameras add their spice in
a big way to the multimedia recipe.

Davic seeks modem spec

By:
George Leopold

Washington - With work complete on set-top and interactive-TV
standards, the Digital Audio Visual Council (Davic) is shifting
gears to tackle cable modem standards. The group wants to nail
down modem and other new specs by June in conjunction with
a cable-industry effort.

Davic completed its first interoperability framework in Berlin
on Dec. 16. After final editing, copies of the Davic 1.0 specification
will be released to the group's 205 member companies in mid
January. The spec sets global standards for a range of digital
interactive services and will be updated frequently.

But Davic members said the rise of the Internet during their
year of deliberations has prompted them to make high-speed
cable modems one of the group's highest priorities over the
next six months. Leading cable and equipment companies announced
a similar effort in November to be headed by CableLabs (see
Dec. 4, 1995, page 1)

Davic spokesman Robert Luff, chief technical officer for Scientific
Atlanta Inc.'s Broadband Communications unit, said the group
will work with CableLabs to forge cable-modem standards for
high-speed Internet access and other interactive applications.
"We all want one system, not two or three," Luff said.

He predicted chaos if modem makers roll out their own solutions.
"We truly want one set of interfaces." The group has scheduled
a June meeting in New York to complete the spec.

Davic also called for standards proposals for satellite return
channels, a protocol stack for return channels, wireless modulation
schemes, application and system software portability, and security
specs. Most will be used for Davic 1.1.

Another request seeks proposals for 3-D animation, higher- quality
video and sound, modulation schemes for terrestrial VHF/ UHF,
distributed servers and services, high bandwidth interactive
audio-visual communication, home networks, content acquisition
and production, and multimedia mobile wireless systems.

Editorial: Copy right

By:
George Leopold

A NEW WAVE OF consumer products built around digital video disk
technology will surface in Las Vegas this week at the Consumer
Electronics Show. Semiconductor makers will scramble to capture
other consumer-electronics design wins there as well, notably
in multimedia subsystems and all-digital communications platforms.

But design wins and systems developments alone won't assure
the dawn of the digital consumer age. Still needed are answers
to the question of how to protect the video and other digital
content the new products will deliver.

The intellectual-property aspects of emerging digital media,
particularly copyright protection, are potentially divisive
issues that could derail efforts here and abroad to develop
a seamless delivery system for digital video and other multimedia
services. Some view issues of security, licensing and liability
as an opportunity; others consider them a potential spoiler.
Either way, technology-based solutions are needed soon, lest
lucrative digital technologies go the way of digital audio
tape.

A constructive approach for tackling intellectual-property management
comes from the Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA; Annapolis,
Md.). Since the summer, the group has been seeking ideas on
the requirements for technology solutions to the intellectual
property conundrum. IMA, along with the U.S. Copyright Office,
will jointly sponsor an industry forum, "Electronic Commerce
for Content," on Jan. 10 in Arlington, Va., to make some headway
on copyright and other issues.

We endorse IMA's inclusive approach for confronting the digital
copyright issues that must be resolved in the months ahead.
Getting the key participants into the same room can only speed
development of workable solutions.

How can Hollywood and equipment manufacturers bridge their differences
on anti-copying devices? How can U.S. and international copyright
laws be fine-tuned to speed the transition to electronic commerce?

The answers will help determine whether digital video disks,
digital VCRs, camcorders and other content-dependent devices
successfully become the next generation of consumer electronics.

Crosstalk: Bill Gates running in the wrong direction?



In response to Richard Wallace's "PC incorrect" editorial (see
Dec. 11, 1995, page 34), most PC users today do not know that
in the mid-1970s, Bill Gates's own greed, after his departure
from M.I.T.S. in Albuquerque, ruined the Altair 8800 for the
computer hobbyists.

Now Bill Gates's own greed is ruining the image of the Internet
for everyone.

With the one-chip (with built-in intelligent browser) home TV
top connection to the Internet on the horizon and cable companies
such as TCI becoming involved, the Internet is almost at everyone's
doorstep.

Luckily, Bill Gates's Microsoft (and Netscape) are now running
in the wrong direction. Pity their poor investors/shareholders.

The right direction is to install a built-in "turnkey consumer
friendly intelligent Internet browser," which need not rely
on the consumer entering URLs. Instead, it would allow the
consumer with an Internet terminal atop his/her TV to enter
a search string such as, "Show me all the car dealers in the
Baltimore area that have used green mini-vans with cloth seats
in stock."

URL-driven browsers will be dinosaurs.

Good luck, Bill Gates.

Crosstalk: Immigrants not the issue; job export is



In response to Bob Bellinger's "Professional Pipeline" column
titled "Friends" (see Dec. 11, page 100), I would like to bring
to your attention an even greater challenge to the American
engineering profession: The problem is not the use of immigrant
labor in the United States, but rather the use of high-tech
labor overseas, where the wages are even lower. Instead of
having capable Americans develop software, companies such as
GE and, more recently, the GE-Harris Railway Venture Co. have
been farming out the software to a consulting company in India.
Japan's cost of living is too great, so these Third World countries
are of paramount importance to the American-business greed.

For about $17 an hour, the American companies levy the software
requirements, and the software gets developed in these sweatshops
overseas. That not only undercuts the American EE wage but
also is a grim foreboding of the future for American technology.
What type of NAFTA agreements apply to software? Surely this
is not fair to the loyal American worker, nor to the Indian
EE who is not getting $17/hour-more like $5/hour.

Engineers of the late '90s may go the way of the steel workers
of the '70s. I can only hope that when my two-year-old gets
older, he does not choose engineering as a profession, like
I did.

Crosstalk: Amiga 1000 demos high-resolution flicker



I read in George Leopold's story titled "PC makers: DTV spec
doesn't scan" that the FCC officials asked for a demonstration
that "high-resolution text and graphics cannot be read clearly
on interlaced sets" (see Dec. 18, 1995, page 1). I couldn't
believe my eyes. The demonstration product was available 10
years ago: the Amiga 1000. I know, I suffered through it for
years: high-resolution text on an interlaced screen. No high
tech demo is needed; just look at an Amiga 1000 on a good monitor
(I used a high-resolution Sony Trinitron monitor) in "hi-res"
mode, and you will hate the flicker. They must avoid this at
all cost.

All-CMOS imaging challenges CCDs

By:
Chappell Brown

Pasadena, Calif. - Charge-coupled device (CCD) technology has
long held a comfortable niche as a low-noise imaging architecture
that has stayed ahead of the price curve of competing approaches.
But that entrenched position is increasingly threatened by
an all-CMOS imaging technology. Called active pixel sensors
(APS), the devices promise to take electronic imaging to price
performance levels that could someday leave CCDs in the dust.

Eric Fossum, who presented a road map for APS at last month's
IEDM conference, is so confident of the technology's promise
that he's forming a startup to commercialize an APS approach
he has been developing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "Active
pixel-sensor technology is highly appropriate as a next-generation
camera technology," Fossum said. "By integrating camera functions
with a light-sensing operation, APS offers far more functionality
than CCD technology and could lead to a rugged, low-power camera
on a chip."

While CCDs enjoyed brief popularity as a specialized memory
type for early VLSI generations, integration and scalability
issues soon forced the devices out of the running. But the
technology has long been widely valued for its utility in imaging
applications. When operating purely as an image sensor, CCD
chips offer superior low-noise performance and can be manufactured
in standard silicon processes.

A single CCD is essentially a MOS transistor, though with an
extremely long channel that spans the entire chip. By placing
a row of metal gates over the channel, an array-type memory
device is created. A localized packet of electrons under one
of the gates can be shunted to the next gate via a simple clocking
operation. Thus, charge packets, which could represent bits
in a shift register, can be read out on the side of the chip.

When each metal gate stores charge from a phototransistor, the
long MOS transistor can operate as a line in an image. Photons
striking the silicon generate charge packets proportional to
the light intensity, and a row of the packets can be read out
on the side of the imaging chip.

Yet, despite its simple architecture and good noise performance,
CCD technology has some inherent disadvantages that won't improve
much with scaling. The charge-transfer operation requires particularly
high voltages, leading to high power consumption, and the analog
output signal requires A/D conversion chips. And because of
their dimensions, CCDs cannot be integrated with standard CMOS
VLSI circuits to achieve the scaling and on-chip processing
advantages of standard IC technology.

That is precisely where such newer schemes as APS derive their
leverage.

One factor in favor of APS is CMOS technology's high level of
available integration. In the current Jet Propulsion Lab design,
each pixel packs six transistors, which condition the signal
and implement row-column addressing. Because the array of pixels
is essentially a CMOS circuit, additional A/D circuitry can
be incorporated.

The approach also opens the door to any other type of digital
processing functions available with CMOS. "The sensor is able
to do much more than record an image; it becomes a fully functional
camera," Fossum said.

Most promising for consumer electronics is the low power and
ruggedness offered by APS cameras. "Because you no longer have
additional A/D-conversion components and the sensor itself
runs off of standard CMOS power supplies, you get about a factor
of 100 reduction in power consumption," said Fossum. As a result,
the new chips will be ideal for portable applications. NASA
is also eyeing the technology for remote robotic systems, such
as the Mars rover.

The one weak point in previous attempts to build a more compatible
sensor technology has been the noise problem. In fact, the
attempt to use standard transistors in imaging chips predates
the CCD.

As early as the 1960s, many research projects sought to find
a viable imaging approach using standard NMOS, PMOS and bipolar
transistors. Those early attempts ran up against noise problems.

When the first CCD sensor was devised at Bell Laboratories in
1970, it was generally recognized to have satisfactorily solved
the noise problem. As a result, observed Fossum, "the 1970s
saw a vigorous development of CCD imaging technology and little
work on MOS sensors." He noted that a late-1970s bid by Hitachi
to develop camcorder MOS sensors eventually succumbed to the
noise problem. Hitachi was forced to modify its sensors with
CCD technology to get a viable imaging chip.

Remaining work on MOS approaches branched in two directions.
One simple method, known as the passive-pixel sensor, adds
a FET to the phototransistor to create what is known as a transfer
gate. Pulsing the transfer gate conducts photo-generated electrons
out to a bus. Adding a select transistor enables row-column
addressing of pixels.

While the passive-pixel approach suffers noise problems, its
simplicity has made it valuable in certain applications.

Work on the other branch, active pixel sensors, began with the
recognition that performance would greatly improve by including
a sense amplifier with each pixel. Fossum, working with a group
at AT&T Bell Laboratories, has achieved the same noise margins
for his devices as for CCDs.

The final improvement that moved APS technology into the CCD's
performance region, according to Fossum, involved the addition
of a CCD-type transfer operation within each pixel.

Neural-net package offers explicit learning

By:
R. Colin Johnson

Braunschweig, Germany - Combining the learning ability of neural
networks with the if-then rule creation of fuzzy logic, Nefclass
(NEuro-Fuzzy CLASSification) sports the advantages of learning
without the disadvantages of neural networks. The software
package is offered by researchers Detlef Nauck and Rudolf Kruse
at the Technical University of Braunschweig and may be freely
used for educational, scientific or personal purposes.

Nefclass attacks a fundamental problem of neural learning: After
a neural network has learned a set of synaptic weights for
a problem, its solution is incomprehensible to the trainer.
With Nefclass, on the other hand, its trained weights can be
linguistically interpreted as fuzzy rules, such as "If the
temperature is very hot, then turn on the air conditioner."
Also unlike neural networks, which must be initialized with
a random set of weights, Nefclass can be initialized with a
premade set of if-then rules-of-thumb, which learning then
fine-tunes.

"The advantage of incorporating fuzzy logic into our neural
network model is the interpretation of its internal structure
in the form of linguistic rules, some of which can be specified
ahead of time," said Nauck. "For instance, sometimes simple
rules for extreme cases are known in advance, such as 'If all
values are small, then it's class X.' "

Nefclass fuzzifies the traditional perceptron-style neural network
by learning fuzzy rules directly from raw data. The supervised
learning method uses a fuzzy version of back-propagation-of
errors. After training, Nefclass classifies patterns into crisp
sets.

Technically, Nefclass is a three-layer back-propagation neural
network specifically designed to apply to the controller domain.
By substituting fuzzy rules with weighted antecedents for its
middle layer of neurons, Nefclass persuades the neural network
to learn fuzzy rules.

Membership functions

Crisp inputs are fuzzified into fuzzy sets by membership functions
that are usually labeled with linguistic terms-such as small,
medium and large. The weighted outputs of the membership functions
serve as the antecedent (if-parts) of the if-then fuzzy rules
on the middle layer of the perceptron.

Nauck and Kruse also suggest that partial knowledge about the
patterns to be classified-usually the bane of recognizers-can
easily be encoded in linguistic rules. Learning then resolves
the incompleteness of partial knowledge during the learning
process.

As a further refinement, weight changes for parameters are accepted
more readily in the middle of the fuzzy interval (0.5) than
for those near 0 or 1. "By this, a rule is 'forced to decide'
whether it wants to support a pattern or not," Nauck said.

Nefclass only allows fuzzy values between 0 and 1, because they
can be interpreted as degrees of support for a rule-from 0
percent to 100 percent. Negative values are not allowed, because
there is no clear linguistic interpretation to a negative weight.

Nefclass can also graphically display charts and two-dimensional
projections of patterns. The package is available for DOS personal
computers at: http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/~nauck.

Neural simulator harnesses multiprocessors

By:
R. Colin Johnson

Erlangen, Germany - Erlangen University has translated into
English its NeuroGraph simulation environment for neural networks,
which features plug-in support for fuzzy logic and genetic
algorithms. Unlike monolithic simulators, NeuroGraph was designed
from the bottom-up for multiprocessing by using separate independent
modules for all functions. Both its data structures and function
libraries support parallel execution on multiple processors
using either message-based or shared-memory communications
schemes.

"The most unique feature of NeuroGraph is its multiprocessing
support," said Stuart Bar-On, president of the Parallel Performance
Group, which is marketing a commercial version of NeuroGraph
in the United States. "If you have access to other workstations
on your network, for instance, you can really accelerate neural
learning and other time-consuming tasks by running them on
several processors simultaneously."

Both the learning step during system development and the later
pattern-recognition steps of a finished application can be
run in parallel on distributed nets of uniprocessors using
message-passing, or on a local multiprocessor. Alternatively,
finished applications can be compiled into standard C programs
for sequential execution on most platforms.

The main control process within NeuroGraph is its project manager,
which responds to user directives by starting, stopping and
supervising all other processes. Every process can be configured
and administered by the user with graphically oriented controls
that track execution dynamically.

Huge nets

Very large neural networks are defined with special multiple
placement operators, which clone the user's placement of individual
elements as well as create hierarchical structures, such as
networks. Extremely complex elements can be drawn as 3-D multiple
sided surfaces-such as polyhedrons-which can be rotated to
reveal their many variable parameters. Built-in folding and
zoom functions also assist in the visualization of huge neural
networks.

Fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms are supported with special
processes. The former process permits fuzzy logic to be used
in the definition of any active element. The latter process
permits users to specify evolutionary principles for the optimization
of network topologies.

Any element can be tracked dynamically with software sensors.
Such sensors connect elements to virtual output devices, such
as line, bar or pie-charts, each displaying the current state
of internal variables in a separate sensor window.

Once functions are created for the chosen network topology,
all relevant information about the architecture is routed to
a master data structure. The project manager can then split
the execution of the data structure among available processors
in a manner transparent to the user and the application. A
communications process ensures the synchronization of parallel
executing functions, under the supervision of the user. Data
exchange among processes can either be performed in a shared
memory area or with messages passed over any TCP/IP-based network.

As new media becomes prominent, redundant arrays of independent
disks asked to do more -- RAID designers assault bandwidth

By:
Terry Costlow

Users of redundant arrays of independent disks, regardless of
RAID type, are all clamoring for more bandwidth. The demands
on RAID are mounting as the technology gains market acceptance
and adapts to changes in the types of data being stored in
networks and other bandwidth-hungry environments.

"As new media types become more prominent-Internet, the Web,
graphical information, video clips-bandwidth is becoming more
and more of an issue," observed RAID product manager Peter
Jones at Micropolis Corp. (Chatsworth, Calif.). "People with
traditional types of data are usually looking at the number
of people they can support, and they want lots of I/O.

"With more graphical data, there's more focus on bandwidth and
how to sustain data so you deliver images in a timely fashion."

Within a couple of years, observers say, a new segment of users
will embrace disk arrays. Disk drives are becoming the storage
medium for video-on-demand systems, storing movies that can
be called up on a whim by people in hotels, on cruise ships
and even in some homes.

"One of the big areas for change is in RAID for video servers,"
said Dennis Waid, president of Peripheral Research (Santa Barbara,
Calif.). "[Such servers are] really pushing the technology
because of the bandwidth requirements. They need sustained
rates of 1 to 2 Mbytes/second per stream, even when they're
using MPEG-2. When you get 30 or 40 streams for the same title,
that puts a lot of requirement on the bandwidth."

"We're finding that there's quite a bit of usage in medical
applications," said Ron Englebrecht, director for OEM RAID
products at Symbios Logic (Wichita, Kan.). Such applications,
he said, "use RAID mostly to get bandwidth. The resolution
of their images is fairly high, and in some applications, there
are lots of them."

As those changes occur, the rapid rate of change in disk drives
is forcing both RAID and subsystem designers to think about
bandwidth as well. Drive technology is moving forward at rates
as high as 70 percent to 80 percent per year, making it impractical
to stick with the 20-Mbyte/s rate of the basic SCSI interface.

"Drives are getting a lot faster," said Tom Lavan, storage business
manager at Dell Products (Austin, Texas). "Head/media rates
are going beyond 10 to 20 Mbytes/s."

Advanced technology

Two avenues to higher bandwidth are being pursued: use of advanced
drive technology and use of faster data channels to link arrays
to the host. At the same time, the disk drives within the box
are changing. Capacity is going up, of course, as is drive
speed. But RAID designers are looking for other factors to
increase their edge.

"In the past year, we have switched 100 percent away from using
5,400-rpm drives. Now we use 7,200-rpm drives exclusively,"
said Englebrecht of Symbios. "It's amazing how quickly that's
changed: People used 3,600-rpm drives for years and years,
then went from 4,800 to 5,400 to 7,200 rpm drives in just a
couple of years. We hear 10,000-rpm drives will be available
next year. I guess when they're available, we'll start using
them pretty quickly."

But faster spinning drives can bring problems, depending on
the environment. Spinning anything faster takes more power
and creates more noise. Sound might not be much of a concern
for some servers, but for those located in office environments,
it can be a problem.

"When we look beyond capacity and speed, we're looking at drives
for system cooling and audible noise," Dell's Lavan said. "Some
customers in Europe are very sensitive to that. In Japan, noise
is also more of a concern."

Noise and thermal concerns are often intertwined. Most RAID
systems need fans, since there are multiple drives in the enclosure.
The noise of the fan, coupled with the noise of half a dozen
or more drives, can easily become annoying if the drive is
located near someone's desk. Sound is obviously less of a concern
when drives are located in a back room.

The special requirements of video put further pressure on drive
designers, Waid said. "When you're using MPEG-2, you've got
a very high compression rate. You need a very high-performance,
reliable drive because of that compression rate. If you miss
a compressed bit, it can make a big, big difference."

Even as drive designers fine-tune their already lofty reliability
levels, their designs are absorbing some of the functions that
historically have been handled by RAID controllers. Drives
are getting smarter; many now perform the XOR command that
is central to any RAID controller.

"In 1996 and '97, a lot of capability is going to go onto the
disk drives," said Said Rahmani Kherzi, vice president of R&D
at Pathlight Technology Inc. (Ithaca, N.Y.). "They will be
able to do XORs and other functions. You'll still have adapter
cards that are doing a lot of jobs, but a lot of additional
functionality will be on the disk drive."

That can even have an impact on the available bandwidth. "Doing
the XORs in the drive's buffer instead of in the RAID controller
lets you make fewer transfers over the bus," said Jones of
Micropolis. "That alleviates some of your needs from a bandwidth
point of view."

With drives retrieving data faster, arrays adding more drives
to get higher capacities and hosts crying for more data, larger
pipes between the RAID box and the host are essential.

Designers can pursue one of two routes to get higher bandwidth.
They can stick with parallel SCSI by shifting to UltraSCSI,
which doubles the data-transfer rates of the fast and wide
SCSI interfaces that have been in use for the past few years.
Or they can turn to one of the new serial interfaces: the Fiber
Channel Arbitrated Loop or the Serial Storage Architecture
(SSA)

Going to serial interfaces gives engineers higher speeds, more
flexibility, more functionality and simpler cabling. But sticking
with parallel SCSI lets designers use existing software and
cabling, and it's generally cheaper, since the volumes are
far larger.

UltraSCSI can move data at up to 40 Mbytes/s with a 16-bit version
that's available today. A faster version will double that,
to 80 Mbytes/s for the 16-bit versions and 40 Mbytes/s for
8-bitters.

Fiber Channel has bandwidth of up to 100 Mbytes/s, though some
vendors say it can go to 200 Mbytes/s if the proper configuration
is used and commands are sent the right way. SSA currently
has only a 40-Mbyte/s bandwidth. But it has features, such
as spatial reuse, that enable a properly configured SSA architecture
to match the performance of Fiber Channel despite the bandwidth
gap, SSA proponents contend.

Dicey trade-offs

The high-bandwidth needs of RAID complicate the design trade
offs. In some instances, designers working with video data
are sticking with parallel SCSI. And some with traditional
data bases that have little video are moving to serial links.

For example, PC maker Dell has little video data in most of
its server storage systems. But the company has opted to combine
RAID and a serial interface-specifically, SSA.

"One intriguing aspect of SSA and RAID that people are investigating
is putting multiple initiators on the same loop," said Dell's
Lavan. "There is an additive bandwidth effect if you put another
initiator, or controller, in the loop. "

The obvious link between high-bandwidth serial links and increasingly
larger and faster disk arrays is spurring an increase in the
number of RAID vendors in the marketplace. One that plans to
join the pack later this year is Pathlight, an early supplier
of SSA adapter cards. The company has decided that the two
technologies are so closely intertwined, it doesn't make sense
not to meld them.

"The reason we're convinced that we have to support RAID is
that SSA provides a number of features that are useful in RAID,"
Rahmani said. "One of those is multiple initiators. Another
is that with SSA, you can have concurrent transactions occurring
at the same time. An adapter card can support 220 commands
to multiple drives, and then those drives can queue up those
commands so they're continuously performing reads and writes."

But not everyone is convinced that serial links are the answer
for designers who are working on short-term products. Micropolis
is a proponent of SSA, and much of its emphasis in the past
two years has been in video applications. The company has developed
video disk drives and has moved beyond storage subsystems to
create video servers that include personal-computing technology.
But Micropolis isn't sold on serial links for the near term.

"You've got high bandwidth with UltraSCSI and PCI," noted Jones.
"You can put several UltraSCSI channels on PCI and use a lot
of the bandwidth of PCI."

DESIGN TECHNOLOGY ROI: The strong get stronger

By:
Ron Collett

A fundamental restructuring of the electronics industry is under
way that will give the semiconductor industry unprecedented
power. Among the drivers of the shift is the serious shortage
of engineers, especially those who can design and implement
very complex ICs and ASICs. Companies fighting for the limited
pool of talent are offering sign-on bonuses, enlisting squads
of headhunters to raid competitors, boosting salaries and often
throwing in chunks of equity to sweeten the pot. That is creating
tremendous instability within engineering organizations, as
they face the prospect that key engineers may suddenly pick
up and leave if a better opportunity comes along.

Instability translates to higher risk. It becomes virtually
impossible to meet development schedules and take on increasingly
challenging projects.

To cut their risks, companies that might otherwise have taken
on in-house development of a complex ASIC may instead opt for
an off-the-shelf chip. In many instances, they will sacrifice
some system-level functionality or performance in the process.

On the other hand, systems companies that can promise high-volume
shipments or provide some intellectual property to a semiconductor
supplier will be in a position to persuade the chip supplier
to implement chips for them. Likewise, semiconductor companies
will aggressively court systems companies as chip-development
partners.

Semiconductor companies that have fabs will be under enormous
pressure to put more designs through their fab to recoup their
huge investments. They need the architectural knowledge that
exists within systems companies, whereas systems houses need
the silicon-implementation knowledge that chip makers possess.
That dynamic will strengthen the semiconductor industry as
it gathers more intellectual property and pumps out more designs.
The labor shortage, coupled with the increasing complexities
of chip design and the pressure to "feed the fabs," will force
systems companies and semiconductor houses to work together
as never before.

The semiconductor industry is getting more powerful in other
ways. New suppliers, many of them spun off from established
vendors, spring up every month. The semiconductor content of
electronic products is clearly on the rise. In 1995, the semiconductor
industry's revenue reached about $140 billion, up 40 percent
from the year before and almost 100 percent from two years
ago. Chip vendors are developing application-specific standard
products (ASSPs) at an unprecedented rate, capturing more of
the value-added that has been the traditional province of the
systems industry. The systems industry, meanwhile, is leveraging
the semiconductor companies' chip-implementation prowess.

Many companies hope the EDA industry will soon introduce tools
and methodologies that will improve productivity and ease the
difficulties of designing highly complex ICs and ASICs. In
short, they're hoping for a miracle.

But no such miracle is likely this century. Design will only
get tougher, especially given the increasing dichotomy between
the silicon knowledge necessary to implement deep-submicron
based chips and the higher-level abstractions at which designers
must work. That will play into the hand of the semiconductor
industry, because its very existence depends on its ability
to implement complex chips. It will invest whatever is necessary
to survive; it simply has no other choice.

The systems industry, for its part, has a crutch on which to
lean: the semiconductor industry.

Clara, Calif.), a management consulting firm that advises suppliers

INDUSTRY GADFLY: Customer's choice awards

By:
John Cooley

Last summer, we had an informal meeting of the Users Society
of Electronic Design Automation (USE/DA) at a restaurant in
Silicon Valley. Mixed with the industry gossip and issues of
the day was talk of the Phil Kaufman Award-given to an individual
or team that has significantly contributed to a technology
advancement in the EDA industry. This got us to thinking of
who we would recognize from an EDA-user viewpoint. Here are
11 individuals we as customers appreciated:

 Yatin Trivedi and Larry Saunders of Seva Technologies for going
through all the technical and political hells involved with
publicly benchmarking commercial Verilog and VHDL simulators.
These guys took a lot of flack from the EDA vendors who had
simulators that didn't "win."

 Steve Schulz of Texas Instruments for his work as a VHDL "evangelist"
and for going through all the politics needed to get ASIC foundries
and EDA vendors to create the desperately needed VHDL libraries
via the Vital standard.

 Venk Shukla of Cadence Design Systems and Bill Fuchs of Simucad
as two very active "generals" in the Open Verilog International
"army" who not only defended Verilog from the big VHDL push
but also increased Verilog's market overall. Attendance at
the International Verilog Conference (IVC) went in three years
from 213 in 1992 to a record 510 in 1995.

 Wally Rhines of Mentor Graphics for saving a seriously ailing
Mentor, thus saving all the Mentor-related wisdom, experience
and investments that many design teams and engineers spent
years acquiring.

 Alain Hanover of Viewlogic for pioneering the "EDA for the
masses" concept by having the first large EDA company to promote
EDA tools on DOS and Windows running PCs.

 John Sanguinetti of Chronologic for pioneering high-speed Verilog
and for making Verilog a truly "open" language by helping break
Cadence's monopoly on Verilog simulators.

 Bob Dahlberg of Synopsys for changing the Synopsys culture
from one of being control-oriented and litigious toward complaining
customers to one of encouraging open, frank technical discussions
with and between customers.

 John Birkner of Quicklogic and Stan Baker of PREP: for forging
a single benchmarking methodology (PREP) among 11 fiercely
competitive FPGA manufacturers to uniformly measure FPGA speed
and capacity. Before the PREP benchmarks, each customer was
completely confused because FPGA vendors had the tendency to
make absurd claims about how great their products were.

Next week, for those who happen to be in Silicon Valley, we'll
be having another informal USE/DA get-together over lunch at
Synopsys on Monday, Jan. 8. If you want to join us, you must
RSVP to jcooley@world.std.com before Jan. 5 so we can get a
head count for sandwiches. If you can't join us for lunch,
you should subscribe to USE/DA's free monthly e-mail newsletter
at useda-subscribe@netcom.com. Or, if you're a Web junkie,
try http://www.useda.org/useda.html. USE/DA's goal is to make
sure that the viewpoint of the day-to-day EDA user is represented
in places where the decisions that affect us are being made.

John Cooley is founder of the grass-roots E-mail Synopsys Users
Group, president of the User Society for Electronic Design
Automation and a contract ASIC/FPGA designer. He loves receiving
e-mail from fellow engineers at jcooley@world.std.com or call

Masterport first in series of library-development tools -- Cascade
eases IC migration

By:
Richard Goering

Bellevue, Wash. - Leveraging its silicon-compilation technology,
Cascade Design Automation has introduced MasterPort, the first
in a series of IC library-development tools. MasterPort lets
IC vendors migrate physical cell libraries from one process
technology to another.

Cascade is aggressively targeting the relatively small library
development niche because of a compelling need for automation,
said Ken Rousseau, vice president for new product development.
"The way people have been doing library development to date
is starting to break down," he said. "They need a way to collapse
the library-development cycle in order to meet time-to-market."

Rosseau said it typically takes six to nine months-and perhaps
five to 10 man-years of effort-to develop or migrate an IC
cell library today. He claimed that with MasterPort, a customer
was able to migrate a library to a new, deep-submicron process
within a few weeks, saving "an order of magnitude" in time.

MasterPort isn't Cascade's first entry into the library-development
business. Last year, the company released Compiler Development
System (CDS), a tool that generates geometry from C-language
function calls. Cascade also introduced a standalone, off-the
shelf standard cell library, targeted at multiple ASIC vendors,
in August.

MasterPort is very different from CDS, however. Instead of taking
C code, MasterPort imports GDSII and Spice data for existing
cell libraries. It then outputs revised GDSII data and annotated
Spice net-lists for the same library on a different process.

The tool is aimed at cells up to the size of flip-flops. It
doesn't have a hierarchical capability, so it's not suited
for RAMs, data paths or megacells. Cascade plans in 1996 to
introduce a hierarchical library-development tool that can
handle large geometries. In addition, a future generation of
MasterPort will include some of the C-language capabilities
now in CDS.

MasterPort contains an interface called GrafEdit, a graphical
front end for automatic constraint generation. It accepts technology
files that can be provided by Cascade or developed by the user
through a menu-driven interface. This file provides information
on the design rules, process parameters and layer mapping of
the target process.

The tool saves leaf-cell designs in a process-portable format,
so that the design is entered only once. It can then be retargeted
by entering new process parameters and design rules.

Rosseau noted that MasterPort does not use a "lambda shrink"
approach that simply scales components into smaller sizes.
Because different elements scale differently, Cascade uses
a new "point landmark" technology that can manipulate geometry
in two dimensions. "We understand the true 2-D relationship
of the points, and compact them to the best extent possible,
taking full advantage of each process rule," Rosseau said.

Cascade has applied for a patent on this technology and is beginning
to use it in the module-generation products it sells to IC
and ASIC designers.

MasterPort is available now on Hewlett-Packard and Sun workstations
for $150,000.

Briefs: Anacad improves simulation time



Milpitas, Calif.  - Mentor Graphics' Anacad subsidiary has added
another analog-simulation algorithm, integral equation method
(IEM), to its Eldo and MixVHDL simulation tool sets.  IEM claims
to accelerate simulation performance by up to 10 times compared
with traditional Spice or Newton-Raphson algorithms.

The new algorithm complements Eldo's Newton-Raphson and One
Step Relaxation (OSR) algorithms, allowing designers to use
any algorithm as needed. IEM removes previous limitations for
large, tightly coupled circuits, and promises high precision.
Scheduled for July 31, it will ship with Eldo version 4.4.1,
with Unix pricing starting at $22,000.

For more information, call (408) 954-0600.

Briefs: PADS, Viewlogic forge partnership



Marlboro, Mass. - PADS Software and Viewlogic Systems Inc. have
announced a closer technical partnership in which Viewlogic
becomes the first "level three" participant in PADS's Vendor
Integration Alliance (VIA) program.

Both companies have agreed to commit engineering resources to
further integrate Viewlogic's front-end design tools with PADS's
pc-board CAD products. Through the integration of these products,
the companies intend to develop an interprocess communications
(IPC) standard that can be used by other vendors to create
unified solutions.

In specific terms, Viewlogic's ProCapture tool is linked with
PADS PowerPCB package at a database level and has been certified
by PADS as a "level three" integration.

An integrated solution with bidirectional cross-probing was
demonstrated at the recent Design Automation Conference.

For information, call PADS at (508) 485-4500.

SPEAKING OF SILICON: The gate array strikes back

By:
Ron Wilson

Maybe it was a little early to forecast the end of the gate
array. Certainly its future is cloudy. But gate arrays are
striking back with an unexpected new weapon: FPGA-like architectures.

The traditional sea-of-gates gate array is composed not of gates,
but of identical transistor pairs. The metal masks wire the
pairs together to form gates and flip-flops. If you want a
complicated flip-flop, a wide gate or a gate with extra drive
strength, it's no problem-you just wire in more pairs of transistors.

That was great down to about 0.8-micron geometry. Transistor
performance largely determined circuit performance and interconnect
was perhaps scarce, but not actively harmful to speed or power
dissipation in most nets. But as gate arrays moved toward 0.5
 or 0.35-micron rules, everything changed. Now transistors
aren't as important as interconnect.

Ironically, this makes the problem of designing a gate-array
architecture similar to that of designing an FPGA architecture.
Logic is relatively free, but wire is everything. Not surprisingly,
gate-array designers are coming up with some of the same ideas
used by FPGA gurus.

It has been known for some time that the granularity of an FPGA
can influence both performance and density. If you make the
basic elements too small-smaller than a gate, say-the interconnect
losses become excessive and you lose performance. If you make
the logic cell too large-an eight-input function generator
and two flip-flops, for instance-you may get wonderful speed
but will waste a lot of silicon in implementation. For modern
parts, the optimum trade-off point seems to be a three-input
function generator, possibly with a flip-flop.

Two small companies, Aspec Corp. and Silicon Architects, started
taking the gate-array business in this direction about a year
ago. Both have elaborate design environments that are said
to overcome the challenges of submicron ASIC design and to
achieve standard-cell-like results. In both cases, the designs
exploit a new underlying gate-array architecture built from
multitransistor logic cells rather than transistor pairs.

Texas Instruments joined the discussion at the 1995 Custom Integrated
Circuits Conference with a paper describing its TGC3000 gate
array family, currently under development. In the TI gate array,
a logic cell contains eight "sites," each of which contains
one or two logic gates and a pair of pass transistors. Half
the sites have high-drive gates and half have pairs of low
drive gates. Thus, design software can use small transistors
for feedback paths in bistable elements, medium-sized transistors
for clock inputs or pass logic, and large transistors for critical
path drivers.

Recently, Chip Express announced that it will use a similar
architecture for its next-generation deep-sub-micron, fast
turnaround arrays.

The advantages to a logic-cell approach are numerous. By building
with larger blocks, you can implement many logic functions
with higher speed and lower power than could have been achieved
with transistor pairs. With different transistor sizes within
the cell, you can have different strengths of the same gate
without having to wire duplicate gates in parallel. And with
careful design, the cell can be made to implement SRAM more
efficiently than could a transistor pair.

All those approaches seem to yield results much better than
traditional gate arrays, nearly the equal of cell-based designs.
If they can also mask the timing complexities that render deep
submicron design so hazardous, they might begin to recapture
the business that is drifting toward standard cells. And at
the low end of the market, they threaten to beat FPGAs at their
own game.

Low power to the coax people



Tustin, Calif. - While the bulk of attention may be on twisted
pair LAN, Silicon Systems Inc. is out to prove to the coaxial
cable world that power-consumption advances are being made
for 10 Base 2 and 10 Base 5 transceivers. The 78Q8392L device
draws 50 mA when transmitting and 7 mA for line monitoring
while receiving data.

The new transceiver is a BiCMOS redesign of a custom transceiver
SSI developed for Standard Microsystems Corp. Kirk Brinkworth,
network product marketing manager at SSI, said that the company
decided to move to a low-power BiCMOS version after observing
"a huge remaining market for coaxial adapter cards in the U.S.,
Europe and the Far East. People keep predicting the decline
of coaxial cable but pushing out the date for that decline."

Since the BiCMOS device has such a low current drain compared
with bipolar or CMOS parts, SSI has made a special effort to
work with dc/dc converter makers, including parent TDK, to
develop a 500-mW power converter to use with the transceiver.
Joint marketing efforts to promote such devices will allow
PCs with a coaxial Ethernet interface to meet low-power specs
such as EPA's EnergyStar.

The transceiver includes most functions offered in 8392-compatible
devices, including receiver, transmitter, collision signaling,
collision detection, jabber timing and heartbeat functions.

SSI is offering the 78Q8392L in 28-pin PLCC, 16-pin DIP and
16-pin small-outline packages. Volume quantities are available
now. Evaluation units are offered for $2.60 apiece.

Three chips handle North American, European speeds -- Mitel
accelerates line interfaces



Kanata, Ontario - Mitel Semiconductor has introduced three devices
that meet primary-rate ISDN interface rates for North American
T3 speeds (45 Mbits/second) and European E3 speeds (38 Mbits/s)

While leased E3/T3 lines have been slow to grow, the interest
in providing primary-rate ISDN circuit services over the T3
E3 infrastructure has accelerated the need for standard silicon,
said product manager Mel Roberts.

The three new members are the MT90732 E2/E3 multimode framer,
the MT90737 multiplexer/demultiplexer and the MT90733 multimode
framer for both fractional T3 and digital cross-connect.

Line terminals

The 732 is intended for line terminals, in wideband data or
video-transport applications and in multiplexers. It can interface
to systems using NRZ or dual-rail signals, performing all framing
functions for E2/E3 line rates per International Telecommunication
Union specs.

The 733 framer operates in C-bit parity format or M13 frame
format. It can be employed in cross-connects, add/drop multiplexers
and fractional T3 systems.

The 737 performs mux and demux for 28 DS1 signals fed into a
DS3 signal, using C-bit or M13 formats. The two framers come
in 68-pin plastic leaded chip carriers, while the mux/demux
device is offered in 208-pin plastic quad flat packs.

All three chips are sampling. Prices in 100-unit quantities
start at $40.99 each for the MT90732 and the MT90733 and $235.80
for the MT90737.

Pericom graphics IC takes on video role



San Jose, Calif. - With the uncertainly surrounding personal
computer multimedia architectures, vendors can be forgiven
a certain hesitance about how to lay out their graphics systems.
Some graphics chips accelerate video, others don't. Some have
provision to share their frame buffers, others don't. Some
can handle 3-D, others exclude it.

It's understandable, then, that some vendors are allocating
a separate frame buffer to each new feature and combining the
outputs with a video switch. That avoids potential problems
with single-source chips and circumvents the arguments about
which bus should have been able to carry which data flows.

The next problem is to find a switch that can select, pixel
by pixel, between two video sources. There are some very good
analog switches out there, if you happen to have 12-V supplies
on your graphics board. And there are some pretty bad switches
available, if you are working at limited resolution and color
depth.

Pericom Semiconductor Corp. has tried to combine the virtues
in one product. The P15V330 VideoSwitch is a quad two-channel
mux/demux with a single 5-V supply, 180-MHz bandwidth and 3
 on-resistance.

In addition, the company said, the chip can handle very high
(for video) currents, and it shows very low crosstalk. Thus,
it can often be used without an accompanying video amplifier,
even at very high pixel rates.

The part is now in production. It comes in 16-pin, 150- or 300
mil plastic small-outline ICs, for $1.50 each in lots of 5,000.

DATAPORT: Crystal-ball gazing

By:
Loring Wirbel

We begin with the axiom: "Those who have a clue become design
engineers; those who remain terminally clueless become market
analysts." We apply that to the vacuous set of 1996 predictions
inside that huge stack of trade publications sitting on your
desk. After careful deconstruction of the pontifications, we
place the remnants in a Cuisinart with equal parts of eggnog
and Bailey's Irish Cream and end up with a sobering frothy
brew.

Unlike market analysts, I don't suffer from a bizarre bipolar
disorder that says you go nuts about something for 12 months,
then pan it to the high heavens. My dad always disarmed the
Apocalypse Now crowd with his observation that "the safest
short-term prediction is for more of the same, only more so."
Thus, I come up with the following 1996 scenarios.

ATM will continue its slow stumble to ubiquity, but in the WAN
first. 1996 is supposed to be the year that everyone picks
on ATM for failing to replace everything in LAN and WAN in
five years. Hey, it was obvious in 1990 that the move to a
common cell-relay infrastructure would be slow and difficult.
ATM will broaden its reach in 1996, but folks debating over
25-Mbit ATM in the local area are missing the action. ATM will
make its biggest inroads in the WAN, as a transport for Nx64
services.

Fast Ethernet and VG will show respectable growth but primarily
as a shared-media backbone. Last year, everyone went nuts about
switched LANs and assumed the 100-Mbit LANs would be used first
in switched implementation. But switched 10-Mbit LANs solved
immediate desktop bandwidth problems. The best place for 100
Mbit service is as a hub-to-hub workgroup shared backbone for
carrying switched 10-Mbit frames. Server cluster makers will
probably use Fiber Channel or SCI, not switched-100, as an
interserver link. But expect 100-Mbit PCI cards for server
and hub workgroup links to be big in 1996. Desktop 100-Mbit
cards might start to grow by year's end.

Basic-rate ISDN will continue to be spotty in implementation.
Some analysts assume that the price cuts among OEMs for ISDN
terminal adapters will force the regional Bells to get brains.
Oh, PacBell and Southwestern Bell and maybe the BA-Nynex cluster
will show glimmers of intelligence but will be personnel-limited
in ISDN provisioning. Ameritech, U S West and others will gallumph
along in terminal stupidity, ignoring ISDN and trying to push
caller ID to the world. Duh.

IsoEthernet will not die. Good ol' National Semiconductor kept
pushing isochronous Ethernet after pundits said it didn't have
a chance. IsoEnet has 96 circuit-switched B channels. If the
MCI tests prove even halfway-decent, IsoEnet could see a midyear
renaissance.

PCS and digital cellular will grow, but there will still be
a bloodbath (see my previous column's comment about elephants
in a kiddie pool). Services will be discounted to get users
interested, and some will take the bait. But there are far
too many carriers and hardware developers in wireless; many
will inevitably crash and burn.

Cable modems will face a tough market. This one is too bad,
since the new products from Motorola, HP, General Instrument
and Intel/Hybrid are pretty cool, and everyone wants more return
path bandwidth than the phone company can provide. But do you
know anyone who would buy or lease hardware from their CATV
provider?

Caveat: All these predictions ignore the butterfly-wing chaos
factor of an unknown variable changing everything. If so, the
author reserves the right to shout "Never mind!" and wish everyone
a happy 1996.

Learn about RAID from RAB

By:
Terry Costlow

Engineers who want to get up to speed in disk-array technology
can get plenty of information from the RAID Advisory Board
(RAB), a 60-member organization formed in 1992.

RAB's three-tiered focus centers on education, standardization
and certification. Since RAID has suffered from some misunderstanding
in the user community, education has been a prime focus of
the group.

The centerpiece of the educational effort is the 200-plus-page
RAID Book, which defines the various RAID levels and provides
other technical explanations. Other publications include the
Storage System Enclosure Handbook, the RAID Glossary, the RAID
Primer and the RAID Ready SCSI Drive Profile.

For those who want a quick start, there's also a 15-minute video
that provides basic information on RAID. At the other end of
the spectrum, RAB sponsors an annual seminar: RABcon, the International
Conference on RAID and Related Storage Technologies for Users
and Suppliers. It runs almost as long as its name, from Feb.
12 to16, in Redwood City, Calif.

Information can also be found through the Internet at http:
/www.raid-advisory.com.

Six RAB committees work on standardization issues. Three of
them focus on tests: functional tests in SCSI and Fiber Channel
and a performance test. The other three tackle remote-array
monitoring, storage-system terminology and host-interface standards.

To make sure RAID systems actually deliver on the basics they
promise, the group offers certification procedures. RAB's set
of storage system test suites can be run to show that the system
under test provides data integrity even when a drive fails.

There's also a performance test for comparing the vastly different
RAID technologies. The test provides a single aggregate performance
rating, called the RABmark. Users who want to look at the individual
components of the test will be able to get full reports.

Those reports will probably be desirable for most users, since
the various RAID types have markedly different strengths. A
system with high bandwidth may not perform as well in applications
that require lots of I/O. By the same token, some may fare
better in terms of fault tolerance but may sacrifice performance.

PACKAGE DEALINGS: PCMCIA cards and ICs

By:
Terry Costlow

Over the past couple of years, the PCMCIA standard has emerged
as a driving factor for the board-fabrication industry. The
volumes are supposed to be high, providing a heady incentive.
And on the technology side, if a company can produce the thin,
fine-line boards needed for PCMCIA cards, making similar substrates
for larger systems should be easy.

So far, progress has been spotty on both fronts. PCMCIA cards
aren't really turning out to be as large a market as many expected.
And board makers haven't been able to crank out boards nearly
as neatly as most would like. But that doesn't mean that the
strategy doesn't remain sound.

Now, there are some signs that PCMCIA cards might be the driver
for IC packaging too. The small size of the cards, both in
area and height, is likely to make many designers and manufacturers
look seriously at unpackaged ICs. Putting a couple of bare
chips on a large circuit board can have a major impact on the
cost of the board substrate, since the whole board must be
able to support the fine lines needed for the entire board.

But since two or three bare chips will cover a fair portion
of a PCMCIA card, the extra density isn't wasted. If the portable
cards do spark a move to bare chips, it would be a welcome
sign for the U.S. market, which hasn't used nearly as many
bare chips as many system houses in the Pacific Rim.

One question arises, though. If PCMCIA cards aren't providing
enough volume to prompt comparatively small board houses to
pull out the stops to build their PCMCIA capabilities, how
will they create much excitement for large IC producers?

That answer comes from who's well known in the packaging world
for creating and chairing several technical sessions and workshops
at trade shows and industry meetings, Jack Balde. The president
of Interconnection Decision Consulting (Flemington, N.J.) feels
that while the PCMCIA standard was created for computers, the
telecommunications industry will provide the volumes that will
get the attention of CEOs.

As the world shifts to fiber optics, telecommunications providers
are going to need line cards to convert fiber-optic transmissions
into the electronic signals that will go into each home or
office phone. And if you're like me, trying to remember that
my area code will soon change to 847, you know there are far
more phones than computers.

Balde, and many others, feel that the PCMCIA card may turn out
to be the form factor for line cards, which are moving out
of the central office to basements and boxes on neighborhood
corners. Even if telecom providers diverge a bit from PCMCIA,
the packaging issues will be the same.

For board producers, the issues will be mainly to provide substrates
that are thin, have fine lines and don't cost too much. That's
nothing new.

On the IC side, things will change significantly, regardless
of whether you're supplying chips or mounting them on a board.
Some people feel chip-scale packages will become popular, since
they have only the tiniest package. Others say flip chips will
emerge, since they have the smallest footprint of any chip.
Wire bonding certainly has a chance to become the electrical
connection between chips and boards.

Other techniques, such as one that uses flexible circuits to
create plated circuitry that can be attached to boards, may
also emerge. Each has some solid pluses, as well as negatives
that create openings for the others. It's likely that many
vendors will standardize around PCMCIA form factors, but not
on any packaging issues.

Board density seen rising

By:
Terry Costlow

New Orleans - Packaging is becoming a major aspect of system
design, with both ICs and circuit boards growing in importance,
according to presentations at the Technology Marketing Research
Council (TMRC) meeting here last month.

The TMRC meetings explored both the changes predicted for packaging
and the two forces that will drive them: semiconductor advances
and business concerns. The TMRC was created several years ago
by the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic
Circuits (IPC; Northbrook, Ill.), which wanted to augment its
technical efforts by monitoring the business climate.

One major change throughout the electronics industry is the
spirit of cooperation, which has prompted the creation of several
consortia and initiatives. One of them, the National Electronic
Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI), is continuing to create plans
and road maps that help the consortium in its efforts to make
the U.S. electronics manufacturing environment competitive
even in consumer markets. The manufacturing system plan focuses
on four areas that concern packaging engineers: flip chips,
substrates, board assembly and final assembly.

Dramatic changes

In its presentation, NEMI predicted that circuit boards will
undergo dramatic changes in the next four years. This year,
the average board will have about 4,000 I/Os, with packaged
parts using 0.38-mm pitches. There will be about 110 components
in a square inch. In 1998, those figures climb to 7,000 I/Os
per board with packaged-die spacing declining to a 0.25 mm
pitch.

When the new decade dawns, the number of I/Os will actually
decline, slipping to 6,000 contacts. But they'll have far higher
density. Packaged parts will have 0.15-mm spacing, and there
will be 275 components per square inch. The number of bare
dice on a board will increase to 400 parts, double the number
used today.

Road mapping is not the only job at NEMI. It has created technical
working groups that attempt to address the concerns found when
the road map committee looked at what's needed and what's available.
Next month, all technical working group chairs will meet to
figure out how to proceed. In March, NEMI working groups will
kick off their programs.

Other observers also detailed the safe prediction that smaller
chip packages will lead to higher-density circuit boards. Hewlett
Packard Co. and IBM Corp. predicted that chip-scale packages,
which put only a tiny amount of epoxy or other encapsulant
around the chip, will be a key factor in that trend. Chip-scale
packages are only 13 percent the size of plastic quad flat
packs, and flip chips are even smaller. That foretells two
changes: Signal traces will have to get smaller and the size
of the board will shrink.

Relaxed rules

But while chip-scale packaging and ball-grid arrays, another
hot technology, will shrink board size, it won't always mean
that board density will increase. Designers will be able to
relax design rules and lower board layer counts if they follow
some design rules.

One is to use BGAs that have no more than four rows of contacts.
If there are more, it becomes difficult to get signal lines
to the inner rows, which are smaller and have fewer contact
points. Just using BGAs can have a payoff. Since BGAs can support
higher lead counts, designers can use larger chips instead
of using two or three devices packaged in peripheral-lead casings.

Another is to turn to multichip modules, particularly those
with laminate substrates. Using MCM-L technology lets designers
put all the high-density routing on a module, thereby using
coarser lines on the circuit board, according to HP.

Regardless of what packaging prognosticators plan, they must
base their predictions on changes in the semiconductor industry.
Dataquest addressed that concern, forecasting continued steady
growth in semiconductor consumption. Currently, the industry
is shifting from 32- to 64-bit processors, with DRAM technology
advancing from 16 to 64 Mbits. Over the next four years, gate
counts will rise from 300,000 to 1 million. Nothing in that
prognostication counters the need for higher-density boards
and chip packages.

All the technical moves in the board industry are based on business
and economic concerns, of course. According to an analysis
by Morton Electronic Materials, business couldn't get much
better. Over a three-month period that ended last October,
circuit-board bookings had risen 142 percent. Shipments were
also booming, at 122 percent.

Most board houses are full, and lead times are extending. In
a positive note for vendors, prices have firmed up. All these
positives add up to an increase in capital spending. Nevertheless,
there are always some warning signs that need to be monitored,
according to Morton. Component shortages have cropped up. Raw
materials are also in short supply, which is sometimes pushing
prices upward. A big factor to watch is whether growth in circuit
board bookings exceeds the increase in electronic equipment's
growth.

IR receiver aimed at wireless market



Merrimack, N.H. - Unitrode Corp. has entered the infrared market
with the release of an Infrared Data Association (IrDA)- compliant
receiver, the UCC5340.

The BiCMOS micropower receiver is the first of Unitrode's IR
Air Light series. Operating at 3.3 or 5 V, the UCC5340 incorporates
a limiting circuit that permits a wide dynamic input range
for compliance with an IrDA range of up to 1 meter.

An integrated bandpass filter improves the signal-to- noise
ratio for up to 115-kbit/second data rates. The filter includes
additional limiting circuitry that reduces device recovery
time-requirements and allows the receiver to interface directly
with IrDA-compliant detector diodes, according to Unitrode.
The receiver's output can drive a 40-pF load at CMOS/TTL levels
for direct links to UARTs or super I/O devices over data rates
of up to 115 kbits/s.

The ASK-compatible receiver requires only 90 A of supply current.
It comes in an eight-pin SOIC package and is drop-in compatible
with Irvine Sensor's SIR2 unit.

In quantities of 1,000, the UCC5340 is priced at $3.02.

DVDs spark need for software EEs

By:
Junko Yoshida

San Jose, Calif. - With the arrival in 1996 of the digital video
disk (DVD)-touted by most consumer-electronics companies as
the "biggest digital consumer product of this decade"-the industry
suddenly finds itself in need of warm bodies. And this shortage
is no more pressing than in the software arena.

Hiring needs also extend to application engineers and digital
system-level design engineers. The explanation is simple. For
leading consumer-electronics companies, such as Philips, Matsushita
and Zenith, designing a DVD system goes far beyond building
a simple player that plays back a 120-mm-diameter optical disk.
They envision DVD, with 4.7 Gbytes of storage per side, as
a vehicle to drive versatile, digital convergence among their
entire product lines. Examples would include a combo box with
DVD and a digital satellite decoder, DVD with the next-generation
high-performance videogame player, DVD with a digital VCR,
DVD built into a smart TV, and DVD with Internet access. Indeed,
DVD-based digital products can come in nearly infinite combinations
and variations, industry executives said.

Considering a cross section of all the emerging digital consumer
products, ranging from DVD to digital TV, "we really need an
awful lot of software engineers," said Bruce DeVore, vice president
of human resources at Philips Consumer Electronics (Knoxville,
Tenn.)

"We are looking for lots of applications and embedded-software
engineers," he said. Also in demand are hardware digital design
people, especially those with experience in ASIC and digital
system-level designs.

Double hiring

The Knoxville-based company, which recruited about 75 engineers
in 1994 doubled that hiring number in '95, "in order to meet
[our engineering department's] demand for research and designing
of new digital-application products," DeVore said.

Philips is recruiting engineers with up to two years of professional
experience with EE degrees, senior engineers with three to
five years of experience, and engineering director-level people
with five to 10 years. The jobs will be located in Knoxville.

Philips Semiconductors (Sunnyvale, Calif.), a silicon arm of
the Dutch giant, is also adding people, seeking experienced
hands in multimedia and communications.

In multimedia, "we need those with design experience in ICs,
microcontrollers or DSPs," said a Philips Semiconductor spokesman.
"We are also looking for software engineers who can write Windows
device drivers."

Engineers who can add value to high-speed wired communications,
such as ATM and Fast Ethernet, are also in demand, while those
with RF design and analog expertise are needed, he added.

Driven by the company's priority on "interactive [products]"
and "DVD," Matsushita Electric is also adding a big chunk of
applications-software engineers, as well as marketing and technical
support people with an engineering degree, said Bill Schupp,
vice president of human resources at Matsushita.

A substantial number of jobs are expected to be created as Matsushita
launches a company called Panasonic Interactive Media Co. in
northern California this year.

Based on the exclusive rights Matsushita recently gained from
the 3DO Co. to use 3DO's 64-bit M2 technology for next-generation
consumer and commercial products, the Japanese giant now also
has rights to sublicense the 64-bit technology to both hardware
companies and software developers. Panasonic Interactive Media
Co. will develop games software "that matches the technology
leap from 32-bit to 64-bit," Schupp said.

People needed

Though details of the new company's business plans are still
in development and won't become available until the second
week of February, Schupp said, "we will certainly be in need
of many software developers and hardware sales engineers,"
to promote the new interactive platform.

DVD is also another important business focus for Matsushita
this year. While the technical specifications and copyright
issues are being ironed out in Japan, the job opportunities
for DVD-related application engineers and service groups to
support the new system "is wide open in the United States,"
said Schupp.

Zenith Electronics (Glenview, Ill.), now officially a part of
Korean giant L.G. Electronics, continues to emphasize consumer
electronics and network-system products. Accordingly, Zenith
plans to hire 30 or more engineers this year.

"Software engineers are our high priority," noted a Zenith spokesman.

Web gets friendlier to 3-D

By:
Brian Santo

San Francisco - The drive toward fully interactive, networked
3-D modeling took several steps forward last month. Intervista
Software Inc. said it would make its WorldView 3-D Web browser
available in the first quarter; Paragraph International announced
its Virtual Home Space Builder 1.0 for creating presentations
or Web sites with real-time, interactive 3-D graphics and full
multimedia capabilities; WebMaster Inc. began offering VRServer,
a software product that automatically transforms any 2-D HTML
Web site into a framework of 3-D home "worlds"; and Sony released
the beta version of its CyberPassage VRML browser.

Much of this activity is built around the Virtual Reality Modeling
Language (VRML) specification. VRML describes the "physical"
attributes of a virtual object (color, shading, weight). In
combination with a scripting language that can provide these
objects with "behaviors" (motion, avoidance of other objects,
growth), VRML can create fully interactive 3-D virtual worlds.

"VRML will be the catalyst that propels the text-oriented Web
into a cyberspace 3-D reality," predicted Tony Parisi, chief
technology officer of Intervista Software Inc. "As an open
standard, VRML has attained critical mass among developers
the simultaneous announcements of WorldView, VRML world creation
software and HTML-to-VRML Web site converters show the 3-D
genie is out of the bottle once and for all. VRML cyberspace
is also an opportunity to create a new world-view among people
as well as the Net-to create, educate and motivate one another
in an on-line community that eliminates distance and encourages
diversity."

Web weltanschauung

Intervista (San Francisco) has made available a prerelease version
of its WorldView VRML browser for the PC on its home page (http
//www.intervista.com). It will operate either as a standalone
application or as a helper application for Netscape Communications'
Navigator HTML browser.

Fully supported versions of WorldView with printed documentation
can be purchased for $49.95 from Webmaster Inc. at its Web
site at http://www.webmaster.com.

WorldView works with Windows 95, Windows NT and Windows 3.1
with the 32s extension pack. The PC version of WorldView is
among the first applications that use Microsoft's Reality Lab
real-time 3-D application programming interface (API). The
Macintosh version is System 7.X compliant; Intervista is evaluating
the new QuickDraw 3-D API as a 3-D rendering engine for WorldView
on the Macintosh.

Paragraph International's (Campbell, Calif.) Virtual Home Space
Builder 1.0 (VHSB) for Windows OS 95, NT and 3.1 enables any
part of a created environment to act as a URL link and gives
users the ability to incorporate text, sound, video or animation
into a page-what Paragraph refers to as a "home space."

VHSB is driven by an icon-oriented user interface with point
and-click, drag-and-drop tools. The company said that "VHSB
can be learned in only a few minutes and mastered in a few
hours to create stunning interactive presentations and worlds."
Though the emphasis is on the Web, VHSB can also be used as
a multimedia presentation software package for sales, training,
or in-house presentations.

Home spaces can be saved in the standard VRML .wrl format or
Paragraph's own .mus format for higher performance and complete
multimedia functionality.

Paragraph is providing its Virtual Home Space Viewer free of
charge from its home page and is working with Intervista and
other browser companies to integrate its own VRML viewer into
their VRML Web browsers by the first quarter of this year.
That will enable any Web surfer to experience a VHSB world
directly from a browser.

The VHSB 1.0 Commercial Edition, which allows unlimited distribution
rights for developed content and includes extensive media files
and templates, costs $495. VHSB Final Beta is available for
non-commercial (personal) use at a price of $49.95. Evaluation
copies of VHSB, the Virtual Home Space Viewer, ordering information
for all ParaGraph products and a number of examples/ links
to VHSB worlds are all found at the Paragraph site: http:/
www.paragraph.com.

WebMaster's (Santa Clara, Calif.) VRServer, also compliant with
VRML, is activated simply by adding the software to an Internet
server's root directory and pointing the program toward an
existing home page (it can also be used as an entry-level HTTP
Web server)

Webmaster said that VRserver will automatically convert a 2
D world to a 3-D world. Creators of Web pages control the layout,
lighting and placement of objects in their new 3-D site, according
to the company.

Any platform

The 3-D site can be viewed by any VRML web browser running on
any platform (PC, Macintosh or Unix) and the HTML page is still
available for users of 2-D Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator.

VRServer not only maintains a copy of the original HTML home
page, but also dynamically synchronizes both the VRML and HTML
sites to one another. Any changes to the HTML page are automatically
updated and added to the VRML world as a new room.

VRServer is priced at $249 and can be ordered from the WebMaster
home page: http://www.webmaster.com/.

Sony, meanwhile, has introduced several extensions to VRML,
which it calls Enhanced VRML. Additional features include sound,
behaviors and motion pictures. CyberPassage is a browser necessary
to view pages created in Sony Enhanced VRML, based on Netscape
NCAPI.

Sony's authoring tool is called CyberPassage Conductor. Copies
of CyberPassage and CyberPassage Conductor can be downloaded
for free from Sony's Web site at http://vs.sony.co.jp.

EETnet NOTES: Members see the 'Hikari'

By:
Gary Fisher

EEtnet members like to communicate. Drop into the forum any
time, day or night, and you're likely to find a live, on-line
discussion in progress. Many of these are impromptu chats among
members enjoying one another's company; most are serious discussions
of technical issues, taking advantage of the forum's international
membership and the wide array of skills and experiences those
members offer. Some use the conferencing features for business
communications between widely scattered offices or work sites.
What's more, EEtnet has played host to more formal, moderated
conferences, like the technical introduction of Intel's PentiumPro
and a discussion with virtual-reality pioneer Jaron Lanier.

Now, a new regular conference is about ready for launch. "Hikari"
means "light" in Japanese, and the Hikari conferences are intended
to enlighten EEtnet members about Japan. Tomoe Scanlan and
Barbara Zimny, two EEtnet members with extensive personal and
professional experience in Japan, publish a bimonthly electronic
newsletter, also called "Hikari," available exclusively (in
its on-line form) through EEtnet.

Beginning in January, Tomoe and Barbara will host a weekly live
conference on Japanese issues, language and culture. Like the
newsletter, the conferences will offer discussions of current
Japanese news, advice on such cultural issues as doing business
with the Japanese and, perhaps most exciting of all, instruction
in the basics of the Japanese language.

One of the hottest means of expression today is the Internet
Web Page, and EEtnet can help there as well. Starting immediately,
EEtnet members may post their own page on the World Wide Web
at no additional charge above the membership fee (which also
includes five free on-line hours per month). Software for producing,
publishing and browsing Web pages is free to EEtnet members,
and professional assistance is available on-line to aid members
in producing the most effective pages possible. EEtnet Web
pages can include the latest enhanced features, and the free
production software makes it easy to do so, though any HTML
editing software will work just fine.

EEtnet Web pages can be used for business purposes;. For example,
"Immortal Works" Team EEtnet leader Don Swaab has posted his
own page. Point your browser at http://ourworld.compuserve.com
homepages/dswaab to see what he has done.

You're invited to attend the Hikari conferences or express yourself
in any of the ways EEtnet makes available; see the ad in this
issue for details on a free one-month trial membership.

Gary Fisher is a wizard-class sysop on EEtnet. His CompuServe
address is 76702.2040@compuserve.com.

C-Cube 'branches' out

By:
Junko Yoshida

Las Vegas - One concern that system and chip vendors share as
they plan their digital-video-disk offerings is the availability
of attractive software. They wonder how many Hollywood studios
will feel comfortable with the quality of digitally encoded
material.

MPEG-decoder-chip vendor C-Cube Microsystems Inc. is one of
the companies trying to do something about that. It's working
on real-time MPEG-2 encoding silicon for DVD systems. David
Taylor, director of broadcast marketing at C-Cube, said the
company will privately demonstrate its silicon's variable-bit
rate encoding and overall MPEG-2 video/audio and AC-3 encoding
capabilities at a hotel suite here during the Consumer Electronics
Show.

C-Cube also plans to incorporate such features as "branching"
in its encoding chip set, Taylor said. The DVD technical specification
allows scene skipping, or branching, as a parental lockout
function; by embedding flags in a digital stream, a DVD player
can be made to skip over certain sectors on a disk.

The rub in implementing the branching function is that the encoder
must devise a way to make a seamless transition between the
exit and re-entry points. "The technical spec is there," Taylor
said, "but practical implementations are still being worked
on."

C-Cube hopes to announce microcode for VBR-based MPEG-2 DVD
encoding before midyear. Addition of branching and other features
will likely follow several months later, Taylor said.

RAID-certification program completed

By:
Terry Costlow

Wichita, Kan. - Hoping to make it easier for users to pick redundant
arrays of independent disks, the RAID Advisory Board has completed
a certification program that includes a standard performance
comparison level as well as a functional test. Symbios Logic
last week became the first to pass the functional test.

Some RAID vendors believe that the two aspects of the test will
help expand the market significantly. The performance test
will provide an aggregate speed figure that can compare general
performance levels, much like SPECmarks in the workstation
industry. The functional test, which is the portion Symbios
has completed, will certify that data is not lost or altered
when drives in the array fail.

"This gives users a UL-like label," said Ron Englebrecht, director
for OEM RAID products at Symbios, which was formerly a part
of NCR. "It's been a bit of a black eye for the industry that
sometimes a combination of events will cause loss or alteration
of data. This provides an unbiased third-party guarantee that
the system works under adverse conditions."

Split decision

However, the industry is split on the value of the tests. Joe
Molina, chairman of the RAID Advisory Board (RAB), said, "Most
of our members who provide RAID products agree that certification
is the most important program undertaken by RAB. There are
myriad tests in the functional portion; it takes at least a
week to run."

But others think that the tests will not have much impact in
the market.

"What they're trying to do is admirable, but we don't think
that this general test provides customers assurance that they're
getting what they want, that the product delivers what it promises,"
said Tex Schenkkan, marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard's
Storage Systems Division (Boise, Idaho). "That's really driven
by the vendor's own quality and acceptance programs. If you're
a small outfit, this might be something you can do to give
customers assurance that you're not just one of 175 RAID vendors."

The large number of vendors means that users might need some
assistance in determining whether the RAID system delivers
what they expect. Though the performance data is likely to
be the most visible aspect of the tests, the functional portion
is equally important, observers said.

IEC eyes consensus on EDA standards

By:
Richard Goering

Washington - In an attempt to come to an international consensus
on EDA standards, the International Electrotechnical Committee
(IEC) held a series of meetings here last month, involving
U.S., Japanese and European standards organizations. The meetings
helped to raise awareness about international standards efforts
and to identify unnecessary duplication.

The meetings were sponsored by IEC technical committee 93 (TC93),
which develops and approves international design-automation
standards. "This is the first time, to my knowledge, that the
technical committee has held such an open forum," said Jean
LeBrun, TC93 chairman and a design manager at CSF Thomson.

Not 'from scratch'

LeBrun noted that standards organizations and EDA users were
present from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Finland,
Denmark and the United Kingdom. "We don't really want to develop
standards from scratch," LeBrun said. "We'd rather establish
working relationships with recognized organizations like the
IEEE."

Among those included in the meetings were representatives of
the CAD Framework Initiative (CFI), Electronic Industries Association
(EIA) EDIF effort, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa),
PDES and Sematech. The EDA industry standards road map under
development by CFI, Sematech and the Electronic Design Automation
Companies (EDAC) is of major interest to the IEC, LeBrun said.

Patti Rusher, a representative of the EIA's EDIF effort, said,
"We wanted to introduce the EDA road map, which was basically
done in the U.S., and get feedback to go to the next step.
Issues raised included duplicated standards, such as EDIF and
AP210."

Randy Harr, program manager at Arpa, said, "The U.S. government
is fully behind the IEC EDA standards forum meeting. We have
been urging, through funding direction and contact, the various
EDA standards activities to work more closely together. The
IEC meeting is a way to make sure the international standards
bodies are in concert with these efforts."

In addition to a day-long open forum, working-group meetings
were held throughout the week. IEC TC93 working groups address
such areas as interoperability, hardware description languages,
interchange formats, pc-board layout and conformance of applications
to IEC EDA standards. New working groups are anticipated to
address libraries and test.

Cover Feature: Socket suppliers target emerging high-density world of ball
and land-grid arrays

By:
Glenda Derman

As two new package types-ball-grid arrays and land-grid arrays
begin moving into volume production, socket suppliers are scrambling
to provide production, test and burn-in sockets for ICs packaged
in these high-density designs. Besides being reasonably priced,
production sockets must have very low inductances, no planarity
problems, reliable performance and, preferably, surface-mount
formats.

The availability of sockets for the popular microprocessors
is especially important, because the nature of tariffs makes
socketing desirable. Microprocessors can then be inserted as
needed into the sockets of assemblies manufactured offshore.
Sockets also aid in flexible manufacturing and in computer
upgrade strategies.

Moreover, packages such as land-grid arrays (LGAs) are designed
to be used with production sockets. The speedy new MIPS R10000
processor from MIPS Technologies Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.),
an LGA with 599 pads and a 200-MHz core operating speed, is
one of them.

Cinch Connector Division (Elk Grove Village, Ill.) is manufacturing
such sockets around its patented CIN:APSE contact technology.
Because it provides low inductance and minimal signal-path
length, CIN:APSE is said to be an enabling technology for high
speed LGA production-socket applications.

These solderless SMT sockets are compression-mounted and bolted
to the printed-circuit board. They feature inductance of less
than l nH, signal-edge rates in the range of 300 to 400 ps,
signal-path length of approximately 28 mm and contact resistance
of less than 20 milliohms. The sockets, which measure 56 mm
on a side, house packages that are typically used in high-end
workstations.

With an eye to standardization, Motorola Inc. and IBM Corp.
are developing a joint specification for surface-mount, production
BGA sockets for all PowerPC processors in 1.27-mm grid BGA
packages. These small, lightweight sockets attach to the pc
board in the same footprint that the BGA itself would use.
Zero-insertion-force (ZIF) socket contacts are preferred, but
not required. The specifications detail stringent technical
requirements and establish pricing levels at under $5 in volume.

They also include requirements for surface mountability and
heat-sink attachment. Most BGA production sockets assist with
heat dissipation because of thermal-management issues with
microprocessors. Mototorola is working on some final details
of the standard covering requirements for mechanical vibration
for shipping, operating stability over temperature and during
thermal-power cycling, and moisture and humidity sensitivity.

Though all the socket designs Motorola has reviewed for PowerPCs
in BGA and LGA packages feature low-inductance and high-speed
capabilities, engineers report not having seen a true production
worthy ball-grid-array socket that meets all the specified
requirements. The hitch seems to lie in the ability to maintain
a good electrical contact over time in all types of applications,
particularly because of oxide buildup on solder balls. Motorola
expects to have a socket solution early in 1996.

BGA and LGA sockets for other devices are just beginning to
appear on the market. For example, Augat Inc.'s Interconnection
Products Division (Attleboro Falls, Mass.) recently introduced
Pad Array Interface production sockets from 200 to 800 I/Os
for BGA and LGA packages. The beryllium-copper contact system
operates like a pogo stick and has a nominal force of 120 grams.

Reliable interface

The socket contact tip ensures a reliable interface by engaging
the balls or pads of the package without damaging them; the
use of standoffs within the socket also helps. These sockets
have been used with custom ASICs and custom multichip modules,
and Augat says they have just been accepted by two workstation
manufacturers as the standard interconnect for their CPU packages.

The operating temperature range is -55C to 105C; the inductance
value is 4 nH. Sockets are availabile in 12 to 16 weeks at
7 to 12 cents per contact.

Aries Electronics Inc. (Frenchtown, N.J.) offers a BGA production
socket called ZIF BallNest, a lidded, surface-mount model with
a four-fingered, beryllium-copper compression-contact system.
Contacts are compressed from above and the lid functions as
an actuator. The redundant, four-point contacts engage the
sides of the solder balls and perform a wiping action without
affecting the ball bottoms.

The socket housing of ZIF BallNest is bolted to the pc board.
A flap at the base of the contact presses against it to provide
the pressure connection. Inductances are less than l nH and
capacitance between contacts is 1 pF. Sockets are available
in 225 I/O on a 1.27-mm grid for applications with the PowerPC
package, or on a 1.5-mm grid for other uses. Availability is
four to six weeks and cost is 5 to 10 cents per contact, depending
on volume.

A family of low-profile, ZIF, surface-mount production BGA sockets
is being developed by Methode Electronics Inc. (Chicago). The
first of this family-a 1.27-mm grid, 25 x 25-matrix socket
for ceramic BGAs-will have a maximum of 625 I/Os. The socket
which measures 39.4 x 36.8 mm and are 2.3 mm high-have U-shaped
beryllium-copper contacts plated in tin/lead.

It has the same footprint on the pc board as the BGA, because
the package is placed on a plastic carrier that gets inserted
into the socket only after the socket has been soldered to
the board. Thus, no external hold-downs are required. Clearance
holes underneath each of the socket pins enable visual inspection
of solder joints.

ZIF actuation is achieved with a screwdriver. Socket inductance
is less than 5 nH. Sockets for ceramic BGAs will be available
in the first quarter of 1996, with versions for plastic BGAs
following in the second quarter. Pricing in low volume will
be 5 cents per contact.

Testing hassles

High-speed digital and RF designers as well as test engineers
are facing limitations with standard sockets for device characterization
and product testing. Some of the problems encountered during
test include ground bounce, crosstalk, supply decoupling and
distortion and glitches that derive from high-lead inductance,
as well as mutual inductance and capacitance of packages and
sockets.

Engineering test sockets must be robust. They perform comprehensive
electrical test and verification of devices for functionality
and dc parametrics at elevated temperatures and at speed. Socket
compatibility with automated handlers is important, and so
is eliminating inductance by means of socket design.

To weed out potential device failures, burn-in sockets-used
mainly with semiconductors-must handle chips while they are
power-cycled over time at elevated temperatures. Many burn
in sockets are required, and keeping costs down is key. Burn
in sockets designed for use with BGAs at elevated temperatures
face special challenges. Solder balls tend to soften during
burn-in and then deform, often leaving residues on the socket
contacts, which could necessitate cleaning after each use.
Then too, compatibility of solder balls with test and burn
in temperatures, and test and burn-in socket contact designs,
should be monitored.

To meet these needs, Yamaichi Electronics USA Inc. (San Jose,
Calif.) offers the NP 195 series of burn-in sockets for LGAs
in an open-top format, in I/O counts ranging from 80 to 260.
Measuring 56 x 57 x 25 mm high, these sockets are made to withstand
temperatures of

-55C to 170C. Special singular contacts are CAM-actuated to
provide ZIF operation as well as a wiping action on the LGA
pads. The 1.27-mm contact grid is available in configurations
of 14 x 14 up to 25 x 25 rows.

Yamaichi's open-top, 225 I/O burn-in socket for BGAs, the IC
264 Series, can withstand temperatures of -40C to 150C. Used
in automated assembly applications, the ZIF-actuated socket
measures 75 x 62 x 27 mm. A clamping mechanism provides force
for the compression connection between the solder balls of
the BGA package and the crown-shaped socket contacts. The latter
engage both sides of the solder balls without causing deformation.

Target: SRAMs, DRAMs

Yamaichi also offers burn-in sockets for 119-I/O BGAs for static
and dynamic RAMs: the NP 276 Series. Those sockets have an
open top and a different style of ZIF, CAM-actuated contacts.
Shaped like a tuning fork, the contact clasps the top hemisphere
of the solder ball from either side and breaks through the
oxide layer to provide a reliable connection.

The 1.27-mm-pitch, 17 x 17-row sockets measure 33.2 x 26.4 mm
and stand 16.8 mm tall. The series also includes sockets for
380-I/O BGAs in a 20 x 20-row format measuring 49.4 x 49.4
x 19.1 mm. The sockets can be depopulated down to 250 I/O.
Availability is six weeks ARO.

High-performance test sockets for BGAs and LGAs recently introduced
by Condel Technology (Cupertino, Calif.) are based on a high
density, conductive elastomer-interposer design. The heat-resistant
elastomer interposer-the method of connecting the balls or
pads of the package within the socket and the pc board-contains
40-micron gold-plated wires inserted at a 60 angle and spaced
at 0.1 mm. As the connection is compressed, the wires rotate
and slide against the mating contact surfaces, resulting in
a self-cleaning action. Though l-mm interconnect length is
standard, 0.5 mm is available. It is said to be the shortest
interconnect length in socketing technology.

Condel test sockets are aimed at two applications: testing high
speed RF-type devices at 900 MHz and above, and testing high
density ASIC devices at speed. They are designed to pass very
high-frequency signals with very low intermodulation distortion
and minimum crosstalk, characteristics necessary in testing
high-speed RF devices. In addition, low common lead inductance
is minimized to prevent ground bounce, an important issue when
testing high-density ASICs in BGAs and LGAs.

Sockets are available in matrices of 25, 27 and 32 mm square,
either open or lidded. The conductive elastomer with its matrix
of 40-micron wires will accept balls and pads with pitches
as small as 0.1 mm. The Comdel sockets operate at bandwidths
greater than 15 GHz and offer low lead inductances-just 0.35
nH at 1 GHz. Their temperature range is -55C to 155C, contact
resistance is 22 milliohms and the life cycle exceeds 50,000
insertions.

Cost per socket is $2,000, and availability is one to two weeks.
The conductive-elastomer interface can be replaced at a nominal
cost. Also available from Comdel is a test socket for the Tessera
mBGA 188-I/O, 0.5-mm-pitch package. The cost is $1,900 per
unit.

A new test-socket family that accommodates area-array packages
and is designed for use with automated equipment is being manufactured
by PrimeYield Systems Inc. (St. Paul, Minn.). Called the Micro
HPC, these sockets have a contactor body made of glass-filled
polymer. Sockets are open lidded to accommodate automated equipment.

The Micro-HPC's contact elements are gold- and nickel-plated
brass. The insertion force required is 1.5 ounces per contact.

The PrimeYield sockets attach to the the tester board with a
surface-mount connection consisting of a matrix of 40-micron
gold conductors on 100-micron centers. This connection ensures
inductance of less than l nH for testing reliability. Temperature
parameters are -55C to 165C, and socket life is 1 million insertions.
Cost of these semicustom sockets is $2,000 to $3,000 per unit,
and availability is eight weeks.

Cinch Connector Division makes test and burn-in sockets for
Motorola PowerPC microprocessors in BGAs based on its CIN:APSE
technology. Among Cinch's offerings are 256-I/O test sockets
for the PowerPC 603 and 604, as well as 304-I/O test sockets
for the MPC-105.

CIN:APSE's low-inductance compression interface ensures no deformation
of the solder ball. The sockets withstand temperatures up to
125C; inductance is under 5 nH. Availability is six to eight
weeks, and sockets are priced at $600 each.

Also addressing test and burn-in is Plastronics (Irving, Texas),
which has just introduced a line of open-top, ZIF test and
burn-in sockets for ball-grid arrays. Price of the standard
sockets is about 50 cents per contact and availability is one
to two weeks.

Elsewhere, 3M Corp. will introduce a vertical-loading, open
top, ZIF BGA socket for test and burn-in in the first half
of 1996.

PCI-based data-acquisition board provides 16-bit A/D resolution
and Plug & Play



Marlboro, Mass. - A PCI-based data-acquisition board (PCI-EZ)
developed by Data Translation lets engineers and scientists
take full advantage of the performance benefits of the PCI
bus, including data-transfer speed, auto-configuration and
processor-independence. Unlike earlier boards in the line,
the DT3004 provides 16-bit A/D resolution. The unit also complies
with the Windows 95 Plug & Play configuration standard.

Hitachi puts sychronous DRAM and extended-data-out memories
into DIMM packages


Brisbane, Calif. - Targeting both notebook and desktop PCs,
Hitachi America Ltd. has spun two DIMM modules: a 144-pin extended
data-out (EDO) DRAM, and a 168-pin, small-outline, synchronous
DRAM.

The 8-byte, 144-pin HB56xWxxxD small-outline memory module (shown
right) is 2.66 inches long, 1 inch high and 0.15 inch thick.
The application target is notebook-computer OEMs. The device
replaces two 32-bit, 72-pin small-outline DIMMs, allowing OEMs
to make significant gains in end-system miniaturization.

The SDRAM-based DIMM, designated HB526A164EN, is a 2M x 64-bit,
100-MHz module suitable for workstation and desktop-PC main
memory. The unit uses a serial-presence detect scheme that's
similar to that employed in 144-pin small-outline DIMMs. The
module is fully socket-compatible with 168-pin DIMMs that use
fast-page and EDO DRAMs. That means OEMs can make main-memory
configuration decisions late in the manufacturing process,
to more easily match finished systems to orders.

Both of the new by-64 memory modules conform to proposed industry
standards that will ensure interchangeability among multiple
sources.

The 60-ns, 1M x 64-bit, 3.3-V, 144-pin, EDO small-outline DIMM
(HB56HW164DB) has a per-piece price of $285 in 1,000-piece
quantities. The unit will sample this month. The HB526A264EN
a 100-MHz, 2M x 64-bit, 168-pin SDRAM DIMM-costs $635 per module,
also in 1,000-piece quantities. Sample quantities will be available
in March. Call (800) 285-1601, ext. 11.

Power Sources: Portables warm up to lithium batteries

By:
Mohan Mankikar

The nickel-based battery technologies-nickel cadmium (NiCd)
and nickel metal hydride (NiMH)-continue to dominate portable
electronics. But lithium is coming up fast.

Lithium's numerous advantages include high energy density and
high cell voltage-both more than twice that of nickel-based
systems-as well as light weight, fast recharging and environmental
safety. Lithium batteries also have excellent shelf life, with
a self-discharge rate of 1 percent to 2 percent per year (compared
with 10 percent for conventional cells); hermetic construction;
and a broad operating-temperature range.

Because lithium is a newer technology in terms of commercial
use, it is still relatively pricey and is perceived as unstable
in certain forms. But those negatives are fading with increased
acceptance. On the pricing score, a direct comparison between
nickel- and lithium-based systems is inaccurate because lithium's
2-to-1 edge in operating voltage means that only half the number
of cells is required to power a particular application. The
decrease in primary voltage for many systems to 3.3 V from
5 V also favors lithium, because its output is between 3 and
3.65 V per cell. By comparison, NiCd, NiMH, alkaline and zinc
air range from 1.2 to 1.5 V per cell. And to handle the second
knock on lithium-instability-companies have created chemistries
or safeguards to compensate.

Tadiran Electronic Industries Inc. (Port Washington, N.Y.) considers
lithium technology so important that it skipped an intermediate
stage of NiMH development and moved immediately to lithium
metal. In fact, some companies believe that NiMH is an interim
technology and that NiCd will ultimately lose out because of
environmental constraints.

Though they're still playing catch-up, lithium-based batteries
are already widely used, and some applications are in an evolutionary
phase. Depending on the chemistry and product type, the batteries
are found in systems ranging from smoke detectors to F-14 fighters.

Lithium is used in primary (non-rechargeable) as well as secondary
(rechargeable) batteries. BlueStar Battery Systems Corp. (Jarretsville,
Md.) offers two primary battery technologies-lithium sulfur
dioxide (lithium SO2) and lithium manganese dioxide (lithium
MnO2) for military use in communications equipment, night-vision
goggles, chemical-agent monitors and the global positioning
satellite (GPS) systems. The batteries are said to operate
down to -40C and to offer immediate energy output even after
10 years of inactivity.

Ultralife Batteries Inc. (Montvale, N.J.). has developed a flat
profile prismatic system, dubbed the Thin Cell, that can be
as thin as 0.5 mm. With a high ratio of active material to
packaging, Thin Cell's capacity exceeds a claimed 200 mAh/cm3
of material. It is light and has a flat discharge profile and
long shelf life. After 10 years in storage, the batteries,
packaged in foil-plastic laminates pouches, reportedly retain
80 percent of their initial capacity.

One attribute of lithium batteries is that they can be used
in high-temperature applications. A lithium thionyl chloride
model from Battery Engineering Inc. (Hyde Park, Mass.) that
is used mainly in oil and gas drilling operates at -55C to
+200C and is said to have one of the highest energy densities
of its kind.

A manufacturer that specializes in lithium, Electrochem Industries
(Clarence, N.Y.), also has products for such demanding applications
as drilling equipment. Its PMX150 series lithium sulfuryl chloride
primary battery has spirally wound construction and is typically
used in downhole and high-temperature work. It is designed
for immediate power on demand or for intermittent operation.

Tadiran's AA lithium thionyl chloride primary battery, which
was selected for the battery-powered thermal instrumentation
packets in the space shuttle, handles a rated temperature range
of -55C to +85C. But the units are claimed to have withstood
+100C for extended periods during encapsulation.

Many manufacturers have created batteries for special applications
by changing their chemistry or introducing additives. As case
in point is a lithium thionyl chloride technology that Power
Conversion Inc. (Elmwood Park, N.J.) has dubbed PowerStart.
It uses additives that modify the lithium protective surface
and that prevent voltage delay.

Conventional lithium batteries can exhibit voltage delay because
they have a protective passivation layer on the lithium surface.
Though the layer enhances shelf life, it blocks lithium ion
transfer. That may cause a significant voltage drop upon the
application of a pulse, accompanied by a slow recovery to the
nominal operating voltage.

With PowerStart, a lattice surface structure is formed that,
while maintaining its protective function, does not significantly
block the reaction sites. The pulse thus can be delivered with
minimal voltage drop and rapid recovery. Power Conversion employs
the technology in its Eternalcell, which is used in applications
such as smart vending machines, home security systems and medical
devices-requiring moderate power with varying pulse for which
an immediate response is desired.

For commercial rechargeable lithium systems, lithium-ion technology
is most prominent. Sony Corp. (Park Ridge, N.J.) is considered
the pioneer for its development of batteries for its camcorders.
It is currently the largest manufacturer of lithium ion batteries,
with about a 70 percent worldwide market share. Most of its
products are proprietary; besides camcorders, the cells go
into Walkman-type devices and laptop computers.

Banning the boom

Initially, lithium faced some recharging problems. Overcharging
caused explosions; the result is an airline ban against rechargeable
lithium batteries with more than 5 grams of lithium-D. Such
cells must be shipped as special cargo.

But industry solved that problem with innovative techniques
such as development of lithium ion (no lithium metal) and a
solid cathode. Ultralife Batteries has developed a lithium
ion solid-polymer rechargeable battery that is safer than liquid
lithium-ion technology. It reportedly provides design flexibility,
costs less and is environmentally friendly. It can be worked
into flat-profile prismatic shapes with thin foil housings,
customized to virtually any size and stacked in efficient,
multicell configurations.

Tadiran has taken a different approach to the issue of lithium
metal safety. The company has developed an electrochemical
system for its In-Charge rechargeable AA-size cylindrical cells
that prevents hazardous events during electrical-abuse conditions.
The innovation combines the battery's integral electrochemical
fail-safe mechanism with a built-in safety vent to provide
ultimate protection. Together, they deactivate the cell in
case of abuses. The volumetric efficiency of Tadiran's lithium
metal technology exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries, according
to Sol Jacobs, vice president of sales and marketing.

One application in which lithium-ion rechargeables are replacing
nickel cadmium chemistry is computer backup. Maxell Corp. of
America (Fair Lawn, N.J.) has designed a coin-type MnO2 secondary
battery for CMOS-RAM backup in computers, calculators and fax
and phone applications.

Zinc air rises

Sony, Sanyo Energy (USA) Corp. (San Diego) and Toshiba America
Information Systems (Irvine, Calif.) dominate the portables
market for lithium-ion batteries. Toshiba's top-of-the-line
Tecra 700 series uses lithium ion with MaxTime Power Management
for up to 5 hours of battery life. As demand increases for
longer battery hours and higher energy density in portable
applications, lithium technology is becoming more mainline.

Even as lithium pushes into the mainstream, however, it must
face competitors in the battle to dominate the future. Zinc
air, which runs much longer than any other rechargeable chemistry,
is gaining slow and steady acceptance.

One manufacturer, AER Energy Resources Inc. (Smyrna, Ga.) has
been endorsed by two high-profile users of its auxiliary zinc
air cells: Toshiba and Hewlett-Packard Co. The AER Energy PowerPro
runs several models of Toshiba notebooks for up to 15 hours
on a single charge, and the AER Energy PowerSlice LX runs the
HP Omnibook 6000 series for up to 12 hours on a charge.

Toshiba's battery options underscore the fact that, at least
in the short term, other chemistries are expected to coexist
with lithium as alternative technology. Toshiba, a leader in
portable computers, offers optional battery packs in lithium,
zinc air, NiMH and NiCd. Its Tecra 700 series comes with lithium
and MaxTime power management, which lets the user customize
the computer's power management to achieve maximum battery
life.

Traditional chemistries are also making some headway, with new
versions offerings higher densities. A breakthrough NiMH battery
from Panasonic Industrial Co. (Secaucus, N.J.) boasts 300 Wh
liter, which is claimed to be the highest available energy
density for a small secondary battery. The cell's high-level
volumetric efficiency is usually found only in lithium metal
batteries.

Designated the Super300 for its high energy density, the product
has a cylindrical cell shape that is suited for various types
of electronic equipment.

On another front, Plainview Batteries Inc. (Plainview, N.Y.)
has announced a plastic-cased prismatic NiMH cell-the PH 600
that provides 600 mAh at 1.22 V/cell. It is encased in a strong,
rigid, glassified polyimide plastic housing and is totally
insulated except for the small, button-like contacts, both
located at the same end of the battery. The battery is targeted
for use in notebook computers, personal communication devices
and personal digital assistants.

Despite such advances, however, lithium technology clearly has
the momentum. As it matures, and as its prices decline and
its market acceptance intensifies, lithium is expected to become
a dominant technology-though coexisting, to be sure, with NiMH,
zinc-air and alkaline alternatives.

Rosa, Calif.), a market-research and consulting firm that provides

Power Sources: Ericsson adds low-voltage member to PKG family of dc/dc 
converter



Richardson, Texas - Ericsson Components' PKG series of dc/dc
converters is designed for 48/60-Vdc distributed-power architectures.
Now, Ericsson has added a low-voltage part to the line: the
PKG 4310PI. The output voltage is 2.1 Vdc with 30 W of power.
The input voltage range is 36 to 72 Vdc. Typical efficiency
is as high as 75 percent at full output power, and the resulting
increase in case temperature is30C.

Ericsson says the module's high efficiency makes it possible
to avoid heat sinks over a wide temperature range. Maximum
case temperature is 100C.

Measuring 2.94 x 2.41 x 0.43 inch, the mean time between failures
(MTBF) for the PKG modules exceeds 2.1 million hours (200 years)
at a 75C case temperature. The units conform to EN, UL and
CSA requirements. The output voltage is adjustable within 10
percent.

The PKG modules offer remote on/off, overvoltage protection,
1,500-V input-to-output isolation, and a low-input-shutdown
function that protects from unnecessary discharging of batteries
during failures.

In lots of 500, the PKG 4310PI is priced at $58. Call Richard
Hoag at (214) 997-6561.

Eye on Distribution: Downsizing spurs move to catalogs

By:
Robert Ralston

Corporate restructuring in the electronics industry has left
fewer people to do more work. Today's engineers must complete
more projects in a shorter time and, thus, have less time to
meet with suppliers.

That trend creates an opportunity for catalog distributors to
give engineers faster access to a wealth of product information
through improved catalogs. The catalogs often contain not only
product numbers, pricing and specifications but also the dimensions
and technical data that engineers require daily. The Newark
Electronics catalog, for example, contains more than 22,000
technical drawings, in addition to pricing and specifications
for more than 120,000 items from 290 major manufacturers.

As the electronics market continues to grow and expand into
all areas of commerce and industry, the number of components
and associated items has grown to monumental proportions. There
are literally hundreds of manufacturers offering millions of
products. Because engineers do not have time to research all
the new products, they rely on catalog distributors to ensure
their access to the best products for their particular projects.

Accelerated production schedules also dictate that engineers
specify readily available products. Engineers do not have time
to go back and respecify individual components because the
ones they originally selected are out of stock. Catalog distributors
must thus ensure that every featured product is stocked. The
distributor may also stock additional products beyond those
shown in the catalog.

Engineers are not the only group finding time is in short supply.
As manufacturers' sales representatives respond to engineering
customers from large accounts who demand more product research,
technical support and value-added services, they have less
time to spend on second- and third-tier accounts. As a result,
engineers from smaller accounts have increasingly turned to
catalog distributors to meet their needs.

Such customers often have the same needs as their larger counterparts,
including requirements for such services as blanket orders,
technical support, credit-card orders, dedicated inventory,
not-in-catalog orders and more.

Another trend reshaping today's electronics industry is vendor
reduction. As more companies reduce their purchasing costs
through vendor-reduction programs, broadline catalog distributors
are being asked to serve as electronic-components integrated
suppliers, from which customers can get one-stop shopping service.

Catalog distributors must also continue to improve the way they
communicate with both engineers and manufacturers. Today, for
example, most of Newark's purchases are being transmitted electronically.
We are on-line with most of our largest suppliers for information
ranging from pricing to technical data. And the growth of the
Internet has the potential to revolutionize the way we all
do business.

If there is one constant in the industry, it is change. Those
distributors that respond to change proactively, rather than
reactively, will survive and prosper. Those that do not, will
not.

Robert Ralston is vice president of Newark Electronics.

Packaging & Interconnections: Socket vendors get into PentiumPro act

By:
Glenda Derman

Intel's next-generation processor, the PentiumPro, has attracted
the attention of no fewer than a half-dozen vendors of sockets.
Formerly known as the P6, the processor comes in a 2.46 x 2.66
inch, 387-pin ceramic pin-grid array (PGA) with two cavities
to accommodate separate die: one for the CPU and one for cache.
A gold-plated, copper-tungsten heat spreader is attached to
the package.

Intel specifies a "Socket 8" type unit for the PentiumPro, a
low-insertion-contact socket of the sort used in products that
typically are not intended for microprocessor upgradability,
such as file servers. For applications requiring upgradability,
Intel requires the use of a zero-insertion-force (ZIF) version.

AMP Inc. is among the socket vendors looking for a chunk of
this market. The Harrisburg, Pa., company's single-level ZIF
socket on a 24 x 26 grid is available in limited quantities.
Inductance on this low-profile socket averages 3 nH per contact,
and resistance typically runs 10 to 12 milliohms per contact
(20 milliohms maximum)

Robinson Nugent (New Albany, Ind.) has added a single-level,
through-hole ZIF version to its Socket 8 product line that
meets Intel qualification requirements for the PentiumPro.
Integral heat-sink tabs can be used with heat sinks from multiple
vendors, and the insulator material, of high-temperature plastic,
is appropriate for all soldering processes. Cost is under $7.75
per unit for quantities of 50,000. Sockets will be available
on Jan. 1, and lead time will be four weeks.

Project Resources Inc. (Wareham, Mass.) has added to its line
of Pentium-ready sockets a new Socket 8 type for the PentiumPro.
The ZIF, interstitial-style PGA production socket comes with
beryllium-copper or phosphorous-bronze contacts with gold platings
in a variety of thicknesses, and nickel underplating. The insulator
will withstand vapor-phase soldering, the company said.

The socket measures 67.2 x 82 mm and stands 7.9 mm high. Contact
resistance is 15 milliohms maximum, current rating is 1 A maximum
and inductance is 2 nH at l MHz. The socket is priced under
$10 apiece in quantities of 500 units, and delivery is stock
to four weeks.

Meanwhile, Mill-Max Manufacturing Corp. (Oyster Bay, N.Y.) is
offering an LIF PGA production socket with a cutaway to permit
extraction-tool access to the PentiumPro. Users insert the
extraction tool-a simple pry bar that Mill-Max sells for 25
cents each-between the socket insulator and the processor to
gain access without putting stress on the board or neighboring
components. Mill-Max uses a machined shell contact with a beryllium
copper spring for durability and ease of insertion.

The Mill-Max LIF Socket 8 is an open-frame model that measures
86 x 69 mm,and 4.6 mm high. Its nominal controlled impedance
is 50 ohms, and inductance is 1.9 nH. Tabs on the insulator
allow a fan sink to clip directly to the socket for heat dissipation.
Typically too large to be handled by automated pick-and-place
equipment, these sockets are usually manually attached to boards.
The sockets are priced at $8 per unit in quantity and are available
immediately.

Another LIF socket for the PentiumPro-from McKenzie Technology,
a Berg Electronics company (Fremont, Calif.)-uses low-force
contacts as well as an injection-molded socket body to produce

Packaging & Interconnections: Strain relief enhances insulation-displacement 
family of connectors



Irvine, Calif. - Circuit Assembly Corp. has added strain relief
to a line of insulation-displacement connectors for SCSI peripherals.

The reliefs improve reliability in applications in which connectors
are often mated and unmated and can be used with pull tabs
when pulling on the cable is not desirable. The cables rest
against the prongs in a woven fashion, reducing stress on contact
lines. The connectors can be used with Teflon cables, which
are important for high-performance SCSI subsystems. The plug
mass-terminates with 30-AWG, 0.025-inch centerline, flat, unshielded
cable.

A 68-position connector strain relief costs 32 cents when purchased
in lots of 10,000. The connector it attaches to costs $3.74
in similar quantities. Call (714) 855-7887, or fax (714) 855

Modules & Boards: Vero module permits hot swaps of VME cards



Hamden, Conn. - Vero Electronics Inc. says its Live-insertion
Module allows individual daughterboards to be swapped in powered
VMEbus systems without disturbing overall system functionality.

The module, measuring 2.36 inches deep and 10.5 inches high,
is transparent and conforms to the VMEbus specification. The
LiModule is compatible with any standard VMEbus board, backplane
or subrack and supports a mezzanine module for VSB and VXlbus
interfaces.

on the critical, unidirectional lines, such as address, data
and control signals, and analog "quick switches" on the less
critical, bidirectional lines, such as interrupts and bus requests.
After insertion, the board connection is either software-controlled
or mechanically switched, with automatic power-up and bus synchronization.

The 25-ns delay introduced by the LiModule is insignificant,
even in a fully loaded 21-slot VMEbus system, according to
the company. Pricing for the LiModule is $679.32. Call (800)

TIME WARNER SELLS ARCADE UNIT

     Time Warner Inc. continued its slash and burn campaign against
its new media units by selling its Milpitas, Calif.-based Time
Warner Interactive division to WMS Industries Inc., owner of
coin-operated games company Williams Entertainment.

     The deal, for an undisclosed sum, brings together two of the
largest U.S. arcade developers; the TWI division has found recent
coin-op success with "Primal Rage," "Area 51" and "T-MEK," while
Williams Entertainment is known for its popular "Mortal Kombat"
series, "NBA Jam," "Terminator 2" and "Killer Instinct."  It also
adds another chapter to the ownership history of Time Warner
Interactive, which began as Atari Corp. before splitting off into
Atari Games Corp. a few years later.  It was then called Time
Warner Interactive and now reverts back to the Atari Games Corp.
name.

     Time Warner has been looking to reduce its large debt for
months, and last October the media giant shuffled its Burbank,
Calif.-based Time Warner Interactive unit and WarnerActive under
the iNSCAPE umbrella, a joint venture between Michael Nash, HBO and
Warner Music Group.

     The Burbank office focused on creating CD-ROM games and
Internet properties, while the much larger Milpitas division
developed arcade titles which it leveraged for home video game
systems.  In 1995, it released five coin-op titles and 30 CD-ROM
games.

     Reports first circulated that the Atari Games division was on
the block last December, with Acclaim Entertainment Inc. listed as
a possible bidder.  But WMS returns Atari Games to its roots in the
coin-op world, and the deal is expected to close within two months. 
While strategy is being formulated, both companies have found
success by translating hit arcade titles to home gaming platforms. 
Williams formerly had a licensing deal with Acclaim to port its
titles to the home, but now develops the versions in-house and
distributes through GT Interactive.  Atari Games recently launched
multiple versions of Primal Rage, and is set to release home
versions of T-MEK this spring.

     There is no word whether WMS will move the 300-person Atari
Games Corp. out of the Silicon Valley or if layoffs are planned,
but WMS officials said growing its coin-op business was a main
motivator behind the purchase.  WMS reported revenues of $385
million last year and income of $19 million.

     WMS can be reached at (312) 961-1111; Atari Games, at (408)
232-3213.

ROCKET SCIENCE CEO DISCUSSES REPOSITIONING THRUST

     SAN FRANCISCO -- Rocket Science President and Chief Executive
Officer Steve Blank was quite frank about the company's
restructuring efforts at the "Staying Alive:  Reinventing Your
Company" session held at intermediaWorld in San Francisco the first
week of March.  Blank said the company has been through some
"interesting shifts in the last three years," when it began
corporate life as a game console developer.

     Rocket Science was founded in July 1993 (EGN, Feb. 19, p. 5),
and was positioned as a great technology and graphics company. 
That was a time when the "hype of multimedia and Hollywood meeting
in Silicon Valley was at its zenith," Blank said.  The reality was,
however, that "the company was not a multimedia company, but an
entertainment company in a hits-driven business."

     In addition, while the company was founded on spectacular
technology, "that did not default into great games," Blank said. 
Compounding the overall problem, according to Blank, "was a poor
choice of platforms to develop for."  The result was that Rocket
Science "produced weak games, with abysmal game play."

     The irony was that Rocket Science had hired great talent from
Hollywood effects and graphics communities, but their component
skill sets did not translate well into a game company environment.

     Blank said that Rocket Science went through a period of
re-evaluation, and put together a 12-step program for reviving the
company.  Rocket Science then committed to making major
repositioning and structural changes.  Blank said the company is
"now in the process of sitting and executing, and executing very
hard."  He quipped that employees of Rocket Science all wear
buttons around their work spaces that reflect the company's new
operating philosophy:  "It's the Game, Stupid."

     Rocket Science also initiated an intense prototype process
that takes place before any art is submitted.  Blank said that
funding the repositioning plan was made complicated by the fact
that "the game console market has  collapsed dramatically over the
past two years."  The problem for Rocket Science and other game
developers is that fixing companies takes time and money.  But,
according to Blank, "multimedia is no longer a play for venture
capitalists.  Its an entertainment business."

     That means that Rocket Science had to "reposition the company
where the money is."  Blank said that the "money in the business is
now riding on three waves of platforms:  consoles, PCs and the
Internet."

     Despite the company's market travails, Blank said this is his
sixth start-up, four of which have gone public, an option that
could be in the cards for Rocket Science.  The company's Firewalker
3D tool (developed in conjunction with Silicon Graphics Inc.;
story, p. 4) is now coming to market, and dynamics of the Internet
appear to offer game developers a strong vehicle for maximizing the
value of established game titles.  Blank believes that Rocket
Science finally realized that what the company had to deliver was
what the market was asking for.  The market always rules, according
to Blank.

MAXIS SUPPORT BY PHONE IS AROUND THE CLOCK

     It's 4:30 a.m. and SimCity's citizens are about to burn down
the courthouse because the command needed to lower taxes won't
work.  This sounds like a job for SimCity publisher Maxis and its
24-hour support line.

     Were it one year ago, they would not have been able to call
the number.  Digital Robespierres and Dantons would have burned the
city to the ground because Maxis' support number was responsive
only Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

     Maxis realized that 12 support employees working 12 hours a
day, five days a week simply was not enough, but the company could
not afford to have support staff on duty around the clock. 
Originally, Maxis combined its technical support and customer
service departments, and even brought in temporary help, but that
still was not enough.

     Enter IntelliSystems.  Intelli-Systems breezed into the
support center at Walnut Park, Calif., from Reno; it's an automatic
Interactive Expert System designed to answer and solve most
troubleshooting calls coming into a support center.

     Maxis' finances ought to show how successful automation has
been:  savings since the installation in December 1994 and
September 1995 was close to $58,000.

     The IntelliSystem program contains its knowledge in a
centralized base that customers can access via telephone, fax,
local access network or modem.  It can answer most calls because
the majority of questions result from problems frequently
encountered.

     What makes IntelliSystem especially convenient is that callers
can ring up, get the answer to a problem, save the call with the
program, hang up, try the solution and then call back.

     Maxis Customer Support Manager Roger Johnsen said that a
caller still can choose between a human or computer during normal
hours.

     "If I have a choice, I want the customer to speak to a support
representative," Johnsen said.  "IntelliSystem provides an
excellent backup for peak periods.  Amazingly enough, people will
opt for automation when they have the choice."

     Other companies that use IntelliSystem include Digital
Equipment Corp., Adobe Systems and Virgin Interactive.

     Maxis' public relations can be reached at (203) 321-1242.  The
Maxis support line is (510) 927-3905.  Answers typically average
five minutes.

SILICON STUDIO UNVEILS FireWalker

     Silicon Studio Inc., a subsidiary of Silicon Graphics Inc.,
unleashed FireWalker, an authoring system designed to enable
professional title developers to create interactive
three-dimensional titles for multiple playback platforms.  The
studio began working with Rocket Science Games (see story, p. 2) on
the technology approximately one year ago, and their first
commercial game from the alliance, "Ganymede," is expected to debut
in December for the Sony PlayStation, and in the first quarter of
1997 for personal computers.

     "As a company committed to creatively pushing the envelope, we
needed a powerful authoring environment that allows us to focus on
compelling content and head-spinning game play," said Steve Blank,
co-founder, chief executive officer and president of Rocket
Science.  Argonaut Technologies Ltd. joined in the party, too, when
it announced March 4 Silicon Studio had licensed its BRender
three-dimensional rendering software and would integrate it into
the FireWalker products.

     Sega Enterprises Ltd., Time Warner Interactive, SegaSoft and
MediaX/Toonsmiths for the Grolier Interactive product "Surf and
Destroy," will participate in the FireWalker Alpha Test Program.

     FireWalker allows title designers to "drag and drop" an
element directly into the title and position elements in scenes
without programming.  The software also supports dynamic access of
title elements over the World Wide Web for authoring and playback. 
The complete system is expected to cost approximately $1,000 for a
single-seat license with no royalty fees.

     Silicon Graphics also said March 4 that its line of work
stations will run game programming tools for developing titles for
video game consoles.  Sega's development tools division, Cross
Products Ltd., and Sony's game authoring division, Psygnosis Ltd.,
said they would use Silicon's tools for the Sega Saturn and Sony
PlayStation, respectively.

     Nintendo has been developing titles with SGI's game platform
for approximately one year and plans on using it for the Nintendo
64.  Nintendo's 64-bit system uses a MIPS microprocessor from MIPS
Technologies Inc., a subsidiary of Silicon Graphics.

     But wait, Silicon Graphics didn't stop there.  It also
announced an alliance with Apple Computer Inc. to accelerate the
development of digital studios for feature film, animation and
broadcast video.  Silicon Studios said it will support Apple's
QuickTime technology in its new StudioCentral asset management
system which delivers capabilities such as cataloging, real-time
browsing and data archiving.

     Silicon Graphics can be reached at (415) 933-6088 or
http://www.sgi.com; Rocket Science, at  (213) 938-7600 or

ONLINE PREDICTED AS THE FUTURE OF INTERACTIVE GAMES

By Paul Palumbo, West Coast Editor

     SAN FRANCISCO -- The Software Publishers Association (SPA)
sponsored an afternoon session, "Online Interactive Games:  Issues
for Developers and Services," that brought together a distinguished
group of developer and network service providers who preached that
the new world money order is going to be online games.

     While every company thinks its future is interactive gaming,
the questions of when and how publishers go about getting there
remain points of discussion.

     Panelists were Johnny Wilson, Computer Gaming World; William
Simpson, The Dreamers' Guild; Neil Harris, vice president for
marketing at Simultronics Corp. (Gemstone 3); Daniel Goldman, Total
Entertainment Network; Brian Moriarity, MPath; and Sheryl Gotto,
Kesmai Corp.

     Some of the issues discussed during the session included the
evolution of economic models (free, pay for turn, pay for time and
flat-rate pricing tiers), taking a game online or directly to the
Web, the various development models (for example, underwritten by
an online service for an advance paid against royalties) and what
the technology model allows publishers to provide online today. 
The audience was mostly game developers and online service
representatives.

What's Available

     The presentation began with an overview of what actually is
available today online.  Those types of games are mostly free for
downloading by electronic mail, and have no real business model
attached because there are no revenues generated.  There are,
however, also "play for turn" games, whereby charges vary from a
low of about $2 per turn to as high as $10 per turn.  According to
the speakers, those types of games will benefit from CyberCash and
DigiCash services because the transactions are relatively small.

     The consensus, however, was that the real money to be made is
found in the "pay for time," or real-time telecommunications
connections genre.  And those types of services will come to
fruition over providers such as The Total Entertainment Network and
Mpath's network.

     Kesmai Corp. representative Sheryl Gotto said her company does
not produce any games that don't have an online capability.  "All
of Kesmai's games are developed from the network out," she said. 
The company's titles include "AirWarrior BattleTech" and "The
Realms Of Kesmai."

     Gotto described the design characteristics in wide area
network (WAN) games vs. their boxed counterparts.  "If CD-ROMs are
like movies, then online behaves more like a soap opera because the
content has to constantly evolve," she said.  Kesmai always has
used a "pay per second" model, but is going to flat-rate pricing. 
She said that it was an "interesting dilemma for a service that is
resource-intensive."  It's a double-edged sword because "flat-rate
pricing tiers attract more people, but the costs to provision are
higher because of telecom charges."  She went on to suggest that
"multiplayer games are going to become a dominant part of the
industry," and that any provider "can't forget about the
maintenance aspect of the game."

     She cautioned that "once the game is released, that's just the
beginning."

No Burn-Out

     Daniel Goldman, chairman and president of San Francisco-based
Total Entertainment Network, said that "multiplayer gaming is a lot
more compelling because players don't burn out on it because the
user base is constantly changing, as opposed to a single player
playing a PC [personal computer] or game box."  He also said that
customer service is one of the biggest costs, but it's also a
necessity because "so much of a network's success is going to be
based on word of mouth."  Goldman also said that competition is not
the only element that attracted players to online, "it's also
cooperation and chat functions," he said.  One of the company's
major design thrusts is to minimize the impact of latency on games
and gaming.

     William Simpson of The Dreamers' Guild said that his company
is working with Microsoft Network, where the company exclusively
provisions its "Skulls, Bones and Buccaneers," "Online Baseball,"
"PlanetNet" and "Warlords of the Apocalypse" titles.  Simpson also
said that the "nature of the conduit is a major issue."

     He noted that "unpredictability of the latency on the Web and
its duration" are key issues.

Never Alone?

     Game designer Brian Moriarity of Mpath said that people like
the Web "because it satisfies the need not to be alone.  But today
it is a lonely experience."  He predicted, however, that "soon the
Web will begin to notice you."  And when that happens, the "Web
will become conversational, and therefore interactive."  Moriarity
said that there are two real uses for the Web:

     1.  Conversation.

     2.  Interactive, multiplayer games.

     He predicted that some day online games "will challenge, and
eventually eclipse single-player games."  But what is necessary is
an adequate network, sufficient users, and sufficient processing
power.  He said that what developers have been waiting for is a
chance to build the games, and an opportunity to find the poker
partners to fund  these projects.

     What will change the dynamic for online publishers, he said,
is the "first big online hit."  In the not-too-distant future, an
online game "will become so popular that the network will be
threatened with collapse because of intense user interest."

     Moriarity maintains that all publishers then will scramble to
duplicate it.  He further said that that big online hit probably
will reach beyond the enthusiast segments.  For example, millions
of people liked Trivial Pursuit and the Rubick's Cube.  He said he
believes that the game will have to be "simple to play, but
difficult to solve in totality."

10 Ways to Lose

     Neil Harris, vice president of marketing for Simultronics,
closed out the spirited session by listing the Top 10 Rules for
Losing Money Online:

     10.  Use repurposed content from another medium.

     9.  Don't use investors or partners.

     8.  Use PCs as servers.

     7.  Do exclusive deals with distribution sources and networks.

     6.  Focus on the newest technology.

     5.  Ship it and then forget about it.

     4.  Automate everything (no systems operators or live
technical support).

     3.  Focus on games with definite beginnings and endings.

     2.  Flat-rate pricing.

     1.  Don't provide users with communications capabilities.

     While there was disagreement among the panelists about the
impact of online distribution on retail and distribution, everybody
agreed that a major component of those boxed assets will be
digital.  Moriarity said that "everything that is produced should
be designed to be downloaded, because there is a chance to
transcend CD-ROM and packaging."  He also said that "the
convenience and economics of online distribution are irresistible."

     That implies a profound social contract with customers. 
Suppliers will be handling customers directly, not through
intermediaries.  They will have to respect privacy and anonymity,
treat adults like adults, and give parents the tools they need to
make informed decisions for their children.

     Beyond that, the panelists said, the most productive thing
suppliers of online games can do is get out of the way and let the
customer play.  Customers will be attracted to games that offer the
highest level of presence, with suppliers keeping low profiles.

REVISITING INDECENCY ONLINE

     Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) introduced the Online Parental Control
Act of 1996 (OPCA) March 14 to put the onus of child access to sex
and violence on the Internet in the hands of parents and guardians
instead of the federal government.

     The OPCA would replace the term "indecency" standard of the
1934 Telecommunications Act with "harmful to minors."  It also
would establish a definition for that phrase.  In addition, the
OPCA would:

     *    Maintain the Communications Act of 1934's legal defenses
against liability for people who choose to give parents technology
that blocks or restricts access to online materials deemed obscene
or harmful to minors and restricts access to such materials through
adult access codes or credit card numbers.

     *    Add two new defenses:  the use of labeling or segregating
systems to restrict access to online materials, such as systems
developed using the standards designed by the Platform for Internet
Content Selection project (PICS) and the use of other systems that
serve the same function of the other defenses if they are as
reasonable, effective and appropriate as blocking, adult access
code and labeling technologies.

     *    Protect providers or users of interactive computer
services, information content providers and access software
providers from civil or criminal liability under state law for
making available to minors materials that are indecent or harmful
to minors if they take actions to qualify for the defenses
mentioned above.

     "I'd rather have Mom and Dad monitoring their children's
online viewing habits than the government," Eshoo said, echoing a
view shared by many in the online industry.  "Technology offers the
best opportunity for parents to manage what their kids have access
to, and the OPCA encourages those technologies to be developed more
fully."

     SafeSurf, an online parents' organization that assisted in
forming an Internet rating system, joined Eshoo to promote the
acceptance of her newly introduced the telecommunications
amendment.

     "I believe that technological solutions, such as the SafeSurf
rating system, give parents the tools they need to protect their
children without sacrificing our country's First Amendment rights,"
Eshoo said.

RUNNING OUT OF CASTLES

     The Nintendo folks knew they couldn't send Mario, Luigi, et
al. through the fantasy world of castles and magic for too much
longer, so they send Mario, Luigi, Vinnie and all of Bugsy Siegel's
other bruisers through Las Vegas in the Gameboy version of their
NES release "Vegas Stakes."

     With $1,000 in the player's pocket, the first task is to
master five luck games and get into the members-only casino where
the minimum bet is $1,000 - and that's the only rule.

     Winners will get the $10 million the casino has been
"reluctant to part with."

     Released last week, "Vegas Stakes" has been set at a retail
price of $34.95.

TOP GUN, Fire at Will

     Published and Developed by, Spectrum Holobyte Inc.

     DOS; $50

     Ten years after Tom Cruise's I'm-too-sexy-for-my-cockpit cool
made women swoon and men dream of downing Libyan aircraft, Spectrum
Holobyte Inc. has released a "Top Gun" CD-ROM game that a spokesman
said is not so much a flight simulator as it is an "action flying
game."  But the action doesn't come into play until long after the
player has mastered the flight controls.

     Three reasons to leave this mostly uninteresting game on the
shelf:

     1)   Windows 95 Installation - If installed for play in MS-DOS
mode, it reboots the computer before and after game play.  If
installed for play in a DOS window in Windows 95, the video and
audio can be "choppy."  Annoying on both counts.

     2)   Testosterone Level - Too high in some respects, such as
the co-pilot's adolescent sense of humor, and too low in others,
such as the speed of action (e.g., far too much time is spent
waiting for takeoff).

     3)   Music - A cover of Kenny Loggins' "Danger Zone."  Ad
nauseam.  'Nuff said.  RL

CIVILIZATION II

     Published and Developed by Microprose

     Windows, DOS, Macintosh; $49

     Long before "Myst" "became your world," Microprose was
creating the most comprehensive strategy game anywhere. 
"Civilization II" is the long-awaited update of its popular
world-building game.

     Much has been improved since "Civ I."  The new interface is
excellent for managing complex data, and there are myriad
customizable features, including the gender of the player (a nice
PC - politically correct, mind you - touch).  Players familiar with
older versions may be shocked by the new hexagonal mapping. 
Annoyingly, there still is no option to quit to a main menu.  Setup
is relatively trouble-free, although users should opt for the
"maximum" hard disk requirements.

     This game is not for the give-em-hell "Doom" crowd.  It
requires patience and has a steep learning curve - and if the
player learns the tricks of making friends and enemies,
"Civilization II" will require more decisions than any reasonable
despot can handle.  But it is accessible enough for novices to
learn during play - with help from the manual, of course, which
reads like a good history textbook.  Like the original, this game
is addictive.  Matt Petrillo

PIPER

     Published and Developed by Splash Studios Inc.

     Windows 3.1, 95; $39.95

     There's only one way to sum it up:  This is the Pied Piper of
Hamelin Town, mysteriously moved to the Old West.  Rats, led by
Mephisto, a monstrous puppet that will scare off its intended
audience rather than simply revolt them, spread across the gold
rush town of Midas Valley in numbers that could rival Nosferatu's
horde.

     Not surprisingly, a mysterious, dandified flautist appears out
of nowhere with intentions to con, but ends up a hero.  It's not
original, but what fun is here is in the fact that your kids will
get a kick out of using the mouse and you will think, "Geez, it's
pretty neat what they put on computers nowadays!"

     The role of the piper is played by White Mighty Morphin Power
Ranger Jason David Frank, who will make the little girls pant and
the little boys gag.

     Executive Producer Patrick Ford said this is the most
ambitious studio project for CD-ROM ever made.  This is an
ambitious project, but then again, so was "Heaven's Gate."  RM

THE HIVE

     Published by Trimark Interactive;

     Developed by Rainbow America

     Windows 95; $39.95

     The graphics in "The Hive" are stellar and most any player
should appreciate its keen sense of detail.  Learn to love the
graphics, though.  First, because they're great, second because
players see the same thing repeatedly.  However, trigger-happy
gamers will be pleased by "The Hive."  It's the player's job to
shoot first, don't bother asking questions, shoot some more.

     The plot requires a user to protect the galaxy from the evil
Mob, which plans to cause a major setback (to put it mildly) for
mankind by using genetically engineered creatures to create an
ultrafatal toxin.  While one or two plots or plans may come to mind
as a means to counter the Mobster, "Hive" developers would have the
player solve the problems by cremating everything in sight, and
then some.

     One of the first titles to be created for the Windows 95
operating system, "The Hive" does makes the most of it.  However,
Trimark Interactive parent Trimark Holdings said in January that it
"took a significant reserve" for the "Hive," which is part of the
reason it reported its first quarterly loss in history.  Although
the company initially shipped more than 120,000 units of the game,
retail sales were negatively affected "by the dramatically
smaller-than-projected installed user base of the operating
system," according to the company.  SM

SPYCRAFT:  The Great Game

     Published by Activision

     DOS, Windows 95; $49.95

     It's tempting to dismiss any game that boasts a former CIA
director and former KGB major general on the development team, but
"Spycraft" manages to weave together an entertaining tale of
international intrigue through techno-puzzles and the occasional
gunfight.

     A players begins the game as a CIA operative put in charge of
a mounting crisis:  an assassin has targeted the U.S. president on
the eve of his historic trip to Russia to sign a total nuclear
disarmament treaty.  The action shuttles between CIA headquarters
in Langley, Md., and sites around Moscow, as the player hunts down
the assassin from clues left around his previous attack on a
Russian presidential candidate and the murder of a top CIA
operative in the United States.

     Two of the best features of this title are the acting and the
interface.  Clever video shots and simple directorial touches
actually make this game seem like a TV movie at times, which is an
accomplishment for this industry.  The PDA interface, a common tool
among interactive movies, lets the player catch on video and audio
e-mail messages, check the news, search through the archives of
various government agencies and even link to the Internet for clues
(although, only on the Windows 95 version).  DA

ANGEL DEVOID

     Published by Mindscape Inc.

     DOS, Mac; $35

     For every annoying item that plagues "Angel Devoid" as an
interactive movie there is something equally good that shines
through to make this a promising game - but in the end you can't
build half a glider and expect it to fly.  In this case, Mindscape
has created a first-person sci-fi mystery with many of the same
features that made "Under a Killing Moon" from Access Software both
a success and a failure.

     "Angel Devoid" borrows liberally from cult classic
"Bladerunner" to set the dark and seedy mood of this not-so-bright
future.  Beginning the game as Jake Hard, a disgruntled cop on the
cyberbeat, the player swaps identities (and faces) with
arch-terrorist Angel Devoid after being on the losing end of a
high-speed chase.  The rest of the game involves finding the real
Angel Devoid while sidestepping the legions of cops and crooks that
are out for blood.

     While the story is a cut above the usual cheesy scripts,
navigating the multiple lines of play and various endings is a
tiring process, even with the helpful hints from Jake's PDA. 
Whereas "Under a Killing Moon" packed its scenes with many possible
interactions, "Angel Devoid" ends up as an interactive story in
which the action unfolds around the character instead of the
character really participating in events.  DA

3-D FIREWORKS FOR 7TH LEVEL

     7th Level Inc. has signed an explosive deal to acquire
PyroTechnix Inc., a creator of real-time three-dimensional
rendering technology, for 300,000 shares of common stock valued at
approximately $3.3 million.  "By combining PyroTechnix' True3D
real-time rendering technology with TopGun, 7th Level's proprietary
development and playback tool, we will have one of the most
flexible, multiplatform, multimedia development tools in the
industry," said George Grayson, chairman and Chief Executive Office
of 7th Level.  "This will further strengthen 7th Level's internal
title and tools development." 

     True3D will be included in the retail version of the TopGun
tools package, expected to ship in late 1996.  "Now that more
people have a lot more powerful computers and Windows 95 has opened
up a lot of doors, I think we'll see teen and adult-oriented games
using a lot of 3-D, real-time technology," David Henkel, 7th Level
Chief Operating Office said.  However, he added, "I think we'll
still see a lot of 2-D.  Education products lend themselves to that
type of environment."

     PyroTechnix has various unannounced True3D licensing and
videogame development deals with several media-entertainment
companies for projects on Windows and Sony PlayStation platforms. 
The first fruit of those alliances, a first-person science fiction
strategy title, is expected to be demonstrated at E3 this May in
Los Angeles.

     "7th Level is building the kind of marketing and product line
up that can significantly expand PyroTechnix's technologies and
expertise into broader markets," said Sinjin Bain, president of the
privately-held company.  "In addition, by linking our technologies
with 7th Level's, we hope to create an industry standard for
real-time 3-D rendering."  PyroTechnix will retain its name and
remain in Cincinnati.  In addition, senior management and employees
will continue with the company.

AT&T'S ImagiNation RUNS WILD

     AT&T Corp. said it plans to divest its online gaming service
ImagiNation Network (INN) as part of the telecommunications giant's
plan to refocus its business model on transport and away from
content, the company announced March 6.  

     "AT&T's services such as Interchange ... and the ImagiNation
Network are being spun off in favor of services such as WorldNet,"
said Jonathan Erb, vice president of sales and marketing at
ImagiNation.  "Like most telecommunications companies, they
realized that content is not something that they are necessarily
good at."

     ImagiNation currently is looking for partners or investors to
help it continue its business.  AT&T may stay on as a minority
investor, according to Erb.  "I wouldn't be surprised if they did
remain a part of IN, it's a good learning ground."  Merrill Lynch
has been hired by AT&T to help package the network for alliances
and investment.

     "The divestiture is a good opportunity for IN.  We can go
beyond relying on AT&T to help us acquire customers.  We can go to
potential partners and offer them quick-to-market games," said Erb. 
He pointed out that, although the major commercial online services
do quite well at acquiring new members, "there's a pretty shallow
offering of high-quality games," such as tournaments that bring
gamers back to the site repeatedly.  Although no deals have been
made, Erb said, "MCI, Microsoft, AOL [America Online Inc.] and
Internet service providers are all good examples of companies that
would be good to work with."

5 Years of Gaming Experience

     ImagiNation Network offers five years of online gaming
experience, quite the veteran in this emerging market.  In
addition, within the next few months it plans to launch CyberPark,
a three-dimensional virtual reality environment with
high-resolution graphics, animated characters and entertainment and
information content.  

     "CyberPark, without a doubt, takes into account all of our
strengths over the last five years," said Erb.  In addition,
ImagiNation Network visitors spend, on average, one hour using the
service per visit, making it attractive for advertisers.

     Concurrently, the network plans on releasing enhanced versions
of games now on the network and new additions.  "We now have card
and board games, role-playing games and action sports, but we're
broadening the array and upgrading," said Erb.  Look for bigger,
better, faster versions of football and baseball games, as well as
newcomers "Metal Storm" and "Bass Fishing."

     AT&T bought the network from Sierra On-Line Inc. about 15
months ago, although it had invested in the project earlier than
that.  Five years ago, Sierra must have dusted off its crystal ball
and seen that, one day, a boxed game would have the same appeal to
some as a boxed lunch, while an online environment could offer a
smorgasbord of entertainment.

     Sierra is in the process of being acquired by CUC
International Inc.

     While the ImagiNation Network had hoped to run barefoot in the
Cyber Park, without a care in its three-dimensional virtual world,
the online gaming network finds itself lacing up those wingtips,
hitting the pavement and seeking business deals.  When its
surrogate parent, Ma Bell, recently put the service up for
adoption, INN went home to its birth parent, Sierra On-Line, to get
some guidance to help it fend for itself in the real world.

     As a result, INN announced March 13 it has signed licensing
agreements with Sierra, making the network more attractive for
potential buyers.  INN's plan is to fatten up its 3-D environment,
code-named Cyber Park, scheduled to debut this summer.

     Cyber Park now will include Sierra's latest CD-ROM games in
multiplayer online versions including "Front Page Sports:  Baseball
Online," "Mission Force:  Cyberstorm," "The Incredible Machine 3,"
"Trophy Bass" and "Red Baron II."  "NTN Trivia" also will be part
of CyberPark's lineup, as well as spades, hearts, backgammon,
cribbage, gin, poker and bridge.  The company said it is in
negotiations with other developers for additional entertainment,
educational and information content and programming.

     Cyber Park will premiere with more than 40 sites and
buildings, card and board games, as well as its own virtual money
system.  Animated nonplayer inhabited characters such as butlers,
waitresses and janitors will interact with visitors as they traipse
through the park.

     ImagiNation Network can be reached at (415) 548-2525.

DAVIDSON CATCHES A CONDOR

     Condor Inc., a developer of entertainment titles for personal
computers and game consoles, is feathering its nest thanks to a
merger it announced March 6 with Davidson & Associates Inc. 
Financial terms were not disclosed.  The privately-held Redwood
City, Calif., company has developed titles such as "Justice League"
and "NFL Quarterback Club" for Acclaim Entertainment and other
publishers.

     Condor will continue to operate independently, and retain its
staff, under the name Blizzard North, a spin-off of Davidson's
entertainment division Blizzard Entertainment located in Torrance,
Calif.  Condor is working with that division on "Diablo," a
role-playing game due out this spring, and will release other
titles under the Blizzard Entertainment name.

     "Our acquisition in 1994 of Blizzard Entertainment, one of the
most popular publishers in the industry, has proven that
high-quality entertainment software is an exciting and successful
aspect of Davidson's studio strategy," said Bob Davidson, chairman
and chief executive officer of Davidson.  "We're delighted that
Condor, one of the most well-respected game developers in the
industry has joined our family of companies.  This team of talented
developers will strengthen our leadership position in the gaming
industry while broadening our R&D capabilities."

     Privately held Condor was founded in 1993 by David Brevik,
Erich Schaefer and Max Schaefer and specializes in developing games
using three-dimensionally rendered and animated graphics.  A
spokeswoman for Davidson said the transaction with Condor would not
be affected by Davidson's merger with CUC International Inc.

     Davidson can be reached at (310) 793-0600, ext. 1230.

SIRIUS USES SECURE CD TECHNOLOGY

     Sirius Publishing has secured a deal to use 3-Di-d, a new
holographic technology for CD developed by Nimbus Manufacturing and
Applied Holographics PLC, to authenticate the winning discs for the
company's $1 million "Treasure Quest" multimedia scavenger hunt
that launches March 22.  For the discs, Nimbus and AH are creating
a hologram that will be placed on the inner mirror band of the disc
for security. 

     Several other software and entertainment companies are test
marketing the technology, as well.

     According to Robert Headrick, president of Nimbus Information,
the CD-ROM subsidiary of Nimbus CD International, the technology
incorporates true 3-D holograms onto CD without loss of disc
capacity or playing time.  Graphic images, logos, text, photographs
or animated sequences can be incorporated inside the hologram, a
treatment many companies are examining as counterfeiting increases.

     Nimbus can be reached at (804) 985-1100; Sirius, at (602)
951-3288.

ANOTHER NINTENDO 64 DELAY

     In a memo to retailers, Nintendo of America Executive Vice
President of Sales and Marketing Peter Main announced that the
Nintendo 64 will be delayed from April 21 to June 23 (EGN, Feb. 5,
p. 3).  The delay primarily is due to a shortage of semiconductor
chips.

     However, the delay will have no bearing on the U.S. launch
date of Sept. 30, according to the memo.  In Japan, the N64 will
launch with "Super Mario 64," "Pilot Wing 64" and a chess game
developed by Sega of Japan.  Retailers in Japan will accept
reservations beginning April 21.

     The U.S. version will launch with eight to 12 titles expected
to be announced at the E3 trade show in May.

WORLDWIDE E-MAIL CENSUS SOARS PAST 90 MILLION

     It seems incredible that the number of electronic mail users
worldwide has passed 90 million, but that is exactly the conclusion
the following data supports.

     The number of e-mail users worldwide jumped from 71.73 million
at the end of the third quarter of 1995 to 90.96 million at the end
of the year, a gain of 21 percent in that short amount of time.  A
year ago, the worldwide e-mail census counted 52.2 million
mailboxes, suggesting an annual growth rate of 74 percent for the
year.

     There are now 47.3 million local area network (LAN)
e-mailboxes worldwide, up from 25.2 million a year ago.  There were
29.7 million host-based mailboxes at the end of 1995, up from 19.9
million at the end of 1994.  And there are just under 14 million
public e-mail subscriptions worldwide, up from 7 million a year
ago.

     As for the American share, EMMS estimates that roughly 68
percent of the mailboxes are located within the United States. 
About 60 percent of the host mailboxes, 70 percent of the LAN
mailboxes and 80 percent of the public mailboxes are located within
the United States, EMMS estimates.  That totals about 62.1 million
e-mailboxes within the United States at year's end, and about 28.9
million in other countries.

     More than half of all e-mail users are now on LANs, the first
time that threshold has been crossed.  About 52 percent of all the
world's e-mail users are on LANs, up from 48 percent at the end of
the third quarter.  There were 47.3 million LAN e-mail users
worldwide at year's end, up from 34.4 million at the end of
September.

     Interestingly, the share of e-mail users on the public
messaging networks also is rising.  At the end of 1994, about 13.6
percent of the mailboxes were on public network services.  At the
end of 1995, about 15.3 percent were on the public networks.

Host Category Has Smaller Market Share

     Obviously, the segment with a decreasing share of the market
is the host category.  This segment isn't contracting, but neither
is it growing as fast as the other two segments.  So the 4.5
million unit gain in host mailboxes since the third quarter
translates to a 2.5 percent decline in market share (falling from
35.2 percent to 32.7 percent).

     Worldwide, the No. 1 messaging vendor continues to be IBM
Corp.  Between its domination of the LAN segment and its 1995
acquisition of Lotus Development Corp., and its continuing inertial
motion with the OfficeVision product family, IBM controls about
25.5 percent of the private mailboxes worldwide.  That share is
down marginally from the end of the third quarter and a year ago,
but is still far out in front of either Microsoft Corp. or Digital
Equipment Corp., the other contenders running in the money.

     Interestingly, Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail once again are tied
for the lead within the LAN category, as they were in the second
quarter of 1995.  cc:Mail was ahead a year ago.  MS Mail took the
lead in the first quarter.  cc:Mail regained the lead in the third
quarter.

     What makes this dogfight significant is that Microsoft sold
off its Macintosh server-based MS Mail product line to StarNine
Corp., now part of Quarterdeck Corp.  That resulted in its falling
well behind cc:Mail in the tally three months ago.  But it has made
up the lost ground in the interim.

     What makes this dogfight less significant is that both
companies are releasing new messaging product families.  Microsoft
already has Windows 95 and its Exchange Inbox on the market.  It
thereby has made e-mail, fax and Internet access a basic part of
the operating system.

     Lotus has delivered Notes Release 4, its big new messaging
server architecture.  And Microsoft expects to deliver Exchange
Server to the market in a matter of months (between one and 48
months).  So while the installed bases of cc:Mail and MS Mail will
provide the companies with a ready list of upgrade prospects, their
revenue and therefore their ultimate success will not depend on
their respective mailbox client counts.  Messaging clients - at
least the basic inbox/outbox/address book package - essentially
have joined Web browsers and image viewers on the freeware pile.

     The host messaging totals are up for three reasons.  First,
Digital Equipment representatives insist they have 7 million users
of All-In-1 and MailWorks worldwide, not the 5 million reported in
previous EMMS reports.  So EMMS revised that figure to match
theirs.  Likewise, Wang Laboratories Inc. complained of a
750,000-user undercount, and Hewlett-Packard Co. reported an actual
sales gain of 2 million mailboxes for OpenMail and OpenDesk.  The
end result of these and other readjustments is a jump of 4.5
million mailboxes, to 29.7 million host mailboxes worldwide at the
year's conclusion.

Public E-Mail Subscriptions Climb

     The number of public e-mail subscriptions counted by EMMS
continues to climb.  America Online Inc. (AOL) widened its lead to
4.5 million customers - almost a third of all public e-mail users. 
Amazingly, AOL has tripled its size since a year ago.  CompuServe
Inc., the former leader, added 1.5 million users during the year
but grew only 59 percent while doing so.

     It's a sign of how fast this segment is exploding that one
even could consider 59 percent annual growth to be disappointing. 
By the way, AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy Services Co. together now
control 72.4 percent of the customer base (but not the revenue). 
Add in newcomer Microsoft Network (MSN), and the Big 4 have 76.7
percent of the world's public mailboxes.  And with AOL launching
across Europe, MSN launching all over, and CompuServe already
worldwide, their global share is bound to increase in 1996.

Others More Elusive

     Further down the list of carriers, however, growth of any kind
was somewhat elusive.  Most of the traditional business-oriented
public messaging carriers remained even, although some of the
Internet access providers such as NetCom Online Communication
Services Inc. reported huge gains.  As the chart on p. 4 shows,
though, only nine carriers can claim more than 1 percent of the
world's e-mail subscriptions.

GENERAL ELECTRIC TAKING INTERNET CONTRACT BIDS

     Seeking to streamline its operations, General Electric Co.
launched the GE Trading Process Network (TPN) Jan. 2 to let
suppliers bid for GE contracts over the Internet.  TPN primarily
will use electronic mail to solicit bids from outside contractors,
and GE hopes to conduct about $1 billion in transactions over the
network this year.

     This would quadruple the amount of online business-to-business
transactions GE already handles through a private electronic data
interchange (EDI) network run by subsidiary GE Information Services
(GEIS), which was roughly $250 million last year, according to a
company spokesman.  GE will distribute the TPN software to
suppliers that will be able to receive information from the World
Wide Web and submit bids for projects through e-mail.

     The GEIS unit has been promoting this brand of electronic
commerce for online trading between companies as part of the
International Business Exchange (IBEX) project, officially launched
last September with AT&T Corp., Dun & Bradstreet Corp., the Global
Business Alliance, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Chase Manhattan
Bank and other partners.  IBEX is promoting an electronic
mail-based service for companies to solicit and bid on contracts
online.

     IBEX has sold over 1,000 units of its software front-end so
far, but the company is hoping for more rapid growth after AT&T,
Dun & Bradstreet and Simon & Schuster Inc. increase their marketing
and sales efforts this month.  Also, IBEX plans to solidify its
relationship with Microsoft Corp. soon so the service can be
offered to small businesses via the Microsoft Network by the end of
the first quarter.

     While GEIS is involved in this effort, its parent company
opted for a proprietary solution instead of IBEX for handling its
in-house suppliers.  According to a GEIS spokesman, the company
still is evaluating its relationship with IBEX, and is not sure
what role GE will play with IBEX in the future.

     GEIS also announced a partnership last week with X-Change
Software Inc. to expand GE's "Bid Board" service used for
electronic commerce transactions with the federal government.  The
Bid Board lets companies access and respond to federal and state
government Requests for Quotes (RFQs), but the GE service has been
limited to select military and civilian agencies.

     GE plans to incorporate X-Change's X-Bid software, which is
designed to collect RFQs from the Federal Acquisition Computer
Network, into Big Board to expand the number of agencies accessible
through the service.  X-Bid will interface with the different
agencies and automatically format a bid to fit within their
systems' parameters.  The X-Bid system is based on EDI standards.

     GE can be reached at (203) 373-2039; GEIS, at (301) 340-4712.

CompuServe Self-CENSORs AFTER GERMAN OFFICIALS COMPLAIN

     CompuServe Inc. is positioning itself as a victim of
censorship after denying all of its subscribers access to 200
Usenet news groups at the end of last month in response to
complaints from local officials in the southern German state of
Bavaria.

     Rather than fight the move in German courts, or take time to
devise a way to localize the news group blackout to selected areas,
CompuServe simply stopped carrying the 200 titles on its servers. 
It thereby ends up with the enviable position of looking like a
victim to the anti-censorship forces, and looking like a good
Internet citizen to parents, educators and others who might see
some value in the removal of alleged pornography from the Internet.

     At first, the online service claimed it acted in response to
an order from German authorities who had identified the news groups
as illegal under the country's law.  After a public outcry, German
officials appeared to backpedal by insisting they did not provide
the online service with a list of targets, and CompuServe officials
later admitted they acted without any specific order from the
authorities.

     The upshot of the verbal skirmish was that CompuServe
subscribers worldwide, not just those in Germany, were affected by
the action, but by the end of last week the online service was
trying to find a way to restrict access only to its German
customers.  CompuServe spokeswoman Daphne Kent would not speculate
as to when, or even if, access would be restored but said the
company is "always concerned" that blocking access to information
could cost it customers.  Kent said no other online service was
similarly restricted and said "we were likely targeted because of
our size."

     Although smaller than its chief competitor, America Online
Inc., CompuServe has the greatest overseas presence of any consumer
online service.  In Germany it claims 100,000 members.  The number
is insignificant, however, in comparison to the more than 1.8
million individuals who use the Internet in Germany and whose
access to the same news groups is harder to restrict, depending
upon their method of access.

     Kent said CompuServe is "looking at several options," among
them implementing a system that would restrict access to news
groups by region of the world and a "software solution" customized
to abide by each country's laws.

Was This an Accident?

     Observers note that even before the Germans provided
CompuServe with an official excuse to censor, the carrier refused
to list the titles of many of the more risque (alt.) news groups in
its index.  Users who knew the exact names of those unlisted groups
still could subscribe, although all access is now cut off.

     Across most of the media coverage of the CompuServe action,
the spin put on the news was that governments were censoring the
Internet.  It's happened in Singapore, Canada, Germany, and soon
may happen in the United States.  Internet users screamed their
rage in some undiplomatic postings, calling for boycotts of
everything from CompuServe to German beer.

     One question remains:  Suppose CompuServe had concluded that
being known as the family channel is desirable and profitable? 
Perhaps CompuServe, as it fends off AOL, Europe Online, the
Microsoft Network and other services in Germany, Britain and
France, has discovered that parents are concerned about what their
kids are reading?  By cutting access to many of those XXX news
groups that parents fear, CompuServe has made worldwide, mainstream
news.  Does anyone believe this was an accident?

     AOL, which recently launched a German online service with
German publisher Bertelsmann AG that relies heavily on
Internet-based content, has yet to encounter any similar
difficulties.  AOL spokeswoman Pam McGraw said the company is
investigating the CompuServe issue, but has yet to receive any
notification from the German authorities.

     "To the best of our knowledge, we have not received any
requests from the German government," she said.

     However, McGraw added, AOL offers users the ability to block
access to news groups, which may be its saving grace.  Although
CompuServe's Internet division offers Internet access software with
the ability to block access to adult content, the company's
flagship online service does not offer the same capability.

     CompuServe can be reached at (614) 538-4632.

14TH ANNUAL READERS POLL BALLOTING IS UNDER WAY

     As it has done every year since 1982, EMMS again is scanning
the world of electronic messaging, looking for the best of the year
gone by.

     Once again, we're asking readers to vote for what they think
was the best messaging hardware, software, service and company of
the year, as well as the most important messaging event of 1995.

     It was extremely difficult to trim the list of nominees in
each category to 20 candidates.  Therefore, as always has been the
case, additional write-in votes are welcome and encouraged.

     The voting was scheduled to begin over the weekend of Jan.
19-21.  Everyone who has voted at least once since 1991 should have
received a ballot in his or her mailbox.  People who voted but who
didn't receive a ballot by today should contact EMMS to find out
why.  Most likely, some minor change in the voter's user name or
host name prevented EMMS from making a successful delivery.

     People who haven't voted previously are welcome to do so. 
There are several options available.  Included in this issue is a
written ballot, which readers may complete and mail or fax back to
EMMS.  Users who prefer an electronic ballot can send a request to
the mailbox earnum@attmail.com.  They automatically will receive a
ballot by return e-mail.

     In addition, EMMS is posting a copy of this ballot to several
Usenet News Groups, including:

          comp.dcom.fax

          comp.dcom.modems

          comp.groupware.groupwise

          comp.mail.misc

          comp.os.magic-cap

          comp.os.ms-windows.apps.winsock.mail

          comp.os.msdos.mail-news

          comp.protocols.iso.x400

          comp.protocols.iso.x400.gateway

     It also will become available for down-loading from the EMMS
publisher's home page on the World Wide Web, at the address
http://brp.com.

     As mentioned, the voting already has begun.  It is scheduled
to conclude Saturday, Feb. 10, 1996, which allows readers about
three weeks to vote.  Ballots will be counted in the days that
follow, and the results will be announced in four weeks, in the
Feb. 19, 1996, issue of EMMS.

Open to All E-Mail, Fax Users

     As in past years, voting is open to all e-mail and fax users. 
Multiple votes from different people in the same company routinely
are received and counted.  Voters are encouraged to pass along
blank copies of the ballot to their friends and co-workers, to post
copies of the ballot on their internal bulletin boards, and to
otherwise involve additional people in the process.

     Multiple votes from the same person, however, are discouraged. 
Two good ways around that rule, however, are to register five
different screen names on America Online Inc., and to vote from
each one.

     Alternatively, users can send e-mail ballots to EMMS via their
Netscape Navigator browsers, which allow users to change their
return addresses at will.  EMMS, however, uses a special tabulation
algorithm when multiple votes from the same source are discovered.

     In years past, the number of voters has tended to surpass 450,
involving people in more than a dozen countries.  It is hoped that
the count this year will surpass those tallies.

     Voting takes place in five categories:  Messaging Hardware of
the Year, Messaging Software of the Year, Messaging Service of the
Year, Messaging Company of the Year and Messaging Event of the
Year.  Winners receive a certificate commemorating their receipt of
an "EMMSy Award," suitable for mounting.

     This year, the hardware category is again dominated by modems
and fax machines.  There are, however, several personal
communicators, scanners and voice mail systems on the list as well.

     The software category is as usual the most competitive of the
five.  Only a small fraction of the total number of notable
messaging software products released in 1995 would fit on the list. 
They range from operating systems such as Windows 95 to
mail-enabled applications such as Decisive Survey.  This category
more than any other is a dependable source of write-in votes.

     The messaging service category contains a diverse mix of voice
mail services, wireless and satellite messaging carriers,
Internet-related networks, and specialized offerings of the major
online services.

     The list of nominees in the messaging company category
reflects the cross-section of nominees in the other categories. 
These are the companies that in some way made a name for themselves
during the year - some through their arrival, others through their
return, and still others through their continued ability to
dominate their market niches.

     And finally, the messaging event category contains a motley
list of trade shows, mergers, demos, lawsuits and product
announcements that helped shape the messaging industry in 1995.

     Undoubtedly, there are products, services, companies and
events that didn't make it onto the list of nominees.  For that
reason, EMMS will list all of the top write-in vote-getters in the
Feb. 19 issue, alongside the eventual winners.  On occasion, in
fact, a write-in nominee actually has won an award.

     In addition to the list of winners and other top vote-getters,
EMMS will publish a roster of all voters who check off the "Yes"
box where it says "Please list me as a voter."  It's our way of
recognizing the people who make this Readers Poll possible.  It's
also a way for readers to get their names immortalized in a variety
of online databases, news clipping services and other services that
currently carry electronic copies of EMMS.

     Let the voting begin, and good luck to all the nominees.

EMMS Stock Index Year in Review; EMMS STOCK INDEX UP 33% FOR THE
YEAR

     Despite the huge hit that computer and telecommunications
stocks have taken in recent weeks, the EMMS index of 58 stocks was
up 33 percent for the year gone by.

     The stocks fell 2.9 percent in the final month of 1995, their
third monthly decline for the year and their biggest loss since
November 1994.

     Two stocks - General Magic Inc. and UUNET Technologies Inc. -
began trading publicly for the first time during 1995 and therefore
are not included in the annual comparisons.  Companies such as
Lotus Development Corp., which were acquired by larger companies
during the year, were subtracted from the annual comparisons.

     In addition, because of acquisitions made during 1995,
companies such as Netscape Communications Corp., Symantec Inc. and
Quarterdeck Corp. shortly will join the EMMS index, as will several
other companies that completed initial public offerings in the
latter part of the year.  Finally, after decades of domination by
very large public companies (IBM Corp., Digital Equipment Corp.,
MCI Communications Corp. and AT&T Corp. among them) and very small
private companies, a cluster of medium-sized messaging companies is
now listed on the stock exchanges.

     Among the 58 stocks now included in the EMMS index, and the
five to 10 candidates for future inclusion, are a good number of
companies that make most or all of their sales in the messaging
arena.  In fact, some of the Internet-related new issues of 1995
were among the hottest stocks on the market - or they were for
their first few weeks of trading, at least.

Slow Compared to Others Indices

     Compared to the major stock indices, the EMMS index actually
was a little slow during 1995.  While the EMMS index was up 33
percent, the NASDAQ Composite Index was up 40 percent.  The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 34 percent, and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was up 33 percent during the year.

     However, EMMS dug up statistics for 1994 as well, and
discovered something intriguing.  Compared to prices two years ago,
the EMMS index is up almost 56 percent, while the NASDAQ is up 35
percent, the S&P 500 up 32 percent, and the Dow up 36 percent.

     In the accompanying chart on p. 13, the progress of the four
indices is compared, by setting each to equal 100 in December 1993. 
As the chart shows, each index took its dips during 1994, actually
declining in price for months at a time.

     The EMMS index spent only three months of the last 24 below
its December 1993 price - May through July 1994.  It underwent an
almost uninterrupted climb from November 1994 to November 1995 -
peaking at a total 60.6 percent ahead of its 1993 close.

     The Dow, meanwhile, set new highs in December, as did the S&P
500.  The NASDAQ peaked in November, but none of the major indices
is as far ahead of its 1993 closing prices as the EMMS index.

     The 56 stocks that traded for the entire year are listed in
descending order in the chart to the right.  Of those on the list,
43 were up while 13 were down.  Microlog Corp. posted the largest
percentage gain in 1995 - plus 641 percent - while Retix posted the
largest percentage decline -  minus 47 percent.  Eight stocks more
than doubled their per-share prices during the year.

     U.S. Robotics Inc. posted the largest dollar gain per share -
$66.13 - but percentagewise that represents only a quadrupling of
its price.  Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.'s $26.25 gain was good for
a 176 percent leap, while Microsoft's $26.62-per-share gain was
good for only a 44 percent increase.

     The Canadian carrier MPACT Immedia Inc., while up an
impressive 273 percent for the year, was up by that percentage only
because its price was so low a year ago.  MPACT Immedia gained
$3.25 a share to close the year at $4.44 per share.

     Welcome to the first issue of ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT

     Welcome to the first issue of ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT
NEWS, the latest addition to the Phillips Publishing, Inc. family

automation as a vehicle through which to attain a competitive
edge.  Today, executives of companies as large as IBM and as
small as the family-owned customs brokers, are focusing on ways
to leverage strategic benefits that come from computerizing trade
data.
     Every other week ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS will
report on the trends and developments that are changing the way
products are bought sold and moved.  Phillips Publishing is
uniquely positioned to bring you this information because its
experienced team of editors has been providing hard-hitting,
analytical coverage of the competitive communications strategies
for more than a decade.  Tim Shorrock, who has been reporting on
international trade, transportation and the Pacific Rim for 10
years, will continue as editor.  Now here's the news:

NYNEX BUYS LAMARIAN SYSTEMS

     Nynex Corp. took a major step toward its goal of becoming a
global provider of business software and professional services by
buying Lamarian Systems Inc., the Greenbelt, Md., management and
systems consulting firm that specializes in transportation and
international trade.  Under the terms of the acquisition,
Lamarian will continue to operate independently as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Nynex International, which represents Nynex from
offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Geneva, London and New York.

Strategic Alliances with PTTs

     As one of the regional spinoffs of AT&T, Nynex is prohibited
from manufacturing equipment, providing interstate or
international telephone services and selling information
services.  But it can provide telecommunications gateways and
value-added services, such as consulting or software.  To this
end, the company has established a string of what it calls
"strategic alliances" with PTTs (postal, telephone and telegraph
agencies) around the world.  In Europe, Nynex provides telephone
network management services to British Telecom and France
Telecom; computer software to the British financial services
industry; and high-speed data and facsimile transmissions between
Scandinavia and the United States.
     In Asia, the company has formed consulting relationships
with PTTs in Japan, Australia, Singapore, the People's Republic
of China and Taiwan.
     Last year, Nynex signed a broad marketing and technical
agreement with Data Communications Corp. of South Korea (Dacom),
a state-owned company that provides the gateway for all of that
country's EDI communications.
     Nynex has also been scouring world markets for potential
acquisitions and, like several other Baby Bells, is deeply
involved in the cellular telephone industry in Europe.  "They've
got money coming out of their ears," said a software vendor
familiar with the company.
     Overall, Nynex views its business mission as improving
telecommunications services for its large multinational
customers.  The Lamarian acquisition "fits very nicely" into that
strategy "because of the international nature of trade and
transportation," said Susan Simon, director of strategy assurance
for Nynex International, which is headquartered in White Plains,
N.Y.  "We're really excited about the deal."

Lamarian: Projects in Australia, Agreements with GEIS

     For Lamarian, the link with Nynex will provide financial
resources, technology and sales expertise as well as a presence
in more than 70 countries.  Nynex also offers a sophisticated
laboratory that can bring additional technology to the company.
"This is what we've been looking for for a long time--a worldwide
reach," said Harry Latimer, president of the company, in an
interview with ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS.
     Lamarian develops and markets software for government
agencies and companies involved in international trade and
transportation.  It has extensive experience in the port and
ocean shipping industries and was the prime contractor for the
U.S. Customs Service's Automated Commercial System.  Latimer has
a background in the trucking and rail industries, where he served
as MIS director for several leading carriers.
     In recent years, Lamarian has staked out a strong position
in international transport services.  Among its current projects:


      An EDI system for the Port of Melbourne, Australia.
     Lamarian is also conducting a business needs analysis for
     Tradegate, the Australian national port system.  This
     summer, Latimer will be joining a tour of Australia with the
     companies participating in Tradegate to market the concept
     to other ports.  "Australia is a natural target for
     expansion."

      A contract with Columbus Lines, the West German steamship
     line with offices in Hamburg and Newark, N.J., to develop an
     EDI customer interface system for its U.S. customers that
     will later be expanded into Australia, Germany and South
     America.

      Software development and information consulting for Racers,
     the community information system for the ports of San
     Francisco and Oakland, Calif.  Now in pilot stage, the
     Racers system will include what Latimer calls a "simple EDI
     mailbox" that will allow a user to convert a message into
     EDI or facsimile and transmit electronically to another
     party.  The system will also include an expert system that
     will allow users to translate from one message to another.

      An agreement with General Electric Information Services
     (GEIS) to provide an electronic link with the U.S. Customs
     Service's Automated Manifest System.  Using Lamarian's Ocean
     Going Management System, forwarders, carriers and shippers
     will be able to transmit manifest data to Customs via the
     GEIS network, speeding up the process for cargo clearance.
     All the information on the system will be in EDI format,
     which will allow users to channel the data to home offices
     and other parties.  Latimer said Lamarian is also working on
     a tariff and booking interface for the system.

     The non-exclusive remarketing alliance with GEIS will
continue, despite the acquisition by Nynex.  "We think [the GEIS
agreement] is a very positive relationship and will bring
additional market coverage," said Nynex's Simon when asked if
GEIS might be viewed as a potential competitor in the interna-
tional trade field.  Lamarian and GEIS were meeting last week to
formulate their plans, according to Latimer.
     Nynex and Lamarian will be announcing plans for other
software services and capabilities in a month.  "Our plan is to
work together to grow Lamarian and make them stronger, bigger and
better," said Simon.

THE SLOW PACE OF AUTOMATION  IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

     There was a sober undercurrent to the International Trade
     and Computerization Show sponsored by the NCITD-
     International Trade
Facilitation Council in New York earlier this month.  Despite
tremendous advances in computer and software technology and the
obvious and pressing need for automation, it was clear that a
comprehensive information system for handling the demands of
international transportation and logistics is still a long way
off.
     The difficulties facing the industry were underscored on the
opening day of the conference, when the Federal Maritime
Commission (FMC), citing technical problems, cancelled a session
on the FMC's long-awaited computerized database for ocean tariff
rates (see p. 8).  They were also evident in many of the
conference sessions devoted to EDI and automation, where speakers
consistently focused on the gap between what they want and the
information products and services currently available on the
market.
     Another sign of the complexities of international trade
automation was the number of companies that didn't show up.
Infonet Network Services, which 6 months ago announced a master
plan to develop a global EDI system for transport, was nowhere to
be seen.  AT&T and British Telecom, which are also aiming at the
global logistics market, were absent as well.  The London-based
Export Network, which is reportedly having trouble lining up
customers for its forwarder-shipper network (now months behind
schedule) didn't send a representative, a strange move for a
company that has spent thousands of dollars to build a U.S.
customer base.

Some Signs of Optimism

     To be sure, there were signs of optimism at the meeting.
The U.S. Customs Service announced that it was seeking funds
to build an automated system for exports in cooperation with the
Commerce Department.  Several firms displayed new, innovative
automation packages for exports.  Financial services for trade,
for so long the missing ingredient at these shows, finally
appeared to be making some progress.
     And in a keynote speech, Lynn Fritz, president and sole
shareholder of Fritz & Co., said the U.S. forwarding industry was
"remarkably well-postured" to dominate the world market for trade
services in a similar manner that American insurance and
accounting firms have dominated in their sectors.
     But Fritz also issued a warning to firms that don't keep up
with customer demands for automation:  "Companies that don't
deliver the goods...will suffer the modest pains of extinction,"
he said.
     In short, the NCITD show gave the appearance of an industry
that is treading water and waiting for something to happen.
Participants and speakers identified 3 key problem areas:

     The general lack of interest in EDI among small and medium
companies.  Currently, nearly half of the companies on the
Fortune 500 are using, or planning to use, EDI.  Even if the
remaining 50 percent and the next tier of suppliers and customers
becomes EDI-capable in the 1990s as expected, that will still
leave thousands of companies hooked on paper.  "The vast majority
of shippers are not automated, and that's a big issue," said Pano
Anthos, vice president of Syntra Ltd., a New York software house
specializing in international trade.

     The continued use by the largest shippers--particularly
multinational corporations--of proprietary communications systems
and networks.  In several workshops it was noted that major U.S.
firms doing business in Europe, including Ford Motor Co. and IBM,
are not only using but expanding the private communications
networks they use for international transactions.  "One reason
EDI is moving very, very slowly is because people are operating
in a proprietary environment," said Tony Barone, vice president
of Randy International, a New York air freight forwarder that has
been using EDI for international communications for over a year.
"That makes it difficult to benefit if you're using EDI."

     The frustrations of booking cargo electronically.  "The
problem is, every [carrier] is different," said Duncan Alexander,
director of export services for Johnson & Johnson International
and chairman of the NCITD's computerization committee.  "It's
just not worth the trouble to go into each carrier's PC system."
Hank Ulrich, president of H.B. Ulrich & Associates Inc., a
"systems solutions" firm that works with Johnson & Johnson,
complained that the major ocean carriers "have been talking EDI
for many years, but there's always something they can't do."  Few
can offer the capabilities to accept electronic booking notices
or bills of lading, he noted.  Another serious drawback: the
inability of most carriers to provide electronic confirmation of
delivery.  "We have people who do nothing but call the airlines"
to see if a shipment has arrived, said Barone.

One Big Database?

     To resolve these problems, some shipping executives have
proposed a "one-stop" data bank that would allow them to make
bookings and receive confirmation statements on steamship lines
(as well as air cargo carriers) using EDI.
     In an interview, Johnson & Johnson's Alexander said he
envisions a "generic system" similar to the Sabre passenger
reservation system that travel agents use to find available seats
and book flights.  "We'd like to have one telephone number to
book cargo in standard formats with every line," he said.
     But past efforts in that direction have failed commercially.
At the same time, carriers have balked at the "one-stop" idea
because they believe a generic reservation system would expose
confidential information.  "The problem is, carriers fear that
their customer list would be made public," said R.T. Crowley, a
former steamship executive who now heads his own transportation
consulting firm, C.W. Consultants.  "That's one of the things
that will hold booking close to the lines."
     Crowley suggested 2 alternatives: centralized booking
systems operated by shipping conferences (an idea being pursued
by the Atlantic Conference); and a mailbox system operated by the
value-added networks that would allow shippers to dial a
carrier's mailbox and transmit shipping data.
     But Alexander said the concept of a common database for
shippers shouldn't be dismissed.  "Banks move billions of dollars
every day by wire," he said.  "They've handled the
confidentiality problem.  If there can be a global market in
finance and security trading, why not in transportation?"

IBM LOGISTICS STRATEGY STILL A MYSTERY AFTER NCITD SESSION

     IBM raised more questions than it answered at a May 31
     presentation before the NCITD computerization committee.
     The session, which focused on IBM's work to assist shippers
and carriers in the integrated logistics and information systems
areas, sparked intense speculation, particularly among shippers
and software vendors.  Would there be a major product
announcement?  Was the company going to disclose its list of
software partnerships for trade and transport?

Speculation prompted by IBM

     These questions were prompted by IBM itself, which has
expressed strong interest in the logistics industry.  Last year,
executives from IBM's International Trade Solutions Group in
Boulder, Colo., told us that it was developing products for the
international trade market (see "IBM Readies 'Total Solution' for
International Trade," COMPUTERS IN TRADE & TRANSPORT, October
1989).
     At the same time, other divisions of IBM have been active in
developing data systems for the trucking and rail industry.  Last
January, IBM announced a joint venture with Motorola Inc. to
market a nationwide network that will allow companies to provide
mobile workers with direct access to computer databases through
hand-held terminals built by Motorola and a radio network built
by IBM.                   According to John Pemberton, an IBM
analyst with the Gartner Group, the company is also working on 2
major projects in the mobile satellite/data communications area:
an onboard PC that will be compatible with satellite-based
systems for the trucking industry, built by such vendors as
Geostar and Qualcomm; and an international mobile network for
companies with large field operations, such as food franchises
and oil and gas companies.
     On the carrier side, IBM is reportedly developing automated
communications dispatch systems for Consolidated Freightways,
Roadway Inc. and J.B. Hunt--3 of the largest motor carriers in
the United States.  IBM is also working closely with Sea-Land
Service Inc. on automatic equipment identification systems for
ocean shipping and on Automatic Train Control Systems with CSX
Transportation Inc.
     "I'm getting some very strong indications there are some
major things going on with IBM" in the logistics area, said
Pemberton.

Framework for Logistics

     But NCITD members looking for an integrated automation
system geared to the needs of shippers were disappointed.
Instead, the group was presented with a pitch for IBM's latest
product offerings in office technology and services, centered
around IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA), a vehicle
for systems integration being marketed aggressively in the U.S.
business community.
     IBM, said David R. Livingstone, industry administrator for
IBM's transportation industry marketing division based in
Southbury, Conn., is ready to "support the emergence of a general
framework for integrated logistics" and "end-to-end freight
movement."  To do that, "We now have all the products in place to
create one single image of the enterprise...All the pieces are
here."  In areas where information gaps exist, Livingstone said,
IBM is ready to work with customers on such new technologies as
automatic equipment identification, barcode scanning and high-
performance databases.  Some examples:

      For strategic planners, IBM will "put in your shop
tomorrow" an Executive Information System based on the "Office
Vision" component of SAA that will allow executives to plan
marketing, pricing, routing and scheduling of cargo.  The system
can also be augmented by artificial intelligence (expert systems)
for short-term forecasting and other functions.

      In the air cargo industry, where all the players use paper
and telephone and there is "no tactical, strategic or real-time
data for rapid delivery," IBM will provide a "simple relational
database" that could be integrated with automatic equipment
identification and radio-frequency barcoding to track containers.
A similar framework is possible for ocean shipping.

      To build that "single image" framework, IBM has available a
wide range of products, including EDI translation software and
local area networks that will provide a "common user view from PC
to mainframe."  IBM will even provide a mouse-driven graphic
interface that "resembles a video game" and requires "no
knowledge of computers."

      For companies that want to improve their control over the
flow of paper, IBM has developed image processing software that
automatically queues a document to the next person in the chain
and allows a supervisor to prioritize documents and monitor
employees.  The software can be linked to a telephone switching
system that routes customer calls to a designated employee and
simultaneously recalls the image of the customer's document on a
computer screen.  Image-processing technology, said Livingstone,
has many uses in transportation, including customer service
departments, inter-line cargo scheduling and exchanges of data
between freight forwarders and carriers.

Internal IBM Strategies Unclear

     In an interview, Livingstone said IBM's transportation
strategy was "reasonably well-integrated with other IBM groups."
But it became clear during the presentation that the transport
and international trade groups were not entirely in synch.
     At one point, software executive Pano Anthos said that IBM's
integrated approach would be "difficult to justify to senior
management" because there is no single depository for the carrier
data needed for a strategic analysis.  "Even the IBM network is
mostly proprietary," he said.  "It would be helpful if a
corporation selling a technology would be a leader in using that
technology."
     That prompted someone to ask if IBM's international trade
solutions group was using EDI standards.  The answer: no, the
group uses internal standards.  In that case, what are your plans
for standards?  In international purchasing "we are moving in the
areas of standards and will support the emergence" of Edifact,
responded John Gates, a top executive with the group.
     That apparent double-standard angered some participants.
"IBM has a lot of nerve talking about the carriers not connecting
when the VANs have no interconnection abilities themselves," said
one executive.  Other participants said the presentation focused
too heavily on domestic carrier operations and questioned the
wisdom of promoting image-processing technology at a time when
the shipping community is trying to expand the use of EDI.
     But the most scathing comment came from a systems
integration specialist, who said the entire program was
"inappropriate."  "This was only something IBM could have done,"
he said.  "It really shows the clout of Big Blue...Do you think
that an Ordernet or a Kleinschmidt could have asked for an hour
and a half on the NCITD agenda?  No way."

Analyst View

     Pemberton--who did not attend the session--said IBM's
emphasis on systems architecture has important implications for
the logistics industry.  "We believe IBM is trying to extend the
SAA architecture framework from the office out to field
operations," he said.  "That's maximum capture [of data].  DEC
[Digital Equipment Corp.] and the other vendors aren't even
watching the ball game on this one."
     IBM's "end-game," he said, "isn't the dispatcher looking for
some better gadget to monitor something.  It's the information
system itself."  If IBM is successful in building a system that
can integrate office communications, EDI and mobile satellite
technology with the SAA platform, he said, "they're in fat
city...That's where they sell mainframes, AS-400s and everything
else."

CUSTOMS SEEKING FUNDS FOR EXPORT SYSTEM

     The U.S. Customs Service has asked the Bush administration
     to provide $40 million to allow Customs and the Census
     Bureau to capture export data.  The proposed system, said
     Samuel Banks, assistant
commissioner for commercial operations, would provide a tool for
Customs to communicate with customs agencies in other countries
and would simplify the classification of goods under the
harmonized system.  "This is a major undertaking," he told
ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS.  "But we can't do it without a
commitment" from the administration.
     "As a unit volume, exports have increased substantially
since the fourth quarter of 1982, to over 10 million per year,"
Banks told the NCITD.  "We should have learned by now that we
can't always depend on other countries to tell us which of our
products have crossed their borders.  If we make this initiative
work, the benefits will be immediate and substantial."

FMC AUTOMATED TARIFF SYSTEM UNDER REVIEW

     The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) abruptly cancelled a
scheduled speech to the NCITD about the FMC's proposed system for
automating ocean freight rates May 30.  In a letter to the group,
FMC Commissioner Rob Quartel said the speaker, James Warner,
stayed in Washington because the FMC is "reviewing a number of
elements related to the development of the automated tariff
filing and information system (ATFI)."
     The incident left many NCITD members wondering if there were
deeper political or technical problems with the system, which was
designed to computerize access to the thousands of ocean freight
rates maintained by the FMC.  "There should have been a
representative here to talk to people," said R.T. Crowley, a
transportation consultant.  "This approach only caused rumors and
speculation."

Problems with Contractor

     Last summer, the FMC awarded contracts for the ATFI system
to Planning Research Corp. (PRC), a Virginia consulting firm, and
DXI Inc., a Pittsburgh software vendor.  According to a source
close to the FMC, the agency has become "very dissatisfied with
what PRC has done."  The source said the FMC is backing away from
its plans to build a large database for freight rates and
studying an "approach more like U.S. Customs" in which steamship
lines prepare and transmit shipping data directly to the agency.
     Tariff filing is just one aspect of ATFI that's being
studied, said Quartel, who spoke to ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT
NEWS last week to "end any uncertainty" about the automation
project.  Quartel, who chairs the FMC automation committee, said
that while the FMC "doesn't know precisely where we are" on
filing, "our goal is to make it as easy as possible" for both
small and large carriers.  The FMC is also looking at how the
filing system will affect the agency's internal operations, and
has asked the contractors to survey other data products on the
market.

Major Shift

     In a significant shift from earlier plans, Quartel said he
had asked the contractors to change the interface technology on
the user side from dumb terminals to PCs.  The testing phase, he
said, showed that the system "was not as user-friendly as we
would have liked it to have been."
    Quartel said he is concerned that "the private sector is
moving faster and more innovatively than we might be, so I wanted
to make sure we were on the right track from that standpoint."
     "As a global issue," he continued, "we have to be very
cognizant of moves towards the ending of paper...Ultimately,
we've got to find a way to carry this electronically from the
creation of a contract between shipper and carrier all the way
down to the bill of lading and Customs.  Our goal is not to get
in the way of that."
     The FMC will issue a report on ATFI in several weeks and
will be asking for comments from ocean carriers and shipping
conferences at that time, Quartel said.

PLAN NOW FOR '96


INTRO

Which baseball player once said, "It's tough to
make predictions-especially about the
future"? It's not tough in the technology industry
so long as you relegate its dazzle to
third place. First and second: the capitalization
of the technology's packagers and their
marketing (not just advertising) smarts.

Don't rush into buying laptops

Intel is pulling the rug out from under the laptop
makers' monopoly on motherboards. It
plans to package cheap generic Pentium
motherboards that any vendor can mold into its
laptops. So watch for laptop prices to drop
several hundred dollars by year's end-and try
not to buy until they do.

You'll see IBM suffer again in '96 for their lack
of mass-marketing savvy as they keep
trying to sell Aptivas and OS/2 to the home market
instead of businesses. Apple, too,
will keep ignoring markets that love them
(engineers, designers and publishers). While
they woo generic users in business, homes and
schools, software vendors will scale back
Mac support.

Microsoft has an evangelist to the accounting
profession and just struck a deal to bundle
Big Bill's software with Compaqs. So we'll see
more ads (and editorial praise) for
Compaq in other accounting publications in '96.
But Compaq won't win back all those
CPA firms that powered its early success until it
stops hugging the high end of the price
scale.

Buzzwords to learn and use

For three years, the AICPA's Information
Technology section has ranked EDI first in
important technologies for CPAs to understand. '96
could be the year your clients
pressure you to add it to their accounting
packages. Luckily, smart accounting software
makers will supply the link this year. We'll help
you with EDI how-tos-and alert you to
good EDI seminars.

This is the year that mainstream CPA firms will-
for the first time-give serious thought
to encouraging members to telecommute. Reasons: It
can cut real estate and furnishing
costs, travel budgets and absenteeism. And managed
right, it will increase productivity.
If your firm wants to stay competitive, you'll
start using groupware this year: a program
like Lotus Notes or Collabra Share if you occupy
several offices, one like Word if your
groups are simple. Biggest benefit: multiuser
simultaneous document revision with all
changes and remarks stamped with date, time and
reviser's initials. One or all can then
review all changes and accept them fast in whole
or part.

This year, you'll be able to set clients up with
publication warehousing (also called
publishing on demand). They'll then store
catalogs, manuals, policy handbooks and
similar publications on disk and desktop-publish
up-to-date copies as needed. Your firm,
too, will try harder this year to run a paperless
office. Biggest winners: our forests and
everyone's paper budgets.

In '96, says editor-at-large Rick Richardson,
you'll pare overtime and temp wages if you
use agents-1996's stunning successor to your old
DOS batch files. Why? Every night at
11 pm, an agent in our backup software backs up
all our files without a human
command. Every time a new subscriber joins our
ranks, an agent in Commence (see
CPACR 1/95, p. 2) starts Word, opens the right
file, inserts the subscriber's name and
prints a binder cover page-all on its own.

Windows 95 has only limited agentry powers. Free
first aid: Richardson's list of vendors
who sell add-on or stand-alone agents is yours
free from us for a phone call, a fax, an E-
mail note-or pick it up at our Web site.

This year, if your firm's growing, you'll want to
switch to US Robotics, Motorola or
another vendor's ISDN-ready modems. They plug into
ISDN lines or regular phone
lines. In cities with reasonable Baby Bells, ISDN
will gain you a lot of bandwidth for
configuring as phone lines, web connections, video
lines and more (see this issue's
Bookshelf item, p. 8).

If your firm's small, you'll discover the joys of
non-ISDN modems that can pass along
caller ID data. We tied Motorola's new Power
Series 28.8 Data/Fax Modem into the
subscriber database kept by Commence. It pulls a
subscriber's record onscreen as we
pick up the phone!

Buzzwords to ignore in '96

P6 PCs? No way! Even the most eager vendors can't
yet buy a model that works. Your
P5 (Pentium) PCs won't become obsolete in '96.
Another sure thing: When the next
chip's advertised, mark my word: it won't be
called a Sexium.

Data warehousing? CPAs aren't the only ones
dreaming of being able to list all the
scattered company data in one virtual warehouse
that lets any user access it on
command. There's been progress-but don't expect a
standard technology to be ready in
'96.

Internet commerce? Watch it stall in '96 as buyers
get bored surfing the rubbish that'll
glut the ether. (Example: one university's selling
ads aimed at accountants surfing their
accounting department's site.) Who'll make money
on the Net?

Computer hardware and software vendors, who'll cut
real-time tech support costs by
side-tracking users to online support stations;

vendors of products with nerd appeal, such as net-
linked multiplayer games;

overseas vendors of products that people can't (or
won't) buy face-to-face-so long as
they're delivered in plain wrappers. Congress will
learn that they can't pass laws
banning international Internet commerce.

Information extractors? Don't fall for this year's
replacement for last decade's promise of
expert systems. As your firm's shower of online

THE QUEST FOR A PROFITABLE CLIENT WRITE-UP


INTRO

Ever since CPAs started losing write-up business
to clients who think they can be their
own accountants using programs like One-Write Plus
and Quicken, we've been
encouraging write-up software vendors to give us
ammunition to fight back. When I met
with a number of them in 1994, they agreed that
heftier write-up software could help
CPAs give clients management information they
can't get from low-end accounting
software.

We're still waiting. All that's happened is that
one vendor I met with-Peachtree-dumped
its write-up program.

The biggest hope for write-up's future is Windows,
which can provide easy, effortless
data swapping between compliant programs. Knowing
that, subscribers have been
phoning to ask about the Windows write-ups. Our
verdict: Sorry. First-generation
Windows write-ups show promise, nothing more.

So Rigotti & Assoc. of Taylor, MI, sticks with
BusinessWorks (see review on p. 9). CPA
Mark Rigotti explains,  "It's medium-end, so once
you get to know it well and become a
qualified installer, you've opened up a practice
in consulting."

And some CPAs are moving back to write-up
programs. Reasons: For simple repetitive
data entry and reporting, they're faster. And
three of them import client-entered
bookkeeping data in a flash-if they're teamed with
the same vendor's client program.

CPAs dream of do-all write-up

McKee & Empsall of Malone, NY, still uses Creative
Solutions' Write-Up Solution II.
CPA Bill Empsall calls it "a 1987-vintage product,
hopelessly behind the times." His
dream: "A trial balance and write-up program all
in one with workpapers, ratios,
indexing, analytical review-and a financial
statement report writer which uses drag-and-
drop to build publication-quality financial
statements."

Empsall says, "ATB for Windows, despite its
problems, comes close in concept."
Lacking: "An industry-standard database that a
report writer can access." He adds,
"Why is it necessary to have to learn two or more
programs to service one client?"

In concept, the AICPA's ATB Write-Up should be
just what the doctor ordered. Instead,
it's just ATB audit with two extras: after-the-
fact payroll processing and ability to
collect, format and print a limited range of
financial statements. Big pluses: It does
flexibly calculate company performance ratios. And
it's so similar to ATB, it's a fast
study for ATB users.

Write-ups with client editions

Three write-ups-from Cold River, Creative
Solutions and SCS/Compute-have
companion bookkeeping software that you can sell
or recommend to small clients. The
packages are set up to encourage your clients to
do just data entry and turn to you for
adjustments, monthly closings and financial
analysis.

Cold River's Veritask for Windows has almost
nothing new but its name. It's old
Accounting by Design, which Peachtree bought,
named Crystal, renamed Peachtree
Writeup for Windows-and sold. Cold River plans to
update it next year. Yet even with
no overhaul in seven years, it holds its own
against costlier competitors.

Its manual and clear screens guide you through
moving data (via Windows links and
import/export) to and from nearly all vendors' tax
and accounting programs. Warning: It
takes several hours to set up the first custom
transfer and an hour or two for each
subsequent set-up. But once set up, each to/from
template can be reused instantly.

It imports client data with nearly no set-up time
from Peachtree, Solomon III, Great
Plains (but not Dynamics) and some Computer
Associates programs.

CPA Walter F. Malcolm of Agawan, MA, describes
SCS/Compute's Datawrite client
add-on as "like QuickBooks with no GL so the
integrated AR, AP, Checkbook and
Payroll can't post." Malcolm likes it because
"with Datawrite holding the GL, there's no
muss, no fuss, no data input for the accountant."

Bridging the CPA-client gap

If smaller clients insist on using QuickBooks or
Quicken, Quick Write-Up II could be
your salvation. It imports Intuit's data into ACE,
ACCPAC Plus, ATB, DacEasy,
M*A*S 90, Veritask, Platinum, Write-Up Solution
II-or in comma-, space- or tab-
delimited ASCII for none-of-the-aboves. Tip: If
your favorite in-house client write-up is
not listed, tell vendor Don Schuster. He says
he'll try to add what you own to his export
list.

The utility is so adept, it took me a minute to
install, 20 seconds to point it to Quicken
files and tell it to move them into ATB, then 30
seconds to decide whether it should
include voided checks, omit zero'd subaccounts,
etc. In less than two minutes more, a
year of Quicken data had been exported flawlessly
to ATB.

Tax Work: From Store Front to Internet


INTRO

It had to happen: some enterprising CPAs and EAs
are already selling tax preparation
services on proprietary Web sites. Here's where
you can see them at work.

http://www.traveller.com/%7Esaltek/

preparation using a Netscape server. To
keep data (hopefully) confidential, he advises
clients to use Netscape's matching
browser. To read Saltek's theories on encryption,

http://www.rsa.com/netsite/PK-Intro.html

http://www.taxwizard.com

is home for Tax Wizard, an "interactive tax
organizer" set up by Los Angeles
CPAs Hargrave and Hargrave to download tax data
from Web-happy tax clients.

http://www.5010geary.com/

is run by 1-800-TAX-LAWS, a nationwide
network of CPAs, EAs, LPAs and
attorneys loosely tied by an 800-number referral
service. The site provides on-line tax
preparation plus tax, estate, investment and
retirement planning.

RIA buys SCS/Compute

12/24/95: RIA just offered to buy SCS/Compute,
which renewed product development a
few years ago after a long sleep. We expect a
deal.

Acquisitive parent Thompson Publishing keeps hands
off subsidiaries as long as they
make money. So, with SCS/Compute's programs backed
by RIA's capital and sound
management, CPA firms can only come out ahead.

Also this month, RIA licensed Intuit to sell RIA's
Research Companion to TurboTax
ProSeries buyers. It contains 1,500 easily
searched paragraphs on individual and
corporate tax, pension plans, employee benefits,
and estate and gift taxes. There are also
IRS addresses, tax calendars and 40+ pages of
depreciation and inclusion amount tables.

Free seminar tackles 2000 woes

1/23/96, 1 pm EST: Great Plains' next national 50-
minute teleconference for
accountants helps you solve the computer problems
that'll result from changing system
dates to the year 2000 (see CPACR 9/95 p. 89).
Great Plains CPA Wayne Harding
points out that CPA/consultants need to know now
what to expect. Reason: Software
that calculates future events will hit the
millennium before 2000 and clients may hold
you accountable for expensive errors.

You can listen to Toronto information systems
consultant Peter de Jager and other
experts and ask questions via an MCI conferencing
line. To "attend:" You must
preregister but there's no fee or phone charge.

4/30/96: The next teleconference in the series, on
how accountants can use the Internet.

Accounting software updates

Version 3.5 of Peachtree Accounting for Windows
(see 9/95 CPACR review, p. 87) is
nearly free of the bugs that frustrated pioneer
users. It comes with 75 sample business
templates and a Q&A format for fast set-up. Its
box holds a CD-ROM and disks-take
your pick. The Mylar includes SharkWare (a so-so
PIM) and Timeslips Accounting Link
(TAL) to import t&b data from Timeslips.

Note to CPAs: This small-business program bears no
resemblance to bulky old Peachtree
Accounting for DOS. Warning: Its ability to change
and erase old transactions destroys
audit trailing.

MYOB's Version 6 (see review,  CPACR 5/95 p. 41)
adds a report customizer with 100
tailorable templates. Its help is improved and,
like Peachtree, it bundles TAL. It now
matches Peachtree in import/export ease and
ability to manage jobs and projects. Its
inventory still beats Peachtree, and it can also
accrue vacation and sick pay balances.
Still unchanged: its danger-laden turn-on/turn-off
audit trail button. Note: It's not
multiuser.

New Fax Master lets M*A*S 90 users fax invoices,
purchase orders, sales orders and
marketing literature without leaving the package.
It can schedule faxing for night
transmission. A built-in text editor creates cover
letters with graphic overlays of logos
and product art.

CPE tracking software

Now that we can offer 12 CPE credits/year for
reading CPACR, several subscribers are
looking for electronic CPE credit trackers.

Here are four that serve three different uses.

Linton Shafer's Continuing Education Tracking
System tracks personnel, self-schedules
in-house or sponsored courses based on staff level
and area of expertise and records
expenses and evaluations. It holds license
numbers, prepares reports for licensing
agencies and carries forward unused hours. It
exports in dBase III and bundles a
calculator, appointment calendar and notepad.
CPAs Schenck & Assoc. S.C. of Appleton, WI, wrote

Professional Education Tracking System (PET) so
that besides tracking courses and
personnel, they could cost out courses by sponsor,
instructor and location and evaluate
them for effectiveness, materials, facilities and
value.

To set up PET, you must define annual hours
needed, reporting period length and hours
and maximum allowed carry-overs. Then it makes
sure everyone meets CPE
requirements. Printouts include letters of
enrollment, yearly CPE totals and expense
reports.

Inexpensive CPELOG just tracks firm members'
credits and tells if they're meeting
license requirements. But each of its customized
name-your-state modules comes with
GAO, AICPA and NSPA requirements plus requirements
for all applicable licenses in
that state. Its reports show:

courses meeting license requirements, with needed
reporting data;

courses not qualifying for a particular license,
with reasons;

per-person per-license requirements and
deficiencies;

per-person credits earned and firm totals for a
selected license.

The program doesn't export and has no online help
but it's easy to use.

Good book/disk buys for CPAs For the bookshelf

Each of the following books is rich with
technology tips. Three include useful disks.

Conrad Carlberg's 526-page Business Analysis with
Excel helps select the best way to
crank out everything from income statements and
balance sheets to absorption and
contribution costing spreadsheets. It's also got
the shortest explanation of regression
analysis we've ever read. Use it just to look up
formulas-or copy out whole templates
from its bundled disk.

ISDN doesn't just deliver faster data than modem
calling, with faster connect and
disconnect. It provides caller ID and lets your
computer distinguish voice from data.
James Y. Bryce's 524-page Using ISDN shows how to
buy and hook onto ISDN services
for everything from surfing the Internet to
interconnecting LANs. It hand-holds do-it-
yourselfers and provides tips for hiring outside
installers.

Scott Mueller's Upgrading and Repairing PCs keeps
getting better. The 5th edition's
1,394-pages will help you figure out what's wrong
with a PC, whether it's worth
upgrading and what equipment's worth adding. A
long chapter on SIMMs explains the
different facets of memory so well, you'll never
be confused again. Other chapters cover
troubleshooting hard disks, sound cards and more.

A bundled CD-ROM lists vendors, tech support phone
numbers, and specs (including
factory jumper settings) for 1,400 peripheral
cards.

If you itch to make a WWW page, Andy Shafran's
Creating Your Own Netscape Web
Pages is clear, colorful, highly illustrated and
simple enough for total non-techies. Files
on the bundled disk let you explore the Web using
popular Netscape (included free) and
build Web pages. Tip: Shelve Shafran's suggestions
for adding video, audio and
animation; these memory hogs won't be standard on
the WWW for many months.

BusinessWorks

BusinessWorks works like accounting software
should

Now that the DOS and Windows versions of
BusinessWorks do virtually the same thing,
we retested these old favorites to see if they
kept up with the times.

They sure did. After Manzanita wrote Business Ties
for Prentice Hall (see review in
12/94 CPACR, p. 1)-which has been in limbo since
CLR acquired P-H-Manzanita added
all of its new goodies to their own program.
Version 10.1 for DOS and 3.95 for
Windows are now lock, stock and barrel part of the
State of the Art fold.

They're both modular, consisting of a System
Manager, GL, AP, AR, PR, Inventory, Job
Cost, Order Entry with job quoting and Crystal
Report Writer. The $95 System Manager
has a nifty any-size label maker and all modules
come network-ready for up to 48
metered users at 99 workstations. They're fast,
attractive and completely integrated.

BusinessWorks is an accrual system. It permits
$99-million account balances and uses
four digits plus two decimals for account IDs.
There's monthly closing but instant
transaction posting to the GL and easy fast look-
up everywhere. It keeps 99 companies,
does consolidation and passwords by company,
module and task. It prepares product or
service invoices. Payments can be allocated by
percentage to 10 GL accounts.

Inventory costs four ways. Commissions are
calculated. Prices and other attributes can
be changed once for any group of records. Easily
customized management reports
complement a bevy of old-fashioned CPA-style
worksheets.

Payroll has a direct-deposit EFT option and a
built-in utility that sends data to NPC via
the client's modem. Refunds and write-offs are
easy. So are banking transactions and
bank transfers. AR takes credit card payments.
Needed: a field for entering card
numbers.

Best feature: a data import/export facility that
makes moving to and from other easy-
transfer accounting packages (such as Peachtree
for Windows) a dream. Other bonuses:
Notes can be added anywhere. The DOS version has a
pop-up calculator and calendar.
There's a zip code database, impaired file
rebuilding and user-to-user E-mail built in.
An optional audit trail log records every
important data change by user.

Help is adequate and context-sensitive. The manual
is clear and useful. Our one big
beef: The Windows version doesn't have DDE, OLE or
ability to quick-copy onscreen
data into another Windows program. (Little
Peachtree for Windows does!)

Recommend to: growing clients who want easy-to-use
accounting software with flexible
inventory, pricing and order handling plus fast,
easy custom management reports.

BusinessWorks,

Subscriber feedback
Fixed assets fallout

Several subscribers telephoned to say they wish we
had included their write-up software
vendor's fixed assets program in last month's
comparison chart, Fixed Assets Programs
for MS-DOS and Windows (p. 112-113 in print
edition). Tell us what you're using and
we'll do it next time. Meanwhile, we'd love to
pass along your verdict to other
subscribers.

Example: CPA Terry Seiberlich whose Seiberlich
Accountancy Corp. serves two cities
in CA, writes that Creative Solutions' Fixed Asset
Solution II has CSI's usual
maddening keystroke and interface problems. "But,"
he adds, "it is relatively fast and
technically accurate, with good-to-excellent
reporting. If I were shopping today, I would
probably buy the CSI product over most of the
others."

Fixed Asset Solution II: Creative Solutions 800-
869-8900,
313-426-5860.

CD-ROM MOVIEBOOK FROM SOUND SOURCE
INTERACTIVE RUNS UNDER WINDOWS

Babe, that cute little irrepressible pig and summer-movie
sensation, is fresh from his adventures on the big screen and
ready to take children on an exciting romp through the world
of interactive edutainment. Babe is making his MovieBook debut
in an irresistible CD-ROM-based storybook from Sound Source
Interactive that enables kids from three and up to learn while
having fun. Universal City Studios, the motion-picture studio
that brought Babe to the movie screen, joined with Sound
Source Interactive to bring the hit-movie sensation to the
computer screen.

Sound Source Interactive's series of MovieBooks package
turns today's most popular family films into creative and
interactive learning experiences. "Babe: A Little Pig Goes A
Long Way" is the latest title from the creative group that
brought "Black Beauty," "The Secret Garden," "The Little
Rascals" and "Lassie" to CD-ROMs and computers everywhere.

On retail shelves in time for Thanksgiving, Babe is an
interactive CD-ROM that features a 52-page storybook complete
with text, actual movie clips, photos, animation, sound
effects, games and puzzles. Mirroring the movie's plot, the
CD takes children on a multimedia journey into the magical
landscape of the little pig that could.

"With a simple click of the mouse, children can experience an
interactive adventure, from a pigs-eye view, while learning to
read and conducting activities that bring the fundamentals of
early education to life through imaginative and intuitive
interfaces," said Vincent Bitetti, CEO of Sound Source.

Bitetti explained that the goal of Sound Source Interactive's
MovieBooks is to educate while entertaining. "With Babe and
our other titles, our goal is to spark literacy, familiarize
kids with the computer, and create an educational focus within
a movie-going experience," he said. "Our MovieBooks promise to
hold a child's interest while offering quality educational
material."

Storybook Takes Children on Babe's Magical Journey

As children enter the world of Babe, they are led to Hoggett
farm and its magnificent barn by the famous trio of singing
mice from the movie. Entering the barn begins the adventure!
Children are presented with a myriad of options at this point.

Proceeding straight ahead takes them to a curio cabinet
filled with active objects and memorabilia, including the main
storybook. Children can also turn left, right or proceed
outside to a barnyard where a number of activities designed
to enhance critical and creative thinking skills await.

The main storybook is presented by clicking on the book in
the center of the curio cabinet. Filled with 52 pages of text
accompanied by animations, movie clips, games and puzzles, the
storybook interactively tells the tale of Babe's magical
journey. Children can read the story themselves or chose the
narrative option which automatically takes pre-readers through
the story, triggering animations and movie clips on cue.

In the interactive mode, the last page of each chapter
presents children with a multiple-choice reading comprehension
quiz. A perfect score on the quiz rewards the child with a
puzzle piece. Fitting each chapter's puzzle piece together
reveals a completed puzzle picture which can be printed.

Variety of Activities Makes Learning Fun

In addition to the storybook, children can immerse themselves
in a variety of entertaining learning activities. These
activities have been specifically designed by Sound Source to
teach logic and reasoning skills while providing children
with loads of fun.

In Silly Skins, children are able to place "silly animal
skins" on each barnyard resident, painting ducks with stripes,
pigs with polka dots and horses with checks.

Among the wacky skin choices is the correct choice, teaching
children deductive reasoning by allowing them to reach a
logical conclusion of matching the correct skin with the
appropriate animal. Children also learn to understand the
relationship between objects along with creative thinking and
problem-solving skills.

Children can also create a barnyard scene, clicking and
dragging animals, trucks, buildings and fences into a
landscaped picture. Here the child learns creative thinking as
well as hand-eye coordination. A hidden puzzle is another fun
learning activity, certain to challenge and amuse any child.
By solving detailed dilemmas and searching for a host of
hidden objects in less than a minute, children again use
deductive reasoning, enabling them to reach a conclusion by
interpreting a series of clues.

Additional activities include a maze where children can help
Babe rescue sheep, a missing-pieces puzzle and a Kooky Coop
where children enter a chicken house and locate objects found
in each chicken's nest. Children can also make greeting cards
to print out and color.

Pricing and Availability

Available immediately, "Babe: A Little Pig Goes A Long Way"
has a suggested street price of $29.95. Babe and other Sound
Source Interactive MovieBooks are available at most major
retail outlets, including Comp USA, Egghead, K-Mart, Price-
Costco, Software Etcetera and other fine stores.

Sound Source Interactive MovieBooks play on any 386 33MHz, or
faster, IBM PC/compatible computer running Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95. The computer should be equipped with at least 8MB
RAM, a 256-color monitor, sound card and double-speed CD-ROM
drive.

From The Editor: New computers won't be cut from the same old cloth

By:
Ellen Pearlman

On a recent business trip, I met a marketing manager from Levi
Strauss. With my last attempt to buy jeans still fresh in my
mind--I must have tried on 100 pairs only to leave the store
empty-handed--I seized the opportunity to vent: "If you're
no longer shaped like an 18-year-old, it's impossible to find
a pair of jeans that fit." He smiled and reassured me that
Levi Strauss has a solution up its sleeve (or cuff, as the
case may be). The company is experimenting with jeans tailored
precisely to the customer's body shape, for a small extra fee.
I haven't visited the Manhattan store that offers the service
yet, but I will. It's no wonder Levi's jeans have been so popular
for nearly 150 years: The company understands--and reacts to
-its customers' needs.

Keeping the mass-market customer satisfied doesn't come quite
as naturally to the leading computer companies, many of which
are still getting used to the idea of becoming household names.
Their marketing efforts have long focused on businesspeople,
engineers and scientists, whose needs are much more specialized
-and predictable--than the consumer at large. That helps explain
why most computers look alike; gray or beige boxes with giant
hard drives suited the traditional buyer just fine--isn't that
what consumers want, too? Truth is, there's no telling what
"consumers" want, because there is no monolithic "consumer"
community.

But several companies are beginning to take their thinking beyond
the traditional box--literally and figuratively.  Computer
industry stalwarts including Oracle, Sun, Compaq and Apple have
begun talking in earnest about a new $500 consumer appliance,
essentially a limited-function computer.  This machine would
forgo the "more, more, more" philosophy of memory, storage and
software, instead housing just enough technology to perform the
specific functions a customer needs, such as accessing the
Internet and perhaps downloading programs--needed to, say, edit
text--from the global computer network temporarily.

While it's doubtful these projects will be lightning bolts that
make computers as common in American homes as TVs, they do
show a healthy desire among manufacturers to design products
for different types of computer users. As it is, many of us
use only a fraction of the power and sophisticated capabilities
of our home computers. Of course, some people want a Ferrari
engine, even if they rarely drive over 65 mph; today's PCs
suit them just fine. But for people who shy away from computers,
an inexpensive, easy-to-use device could be the place to start.

Indeed, in an industry that traditionally craves "bigger, better,
faster," it's instructive that in our cover story, the Consumer
Lab on printers (page 181), our jury's top nods often went
not to the models whose print quality floored them, but to
those that offered high quality and a price that didn't go
through the roof. Sometimes, less is more.

Other companies are rethinking computer style Gear + Gadgets).
Their new machines, with sleek angles and innovative shapes, look
more like furniture than office machines and recall a fundamental
principle of design:  Form follows function.  Before long, for
instance, we could see PCs built into some new kitchens, fitting
with the decor of the microwave, oven and dishwasher.  Either a
touch screen will offer a menu of options, or, better yet, we'll
use voice-recognition software to request a recipe while pulling
the ingredients out of the refrigerator.  (To see how two
families have redesigned their kitchens to accommodate today's
PCs, turn to page 174.)

Will $500 PCs be a step toward making home computers as ubiquitous
as toasters? I doubt that day will come as quickly as PC makers
would like; historically, people are slow to embrace change
-consider that automated teller machines were introduced 20
years ago, yet less than half the U.S. population uses them
today.

That's the same reason I think the media is jumping way ahead
of the public when it comes to cyberspace. Some breathless
reports would have us believe Americans' TVs will soon be buried
in cobwebs, abandoned as we race off to surf the Web, engage
in electronic chats and shop at our PCs. Novelty always makes
for an exciting story, but there are still far more people
who've never gone on-line than those who log on regularly.

As usual, however, a kernel of truth lies under the hype. New
research from FIND/SVP and Grunwald Associates shows that nearly
two-thirds of children in U.S. homes with PCs watch less TV
because they're using computers; the figure rises to nearly
three-fourths in homes with multimedia computers. For a new
generation, going on-line is becoming routine; many youngsters
-and adults--are creating home pages on the World Wide Web.

Perhaps the most exciting thing about the Web is that it's the
ultimate customizable medium--anyone can shape it to his or
her own needs. It's similar to the lesson I believe companies
will need to learn in order to succeed in home computing: One
size rarely fits all, and a custom fit is a welcome addition
in any marketplace.

Letters: From 'phobe to Wordphile



I was delighted to see the way you summed up my story in your
November 1995 issue ("Computerphobe Contest Winners: Atlanta
Brave," page 166). It was beautifully written, a perfect blend
of empathy and humor, and it expressed my feelings and fears
precisely.

Ask me how I'd rate my computer skills these days, and I'd confidently
tell you, on a scale of one to 10, about a three--not long
ago, my answer would have been zero.

I owe my progress to on-the-job training; I now sit in front
of my PC from morning to night, Monday through Friday, and
sometimes on the weekends as well. The machine and I both are
getting quite a workout.

I dare say my trepidation has turned into camaraderie, and while
I initially approached the computer with hesitation, I now
sit down, push the button to turn it on, and get right to work.
The only program I've learned how to use so far is Word for
Windows, but from little acorns grow mighty oaks, or so I've
been told, and I am not discouraged in the least. I have learned
that the frustrations I face when using the PC aren't nearly
as debilitating as the fears, and though I am often overwhelmed,
my heart doesn't skip a beat anymore when a warning appears
on the screen.

Thanks to all of you for offering the contest--I have won so
much more than just a computer system.

Wow--your November issue was great! It seems that I enjoy each
month's issue more than the last. In fact, my wife gets on
my case because when our new copy arrives in the mail, I sit
down and read the whole thing in one day. Then, when I wind
up sitting around and doing nothing, she says, "See, you should
have saved some of the HomePC reading for now, but no, you
have to read it all at once!" She's right, as usual.

Letters: Give OS/2 its due



Were you really surprised at the results of the operating system
comparison in your November Consumer Lab ("Not Bad, Rookie
 Windows 95 Wins Our Jury Over," page 175)? I think I could
have easily predicted that a Windows product would come out
on top when everyone on your test panel had some experience
with Windows and no one had ever used OS/2 Warp. Perhaps a
better name for the article would have been "Windows Users
Like Windows 95," because the exercise verified that what people
like best is what they are most familiar with.

I hope that when your readers are shopping for an operating
system, they are more objective than your magazine chose to
be.

Karen Buros

Austin, Texas

Editor's reply: In fact, several of our testers had used OS
2 Warp prior to their experiences in our Lab; we did not include
that information in their bios because no one had used it as
his or her preferred operating system (although the OS/2 Warp
review mentioned that one tester had previously switched from
the IBM operating system to Windows for Workgroups). Final
grades aside, as we reported, many testers had positive comments
about OS/2 after using it, as well as criticisms. On balance,
this group found Windows 95 easier to use.

Letters: SIMMering down



Another computer magazine? I figured I'd give HomePC a chance,
just to see if it was any different from the rest.

Was I surprised! I opened my first issue of HomePC and found
Dr. PC addressing a reader's memory parity errors (August 1995),
a problem I'd been having with my own system but hadn't been
able to solve.

After reading Dr. PC's advice, I opened my computer case, re
seated all the SIMMs in their slots, and voila, problem solved!
Thanks, Dr. PC--you saved me at least $100.

Letters: Look before you leap



After reading about upgrades in the September 1995 issue of
HomePC ("The Upgrade Dilemma: Can Your PC Be Saved?" on page
85), I decided to upgrade my 486SX 25-MHz PC, an IBM PS/1,
using an Intel DX4 75-MHz OverDrive processor. I reviewed the
reference material that came with my computer, and checked
the PC's motherboard to familiarize myself with my system before
buying the new component. It looked simple enough, so I decided
to go ahead.

When I received the new processor, I eagerly read the installation
manual and reviewed the diagnostics program included with the
processor. I correctly installed the component only to be met
with a "cache error" message when I booted up. My programs
ran worse than before the upgrade.

I removed the OverDrive processor, then contacted IBM support.
I was informed that my PS/1 was incompatible with the DX4 OverDrive
processor, and serious problems could result if I tried to
run my computer with it installed.

I urge anyone planning an upgrade to check with the computer's
manufacturer to make sure the system is compatible with any
new components before buying and installing them.

Roger A. Cohn

Pine Plains, N.Y.

Editor's reply: Generally, Intel's OverDrive processors will
work in the system categories for which they're intended, but
many variables come into play in selecting the right chip for
your particular machine. As you noted, it's always wise to
check with your computer's manufacturer before making a purchase.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: Customizing Win 95 is child's play

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I've read that Windows 95 will let me set up custom desktops
for each member of my family who uses the computer. How can
I do this?

A: Building custom desktops in Windows 95 is a snap. First,
design a rough desktop that would work for all the members
of your household who use the PC. Shuffle the icons around
until you find a basic arrangement that seems logical. Then,
make sure all your programs are listed on the Start menu. If
any programs are missing, use a Windows 95 file-management
tool--either My Computer or Explorer--to drag the icons for
the missing applications onto the Start button.

Now, open the Windows 95 Control Panel and double-click on the
Passwords icon; you'll see two options at the top of the next
window. The first tells Windows 95 to use the same desktop
each time the computer starts up (this is the setting that
is currently active on your PC). The second tells the system
that more than one person will use the PC, and that Windows
95 should present each with a different desktop. Switch to
the second option.

Two check boxes will appear in the lower half of this window.
The first, "Include desktop icons and Network Neighborhood
contents in user settings," tells Windows 95 to keep track
of the different desktop icon arrangements for you and, say,
your kids; if you're connected to a network, it will do the
same for your network icons. This check box will already be
selected, since you chose the multiuser option. The second
check box, "Include Start menu and Program groups in user settings,"
instructs Windows 95 to show specified menu items and program
groups for each user; select this as well, and then click on
OK. At this point, you'll be asked if you'd like to restart
your computer. Click on Yes.

When the system reboots, a log-on window will appear as soon
as Windows 95 finishes loading. Type your name, and enter the
password you'd like to use. Windows 95 will ask you to confirm
your password by typing it a second time. When your password
is accepted, the basic desktop you set up earlier will appear
on the screen. You can now arrange its elements any way you
like, and the only way anyone will be able to use this desktop
-or rearrange it--is to enter your name and password at the
log-on prompt.

To set up a custom desktop for your kids, restart your PC, enter
a new name in the log-on window (for example, your child's
name, or a generic ID like "Kids"), supply and confirm a password,
and you'll return to the default desktop, which you (or the
designated user, once you pass along the name and password
you entered) can now modify. To see what some custom desktop
setup screens look like, see "A Visual Guide to Windows 95
Shortcuts," which you'll find after page 306 in the November
1995 issue of HomePC.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: This logo's got to go

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I've got a graphic I'd like to substitute for the Windows
logo that appears when I boot up my computer. Will Windows
3.1 let me swap my preferred image for the standard logo?

A: You bet. To do so, you'll need graphics software that can
work with .rle files, which are compressed graphic files. (One
popular program that fits the bill is HiJaak Pro from Inset
Systems.)

First, look in your Windows system directory (C:\windows\system)
and locate the vgalogo.rle file, which contains the Windows
logo that you want to replace. Rename this file as, say, oldlogo.rle,
and save it, just in case you change your mind later and decide
to put it back as a startup graphic.

Next, use your graphics program to open the file you want to
use for your personal logo and save it in the C:\windows\system
directory as vgalogo.rle. This puts your new graphic in the
right place--but now you'll have to update win.com, the Windows
3.1 program file, to make it aware of your new image.

Open Windows' Main program group and double-click on the Windows
Setup icon. Pull down the Options menu and choose "Change system
settings." When the settings window opens, note the name of
your current video driver--you'll need to know it to finish
this setup.

Your next step will be to change the video driver's specification
temporarily. Click on the down-arrow button next to the video
driver and choose VGA from the list. This will change Windows'
video driver to VGA, but, more important, it will force win.com
to re-read the vgalogo.rle file you've just modified.

Click on the OK button, and you'll be prompted to restart Windows
-but don't do that yet. Instead, click on the Continue button,
and follow the steps outlined above to put your video-driver
setting back to what it was before.

When the setting is restored, you can exit Windows and restart
your computer. When you do, the graphic you chose should be
there to welcome you back to Windows--it'll greet you at each
startup until you decide to change it again.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: Going to pieces over file fragments

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I've been told that I should fix the file clusters on my
hard disk so the disk isn't fragmented. When I run the DOS
Defrag utility, it tells me I've got lost clusters, but it
doesn't help me solve the problem. What's wrong--and what can
I do to fix it?

A: DOS stores files in sets, known as clusters, or file allocation
units, which are fixed blocks of space on your computer's hard
disk. A single file can take up many individual allocation
units, and DOS tracks them with directory structures and an
index called a file allocation table (FAT)

Each time you work at your PC, files are created and deleted,
and existing files may change size. Your computer won't necessarily
store a particular file in consecutive units of disk space
as changes occur; instead, it chops up the file into fragments
it places into various clusters across your hard disk.

When you instruct your computer to open a file stored in pieces
scattered all over your hard disk, your operating system has
to comb a lot of disk space to retrieve all the parts, which
slows system response. You can improve your PC's performance
by "defragging" the disk--in other words, rearranging the fragmented
data on the hard disk so that it's again contained in contiguous
units. To run DOS's Defrag utility, simply type defrag at the
DOS prompt.

However, when a file isn't saved properly--for example, if your
PC's power is cut off while you're saving a file--the units,
or clusters, to which the file's pieces are assigned won't
be linked to the name of the file; they're considered "lost."
The file's information isn't gone--it's still on your hard
disk--but the operating system can no longer associate those
clusters with a particular file. For the defragging procedure
to be effective, you must first eliminate any lost clusters
on your hard disk--otherwise the Defrag utility has to work
around them.

To do this, use the ScanDisk utility (in DOS 6.2 and later versions;
type scandisk at the DOS prompt) or the Chkdsk utility (in
earlier versions of DOS; type chkdsk at the prompt). If the
utility finds any lost clusters, you'll be given the option
to convert them into files for further inspection or delete
them. Check your DOS documentation to determine the best answer
for your situation.

To keep your hard disk in peak condition, you should defrag
it every week or so. However, be sure to run ScanDisk or Chkdsk
first to make the process as effective as possible--and to
be sure your PC performs as efficiently as it can.

These steps work for Windows 3.1 and DOS, but not for Windows
95; the new system has a different defragging utility. For
instructions, see "A Visual Guide to Windows 95 Performance
Boosters," which appears after page 444 in the December 1995
issue of HomePC.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: PC-phone has a nice ring to it

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I'd like to use my PC as a telephone, but suppose I do this
and I'm put on hold for a long time? Can I connect my modem
to my PC's speakers so that I'll know when someone finally
picks up at the other end?

A: Most modems incorporate a speaker that allows you to hear
dial tones, busy signals or connection signals as the device
attempts to link up with another computer. But this speaker
cuts off as soon as the connection's made, which means you
need a separate device to use your computer as a speakerphone.

To hear what's going on over the phone line, you'll want a telephony
card--a single device that typically combines a sound card
and modem. These cards, which cost about $250, include connectors
for speakers, a microphone and a telephone line; most are sold
with software that will give your computer more-advanced features
such as a speakerphone, voicemail capability, and even caller
ID, if it's available in your area.

If your PC is already equipped for multimedia, it's a good idea
to have your local computer dealer install the telephony card.
This device will replace your existing modem and sound card,
so you may need some extra hardware if your CD-ROM drive is
connected to the sound card; installation could be a bit of
a juggling act.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: CD? Can I make mine E?

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I recently added a second hard drive to my PC, which runs
Windows 3.1. The new drive is labeled C, and my old hard drive
is now D; how do I label my CD-ROM drive E?

A: Editing your PC's autoexec.bat file will do the trick; you
can use Windows' Notepad program in the Accessories program
group to get to it.

Before you start, though, it's essential to make a backup copy
of your current autoexec.bat file. Once you've done that, locate
the line that reads C:
\MSCDEX.EXE / 
/L:D. This is Microsoft's CD-ROM driver; one of its jobs is
to tell the operating system how to refer to your CD-ROM drive.
In our example above, 
and 
indicate variables that will differ depending on how your system
is set up. But don't worry about those; the /L: at the end
is your focus.

If it reads /L:D, as in our example, it's telling the driver to
refer to your CD-ROM drive as drive D, which is common.  To
change it to drive E, just replace the D with an E, so that the
line reads C:\<directory>\MSCDEX.EXE /<options>/L:E.  Save this
file, reboot your computer, and your mission will have been
accomplished.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: See my chip--& raise it?

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I have a 486/DX2 PC. My friend says that DX2 chips can't
be upgraded to Pentium class. Is that true?

A: Don't necessarily believe everything that your friends tell
you. If your PC's motherboard has a ZIF socket--and nearly
all DX2 computers do (check with the manufacturer if you're
not sure)--you can buy an Intel Pentium OverDrive processor
that will boost your 486 to Pentium-like speeds. Mind you,
you won't get the blindingly fast performance that a top-of
the-line P100, P120 or P133 chip delivers, but it will be quicker
than what you have now. A Pentium OverDrive processor will
boost a 50-MHz DX2 PC to about 63 MHz, slightly faster than
the slowest Pentium machines; a 66-MHz DX2 can be jolted to
83 MHz. (For a complete look at the difference an OverDrive
processor will make in a particular system, see Gear + Gadgets,
November 1995.)

Before you purchase an OverDrive chip, check with your PC maker's
technical-support department or call Intel (800-538-3373) to
confirm that you'll be buying the correct processor for your
system, and to find out if you'll need to upgrade your computer's
BIOS (basic input-output system) in conjunction with the chip
upgrade.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: When bad graphics happen to good PCs

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I have a 486/66 SLC2 PC with 8 megabytes of memory. When
I play action games like Descent, the graphics are slow and
choppy. Can you suggest a way to improve the quality of the
screen images?

A: There could be several causes of your problem. First, check
your documentation or call your video card manufacturer to
be sure you have the latest video drivers for your card.

If that's not the difficulty, your computer may be loading unnecessary
programs when it starts up, eating into the memory available
for your games. For instance, many DOS games have built-in
disk-caching technology, which saves frequently used data in
memory rather than forcing the system to go to the hard disk
constantly to retrieve that data. In this case, DOS disk-caching
drivers such as SmartDrive, which normally improve performance,
just get in the way.

For the best image quality, you should run your DOS games from
a clean boot disk that doesn't load all your PC's drivers.
One way to do this is to boot off a floppy you've set up as
a game boot disk (see "Memory Not Included" in the December
1994 issue of HomePC). Or, if you're using DOS 6.0 or a later
release, you can simply press the F8 key when "Starting MS
DOS..." is displayed during your PC's startup routine. This
instructs DOS to ask for confirmation of the startup drivers
as they load (just hit "Y" for yes if you want DOS to load
each particular driver). Be sure that you load your memory
managers (himem.sys and emm386.exe), as well as your mouse
driver (mouse. com or mouse.sys) if you need to use the mouse
to play your game.

If the game requires sound or CD-ROM support, such step-by-step
loading of drivers can get tricky, since you may not know offhand
exactly which drivers you'll need. In that case, I'd recommend
you check your game's documentation for tips on making a boot
disk.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: Lost in DoubleSpace?

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I have a 386SX 25-MHz computer with an 85-MB hard drive that
I'm using with DoubleSpace. Can I install Windows 95 without
removing DoubleSpace?

A: Disk compression utilities, including DoubleSpace, DriveSpace
and Stacker version 2.0 or later, won't stop you from installing
Windows 95--but it may not be worth the trouble.

If you decide to try it, first make sure you have at least 1.5
megabytes (MB) of free space on your primary hard drive. If
you plan to use a permanent swap file--which boosts performance
by letting your PC use a portion of your hard drive as extra
memory--make it at least 8 MB. Check your Windows documentation
to learn how to set up a swap file on your computer, or how
to adjust the size of the one you already have.

Even with a swap file, though, your setup is going to pose some
problems for Windows 95. For example, to load the operating
system, you'll need at least 40 MB of free hard-drive space
(more if you're not upgrading from an earlier version of Windows,
or if you want to use programs written specifically for Windows
95), and at least 8 MB of RAM for Windows 95 to run efficiently.
You may also have a hard time finding Windows 95 device drivers
for the older video and other peripheral cards you probably
have in your computer.

My advice? Skip the upgrade; you're better off putting the money
you save toward the purchase of a new PC with Windows 95 preinstalled.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: I need directory assistance

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I created a directory called QTW11 -D on my Windows 3.1 PC,
and now I want to delete it. But no matter what I do, I just
can't make it go away. Help!

A: You're having trouble deleting the directory because the
DOS command that removes directories, rmdir, can't handle names
that have spaces in them; rmdir regards a space as the end
of the directory name. You're going to have to do some fancy
footwork to get it to recognize the name of the directory you
cite.

To convince rmdir that the space is just another character,
you have to use a special three-digit code as a stand-in for
the space within the directory name. Go to the DOS prompt and
type: rmdir qtw11, then hold down the Alt key and press 255
on your numeric keypad. When you release the Alt key, you'll
see a space on the command line. Type the rest of the directory
name, -D, hit Return, and DOS will delete the offending directory
from your hard drive.

Best Buys--Super Values For Savvy Shoppers: Begin piano lessons with 2 C-notes

By:
Jennifer Triverio

Have you ever thought about taking piano lessons, but worried
you'd spend more time thinking about missed bank notes than
musical ones? If so, the Piano Discovery System has the perfect
pitch; it promises an affordable and fun way to learn to tickle
the ivories with help from your PC.

The $199 system includes a four-octave MIDI musical keyboard
that plugs into your PC's sound card through a single cable
(no additional power supply or equipment required) and a Windows
3.1 CD-ROM. The disc includes 200 lessons--the equivalent of
a year's worth of piano instruction--designed for newcomers
to the keyboard from age 6 on up.

The program is arranged in six sections: Go to the Schoolhouse
to learn the basics of piano technique and music theory; the
Bungalow to practice songs; the Arcade to exercise your developing
skills in three video games; the Performance Hall to play with
a virtual symphony orchestra; the Jam Stage to experiment with
sound effects, riffs and rhythms; and the Recording Studio
to work out your ideas and hear them played back by a fully
equipped 16-track MIDI recorder.

If your practice sessions are a hit, you can call for an encore
 Discs covering the second and third years of piano instruction
cost $79.99 each.

Best Buys--Super Values For Savvy Shoppers: Piquing kids' interest in investing

By:
Jennifer Triverio

You're never too young to start saving for a rainy day. Liberty
Financial's free Young Investor Game (DOS) encourages youngsters
to manage their money wisely by educating them about economics
and finance as they play.

In this one- or two-player game, available directly from Liberty,
kids wend their way around a board on the screen, answering
questions and earning (or losing) money as they go.

Topics include the stock exchange, mutual funds and the IRS
(midway through the game, the program announces it's April
15--and unceremoniously takes 28 percent of the player's earnings)

The answers are fully explained, and some might even open a
few adults' eyes: For instance, did you know that if, from
the day of your birth, someone invested $13 a month for you
in a mutual fund with a 10 percent annual yield, you would
be a millionaire at age 65?

Granted, education isn't the only item on Liberty's agenda;
the disk plugs the Young Investor Program--designed to convince
kids and their parents to invest in the Liberty-owned SteinRoe
Young Investor Mutual Fund. Then again, making money is the
name of this game.

Plug 'N' Pray--Windows 95 Plug-and-Play promises automatic hardware
installation, but it doesn't always work that way. Here are
five hints to help.

By:
Phillip Robinson

Imagine three people sitting side-by-side in front of computers.
On the right is Bob, who's content with his Macintosh. Sure,
he knows there's much more software available for PCs than
for his Mac, but when he bought a new modem and scanner, he
simply clicked twice on the Install icon, and they were up
and running in no time.

On the left is Debbie; her PC runs Windows 3.1. She loves all
the new software she can buy, but new hardware's another story.
She knows replacing her 14.4-Kbps modem with a 28.8 model would
make surfing the Internet twice as much fun, and a faster graphics
card would let her see the 3-D animation in the latest games,
yet Debbie just can't forget how hard it was to install her
sound card. She spent hours moving DIP switches, setting up
jumpers, running configuration programs, fiddling with memory
management utilities, guessing what IRQs, I/O addresses and
DMA channels were...and then, after all that, it still doesn't
work right some of the time.

In the middle sits Kim. She's excited about her new PC, which
she bought with Windows 95 installed. She can run most of the
same Windows programs Debbie enjoys, plus all the new software
that's designed just for Windows 95. Kim isn't worried about
hooking up her printer and monitor to the PC, or adding any
new hardware she wants to buy in the future; after all, Windows
95 has Plug-and-Play. When she wants to install hardware, all
she has to do is plug in the device, click on the Add New Hardware
icon, and Windows 95 will automatically find it, set it up
so it won't conflict with other devices, and install any files
she needs to get it up and running.

Just like a Mac.

But Kim might be in for a surprise. Even with her new computer
and Windows 95, she won't necessarily be able to install hardware
automatically.

Apple has been working for more than 10 years with a fairly
small group of manufacturers that design hardware for the Mac;
as a result, it's been relatively easy for the company to enforce
its standards for its machine. Microsoft, which introduced
Plug-and-Play support in Windows 95 less than six months ago,
has been working with chip-maker Intel and PC hardware manufacturers
to develop Plug-and-Play standards for only about two years.
Then, consider that there are far more peripheral devices available
for the PC than for the Mac, and that these devices come from
many different manufacturers, all of which work independently
of Microsoft--the phrase "trying to herd cats" comes to mind.
It will take years before all PC manufacturers conform to the
Windows 95 standards.

For now, when Kim--or any other Windows 95 customer--uses Plug
and-Play, the PC may find and set up some peripherals just
fine, set up other devices for mediocre performance, and not
recognize a few others at all. That's why some technology analysts
refer to Plug-and-Play as "Plug-and-Pray."

Even so, most PC users will have an easier time installing hardware
with Windows 95 than they ever did before. But if you use the
new operating system and your CD-ROM drive is running at half
the speed you expected, or your monitor isn't displaying images
at the high resolution you thought you paid for, or your sound
card isn't working at all, prayer probably won't make the device
run more efficiently; the following five hints will.

Make sure you have a Plug-and-Play BIOS.

To make the most of Plug-and-Play, you may need to upgrade your
computer's basic input/output system (BIOS). Stored on a ROM
(read-only memory) chip, BIOS software starts your PC, loads
the operating system and then hands control of the PC over
to it. The BIOS also contains the instructions that activate
all your peripheral devices. A Plug-and-Play BIOS helps your
PC understand what hardware is plugged in, and it works with
Windows 95 to coordinate the setup of those devices.

If you bought a new PC from a major manufacturer during this
holiday season, odds are it will have a Plug-and-Play BIOS.
If you bought a PC earlier in 1995, chances are good that it,
too, has this type of BIOS.

But if you bought your PC in 1994 or earlier, it's likely your
computer doesn't have a Plug-and-Play BIOS. If you're not sure,
call the manufacturer's technical-support line. Or, on many
PCs, you can press F1 (or another key or keys; check your manual)
while your computer is booting up to see its setup screen,
which displays the BIOS version your PC uses, as well as other
information about your computer.

If you don't have a Plug-and-Play BIOS, or if you suspect there
might be a newer version that simplifies hardware installation
for Windows 95, call your PC manufacturer to explore the possibility
of upgrading your ROM chip. (If your PC is very old, you may
not have the option to upgrade to a Plug-and-Play BIOS, though
you'll probably be able to run Windows 95.)

Some PCs use a "flash ROM BIOS," a special kind of ROM chip
that lets you update the BIOS software without replacing the
chip. Again, check with your PC manufacturer. If you have a
flash ROM BIOS, you can get an update on disk from the manufacturer,
or perhaps download it from an on-line service.

If you don't have a Plug-and-Play BIOS and can't upgrade to
one, you can still reap some of the benefits of Plug-and-Play.
For instance, in many cases Windows 95 sets up peripherals
such as a sound card, CD-ROM drive or printer automatically.
On the downside, it may not recognize start-up devices such
as a hard drive, floppy drive or keyboard controller. You'll
have to set these up yourself, which requires the answers to
some technical questions from the hardware manual or the manufacturer.

If you're buying a new PC, ask if its BIOS supports Plug-and
Play, and don't take "No" for an answer. Better still, the
reply should be, "Yes, it's an ESCD Plug-and-Play BIOS." That
means the BIOS creates an Extended System Configuration Data
list of any tricky changes you may have had to make manually
to set up devices that Plug-and-Play couldn't handle on its
own. This list is stored on the BIOS chip, which retains the
information when you turn off the PC, or even through a major
system crash.

Buy Plug-and-Play peripherals.

Windows 95 will try to install any peripheral you add, but it
works best with hardware that's designed to support Plug-and
Play; such devices identify themselves to Windows 95 and tell
it what they need to run properly. Unfortunately, many of the
peripherals in stores now--and most of those you probably own
already--were not designed for Plug-and-Play.

How do you know if a device supports Plug-and-Play when you're
shopping for new hardware? There's no independent testing service
for Plug-and-Play compatibility, so the only way to be sure
is to look on the peripheral's box for Microsoft's seal of
approval: "Designed for Microsoft Windows 95." A manufacturer
may claim that its product is "Plug-and-Play compatible," but
be skeptical, because such a claim without Microsoft's label
likely signals two things: The manufacturer believes the product
is easy to set up, and it declined to pay Microsoft a fee to
test it to make sure. Before you go shopping for hardware,
ask for a list of products approved by Microsoft from its customer
service department (800-426-9400), its forum on CompuServe
(Go MSL) or its World Wide Web site (http://www.microsoft.com)

Get the latest drivers.

Drivers are programs that help your peripherals and computer
understand each other. They're like translators at the U.N.
-without them, no communication occurs.

Windows 95 includes drivers for the most popular peripherals.
Drivers written specifically for particular devices obviously
deliver the best possible performance for those models, because
they adapt to and implement the devices' most sophisticated
and advanced features.

Some drivers will work with a number of different peripherals.
For example, Windows 95 includes drivers for the popular Hewlett
Packard ink jet printers; these drivers will work with most
ink jets from other manufacturers, too, because they follow
standards set by Hewlett-Packard. Similarly, most modems can
pretend to be a Hayes modem, and most sound cards can use drivers
designed for the Creative Labs Sound Blaster.

Windows 95 tries to assign a specific driver to each device.
If it can't find one, it looks for a compatible generic driver.
If it can't find even that, it will tell you so and ask for
a disk with a suitable driver. (Most new peripherals are sold
with a floppy disk that contains such a driver.)

If the disk includes a 32-bit Windows 95 driver, use it (check
the manual or call the manufacturer to find out)--it will probably
give you even better performace than the generic drives that
are built into Windows 95. If one of your older devices has
just a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.1 driver, you're better off
using Windows 95's generic 32-bit drivers if you can; if those
don't work, your only choice may be to use the 16-bit driver
you've got on the disk.

If you're installing an older peripheral device, call the manufacturer
to get the latest version of the driver. The company will send
it to you on disk, or tell you how to download it from an on
line bulletin board. Again, a specific 32-bit Windows 95 driver
is best, but if you must use an older 16-bit Windows 3.1 driver,
make sure it's the latest version. A new driver for your device
most likely will have fewer bugs and work better with other
new hardware and software.

Ask the Wizard.

When you have the latest drivers, you're off to see the Wizard
-a Windows 95 feature designed to help you through peripheral
installation. Plug in the device, then click on the Windows
95 Start button, highlight the Settings options, click on the
Control Panel, then double-click on Add New Hardware to bring
up the Add New Hardware Wizard. Click on the Next button, then
click on Next again to instruct Windows 95 to find your device.
If the Wizard finds your peripheral, it will try to install
the appropriate driver.

If Windows 95 can't find your hardware, it will ask you to click
on Next to install the device manually. When you do so, you'll
see a list of hardware types: CD-ROM controllers, display adapters,
video and game controllers, and so on. Click on the type of
device you're trying to install, then click on Next.

For most types of devices, you'll see a list of manufacturers.
Click on the one that made your device; then click on the particular
model. If the manufacturer and model aren't listed, it means
Windows 95 doesn't include a specific driver for that device.
You now have two choices: You can choose a compatible or generic
driver (look in the device's manual or call the manufacturer
to see which of Windows 95's built-in drivers you should use),
or you can install a new driver supplied by the device's manufacturer.

To install the driver, click on Browse, locate the driver on
your floppy disk or CD-ROM, and then click on OK. Windows 95
will copy the driver to your hard drive and add its name to
its Registry file of drivers. The Wizard will also add a line
about the driver to the autoexec.bat and config.sys files if
it's a 16-bit DOS driver. If Windows 95 doesn't find the driver
on your floppy disk or CD-ROM, run the Windows 3.1 Install
program, which you should find on the floppy or CD-ROM. Then,
restart Windows 95 and return to the Add New Hardware Wizard.
The driver should now be on your hard drive.

If you're installing a device that isn't made for Plug-and-Play,
you may see a message that tells you the device conflicts with
hardware already in your PC. This is the toughest nut to crack.
It means some other peripheral has already laid claim to a
resource--an I/O port or memory address--that the device you're
trying to install needs for itself. The more devices you have
that aren't made for Plug-and-Play, the greater the chance
of such conflicts.

Do a little troubleshooting.

To see which device conflicts with the one you're trying to
install, go back to the Control Panel, double-click on the
System icon to bring up the System Properties window, then
click on the Device Manager tab. You'll see a generic list
of all the hardware hooked up to your PC. A "+" next to a device
means you can click on it to see its model name and manufacturer.
An X through a device icon means it's been disabled. A circled
exclamation point through a device icon indicates a problem.

Double-click on any device icon that has an X or an exclamation
point to get some details about the nature of the conflict
between this device and the one you're trying to install. Under
the General tab, you'll see the type, manufacturer and version
of the device. You can also read about its status, including
any problems. Under the Driver tab, you can see the version
and location of any driver the device uses. Under the Resources
tab, you'll see the resources the device is using: I/O ports,
memory addresses, interrupts (signals to the processor to stop
doing other work and turn to this device) and so on.

If you know your way around a PC, you can assign the memory
addresses and other resources each non-Plug-and-Play device
should use. But remember, if you make the wrong choices, your
device may not work, or you may even risk freezing your computer;
in most cases, your best bet is to call the device's manufacturer
for technical support.

To find a complete list of the resources your devices are using,
click on the Computer icon at the top of the Device Manager
list and then click on the Properties button. If you want help
in assigning resources, double-click on the Start button, click
on Help, then double-click on Troubleshooting. Here, you can
click and double-click your way through a variety of suggestions
on what to look for, and get some guidance concerning resource
assignments.

Once the device is installed, make sure it's working at peak
levels. Go to the Control Panel and double-click on the icon
for the device (if you can't find it there, you may find it
under the System icon). Then click on the Properties button
to see if the device is set for maximum performance. It probably
will be, but sometimes a generic driver assignment or another
glitch can affect the setting. In that case, you can adjust
many of the settings simply by clicking on them. (For tips
on how to do this, see Nuts + Bolts on page 215.)

If you heed the five points above, you'll help Windows 95 recognize
and install hardware, whether or not it's designed for Plug
and-Play. As a Plug-and-Play BIOS becomes more common in PCs
and more peripherals are designed for Windows 95, PC owners
can indeed look forward to the easy installations Mac users
enjoy. Now that will be the answer to a prayer.

Setting Your Sites On The Web--All the world's your stage when
you create your own home page on the Internet; it's easy to
do--just follow our guide as you go.

By:
John Eckhouse

Jenny and Andy Wood love funky old American motels with flashy
neon signs. After living overseas for two years, Lisa de Araujo
developed a lingering fascination for all things Italian. Zoli
Nazaari-Uebele collects Barbie dolls and desperately wants
to fit one with a Pan Am stewardess outfit. Seven-year-old
Emma Bowen, who has a delightful English accent, hopes to visit
Legoland in Denmark again next summer.

I've never met any of these folks, yet I feel I know them well.
They've all told me about their hobbies, shared some of their
secrets, shown me family photos and even spoken to me. How?
Jenny, Andy, Lisa and the others all have "home pages" on the
World Wide Web, the multimedia section of the Internet you
can navigate with the click of a mouse button. All you need
is a Web connection through a commercial on-line service or
an Internet service provider, and Web browser software.

Think of a home page as a cross between an autobiography and
a billboard. It's the front door to the information you post
that dwells on the Internet. Once visitors enter, they'll see
whatever information you choose to share with them--perhaps
something about you, your family, your occupation or your hobbies.
You can include photographs, sound, even home movies. You can
also highlight certain words--called hyperlinks, or links,
for short--to provide instant one-click access to other pages
you've created, or to pages you like that were designed by
other people.

IN THE BEGINNING

Until 1994, most home pages were created by computer enthusiasts
and college students with lots of time on their hands. Some
pages were witty, many were informative--but most were about
as engrossing as watching mold grow on stale bread. One guy
posted a list of all the musical tapes in his collection; another
filled his page with a roster of all the computer classes offered
at his university--and one desperate soul posted a photo of
his toenail clippings. Many pages looked like ransom notes,
overflowing with randomly chosen type sizes and styles, and
gaudy colors.

But as new software made Internet access easier, more people
began discovering the Web--a fact that didn't escape the notice
of corporations and advertising agencies, which soon began
exploring, too. Slick promotional sites and virtual stores
began popping up in short order, featuring glitzy pages with
sharp photos, sounds and videos. After seeing the possibilities,
more individuals began investing the time to create enticing
home pages. Today, you can find everything on the Web from
the daily news to health tips to video clips of windsurfers
to a self-published book titled 54 Ways You Can Help the Homeless
(for a small sampling of the variety of home pages on the Web,
see the examples beginning at left)

Equally important to the boom in personal home pages is that
they've grown increasingly easy to produce. It no longer requires
a computer-science degree to create a home page using HyperText
Markup Language (HTML), the standard format for writing Web
pages; a little time, a dash of creativity and the right software
will do just fine. Take it from me: I know nothing about programming
or design, yet in about seven hours, I created my first six
linked pages on the Web.

My main page is called Cyber Ace, the name of the back-page
column I write for HomePC. On my Web pages, I created hyperlinks
to an autobiographical page, a page describing the Cyber Ace
column, a page featuring a photo of my family's kittens and
two pages describing my experiments with HTML code. There are
also nine links to other Web sites that are related to my life
in some way.

My pages won't win any design awards, but I'm proud of them.
There's no better way to entertain, inform or introduce yourself
to a worldwide audience at this price; just follow the steps
below, which outline the way I set up my own home page, and
you, too, can get entangled in the joys of the World Wide Web.

LOOK FOR INSPIRATION

Before starting your home page, look at what others have done
by clicking around existing home pages. Jot down notes on the
styles you like and the addresses (called Uniform Resource
Locators, or URLs) of attractive pages so you can go back later
for a closer look. Don't be shy about borrowing good ideas
you see on the Web--in cyberspace, imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery.

While there's no "right" way to design a home page, it's a very
good idea to include a few common elements: a title, a message
explaining what the page is about, brief biographical information
and a photo, a main topic, links to other Web pages and a way
for visitors to comment. If you have more than one page, it's
good form to put a link at the bottom of each page that will
take a visitor back to your home page with a single click.

MAKE A PLAN

Once you've toured Web sites, sketch out a basic layout for
your page on paper. What's the title? What's the first thing
you want visitors to see? Then what? Should you include a table
of contents? How will you link your pages? Do you want to include
photos and color graphics?

CHOOSE YOUR TOOLS

There are two easy ways to build the content of your page. You
can use a word-processing program with an add-on HTML converter,
which lets you compose your page in English and then, with
the click of a button, convert everything to HTML code. Or,
you can use an HTML editor, which lets you enter the proper
HTML coding--called tags--using a pull-down menu or keyboard
shortcuts. (For a sampling of software options, see the box
below.)

I chose an HTML editor, because it let me preview my work as
I went along. Also, it let me learn a little about HTML; I
picked up what HTML tags do pretty quickly, which let me type
in new tags--say, to align words by a photo--that may not yet
be included in the conversion programs. To create my pages,
I used a program for the Macintosh called BBEdit, which is
available for free on the Web. I picked up additional tips
from some Web sitesand a few books.

BREAKING THE CODE

Once you begin, you'll notice that virtually every HTML command
begins and ends with a tag inside the "less than" and "greater
than" symbols:  < >.  The only difference between the starting
and ending command is the addition of a slash (/) to the latter.
For example, every page on the Web begins with the tag <HTML> and
ends with </HTML> .  (Commands within the symbols are usually
written in capital letters.)  These tags tell a Web browser how
your page should look when viewed on a screen.

Two commands you'll see frequently are <BR>, which breaks type
over two lines, and <P> , which breaks type over two lines and
adds a line space in between.  You don't need an end tag after
either of these commands.

NAME YOUR PAGE

Pick a title for your home page; it will appear in the title bar
at the top of your Web browser.  To name my page Cyber Ace, I
typed this:  <TITLE>Cyber Ace</TITLE>

It helps readers know what they're looking at if you place a
graphical heading or title in large type across the top of
your page; most often, it's the same as the title of your page.
Basic HTML lets you use six text-heading levels--the type size
decreases as you go from level 1 to level 6. Just as a larger
newspaper headline generally flags a more important story,
larger headings typically signal the major sections of your
home page. A good rule of thumb is to put your main heading
in H1, then use smaller sizes for subsequent headings.

For my page, I spread the headline over two lines, making the
second line a bit smaller than the first.  I used a pull-down
menu in the software to create the HTML tags for the heading
sizes.  In HTML code, it looks like this:  <H1>The Cyber
Ace</H1><H2>"Your On-Line Tour Guide"</H2> 

After applying the HTML code, I found it helpful to check out
what it looked like through my Web browser, just to make sure it
delivered what I had in mind.  After every few lines, I saved the
document and looked at it using the Preview command.  After
giving my headlines the once-over, it seemed to me they'd look
better centered on the page, so I added a center tag before and
after the text.  And since HomePC holds the trademark to the name
Cyber Ace and the logo illustration, I consulted one of my
guidebooks and found that I needed to type "(r)" immediately
after the word "Ace" to get the symbol to appear.  Putting it all
together, here's how the headline looked in HTML:  <CENTER><H1>The Cyber
Ace(r)</H1><H2>"Your On-Line Tour Guide"</H2></CENTER>

CREATE HYPERLINKS

If you have a large home page, you may want to create a table
of contents on top with hyperlinks to the sections visitors
will find below. You can also link to other Web pages you've
created or any other Web page you like.

Don't go overboard when you designate hyperlinks from your home
page. Some people make virtually every word on their page a
link, which is offputting to visitors. Similarly, designate
only a few words as a link, rather than a whole sentence--it
works just as well from the reader's perspective, and it's
easier on the eyes.

For my first attempt, I put a direct link to my e-mail address.
There are many ways to do this, but I selected a command known as
"mailto" because it calls up a preaddressed form visitors can use
to send me e-mail.  To link to my e-mail address, I created an
HTML reference to it using a command known as HREF, then
"anchored" the whole thing using the <A> and </A> commands.
Trust me, it's less complicated than it sounds.  Here's what it
looks like:  Send questions and comments to:  <A HREF=
"mailto:eckhouse@cerf.net"></A>The Cyber Ace

When viewed through a browser, it shows up as "Send questions
and comments to The Cyber Ace"; the last three words are highlighted
in blue. A click on these words calls up a mail form addressed
to eckhouse@cerf.net.

Next, I added links to the HomePC home page and the Cyber Ace
column within HomePC's site:  
<A HREF="hhtp:/techweb.cmp.com/techweb/hpc/current/18cyberspace.
html#cyberace">December</A>

When a visitor clicks on the blue underlined word "December,"
they'll jump to my column.

USE HOT BUTTONS

You can also use a graphic as a hyperlink--called a hot button.
A click on the image whisks a visitor to another Web page.
For instance, on my autobiographical page, I added the Cyber
Ace graphic as a link; clicking on it calls up my Cyber Ace
home page. To do this, I created an "image tag" for the graphic
by typing in the location of the artwork in relation to the
HTML document on my server. It looks like this:
<IMG SRC="cyberace.gif">

This image tag must be included inside the opening and closing
parts of an anchor tag, along with a reference that tells
visitors where they'll go when they click on the link.  The image
of the Ace on my page takes visitors to the page named
cyberace.html.  I could align the words explaining this to
visitors with the top, middle or bottom of the graphic.  I wanted
the words centered, so I added the command "ALIGN=middle" to the
following line of code:  <A HREF="cyberace.html"><IMG
ALIGN=middle SRC="cyberace.gif"></A> Return to the Cyber Ace page

ADD SOME COLOR

A page without artwork won't draw much attention from visitors,
so add some icons or color graphics, or scan in your own drawings
or photos. Most of the images you see on the Web are stored
in the GIF or JPEG format. The software included with most
home scanners and graphics programs gives you the option to
store images in one of these formats.

Note just how much disk space each image you include demands
from your computer. On a Web page, the more large files, photos
and graphics you use, the longer it takes your page to come
into view on a visitor's screen--and the higher the risk readers
will grow impatient and move on. If you post a large photo,
store it on a Web page by itself and link to it from your home
page. Next to the link, let viewers know how large the file
is to give them an idea of how long it will take to appear
on their screens. This helps them decide whether it's going
to be worth the wait.

For artwork to spice up your page, stop at the HTML Goodies
Page (http://www.cs. bgsu.edu/~jburns/gifs.html), where you
can stock up on icons, buttons, arrows and other graphics.
You can also pick up GIF files of colorful textured and patterned
backgrounds at The Background Sampler (http://home.mcom. com
home/bg/backgrounds.html). I replaced the standard gray background
on my home page with a tan texture by storing a GIF file on
my hard drive and writing an HTML command calling for it just
under the title command of my Cyber Ace page:
<BODY background="WIND_PAP.GIF">

WATCH FOR TYPOS

If you're adding a background graphic, be sure to type the file
name exactly as it's stored. I typed the file name in lowercase
when it was written in capital letters, and it took me 10 minutes
of trial and error to figure out why the background wasn't
showing up on my page. I also discovered the hard way that
many Web servers can't recognize certain characters in file
names, such as exclamation points, ampersands and spaces.

STORE FILES WISELY

It's a good idea to store all your files--say, a few Web pages
or one home page and several graphics--in one folder on your
computer; this makes it easier to organize your files for a
Web server, a computer set up to send pages to other computers'
browsers on request. Give your graphics the proper designation,
such as a .gif or .jpg file-name extension.

Also, if you have more than one file, you need to give the main
home page--the intended starting point for visitors--a designated
file name or extension, which will depend on the Web server
you're using. For example, you may need to mark the main home
page as .default.html, .home.htm or .index.htm. This lets the
Web server know which page to dish up first when a browser
asks for your file.

USE A CHEAT SHEET

If you don't know the HTML code for a particular style, just
copy it from someone else's home page. Every page on the Web
contains the construction blueprint of HTML codes that were
used to create it. Simply go to the View pull-down menu on
your browser and click on Source.

ADD A TEXT-ONLY OPTION

Not everyone on the Web has a browser that can view graphics,
and some people turn off the graphics in order to speed up
their flights around the Web. Also, many HTML commands work
only with the popular Netscape Navigator browser; people using
other browsers might not be able to see images on your page.
It makes sense, therefore, to offer visitors a text-only version.
It took me just a few seconds per page to delete the graphical
commands.

DISCOVER NEW TRICKS

There's a lot more to HTML, if you're interested. I learned
how to make words blink, add pull-down menus and install a
device to count the visitors to my pages. I posted samples
on my practice page--drop by and view the code at http://techweb.cmp.com
hpc/jeckhous/ experimental.html.

FIND A WEB SERVER

After you create your home pages, you'll need to post them on
a Web server. If you wish, you can set up your own Web server
at home, but it's much easier to buy space on someone else's.
Most Internet service providers rent space, as do some of the
commercial on-line services. You can find a list of Internet
service providers on the Web at http://thelist.com/.

The fees for storing Web pages vary, so shop around. Expect
to pay no less than $25 a month for about 5 megabytes of disk
space--ample room for several pages. Check to see if there's
a charge each time you change your pages. Most likely, you'll
use the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) feature of your browser
to upload pages to your Internet service provider.

When your Web pages are complete and stored on a Web server,
your welcome mat is out and you're ready to invite the world
into your cyberspace home. Let friends know about it through
e-mail, postings in on-line discussion groups and any other
way that comes to mind. Speaking of which, drop by my completed
page (http://techweb.cmp. com/hpc/jeckhous/cyberace.html) and
let me know what you think.

Paging The Web For Advice

By:
John Eckhouse

The best place to get the latest scoop on how to create a Web
page is the World Wide Web itself. New techniques and styles
appear so quickly that books and software just can't keep up.
Here's a look at some helpful on-line sources.

A Beginner's Guide to HTML

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/ html-primer.html

What better place to start than the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications, where the first Web browser was created less
than three years ago? This guide is a terrific primer for people
trying to understand HTML.

The Bare Bones Guide to HTML by Kevin Werbach

http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/barebone.html

Even if you think you know what you're doing, you'll want to
keep this guide by your side as you create Web pages. It's
more of a "cheat sheet" than a manual--and a resource you'll
refer to again and again to find the HTML coding you need.

Creating a Home Page

http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/ netizens/construction.html

Here's a simple, concise, step-by-step guide to creating a basic
home page with links and graphics. It teaches you how to use
HTML without forcing you to understand exactly what the arcane
commands mean.

Webmaster Reference Library

http://www.corpnet.com/~aking/webinfo/

Aimed at everyone from aspiring HTML authors to Web professionals,
this site offers links to more than 550 other pages that provide
information, tutorials and tools. 0--J.E.

Page-Turners (Literally)

By:
John Eckhouse

Whether you're a Web novice or a veteran Net surfer, bookstore
shelves are overflowing with titles that will help you create
your own Internet home page. Here are four of my favorites.

Build a Web Site by Net. Genesis and Devra Hall (Prima Publishing;
$34.95)

Intermediate and advanced Web users will get a helping hand
here; it's especially useful if you know the Unix operating
system and want to set up a Web server.

HTML for Dummies by Ed Tittel and Steve James (IDG Books; $29.99)

Explore the basics of the Internet, the World Wide Web, and
acronyms like SLIP, PPP, MPPP, HTTP and HTML before learning
how to design and build a Web page. The book includes a disk
with a number of Web documents and a hyperlinked list of all
the Web pages mentioned in the printed text; if you have a
Web browser, you can view those pages with a click of your
mouse.

HTML Web Publisher's Construction Kit by David Fox and Troy
Downing (Waite Group Press; $36.95)

This book works best as a reference for people who already know
a bit about HTML coding and just need some tips on creating
graphical tables, customized shaded lines, bullets and other
frills. (You can skip the first section of the book and move
immediately to Part II: Creating Web Pages.) It includes a
CD-ROM loaded with software and tools to create your own Web
site.

Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML in a Week by Laura Lemay
(SAMS Publishing; $25)

Novices will find this delightful, well-illustrated primer a
breeze to follow. Don't miss the chapter on the do's and don'ts
of Web page design. And if you care to learn more about HTML,
it's packed with instruction explaining the more advanced features.

Pix To Click--PHOTO LIBRARIES ON CD-ROM. Focus in on discs with
striking photos that liven up birthday cards, fliers, reports
and more in a flash.

By:
Tony Roberts

A picture is worth a thousand words, folks say, so imagine how
eloquent you'd be if you had hundreds of professional photographs
at your fingertips. You could jazz up your music newsletter
with the image of a saxophone, give your sales presentation
a boost by adding a slide of the space shuttle blasting off,
even add sparkle to your screen saver with dazzling shots of
a fireworks display.

Like clip art and display fonts, color photos add flash to your
newsletters, reports or presentations. And now that photo collections
are available on CD-ROM, it's easy to find just the right picture;
a single disc can hold more than 1,000 images. If you want
to add spice to your cooking newsletter, choose a gallery with
photos on a single theme, such as fruits and vegetables. The
images in a disc of general photos, meanwhile, can come in
handy for everything from birthday cards to business fliers.

Many CD-ROM photos can be imported directly into your desktop
publishing, graphics or presentation program, but others require
special software before you can use their images. (For tips
on how to make sure the collection you choose is compatible
with your software and hardware, as well as your needs, see
"Formats in Focus" on page 138.)

Most photo CD collections are royalty-free, which means you
don't have to pay an additional fee to use an image from the
disc in any document or item you create for personal use. Your
child can go wild putting shots of lions in his or her school
report on nature, and you can use the photos in greeting cards,
newsletters and, in many cases, advertising, promotional materials
and business presentations--although some collections restrict
the number of pieces you can print using any single image.
You may even be able to use them in commercial products, such
as calendars or T-shirts, but you'll have to get permission
first. Other restrictions might also apply, so when you're
working on a project that could run afoul of your license agreement
-say, a print ad or a World Wide Web site--do some research
to be sure it's fair use.

Remember, the images included in any CD-ROM collection reflect
the skill and artistry of the photographers involved; quality
varies. On the following pages, you'll see some of the CD-ROM
color-photo libraries we feel are sure to make you smile.

First exposures

The variety of pictures--2,500 images spanning 88 categories,
including Agriculture, Fashion, Health Care, Occupations, Nature,
Religion, Sports and Transportation--and a price that's hard
to beat make PC Paintbrush PhotoLibrary a good way to start
your digital photo collection. The low-resolution images on
this two-disc set--stored in both TIFF and BMP formats--work
best as quarter-page shots, or you can use them with the Windows
Wallpaper option or the After Dark screen saver to decorate
your desktop. To help you find the perfect photo for any project,
the package includes the Power Album for Windows and Fetch
for the Mac, both of which let you browse thumbnail-size screen
images or search by keyword.

$49 (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Softkey, (800) 323-8088, (617)
494-1200. 

Postcards from the edge

Every picture tells a story, so let PhotoDisc's ClipPix help
you get your tale across in your next multimedia presentation.
The 500 photos--covering Business, Nature, Holidays, Objects,
Backgrounds, People, Landmarks and Sports--can add style to
the substance of any pitch. The images, stored in BMP and TIFF
formats for the PC and PICT for the Macintosh, are tailor-made
for do-it-yourself screen savers; use them at postcard size
or smaller for the sharpest printed images. The disc includes
software for browsing the images on screen, or you can refer
to the included card of thumbnail photos.

$149 (DOS, Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from PhotoDisc, (800) 528
3472, (206) 441-9395. 

A touch of class

Textured backgrounds from the Artbeats collection can give any
document or presentation slide an impressive finish. A marble
design on the cover of your financial proposal, for example,
immediately tells investors you mean business. Titles include
Marble & Granite, Marbled Paper Textures, and Leather & Fabric;
each comes with 40 high-resolution TIFF images for use in professional
documents, and 120 PICT files that perk up slides or World
Wide Web pages. The packages are pricey, but if they keep your
projects from fading into the background, it's money well spent.

$349 each (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Artbeats, (503) 863
4429. 

A precious natural resource

Would a bee's-eye view of an orchid help promote your gardening
club's fund-raiser? How about a shot of the towering California
Redwoods for your environmental group's annual report? If so,
Nature Scenes is a natural: You'll get 100 photos of deserts,
forests, lakes, icebergs, flowers and more, stored in the Photo
CD format. Nature Scenes is part of the 325 CD-ROM Corel Professional
Photo Series; each disc focuses on one topic, and includes
a printed card for quick reference, plus software for viewing
the images and using them as screen savers. They're sold individually,
or you can choose from 13 prepackaged "libraries," each with
25 discs.

$14.95 for individual discs, $149.95 for each library (Windows
3.1, Macintosh) from Corel, (800) 772-6735, (613) 728-8200.

Arty facts

The next time you want to re-create a page from the past, try
one of the timeless images from the Classic PIO Library. A
photograph of a vintage radio might be a turn-on for readers
of your antiques digest. Or perhaps including a picture of
an old scooter on your garage-sale flier will get the customers
rolling in. The six discs in the collection, sold separately,
include Business Equipment, Entertainment, Microphones, Nostalgic
Memorabilia, Radios and Telephones. Each contains two views,
in high- and low-resolution TIFF formats, of 20 objects photographed
at 20th Century Props, one of Hollywood's largest prop houses.
If you don't need 20 images of, say, microphones, there's also
a Sampler that has various items taken from the other discs,
including cameras, clocks, high heels, hula dolls and jukeboxes.

$69.95 each (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Classic PIO Partners,
(800) 370-2746, (818) 564-8106. 

Strokes of genius

You may never paint like Rembrandt or sculpt like Michelangelo,
but with Planet Art's Classic Graphics collections, the masters
themselves can add a touch of artistry to your projects. Choose
from among the works of Botticelli, Raphael, Van Gogh, and
the Dutch Masters, or from Japanese Art, Antique Maps, Textiles
of India and more. Each of the 28 discs has 100 high-resolution
Photo CD images. So let Leonardo da Vinci illustrate the literature
for your local medical society's annual conference, or choose
a Renoir for your school's art-fair poster--it's sure to make
an impression.

$89.99 each (DOS, Macintosh) from Planet Art, (800) 200-3405,
(213) 651-3405. 

Made in the cliched

Don't settle for dull documents when you can throw in everything
-including the kitchen sink. PhotoDisc's Metaphorically Speaking
spices up your projects by adding original photographic takes
on stock phrases. Is your glass half empty or half full? Are
you stuck behind the eight ball, working like a house afire,
comparing apples and oranges? Do you want to tip your hat to
someone special? The disc contains more than 100 images in
Photo CD format, plus a useful reference card. If you don't
want to put all your eggs in one basket, PhotoDisc has three
volumes of images of Everyday Objects, plus Just Hands, Just
Tools and Just Documents.

$149 each (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from PhotoDisc, (800) 528
3472, (206) 441-9355. 

Giving you the business

If you've ever spent hours hunting for an appropriate photo
to illustrate a company brochure or report, you'll value Images
of Business (Vol. 2) from Image Club's PhotoGear collection.
The disc contains 100 photos, including a telephone, a briefcase,
a globe, cluttered desks, shaking hands and corporate bodies
in motion, with several views of some subjects. There's a handy
reference card to help you find the image you want. Files come
in high- and medium-resolution TIFF formats, plus low-resolution
PICT format. You can also pique people's interest with PhotoGear's
MountainScapes (Vol. 5) or brighten your backgrounds with SkyScapes
(Vol. 6)

$59 each (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Image Club, (800) 661
9410, (403) 262-8008. 

A landmark collection

Interesting angles, creative cropping and vibrant colors make
the images in Digital Stock's Building and Structures perfect
for those who need--and can afford--top-quality architectural
photos. The disc contains 100 Photo CD images of Gothic cathedrals,
skyscrapers and other structures. Landmarks such as the Taj
Mahal, the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame are included, and the
unknown churches, barns and brownstones are charming. If you're
laying the foundation for a professional photo collection,
Digital Stock also has discs on Indigenous Peoples, Animals,
Business & Industry and more.

$249 each (DOS, Macintosh) from Digital Stock, (800) 545-4514,
(619) 794-4040. 

They shoot, they score!

You'll have a ball using the Stock Clips Sports Equipment collection
to jazz up your football club's newsletter--and you'll score
points with your readers. The disc holds more than 75 images
of everything from caps to cleats and cues to clubs. All have
been photographed on a white background, so they can stand
alone on a page or blend with other photos and designs. The
images, stored in high-resolution TIFF format, can be blown
up to create eye-catching fliers or posters. The disc also
includes Shadow files to create a 3-D effect. If playing with
these images whets your appetite for other titles from Digital
Media, try Food & Grocery Items, or Toys, Models & Game Pieces.

$99 (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Digital Media, (800) 786-2512,
(714) 362-5103. 

Digital potpourri

Add pizzazz to multimedia, video or slide presentations--or
liven up your screen saver--with Screens & Wallpaper from the
Seattle Support Group. Its 200 photos cover such categories
as Activities, Animals, Farms, Floral, Monuments, Patterns,
Scenery and Still Life. The pictures in Night and Neon--photos
of colorful outdoor signs and dazzling firework displays shot
against a nighttime sky--are unique and exciting. The images
come in various resolutions in BMP format for the PC and JPEG
for the Mac, and an on-screen browser lets you preview the
photos on the disc.

$19.95 (DOS, Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Seattle Support Group,
(800) 995-9777, (206) 395-1484.

Pix to Click: Formats in Focus

By:
Tony Roberts

Photo libraries are stored on CD-ROMs in various resolutions,
color depths and formats. Here's what you need to know to be
sure a collection will work for you.

* RESOLUTION: All photo images are bit-mapped--that is, they're
scanned and broken up into tiny pixels (dots), which are stored
as digital information; the more pixels per inch, the higher
the resolution. If two photos are the same size, an image with
1,024 by 768 pixels will contain more detail than one with
640 by 480 pixels. Reducing an image packs more pixels in one
square inch and boosts the resolution.

* COLOR DEPTH: This refers to the number of distinct colors
an image can contain. Each pixel is made up of bits of data.
A pixel that has 24 bits can be displayed in any of more than
16 million colors, while an 8-bit pixel is limited to one of
256 colors. Higher resolutions and greater color depths produce
images of better quality. But if your graphics card supports
a maximum of 256 colors, that's your limit, even if you're
working with a 24-bit color image.

* FORMAT: If you plan to print your documents professionally,
your best bet is the Photo CD format, which uses 24-bit color
and provides five versions of the same image, ranging in size
from 128 by 192 pixels to 2,048 by 3,072 pixels; the latter
can be enlarged to the size of a magazine cover and still retain
its sharpness. To open and store Photo CD images in a format
that your word-processing, desktop-publishing or presentation
program can use, you'll probably need image-manipulation software,
such as Adobe Photoshop. You also need at least 16 megabytes
of RAM to work with these images effectively.

Some collections store high-resolution, 24-bit images in TIFF
format, which can be used directly with many Windows or Macintosh
programs that let you import images, or in PICT format for
use with Mac programs. The JPEG format, which supports 8- and
24-bit color, works with both PC and Mac software; these files
are compressed to save hard drive space, and you may need special
software to work with the data.

For most home- and small-business projects--newsletters, fliers,
reports, overhead transparencies and so forth--that will be
output to a 300-by-300- or 600-by-600-dpi color ink jet printer,
low-resolution (640-by-480, for example), 8-bit image files
will do the trick. You can also use these photos for on-screen
presentations, or take them to a commercial service bureau
that can turn them into color slides. These images--which can
be stored in TIFF and PICT formats, and the BMP format for
Windows--contain less data, so you need only 8 MB of RAM to
open and manipulate them. --T.R.

Empowering Tools--Assistive technology gives the disabled community
equal access to computing's benefits.

By:
Lynne S. Dumas

Eleven years ago, a diving accident left Mary-Kay Webster a
quadriplegic. It was a tragic event, but it didn't stop her
from striving to lead an independent, productive life. Today,
with the help of a laptop computer she controls by manipulating
a trackball (she retains limited wrist movement), Mary-Kay
is an accountant for a local business, the Chesapeake Packaging
Company, working primarily from her Richmond, Va., home.

"One of the greatest frustrations since my accident has been
that I can do just one thing at a time," she says. "But with
my computer, I can do three things at once--I can transmit
a report while I write a letter and work on a spreadsheet."

This kind of perseverance with the help of technology is a familiar
story to Joseph Nagler, who runs the Center for Research in
Arts and Medicine at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine
in New York. "Home computers are tremendously empowering,"
Nagler observes. "They promote inclusion and level life's playing
field by helping remove the barriers and stigma that often
accompany a disability."

To reap these benefits, many people with disabilities rely on
special hardware and software, or "assistive technology." Using
these tools, individuals living with a variety of physical
challenges, from arthritis to blindness, can command a PC more
comfortably--or, in some cases, use one when it previously
had seemed impossible.

Jay Leventhal, a 37-year-old New Yorker, has been blind since
childhood. From his early years into adulthood, Jay used materials
printed in braille--not the most hospitable system for a writer
who wants to edit or update his work. Then, 10 years ago, Jay
got a PC equipped with a screen reader; this device works in
conjunction with a speech synthesizer to recite the text that's
on his computer screen, making it easier for him to read, write
and edit.

These days, Jay, who works at the American Foundation for the
Blind's Technology Center, is particularly pleased with the
opportunities on-line connections present. He uses e-mail to
correspond with friends around the world, something that was
difficult or impossible before. "With e-mail and my screen
reading program, my friends no longer have to worry about writing
in a format I can read," Jay says. "And although there aren't
any daily newspapers in braille, now I can connect to CompuServe
and keep informed with Associated Press news reports."

As Mary-Kay, Jay and others with disabilities have learned,
hardware, software and special computer gear can be a tremendous
help in day-to-day living and in achieving personal goals.
Below, you'll find a thumbnail guide to specialized computer
products that can help you or someone you know.  Some solutions,
such as wrist rests, are easy to use and inexpensive; others are
elaborate and pricey.  Before picking a particular technology or
product, consult a doctor, physical therapist or disabilities
expert to make sure it's the most appropriate choice.  For people
in need who can't afford the more expensive products, equipment
donations or grant programs sponsored by government, corporate,
community and religious groups may be an option.  The Internet
and commercial on-line services are also a gold mine of product
information, inspiration and support for people with physical
disabilities page 164)

Each description that follows includes approximate costs, but
bear in mind that prices vary widely. Since few computer stores
stock these specialized products, we include the names of a
few manufacturers in each category.

MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS

Motor problems range from minor restrictions on movement to
complete paralysis. Accordingly, the assistive-technology solutions
cover a wide range of conditions.

* Wrist and arm support

Proper support for wrists--and sometimes arms--can help ease
movement problems at the computer, such as the wrist and hand
soreness that occasionally accompanies a mild case of carpal
tunnel syndrome or some forms of arthritis. Wrist rests and
armrests, available for use with either a keyboard or a mouse,
will help maintain proper positioning.

Prices: $10 to $25 for a wrist rest; rests for the entire lower
arm cost about $125 apiece.

Manufacturers: Bucky Products, (800) 692-8259, (206) 545-8790;
DeRoyal/LMB, (800) 541-3992, (615) 938-7828.

* Keyboards

Special keyboards can help computer users with various disabilities.
Options range from split models designed to make typing easier
on hands and wrists (available at many computer stores) to
specialized alternate keyboards, which can assist people with
more severe movement problems.

--Miniature keyboards

The keys on these models are set very close together, which
allows people with a limited range of motion to use them without
straining.

Prices: $400 to $1,500.

Manufacturers: InTouch Systems, (800) 332-6244, (914) 354-7431;
TASH, (800) 463-5685, (905) 686-4129.

--Programmable keyboards

Using a combination of special hardware and software, these
products let users customize the position, size and function
of individual keys. For instance, someone with a motor impairment
can buy a board that has a few large keys preprogrammed to
perform special functions. Instead of having to type "Hello,
my name is Mary," for example, Mary could assign a key to that
phrase, which would appear on the screen whenever she pressed
that button.

Prices: Range from $250 to $1,700, depending on the level of
sophistication and customization.

Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;
IntelliTools, (800) 899-6687, (415) 382-5959.

--On-screen keyboards

These are not keyboards in the traditional sense; rather, they
are software programs that display a standard or modified keyboard
on the computer screen. Users can control this on-screen keyboard
with a mouse, touch screen or electronic pointing device.

Prices: $100 to $1,200.

Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;
Words+, (800) 869-8521, (805) 266-8500.

* Alternative data-input devices

Sometimes, people who can't use a keyboard or mouse can substitute
computer peripherals that let them control the computer with
a nod of the head, the touch of an elbow or even the sound
of their voice.

--Wands or pointers

The simplest alternative input devices--typically held in the
hand or mouth, or strapped to the head--are used to strike
a regular or alternative keyboard.

Prices: $20 to $120.

Manufacturers: Extensions for Independence, (619) 423-1748;
North Coast Medical, (800) 821-9319, (408) 283-1900.

--Electronic pointers

People with certain motor impairments may find it easier to
use one of these devices--sometimes in the form of a sticker
that can be worn on the forehead, finger or foot. Electronic
pointers allow the user to move the cursor on the screen and
issue commands through ultrasound or an infrared beam. For
instance, instead of striking keys or clicking a mouse, the
individual might manipulate the pointer to choose from sequentially
highlighted on-screen choices. These high-tech pointers work
with special hardware or software that interprets pointer commands
and gives users extensive control of their computers.

Prices: $1,000 to $2,000.

Manufacturers: Ability Research, (612) 939-0121; Madenta, (800)
661-8406, (403) 450-8926.

--Switches

Various parts of the body--for example, the elbow, foot or head
-can control switches to issue computer commands and enter
data. Users can control almost any standard program by employing
a switch that's linked to special software and a device that
translates the switch's commands into information the computer
is able to process.

Prices: $30 to $100; any special interface devices and software
will cost a few hundred dollars more.

Manufacturers: AbleNet, (800) 322-0956, (612) 379-0956; Toys
for Special Children, (800) 832-8697, (914) 478-0960.

--Trackballs

Essentially computer mice turned upside down, these data-input
devices use a movable ball atop a fixed base. (Many laptop
computers have built-in trackballs.) Rotating the ball with
the fingers, chin or another part of the body moves the computer's
cursor and lets some users select from on-screen menus more
comfortably than a switch or pointer allows.

Prices: $100 to $175; trackballs designed for people with particular
disabilities can cost $400 or more.

Manufacturers: Kensington, (800) 535-4242, (415) 572-9675; Penny
and Giles, (800) 554-0220, (508) 226-3008.

--Touch screens

Either attached to or built into a computer monitor, touch screens
for home use are similar to those used in airport information
kiosks and on automated teller machines. By touching the screen
over a particular option--say, to call up a menu item--the
user can see the desired information. In the home, touch screens
are often used along with special software, such as on-screen
keyboards.

Prices: $200 to $2,000; touch-screen overlays generally cost
less than complete monitors.

Manufacturers: Edmark, (800) 426-0856, (206) 556-8400; MicroTouch
Systems, (800) 642-7686, (508) 659-9000.

--Voice-recognition systems

People with severe motor impairments can control computers with
these systems, which combine hardware and software that allow
the user to tell the computer what functions to carry out-
just say "close file" or "print," for example, and the machine
complies.

Some voice-recognition systems handle only a limited number
of preset basic commands. If these are too bare-bones, more
advanced dictation systems may be the answer; these products
recognize an extensive vocabulary of spoken words, allowing
users to perform any number of tasks, such as dictating a letter.

Prices: $400 to $1,000.

Manufacturers: Apple Disabilities Solutions Group, (800) 600
7808, (408) 996-1010; Dragon Systems, (800) 825-5897, (617)
965-5200.

--Word-prediction software

Typically used in conjunction with a word- processing program,
these packages cut down on the number of keystrokes or other
physical motions required to feed information to the computer.
Using a keyboard or alternative input device to specify the
first few letters of a word, the software presents an on-screen
list of choices to complete the thought. For example, the letters
B-E might bring up "bell," "better," "best" and "because."
Choose the right word and the software drops it into the document
on the screen.

Prices: $250 to $700.

Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;
Words+, (800) 869-8521, (805) 266-8500.

HEARING IMPAIRMENTS

Computers set up with "auditory alerts"--such as beeps or bongs
-to relay information pose problems for users with hearing
impairments. There are a couple of easy ways to address this
problem.

If you or someone you know uses a Macintosh, adjust the Speaker
Volume setting (you'll find it in the Sound control panel)
to zero; then, instead of making a sound, the computer will
flash a visual cue. PC users who are running Windows 95 can
make a similar adjustment. (For more on Windows 95's features
for disabled users, see page 160.) For other PC operating systems,
add-in utilities are available to change auditory alerts to
visual cues. These packages generally cost around $20 from
vendors such as Microsystems Software, (800) 828-2600, (508)
879-9000.

SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS

For almost as long as PCs have been in use, people who can't
speak have employed them to communicate more easily, typing
their thoughts at the keyboard. But even with assistive technology,
one of the biggest frustrations in nonverbal communication
is the inability to express a thought quickly. Consider this
 When most of us speak, we deliver our thoughts at a rate somewhere
between 120 and 180 words per minute. How many of us can type
anywhere near that fast? On top of that challenge, speech impairments
can be associated with a range of motor difficulties, such
as paralysis.

Some of the products mentioned above, such as word-prediction
software, can help speed communication for people with speech
and/or motor impairments. And when necessary, computer systems
such as the products mentioned below can literally speak for
these individuals.

* Speech Synthesizers

Several products for people with severe speech impairments work
in conjunction with a speech or voice synthesizer that enables
the computer to "talk." Speech synthesizers are built into
all recent Macintosh models; PC users can buy an internal device
or an external synthesizer that plugs into their computer.

Prices: $100 to $400, but advanced models with output that more
closely resembles a human voice can cost as much as $2,500.

Manufacturers: American Printing House for the Blind, (800)
287-4204, (502) 895-2405; Echo Speech, (800) 377-3246, (805)
684-4593.

* Conversation software

Used primarily with portable computers equipped with a speech
synthesizer, these programs let people with severe vocal impairments
"speak," whether they're at home or out on the road with a
notebook. As a result, it's easier for nonspeaking individuals
to participate in social conversations; they can initiate dialogues,
answer queries and make jokes with the tap of a key. For instance,
by clicking on a screen icon or choosing a menu option, a user
can command a computer-synthesized voice to say "Hi, how are
you?" Some programs allow the user to type in more extensive
information--for example, an account of how he or she spent
the weekend--and store the anecdotes until the user is ready
to play the speech back for a friend.

Prices: $100 to $500.

Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;
Microsystems Software, (800) 828-2600, (508) 879-9000.

* Talking word processors

Combining a word-processing program and a voice synthesizer,
these programs repeat text aloud after it's been entered into
the computer.

Prices: $100 to $500.

Manufacturers: IntelliTools, (800) 899-6687, (415) 382-5959;
Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682.

VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS

In addition to the talking word processors, voice-recognition
systems and speech synthesizers mentioned earlier, the following
technologies can help people with partial or total vision loss
take advantage of the best that computers have to offer.

* Screen-enlargement programs

These programs may prove helpful for people with diminished
vision by magnifying computer-screen text and graphics to make
it easier to read. Individuals simply run this software in
conjunction with a word processor, spreadsheet or other software
program. Be aware, though, that even when used with a large
screen monitor, essential information can be pushed off the
viewing area when the text is enlarged. Before selecting a
screen-enlargement program, it's a good idea to check with
the manufacturer or seek the advice of someone familiar with
the program who knows how it works with specific software packages.

Prices: $250 to $500.

Manufacturers: Ai Squared, (802) 362-3612; Microsystems Software
(800) 828-2600, (508) 879-9000.

* Screen readers

Like Jay Leventhal at the American Foundation for the Blind,
people who are visually impaired can benefit from software
that works with a speech synthesizer to read aloud whatever's
on the screen (including menu options, as well as words and
numbers)

Prices: $150 to $500.

Manufacturers: Berkeley Access, (510) 883-6280; Microsystems
Software (800) 828-2600, (508) 879-9000.

* Braille devices

Refreshable braille computer displays translate what's on the
PC screen into the printed language used by visually impaired
or blind readers. These displays are called "refreshable" because
the braille characters--formed by small, rounded pins--change
to display each line of on-screen text. Another option is a
braille printer.

Prices: $5,000 to $12,000 for braille computer displays; $2,000
to $6,000 for braille printers.

Manufacturers: American Thermoform, (800) 331-3676, (213) 723
9021; TeleSensory, (800) 286-8484, (415) 960-0920.

Empowering Tools: How Windows 95 helps

By:
Maria Behan

Windows 95 includes several features that make it easier for
people with disabilities to use a PC. You'll find these options
in the Accessibility Properties window. To get there, click
on the Start button, highlight the Settings option, click on
Control Panel, then double-click on the Accessibility Options
icon.

The Accessibility Properties window has five tabs. Here's a
look at some of the options each makes available.

* Keyboard: StickyKeys lets people who type with one finger
or a mouth-stick press one key at a time to issue commands
that usually require the simultaneous pressing of two or more
keys, such as Alt+Tab. FilterKeys can help those who have trouble
with unintended keystrokes; it instructs Windows 95 to disregard
keystrokes that aren't held for a specified amount of time.

* Sound: The SoundSentry lets you substitute a visual cue for
an audible alert. ShowSounds enables programs that use digitized
speech or other sounds to display on-screen captions instead.

* Display: The High Contrast option allows those with limited
vision to select colors and fonts for easier reading.

* Mouse: MouseKeys lets people with motor problems control the
cursor with the numeric keypad instead of a mouse.

* General: The SerialKey option makes it easy to attach special
equipment, such as an alternative keyboard, to a PC's serial
port.

Tasteful Surroundings--Drop Into Your Kitchen For A Byte

By:
Ellen Frankel

Two years ago, Nina and David Spiegelman moved their young family
from a cramped New York apartment to a spacious house in suburban
Westchester. Even though their center-hall colonial is a roomy
3,000 square feet, Nina, a full-time homemaker, knew she'd
be spending a good part of her day in the kitchen, so she and
David decided to remodel the room and create a multipurpose
"family" center. As part of that plan, the couple felt it would
be the perfect spot for the family computer.

"We could have put the PC in one of the children's rooms, or
in our den or basement playroom," Nina explains, "but it made
more sense to us to place it in the kitchen, where it's so
easy for all of us to spend time together."

The Spiegelmans--like the Johns, who are profiled on the next
page--hit on an old idea that's gaining new popularity among
families remodeling their homes: using the kitchen as a magnet
for family activities, the room to which everyone in the house
gravitates after going their various ways each day.

A 20-BY-30-FOOT KNOCKOUT

To remodel their kitchen, Nina and David annexed the adjoining
breakfast room and back porch to create a roomy 20-by-30-foot
space. The multimedia PC and printer sit on a built-in desk
next to the wall oven. A cushioned bench forms an L with the
desk, providing a cozy corner with comfortable seating; the
cabinets underneath store software, board games, toys and sports
equipment. The large windows in front and to the right of the
PC reveal a lovely view of the garden and the woods beyond.

The house's traditional style dictated the choice for the kitchen
cabinets--a warm champagne finish on maple. Both the desk and
the built-in seating are made from matching, stock kitchen
cabinets; brass hardware and Laura Ashley fabrics complete
the mood.

"One of the best things about having the PC in the kitchen,"
says Nina, "is that opportunities pop up for all of us to learn
new computer skills from each other." Nina, formerly in magazine
ad sales, and David, a TV executive, use the PC for personal
correspondence and to manage household finances. Their sons,
Sam, 6, and Ben, 31/2, play with educational software. Looking
ahead to their school years, Nina foresees that "keeping the
PC in the kitchen will be really convenient when the kids need
both the computer and my help to do their homework."

AN IDEA TAKES ROOT ON THE FARM

Sharlette and Bill John hail from Missouri farm families. And
though they've chosen other careers--Sharlette has a real-estate
business, and Bill oversees their rental properties and works
in insurance--they still love the farmer's way of life. For
proof, witness their commitment to one of its venerable traditions
 making the kitchen the hub of family experience.

"When I was a kid," Bill recalls, "the kitchen was the only
room we heated, so we did everything there. We took visitors
to the kitchen, not the parlor. I wanted that for our home.
We had the space to put the computer elsewhere in the house,
but we wanted it to be where everything happens."

When they redid the 450-square-foot kitchen in their spacious
4,000-square-foot home tucked into a rural area near Kansas
City, Mo., Sharlette and Bill chose a contemporary decor, even
though the house, built in 1860, has a charming, old-fashioned
feel. "It's the only modern room in the house," Sharlette notes,
"but we like its clean, crisp look." She modeled the computer
center--an 8-by-8-foot built-in unit with attractive rounded
corners--after a style she saw in a magazine.

The computer center is finished in the same white laminate as
the kitchen cabinets. The PC and printer sit on a desktop;
three shelves above the desk hold software, books, family photos
and knickknacks. They chose a Balans chair, which lets you
sit in a kneeling position, for its ergonomic support.

"When we're finished using the PC, we just shut the unit's folding
doors, and our kitchen is totally neat and tidy," Bill says.
He particularly likes one unexpected benefit of putting the
computer in the kitchen: The family, which includes their children,
John, 17, and Christi, 19, spends less time watching television.
House rules state that when the PC is on, the TV, which is
also in the kitchen, is off. And it seems that one family member
or another is always using the computer. Sharlette often brings
work home from her office, and she lists her properties on
the Internet. Bill uses the PC to track their rentals. And
they both turn to the computer at tax time. John and Christi
stake their claim to the computer to do their schoolwork and
play games.

"In most families," says Bill, "the computer is in one room,
the TV in another, and the kitchen is for preparing meals;
everyone comes home and goes off to a separate place. In our
house, we come home and gather in the kitchen. And that's what
works for us."

Ellen Frankel is president of ECPM, an editorial consulting
firm in New York specializing in home design.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Documentary evidence: rating 13 
printers' value

By:
Sean Fulton

When you need a new printer, the signs are clear--too bad you
can't say the same for your documents. It may be that your
old ink jet wearily spits out a smudged copy of the resume
you've spent hours formatting. Perhaps it dawns on you when
you see your daughter's face after the colorful drawing she
couldn't wait to show you rolls out in black and white on your
monochrome laser printer. Or, the last straw may come when
you're out of aspirin and the rat-a-tat-tat of your cranky
old dot matrix churning out a 30-page report sets your temples
throbbing.

Knowing you need a new printer is easy; knowing which new printer
to buy is trickier. The good news--and part of the reason shopping
for a printer gets so confusing--is that these days, more and
more machines deliver high-quality output for a fraction of
the price you would have paid just a year or two ago.

Whether you're looking for a monochrome laser model that delivers
clean pages of text in a jiffy, or an ink jet that adds brilliant
color to greeting cards, children's homework assignments, business
handouts and other projects, you'll find plenty of contenders,
often priced at less than $500. Even if you need special capabilities
-say, a laser printer that supports the PostScript language
for heavy-duty graphics output--you still may walk away from
the store having paid less than $1,000.

When you start comparing printers, you'll run headlong into
dizzying specifications: resolution, speed, installed memory
and other potentially confusing terms. Each of these features
makes a real difference and deserves your attention, but there
are some things the numbers just won't tell you. For instance,
while it's nice to know that the printer you've got your eye
on feeds 20 envelopes at a time through the machine automatically,
that doesn't mean the unit handles the task well. Some printer
feeders will take your Number 10s, chew them up and spit them
out.

The most reliable way to learn how a printer performs is to
see it in action--and not just in the prepared demos you often
get when you visit stores. That's why we invited 12 people
with varying degrees of computer experience to try an array
of leading printers in our Consumer Lab as if they had bought
them for their own use, and asked them to tell us how satisfied
they were with each unit's performance under real-life conditions.

The 13 products our testers examined--including monochrome lasers
and color ink jets for PC and Macintosh systems--come from
seven of the top names in the printer business. (We chose not
to include monochrome ink jets, as the reasons for buying one
-essentially a matter of price--are disappearing: Printer makers
today offer color ink jets for as little as $20 more than the
monochrome models.)

Most of these companies sell more than one model in each category
we tested, so we asked them to send us the one product in the
line they believe offers the best value for home use. Hewlett
Packard sent different printers for the Macintosh and PC tests,
even though the laser and ink jet models the company designated
for Mac users will work with a PC as well.

UNDERSTANDING THE LINGO

A printer sure would come in handy to generate a cheat sheet
defining the terms you'll see as you do your research and shopping.
Resolution is perhaps the most common characteristic you'll
read about--and potentially the most confusing.

Essentially, resolution tells you how fine an image the printer
can generate. Both ink jet and laser printers produce text
and graphics by placing a series of dots on paper; printer
resolution measures how many dots the machine can fit in a
square inch, horizontally by vertically. The more dots per
inch (dpi), the higher the resolution--and the sharper the
image.

Almost all the printers we tested also include some sort of
"resolution enhancement" technology intended to help smooth
jagged edges on text and line art. How well does it work? Your
eyes are really the best judge; as a general rule, be skeptical
of any claims that such a feature actually increases the printer's
resolution.

The issue of resolution can get even more complicated with certain
variables. For instance, some color ink jet printers may support
enhanced resolution for printing in black and white, but not
in color. Or, some laser printers may be able to give you 600
dpi (shorthand for 600-by-600-dpi) resolution for PostScript
output, but not for documents that need to be translated into
the unit's built-in PCL (Printer Control Language) code, which
many PC users rely on for outputting everyday work.

And consider this: It's theoretically possible for a laser printer
with 300-dpi resolution to produce sharper images than some
ink jets with 600-dpi resolution. An ink jet printer works
by blowing its tiny dots of ink through little "jets" mounted
on a printhead; during printing, some "spraying" typically
will occur, taking a toll on the image's sharpness. In contrast,
a laser printer (or a printer that uses LED technology, such
as the Okidata OL-810e, which our testers reviewed) works along
the same lines as an office copier--a rotating drum picks up
toner, and then "melts" it onto the paper.

Clearly, resolution comparisons get complicated. If it all seems
too confusing, here's a simple rule of thumb that may help
 Without minimizing the importance of understanding and inquiring
about resolution issues, seeing is believing--in a nutshell,
if the results don't show up on the page, the numbers on the
box really don't mean a thing.

Beyond resolution, if you're shopping around for a color ink
jet printer, you should also familiarize yourself with color
correction and color-enhancement technology. Basically, these
features enable the printer's software to analyze the image
it's printing and massage it--for example, it might adjust
the tones and shades of the colors on the page automatically
-so that the printout looks its best. All the color printers
our testers reviewed make these adjustments to some degree;
not surprisingly, some printers implement the feature more
successfully than others. In the category of self-correction,
HP's ColorSmart technology won consistent praise from our testers.

Color ink jet buyers should also know the difference between
"true" and "composite" black. Generally speaking, for a color
ink jet printer, you're better off with a model that supports
true black for your color images, although it may cost more.
Composite black is produced by mixing the cyan, yellow and
magenta inks contained in a printer's tricolor cartridge, and
it tends to look greenish or gray on the page.

DON'T FORGET THE MEMORY

It's also important to consider how much random access memory
(RAM) your printer needs. Laser printers process an entire
page's worth of data internally before they put it on paper,
and so they typically require more memory than do ink jet printers,
which print out pages character by character.

In the past, if you had insufficient memory installed for your
laser printer, you'd risk seeing error messages when you'd
try to print a full page that contained complex graphics, or
other complicated jobs. Printer makers have devised a way around
this problem for most types of documents home users print.
The solution, called memory compression, effectively doubles
the amount of memory your laser printer has at its disposal.

Some manufacturers, such as Panasonic with its KX-P6100, have
elected to strip their laser printers to a bare minimum of
RAM and let your PC handle much of the image-processing work.
Typically, to use such printers (often called Windows or GDI,
for Graphical Device Interface, printers), you'll need a Windows
based PC with a 386 or faster microprocessor and no less than
4 MB of RAM; the more RAM and the beefier the CPU in your PC,
the better the performance you should see in your print jobs.

One advantage of a GDI model is that it may save you some money,
since you don't have to add in the cost of 1 megabyte (MB)
or more of installed memory. Die-hard DOS users may be less
interested in some of the printers that use this technology;
depending on the model, printing from DOS applications isn't
always smooth.

Another point to remember about printer performance is that
the manufacturer's maximum rated speed specifications won't
necessarily be the last word on what a printer can actually
do. The performance you see at home depends on a number of
factors, such as the kind of document you're printing (a page
of text will print faster than a page of graph-

ics, for instance), whether you're printing in "best quality"
or in "draft" mode, and even whether you're working in black
and white or in color. In the latter case, the difference can
be dramatic; a color ink jet that prints as many as four monochrome
pages per minute (ppm) may manage only 0.6 ppm in color. Once
again, always trust your own impressions rather than the manufacturer's
claims.

THE EYES HAVE IT?

With personal experience so crucial to a buying decision, how
can you be sure your experience at the store accurately represents
what you'll see at home? For starters, check that the printer
is outputting sample documents sent from a PC. Many in-store
printer demos hook up an interface box to the printer; you
press a button and the printer outputs a few sample pages.
While this will give you some idea of the machine's print quality,
you won't be able to tell how fast the printer operates when
connected to a real computer, or whether the printer's software
is effective and easy to use. It's important to know, for example,
if the software alerts you with an on-screen message that the
printer's out of paper or there's any other sort of problem;
all the products in this review do so.

Before making a final decision between a color ink jet and a
monochrome laser printer, consider some of the costs that will
arise after your purchase. For instance, most laser printers
handle high-volume use better than color ink jet printers do.
Typically, you'll spend about two

to two-and-a-half cents per page (excluding paper) for laser
output, but a page from a color ink jet--even if the printer
uses only black ink--can cost from three to four-and-a-half
cents. And a page of color output can send your budget reeling
-anywhere from 11 to 27 cents per page, depending on the amount
of color on the page.

Meanwhile, laser printers offer an attractive combination of
high-speed and high-quality output that makes them the printers
of choice in homes or home offices where color printing isn't
a necessity. While some of today's ink jets process black-and
white output at a rate of 4 ppm, laser technology lets a typical
home model send out as many as 8 ppm. (If you're wondering
what it would take to combine the best of both worlds and buy
a color laser for home, the answer these days is at least $2,000
-many color lasers will cost more than that.)

As for your electric bill, most ink jets--even in full operation
-aren't going to add much to your monthly tab, but lasers can
consume a surprising amount of electricity. To help conserve
money and energy, many laser and ink jet printers (including
all the models our testers looked at) adhere to federal Energy
Star guidelines for reduced power consumption. When not in
use, they shift into a "sleep" or "idle" mode that uses significantly
less electricity than the machines burn up in full operation.
(For more information on Energy Star computer equipment, see
"15 PC Sleepers" in the April 1995 issue of HomePC.) The Brother
HL-630 and Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS printers don't even include
on/off switches, since they power down automatically.

HOW THE TESTS WERE RUN

Six of our testers looked at the nine PC printers in our lab,
while six others worked with the four Macintosh products.

We armed the testers with a series of files to be
printed--including documents that combined text, photographs and
line illustrations.  We asked them to check the "smudge" factor
for ink jet printers, feed envelopes through all the machines in
bulk, clock how quickly the printers handled their various tasks,
and perform several other tests that simulate the way people at
home use their printers.  Our testers spent up to six evenings in
the lab; the PC models were connected to AST Advantage Pro P100
systems with 8 MB of RAM; the Macintosh units were hooked up to
Performa 5215CDs, also equipped with 8 MB of RAM.

When the testers reported back to us, we asked them to grade
each model's performance according to various criteria, including
the printer's documentation, ease of installation, design,
noise control, performance, overall value and overall quality.
We also asked them to grade the quality of text and graphics
(such as line art) reproduction, and color/grayscale quality,
which covers how well the printer simulates the tones and gradations
in images such as photos.

In the PC laser printer category, the Panasonic KX-P6100 took
top honors, providing exceptional output at a competitive price.
Among the PC color ink jet models, the OkiJet 2010--the first
ink jet printer Okidata has delivered to the market--took top
grades; the unit just edged out the category's top guns, including
HP's DeskJet 660C.

For the Macintosh, the Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS squeaked by
HP's LaserJet 5MP. Similarly, Apple's Color StyleWriter 2400
pulled in just ahead of the HP DeskJet 850C. In both cases,
however, the grades were extremely close.

Before our testers began to examine each printer, we urged them
to trust what they saw, and their reactions--the same advice
we've given you. But first, take the additional opportunity
to look through their eyes. The reviews that begin on page
200 should help give you a clearer picture of how to frame
your search.

Technical and research assistance for this lab was provided

Judy Hogan, Paul Malmquist, Mel Odemis and Sun Ying Tam.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Recycling printer toner cartridges 
turns trash into cash

By:
Jennifer Zaino

Did you know that your printer can help you preserve the environment
-and maybe make your wallet a little greener, too? Just return
your used-up toner cartridges to your printer manufacturer
or an independent recycler rather than toss them into the trash.

Printer makers such as Apple, Canon and Lexmark encourage you
to send back the empty toner cartridges from their laser printers
by paying the shipping costs. For instance, when you buy a
new toner cartridge from Canon, you'll find a postage-paid
UPS return label in the box to send your old cartridge to Canon's
recycling plant. Apple's new toner cartridges include a coupon
that entitles you to a $5 rebate if you return your old, empty
cartridge to the company.

Printer makers aren't the only outfits recycling toner cartridges
-independent companies such as Nashua (800-333-3439), in Nashua,
N.H., pay up to $15 for many brands of used toner cartridges.
Nashua remanufactures the cartridges, then resells them for
Apple, HP and other printers through authorized dealers.

Buying a remanufactured cartridge can save you money--from 30
to 50 percent of what you'd pay for a brand-new cartridge.
Apple also sells remanufactured cartridges directly: The $76
Apple SX Toner Cartridge fits the Apple LaserWriter II series
as well as other devices using the SX engine made by Canon;
it's about $30 cheaper than buying a new Apple toner cartridge
for such printers.

If you buy a toner cartridge that isn't brand-new, ask if it's
remanufactured, rather than simply recharged or reconditioned.
Unlike recharged and reconditioned products, a remanufactured
cartridge is thoroughly cleaned, and all its worn parts are
replaced for better performance and print quality. --Jennifer
Zaino

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Meet January's testers

By:
Sean Fulton

Alan Gleicher, 48, is a teacher. At home, Alan uses a nine-year
old Panasonic dot matrix printer hooked up to a 386-based PC,
but he's planning to move to a laser printer.

Adrienne Klein, 46, is an attorney. She uses an HP DeskWriter,
but plans to upgrade the printer this year. She's set her sights
on a color printer in the $300-to-$400 range.

Bill Egan, 37, is a graphic designer. His Apple LaserWriter
is connected to a PowerPC-based Macintosh. For his next printer,
Bill has his eye on a $4,000-to- $5,000 professional-quality
color device.

Ellen McLaughlin, 50, is a travel agent. She doesn't own a printer
to go with her Pentium-based PC at home, but she expects to
buy an ink jet model when she starts shopping around for one.

Thomas DeRosa, 29, is a student. He's satisfied with his current
Lexmark laser printer, but adds that if he were to consider
replacing it anytime soon, price would be his most important
consideration.

Judith Gleicher, 47, is a math teacher; she shares her dot matrix
printer with her husband, Alan (see above)

Steven Russell, 42, is a police officer. He uses a Panasonic
dot matrix printer with a 486-based PC, but he'd like to upgrade
to a new ink jet printer in the coming year.

Theresa Tocci, 31, works in medical billing. She uses a monochrome
dot matrix printer with her 486-based PC.

Genevieve Early, 49, is an accountant. She has an Epson dot
matrix printer at home, but plans to upgrade this year.

Tom Cifardi, 43, is a home-improvement contractor. He uses a
Macintosh and an Apple Color StyleWriter printer.

Leah Mainzer, 65, is a homemaker. She currently uses an Apple
StyleWriter, but she'd like to upgrade to a color printer sometime
soon.

Bill Anthony, 32, is an insurance agent. He uses a PC at work,
but not at home. He looks forward to the day when his office
system is hooked up to a color printer.

SPECS: PC laser, 300 x 300 dpi, 6 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* High performance

BAD NEWS:

* Flimsy output tray

Our testers had no doubts about their favorite PC laser printer
 The Panasonic KX-P6100 took top honors in seven of 10 categories,
including an A for noise control and a B+ for both graphics
and grayscale quality. Its overall excellence, coupled with
an attractive estimated retail price of $399, landed it a lofty
overall grade of A-

In terms of rated specs, this 6-page-per-minute model wasn't
the fastest laser printer that testers saw, but they considered
its speed to be more than adequate. They awarded the unit a
near-perfect A- for performance.

The group also praised the KX-P6100 for being easy to set up
and use. In particular, the testers were surprised at how well
the model printed envelopes, a task that trips up many printers.

Finally, our testers were impressed by the look of the printer
itself, and particularly its conservative use of space. The
KX-P6100 is an upright tower, so it takes up less room on a
desk or stand.

"I'd like to smuggle this one home with me," confessed Genevieve
Early. "It's fast, solid, dependable, easy to use--it's good."

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Okidata OL-810e

By:
Sean Fulton

 
B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Text quality: A

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B

SPECS: PC LED (laser-class), 600 x 600 dpi (text), 8 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Excellent print quality

* Compact size

BAD NEWS:

* High price

The Okidata OL-810e received the top score in only one category
our testers examined (and even that ended up a tie), yet when
the dust cleared, this unassuming, solid performer racked up
enough points to walk off with second place--just barely outpacing
two close runners-up, the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5L and Epson
Action Laser 1400.

For our testers, price was the main difference between the Okidata
machine and the first-place Panasonic KX-P6100. The OL-810e
carries a $799 estimated retail price, which testers adamantly
declared too high, even if the 8-page-per-minute machine was
the fastest-rated PC laser printer they saw.

Our group cited several areas that needed improvement before
Okidata could justify the high price in their eyes. For instance,
the OL-810e took the lowest grade of the five PC laser printers
we tested for its noise control (B). And several testers complained
about cryptic on-screen error messages they received. The unit
also received a B for its documentation, which put it barely
above the bottom of that category. "You'd have to read the
whole thing to know how to do anything," complained Thomas
DeRosa.

On the other hand, the unit shared first place with the Epson
Action Laser 1400 for its clear, crisp text, while it received
a solid B+ for both its graphics and grayscale quality. If
the OL-810e could print the money it takes to buy one, our
testers would have recommended it with no qualms.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5L

By:
Sean Fulton

 
B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: A

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B-

SPECS: PC laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 4 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Excellent text quality

BAD NEWS:

* Construction seems flimsy

Hewlett-Packard sells more printers than any other company,
and enjoys a well-established reputation for quality. Our testers
rated its LaserJet 5L third best among the five PC laser printers
they tried, awarding it a B+. In numerical terms, though, its
grade was just a hair ahead of the Epson Action Laser 1400
and a mere whisper shy of the Okidata OL-810e's score.

The HP brand name has become almost synonymous with printers;
consider that last year, at least three testers in our Consumer
Lab who had problems getting the LaserJet 4L up and running
still gave it extremely high grades. This year, our testers
faced no such contradictions when they gave the HP LaserJet
5L the highest marks in the PC laser group for ease of installation
and documentation (both A-)

Overall quality was a different story; the HP printer's B in
this area was the next-to-lowest score in the category, largely
on the basis of testers' complaints that its construction seemed
somewhat flimsy.

In the key print-quality categories, the LaserJet 5L scored
an impressive A- from our testers for its text output, but
received only B's for its graphics and grayscale reproduction.

In the final analysis, this model did well, but not well enough
to push it ahead of the Panasonic or Okidata models, even with
the weight of the HP name behind it. The LaserJet 5L may not
be a perfect choice, but it's certainly not a bad one, either.

B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control, text quality: A

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B-

SPECS: PC laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 4 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Excellent text and grayscale quality

* Prints envelopes well

BAD NEWS:

* Difficult to set up

Don't let the fourth-place ranking of the Epson Action Laser
1400 fool you; a few points here or there, and it could just
as easily have finished in second place, ahead of the Okidata
OL-810e. In its best categories, the Epson laser model tied
with the OL-810e for top text quality (A), and came in a close
second to the Panasonic KX-P6100 for grayscale quality (B+

However, it also took the lowest grade for overall value (B
)--the 4-page-per-minute printer's $499 street price seemed
high to our testers, when 6-ppm printers such as the Panasonic
KX-P6100 cost less. (The same was true even of the slightly
less expensive 4-ppm Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5L, which also
scored a B- for overall value.)

Several testers said they were baffled at how the Action Laser
1400 could handle the tricky job of printing envelopes with
ease, then complicate something as simple as installing a toner
cartridge. "Unlike with the other printers, I wasn't sure how
to line up the cartridge," said Thomas DeRosa. The documentation
wasn't much help; the Epson model tied with the Brother HL
630 PC laser printer for last place in this category (B)

Many testers said if they saw the Action Laser 1400 on sale,
they'd consider buying it; otherwise, they were hard-pressed
to justify the price.

B

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: B+

LOWEST GRADE: Graphics quality, grayscale quality, performance
 C+

SPECS: PC laser, 300 x 300 dpi, 6 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Generous paper capacity

* Low price

BAD NEWS:

* It's noisy

* Unexceptional print quality

While the Brother HL-630 came in last among the five PC lasers
we tested, it still managed to muster a very respectable B
grade.

Testers found its printouts acceptable, but not exceptional;
the unit received the lowest scores in print quality for the
PC laser printer group. "This is a good printer, but it's just
not the highest quality you can get," declared Thomas DeRosa.

All the testers liked the model's paper capacity--it holds 200
sheets, more than almost every other PC laser printer in our
tests. On the downside, the HL-630 claims a large amount of
physical space compared with its peers.

Although the B+ our testers awarded the HL-630 for noise control
was actually its best grade, they complained that the printer
was particularly noisy in comparison to the other models in
this group, largely due to the fan inside. All but one other
PC laser printer received higher scores for their ability to
keep the peace and quiet.

Even so, with the right price--it's slightly less than $400
retail--several testers said that they would consider buying
it.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS

By:
Sean Fulton

 
#1

B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Text quality: A

LOWEST GRADE: Grayscale quality: B-

SPECS: Mac laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 4 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* High-quality print

* Rugged design

BAD NEWS:

* Slower than the HP LaserJet 5MP

The two Macintosh-compatible laser printers in our tests were
relatively close in our jury's eyes, with the Apple LaserWriter
4/600 PS nosing out the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5MP in the
end. Ultimately, testers considered the lower-priced Apple
unit to be a greater overall value, even if they were disappointed
by its slower (4-page-per-minute) print speed.

"This would be even better if it were faster," said Bill Egan,
"but I would recommend it because of its overall quality."

Our testers gave the nod to the LaserWriter 4/600 PS over the
LaserJet 5MP for documentation, ease of installation and design
-although, while praising its classic, compact styling and
ruggedness, they complained that having a power-cord connector
behind a door at the back of the unit impedes access. Testers
also wished this model would have supported automatic envelope
feeding; instead, they had to hand-feed their envelopes into
the unit one at a time.

Even though the 4/600 PS falls a little short of the 5MP in
terms of some features and expansion abilities, testers ultimately
decided that if the money were coming out of their pockets,
they'd choose the 4/600 PS. This model, which, like the 5MP,
supports PostScript printing, seemed to strike the right balance
between price and capabilities to satisfy our Mac testers'
needs.

B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Text quality: A

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: C

SPECS: Mac laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 6 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Great grayscale output

* Fast performance

BAD NEWS:

* Costs more than the Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS

In our testers' eyes, the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5MP offers
superior speed, enhanced grayscale output and better overall
performance than the Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS. Nevertheless,
those features were not enough to let them swallow the 5MP's
estimated retail price of $1,000 compared with the Apple printer's
$900 estimated cost. That translated into a grade of C for
the LaserJet 5MP in overall value--and a narrow second-place
finish.

Our testers were a little confused when they didn't see a power
switch, yet the unit failed to wake up when they hooked it
to a Mac. The problem? They simply missed the on/off switch,
which is contoured into the side of the unit and difficult
to find.

Testers liked the text quality of both the 5MP and the 4/600
PS, with the A grade achieved by the HP unit just a fraction
of a point ahead of the A earned by the Apple device. But the
group seemed most impressed with the 5MP's ability to reproduce
high-quality images such as photographs; its B grade in the
grayscale category easily outstripped the Apple unit's B-

The 5MP also includes such flashy features as an infrared port
for wireless printing. While certain Mac users surely will
welcome such extras, eliminating a few of them to knock a few
more dollars off the price might well have saved the day for
this printer with our more value-conscious testers.

HIGHEST GRADE: Color/grayscale quality: A-

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B

SPECS: PC color ink jet, 600 x 300 dpi, 3 ppm (B&W), 0.5 ppm
(color)

GOOD NEWS:

* High-quality output

* Attractive price

BAD NEWS:

* It's noisy

When you're hot, you're hot--and Okidata was definitely sizzling
in our lab. Not only did its OL-810e LED printer take second
place in the PC laser category, but the first color ink jet
model the company has ever produced, the OkiJet 2010, beat
all comers in the PC color ink jet category. Testers lavished
praise on this model, giving it top marks in almost every area
we asked them to score.

When it came to performance, the unit earned a B, good enough
for a first-place tie with the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 660C.
But even if it had taken twice as long to generate printouts,
our testers said the output would have been worth the wait.

"I was very surprised when I saw the color quality," said Alan
Gleicher. The unit scored an A- for the quality of both its
color/grayscale and graphics output; text quality was only
slightly lower, at a B+. Testers were particularly pleased
that they could get crisp black output and vibrant colors without
losing too much green: The unit retails for less than $400.

Equally pleasing, "the OkiJet's software installation was easiest
of them all," said Bill Anthony; our testers awarded it the
best grade in that category (B+). The one quibble was noise
control, where this model came in third.

In addition to superior output, our testers liked the OkiJet's
solid feel; they all said it seemed built to last. They also
liked the 150-sheet feeder; rivals handle only 100 sheets.
But don't think the unit's strengths are just on paper--the
winning OkiJet 2010 won reams of real-world praise.

SPECS: PC color ink jet, 600 x 600 dpi (B&W), 600 x 300 dpi
(color), 4 ppm (B&W), 0.6 ppm (color)

GOOD NEWS:

* High-quality output

* Excellent documentation

BAD NEWS:

* Mangles envelopes

Only the OkiJet 2010 earned a better overall grade than the
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 660C among the PC color ink jet printers.
And the DeskJet model actually took top honors for its documentation
and performance (both B's, the latter a tie with the OkiJet
2010)

Testers raved about the instruction manual, which was chock
full of illustrated guides. "HP had the best documentation,"
declared Ellen McLaughlin. "I consider myself a novice, and
this was good for me."

Testers praised the model's dexterity; it churned out high-quality
output for both color and monochrome print jobs, and received
straight B+'s in all text, graphics and color/grayscale categories,
finishing second only to the OkiJet 2010. Like its Mac counterpart,
the DeskJet 660C uses HP's ColorSmart technology, a system
that adjusts the color balance on printouts to ensure it looks
as sharp as can be.

Our testers did cite a couple of drawbacks, though. For instance,
they awarded the DeskJet 660C the lowest grade for noise control
among the color ink jets (B); the printer lets out a mechanical
"whirring" sound each time a piece of paper travels through
its print mechanism. It also had problems printing envelopes;
some testers grumbled that the envelopes came out wrinkled
or smudged.

Despite these complaints, the DeskJet 660C (which is sold for
Macs as the DeskWriter 660C) proved to be a high flyer.

SPECS: PC color ink jet, 360 x 360 dpi, 4 ppm (B&W), 0.8 ppm
(color)

GOOD NEWS

* Attractive design

* Large buttons for easy use

BAD NEWS

* Printouts have a faded look

Canon includes a variety of home-oriented software--from the
Crayola Art program for kids, to Pattern Maker, a cross-stitch
application that prints colored stitching patterns onto fabric
-with the BJC-4100, which is nice. But this didn't cause our
testers to look past color and black-and-white print quality
they considered merely adequate in awarding the unit an overall
grade of B. They perceived its output to be a bit faded compared
with that of other printers--it could muster only a B- for
color quality, a C+ for graphics quality, and a somewhat better
B for text printouts.

While the BJC-4100 didn't earn unqualified praise, its attractive
styling, reasonable price and ease of use made testers take
notice. The device sports an elegantly sleek design that testers
said they would eagerly welcome into their homes. The group
also liked the fact that all the buttons and switches on the
unit were large and easily accessible. Like most of the other
color ink jets, the BJC-4100 has a 100-sheet paper tray and
can hold 15 envelopes at a time.

Even with its relatively low ranking, the BJC-4100 received
consistent B and B+ grades in most categories. The printer
even finished best among the color ink jets for noise control
(B+), which could be crucial for home use. "I'm considering
buying it," said Steven Russell. "The text quality is good,
and I like the quiet."

C

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: B

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: D

SPECS: PC color ink jet, 360 x 360 dpi, 4 ppm (B&W), 1 ppm (color)

GOOD NEWS:

* Low price

BAD NEWS:

* Printout quality trails the pack

The rating for the Epson Stylus Color IIs boiled down to one
question: Testers asked themselves if they'd sacrifice better
quality output to save roughly $70. The answer: the printer's
overall grade of C.

At about $329 retail, the Stylus Color IIs costs just a little
less than what you'd probably pay for the top-scoring OkiJet
2010, but our testers told us that small savings in price wouldn't
be worth the faded and gray output.

The Stylus Color II finished dead last in almost every category,
garnering some strikingly poor grades for performance (D+),
overall quality (D+) and overall value (D)

Despite repeated calls to technical-support lines from testers
and to Epson's public relations department from HomePC editors,
the testers could get no closer to printing in red than a sharp
magenta. Images were often blurry, and black print generally
appeared to be washed out. About the best Bill Anthony could
say was that "the text quality was readable--not crisp or clear,
but at least it printed."

While other ink jet printers our testers examined were slower,
the Epson model still wasn't fast enough to outrun complaints
about its print quality. "I would change everything about the
Epson, make it faster and even cheaper," said Thomas DeRosa.
"For the time it took to print, the printout should have been
of 'Kodak moment' quality."

In a field of otherwise solid PC color ink jets, our testers
felt you could certainly do better.

(color), 5 ppm (B&W), 0.3 ppm (color)

GOOD NEWS:

* Easy to install

* Quiet as a mouse

BAD NEWS:

* Unexceptional print quality

The race between the Macintosh ink jet printers looked a lot
like the showdown between the two Mac laser printers: In both
cases, the Apple model just edged out its rival from Hewlett
Packard.

A quick glance shows a B+ overall grade for the Apple Color
StyleWriter 2400 as opposed to a B for the HP DeskJet 850C,
but as sportscasters say, the game was closer than the final
score indicates.

Testers gave the Color StyleWriter 2400 A's for both ease of
installation and documentation. They also favored the Apple
unit's compact design to the DeskJet's layout, and preferred
the Apple printer's noise control and performance. Finally,
the scales tipped in favor of the Color StyleWriter 2400 on
the question of overall value: It's about $200 less at retail
than the DeskJet 850.

But if you value printout quality more than price, bear in mind
that our testers much preferred the HP unit's output. "The
StyleWriter worked well, but the quality of its printouts isn't
as good as the Hewlett-Packard's," declared Adrienne Klein.

For our testers, the lower price tag, sleek design and ease
of use seemed good enough reasons to recommend the Color StyleWriter,
but they wouldn't ignore the DeskJet 850C, either.

GOOD NEWS:

* High-quality output

* Vibrant colors

BAD NEWS:

Even though our testers thought the Apple Color StyleWriter
2400 was the better overall value, they were nearly bowled
over by the printouts the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 850C produced.

The unit racked up impressive B+ grades in all categories concerned
with output quality. "This is what I want in a color printer,"
said Adrienne Klein--"good, professional quality."

Our panel repeatedly used terms like "vibrant" to describe the
color images, and complimented HP's ColorSmart technology,
which adjusts tones among colors to make a page look its best.

Our testers might even have recommended the DeskJet 850C over
the Apple ink jet if not for a design they suspected could
have been a little sturdier, a sometimes bumpy installation
process and documentation that was occasionally a chore to
wade through. "I thought the manual was poorly written," said
Theresa Tocci. "It didn't clarify the driver installation for
me." While the DeskJet 850C's scores in all three areas weren't
bad, they just weren't as good as the Apple model's.

Another drawback was the DeskJet 850C's estimated retail price,
about $200 higher than that of the Color StyleWriter 2400.
But as the saying goes, you get what you pay for--and in this
case, you'll get demonstrably high-quality color printouts.

Nuts + Bolts--Step-By-Step Tips: Filling in Windows 95's installation gaps

By:
Sean Fulton

If you've decided to upgrade to Windows 95, odds are you were
lured by its promise to make your PC perform as well as it
possibly can. But simply installing the new operating system
doesn't ensure maximum returns; to set up your PC to run at
full speed and peak efficiency, you'll need to tinker with
some of Windows 95's default settings.

During installation, Windows 95 makes a series of educated guesses
about your hardware setup. The process is designed to ensure
smooth installation on just about any PC, which means it errs
on the side of caution--often at the expense of system performance.
The 30-minute tune-up described here will adjust your settings
to the ones best suited for your computer.

Another result of Windows 95's cautious approach is that it
seldom replaces your DOS CD-ROM and sound-card drivers during
installation. Picking the correct drivers is tricky; the installation
program sticks with the tried-and-true DOS drivers--which are
not the most efficient--rather than risk installing the wrong
ones for your particular peripherals, which might disable them.
So, in addition to taking the steps outlined here, you should
contact the manufacturers of your PC, CD-ROM drive and sound
card to get faster, 32-bit Windows 95 drivers and upgrade instructions.

Before you begin, be sure...

*Windows 95 is installed on your computer.

*You have documentation handy for your PC, as well as for DOS
and Windows 95; it'll help you determine which drivers are
now installed.

STEP 1: Click on Windows 95's Start button, highlight Settings,
then click on Control Panel. Double-click on the System icon;
this opens a window that contains basic information about your
PC's setup. Click on the Performance tab.

STEP 2: The Performance panel displays information about your
computer's resources, including its memory (note the number;
you'll need it in step 4). Click on the File System button;
this lets you set up the operating system for fast file access.

STEP 3: If you're using a desktop PC, make sure the "Typical
role of this machine" area is set to "Desktop computer." If
you've got a notebook PC, click on the down arrow and choose
"Mobile or docking system." Make sure the slider switch labeled
"Read-ahead optimization" is on Full; this will boost your
computer's performance by setting it to anticipate what data
from your hard drive it will read next. When these settings
are correct, click on the tab marked CD-ROM at the top of the
window.

STEP 4: "Supplemental cache size" specifies how much of your
PC's memory is set aside as a CD-ROM cache. If you've got less
than 8 megabytes of RAM, Microsoft recommends a 64-kilobyte
cache; move the cache slider to the far left, and indicate
"No read-ahead" in the "Optimize access pattern for" area.

If you have 8 to 12 MB of RAM, move the slider to the fifth
indicator point to get a 626-KB cache, and indicate "Double
speed drives." (It's possible to create a larger cache, but
it won't increase your speed.)

If you have more than 12 MB of RAM, indicate your actual CD
ROM drive type, and move the slider to the far right. Click
on OK to return to the System Properties window.

STEP 5: Click on the Graphics button at the bottom of the System
Properties window. A new window appears, which lets you specify
your PC's video-card settings. Drag the "Hardware acceleration"
slider to Full, which tells your computer to run video as fast
as your video card allows. Click on the OK button in this window,
then on the Close button in the main System Properties window.
If you changed any settings, you'll be asked if you want to
restart the PC. Click on Yes.

STEP 6: Open the Control Panel again, as in step 1. This time,
double-click on the Printers icon. Click once on your printer,
then click on File and select Properties from the pull-down
menu. Click once on the tab marked Details, then on the Spool
Settings button.

STEP 7: If it isn't active already, turn on the option labeled
"Spool print jobs..."; this means you can get back to work
quickly when you print, rather than tie up your system until
the entire document prints out. Unless you're short of hard
drive space, choose the option labeled "Start printing after
last page is spooled," which gets you back to your other programs
faster after a print command. If you choose "Start printing
after first page is spooled," as shown here, you'll use less
drive space, but you'll sacrifice some system speed. Save your
settings by clicking on OK.

STEP 8: Go back to the Windows 95 Start menu, select Programs,
then Accessories, and choose the WordPad text-editing program
from the bottom of the list. Select Open from the pull-down
File menu and look at the config.sys file's contents, which
includes your DOS device drivers. Locate the drivers with functions
that are duplicated in Windows 95, such as the power management
driver power.exe shown above. (If you're not sure what's what,
check your PC, DOS or Windows 95 documentation, or call Microsoft
at 206-635-7000.)

STEP 9: Instruct Windows 95 to ignore references to unnecessary
DOS drivers by typing REM at the beginning of the lines for
those drivers; this tells the operating system to treat the
line as a "remark," not an instruction--in other words, to
ignore it. If you have new, 32-bit CD-ROM drivers from your
PC or CD-ROM drive manufacturer, you can do the same with the
lines for DOS CD-ROM drivers, such as aspi2dos.sys and aspicd.sys,
which are shown in the screen for step 8. When you've finished
editing this file, choose Save from the pull-down File menu.

STEP 10: Now, open your PC's autoexec.bat file using WordPad.
Once again, you'll be looking for DOS drivers you can remove
because they've been replaced by 32-bit Windows 95 drivers.
You'll also want to remove the DOS smartdrv.exe utility; Windows
95 doesn't need it. Once you're done, choose Save from the
pull-down File menu, then close the WordPad program by selecting
Exit from the same menu.

STEP 11: Click on the Start button and choose Shut Down from
the menu. When the Shut Down window appears, select the "Restart
the computer" option, then click on Yes. When it restarts,
your Windows 95 PC will be cruising at optimum speed.

Financial Adviser--Taking Care Of Household Business: 
On-line sources pay dividends for investment clubs

By:
Wayne Harris

Before Douglas Gerlach saw a newspaper clipping about investment
clubs in spring 1993, he had paid no mind to the stock market.
As associate director of institutional giving at New York City's
Lincoln Center, Gerlach's job is to raise money, not invest
it--he had never owned a share of stock in his life. Yet the
clipping intrigued him; the idea of getting together on a regular
basis with other people to learn about investing and build
a strong financial portfolio sounded like one worth exploring.

Gerlach mailed away a request for more information to the National
Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC), a not-for-profit organization
for investment clubs mentioned in the article. While waiting
for the packet to arrive, Gerlach decided to bone up a little
on his own.

"I had been subscribing to CompuServe for years, mainly for
entertainment," Gerlach says. "But I figured there must be
some investing information there." Sure enough, he found NAIC
on-line, with much of the information he had just mailed away
for available to download to his PC on the spot. He received
stock-selection tutorials, demonstration versions of stock
screening software (which helps pinpoint stocks to buy based
on the criteria most important to you, such as a company's
annual dividends or earnings data), and sample partnership
agreements for investment club members. He began posting questions
on the forum's message board, and investment club veterans
quickly chimed in with advice.

Armed with the information he'd gathered on-line, Gerlach and
14 friends formed the Blue Chip Posse investment club, with
Gerlach as president. At monthly meetings, members contribute
between $20 and $100 to be invested in new stocks as a group;
they also reinvest the dividends they earn from some companies
in more stock, or apply those dividends to cash reserves for
future investment. Starting from scratch, the Posse has nurtured
a portfolio worth $15,000 in 18 months.

There are nearly 17,000 investment clubs in the United States
today, giving people who couldn't ordinarily afford to play
the stock market alone a chance to get involved; by pooling
cash, club members can more easily meet the costs of trades
and commissions. The clubs also provide an excellent way for
curious newcomers to learn the ropes.

Commercial on-line services and the Internet are proving to
be invaluable assets for investment clubs, delivering everything
from tips on forming a club to resources for buying stocks
at rock-bottom commissions. You don't even have to be in an
investment club to make use of much of this information--if
you'd rather invest on your own, you'll still be able to use
many of these on-line services for, say, screening stocks or
researching companies.

Investment clubs accumulate wealth through long-term investing.
The average club begins to outperform the market only after
about eight years; every dollar a club invests generally doubles
in about seven years--if it survives that long. Some 40 percent
of new clubs dissolve within two years, and that's a losing
proposition for their members. "The liquidation value of most
clubs is often less than the capital contributions of its members
during the first year or two," Gerlach warns.

PICKING THE RIGHT PARTNERS

Because of the high dropout rate and the risks involved, make
sure the people you link up with for your investment club share
a long-term perspective on investing, and that you feel you
can trust them to do the investment research necessary to make
the club a success.

One way to find prospective members for a new club is to post
a note in CompuServe's NAIC forum (Go NAIC), or in the investment
club folder in America Online's Motley Fool area (Keyword:
Motley). Motley Fool has the best-maintained investment message
boards you'll find in cyberspace. When you post your call for
partners, specify that you're looking for people (usually in
your geographic region) who are committed to long-term investments,
and don't shy away from probing respondents for information
about themselves. People who have a track record of maintaining
commitments to organizations will likely make better members
than lone wolves who claim to know a lot about investing.

Not every investment club holds face-to-face meetings. For instance,
Gerlach--who has become an enthusiastic investor--is also president
of the Pioneer Online Investment Club (POLIC). Members hail
from all over the United States and as far away as Japan. The
club conducts its business electronically, using its own message
boards in the NAIC forum on CompuServe.

To join POLIC, simply participate in the club's discussions
about its portfolio and its hunt for stocks for a couple of
months, then request membership. If you're on America Online
or Prodigy, you can set up your own POLIC-style club using
your service's investment message boards.

Along with its CompuServe site, NAIC maintains a site on the
Internet's World Wide Web (http:// www.better-investing.org)
where visitors can also see investment club advice, sample
club bylaws and model partnership agreements. If you're interested
in launching a club, you can download the documents and amend
them to suit your group's needs.

Be sure that all club members sign copies of a partnership agreement
before any money changes hands. Such agreements are legally
binding structures that allow tax liability on the club portfolio's
dividends and capital gains to be passed along to its members.

Once your club--whether it's an on-line venture or a more traditional
face-to-face association--is up and running, you'll have to
agree on an investment style; the two broadest styles are "growth"
and "value." Growth investors tend to favor companies with
a history of increased earnings year after year; investors
will pay a premium for this seemingly predictable ability to
increase earnings. Value stocks tend to trade for less money
than growth stocks because their earnings are unpredictable;
their fortunes are usually more closely tied to the general
business cycle. A recession, for example, probably won't affect
whether or not people buy breakfast cereal, but it's certainly
likely to dim the fortunes of companies in the auto industry.

To get information on various investment styles as well as background
on the top stocks within those styles, clubs may subscribe
to stock-monitoring services such as Value Line or Standard
& Poor's, consult with a retail broker who subscribes to Value
Line (and pay retail commissions), or leg it down to the public
library to do research.

Investment club members who maintain accounts on America Online,
CompuServe and Prodigy have another option: access to useful,
low-cost electronic resources. For instance, Prodigy's $9.95
monthly fee gives investment club members the opportunity to
use Stock Hunter (Jump: Stock Hunter), which has an excellent
library of articles on eight popular investment styles. Included
are explanations of Dodd/Graham, the granddaddy of value investing
styles, which was developed by two finance professors in the
1930s, and One Up on Wall Street, a growth-oriented style developed
by the legendary Fidelity Magellan fund manager, Peter Lynch.
Download these explanations and your club will be off to a
great start at defining its niche. Stock Hunter also lets you
screen for top stocks in each category and download the listings
for a $1.95 surcharge.

An even deeper array of investment resources--without surcharges
-is available on America Online. Both the Fool's School in
the Motley Fool area, and Investing Basics in the American
Association of Individual Investors area (Keyword: AAII) are
full of articles that will help club members find their bearings.
Consider AAII's common-sense article, "Avoiding Common Investment
Mistakes," required reading. AAII also lets you screen stocks
based on four investing styles, such as companies with low
stock prices relative to earnings. (For more information on
stock screening, see Financial Adviser, February 1995.)

GETTING THE SCOOP

While stock screening can give you an up-to-the-minute snapshot
of a company's earnings history, it won't tell you all you
need to know about its prospects. Are there reasons to think
the company may stumble--or take off--in the future? Does it
face any potentially crippling litigation? Are there any natural
barriers to newer, hungrier competitors entering its market?

All publicly traded companies discuss questions like these in
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Many of these reports, called 10Qs and 10Ks, are available
for review in the EDGAR archives on the Internet(http://www.sec.gov
edgarhp. htm). About 4,000 companies file electronically today,
but by the end of 1996, all publicly traded companies will
be required to do so. Club members can find these reports on
the Internet or in Disclosure's Edgar Plus section on America
Online (Keyword: Disclosure)

Once AOL members have begun to form a judgment about a company's
prospects, they can click over to First Call (Keyword: First
Call) to see what the pros think. First Call maintains a database
of Wall Street analysts' projections of various company earnings
for the coming years. Meanwhile, Motley Fool's stock message
boards track which companies are generating better- or worse
than-expected quarterly earnings--a big factor in short-term
price swings.

SPEND LESS, MAKE MORE?

Clubs typically invest relatively small sums--$500 to $1,000
-monthly, but full-service brokers and even many well-known
discount brokers charge a minimum $40 commission on each trade;
shop around, or else your new club could wind up paying as
much as 10 percent of its monthly investment in commissions.

Until recently, almost all deep-discount brokers on-line imposed
fairly hefty minimum-balance requirements. But the PC Financial
Network on both Prodigy (Jump: PCFN) and America Online (Keyword
 PCFN) have recently introduced a special deal for investment
clubs. PCFN offers a 40 percent discount in addition to the
normal discount rate, bringing the minimum trade down to a
very competitive $24. There is no minimum-balance requirement.

It's even possible to buy selected stocks with no commissions
and reinvest the cash dividends in still more stock at no charge.
The NAIC forum on CompuServe offers a direct-purchase and dividend
reinvestment option on 138 stocks for $5. The AAII on AOL also
maintains a list of companies that allow direct purchase.

America Online, CompuServe and Prodigy all let you monitor stocks,
track quotes and view cumulative values on a 15-minute delayed
basis; this means that during market hours, the prices you
see reflect the prices your stocks traded at 15 minutes ago,
which isn't a significant time lapse for long-term investors.
But that's about as far as the commercial on-line services
go in terms of portfolio management.

On the Internet, Howe Barnes' Net Investor (http://pawws.com
 How_phtml/top.shtml) will set up specific investment club
accounts that allow members to receive company research and
breaking news, as well as view portfolio values on a 15-minute
delayed basis. Howe Barnes also provides more sophisticated
portfolio accounting than the commercial services offer. For
example, if your club receives a stock dividend and then reinvests
it, you must raise the "cost basis" in the stock or you'll
pay more taxes than you should when you eventually sell it
off. The company will track such items for you, and will even
consolidate the accounting for clubs with more than one portfolio.
Howe Barnes requires a $10,000 minimum deposit to use the service,
and its minimum commission is $35.

NAIC also offers two attractive investment club accounting packages
 Dragonware Investment Club Accountant ($169, or $209 for nonmembers
of NAIC) and NAIC Club Accountant ($159, or $199 for nonmembers),
both for DOS, Windows or Macintosh. These programs supplement
more generic portfolio-accounting services and software programs
by helping you with accounting tasks specific to clubs, such
as tracking the pro rata tax liabilities from capital gains
and losses for members who contribute different amounts monthly.

With so many on-line resources at their disposal, members of
investment clubs--and even individuals--can now get a leg up
on Wall Street, reducing the risk of going broke before you
can get to the broker.

Working At Home--Tools For Getting The Job Done: Perfect pitch: 
How PCs make biz presentations sing

By:
Lynn Ginsburg

Picture this: You're about to address the representatives of
a large corporation who will decide whether they can trust
your home business with their company's travel services contract.
A huge boost to your income rides on your ability to make your
case, not to mention all the good that landing a "name" account
will do for your business's prestige. It's a situation that
would unnerve anyone, but you're cool as can be, because you've
got a secret weapon--a killer computer-based business presentation.
This dealmaker organizes your data, insights and arguments
into a cohesive, entertaining whole, complete with colorful
graphics--and even lively multimedia effects--to deliver your
message loud and clear.

How did you manage to put together such a snazzy production
on a budget? The twist in this plot is that it's the handiwork
of some inexpensive software and a home computer, which make
it possible to express your most creative ideas in a razzle
dazzle display.

Presentation software is tailor-made for people who don't have
the luxury of hiring a graphics designer to create business
presentations. These programs have added many features in recent
years, and they now let you do everything from easily altering
the order in which your data is presented to sending your finished
work to potential clients by e-mail.

Below, we take a look at six of the most popular presentation
programs, which range in price from $99 to about $350. In this
group, you'll find products that are suitable for first-time
users and old hands alike. At one end of the spectrum is ASAP
for Windows, which is very easy to use, but not very flexible.
At the other end is Astound for Windows and the Macintosh-
it lets you add high-quality multimedia effects to your presentation,
but it's more complicated to use.

Other programs--Freelance Graphics 96 for Windows 95, Harvard
Graphics for Windows 95, Novell Presentations for Windows,
and PowerPoint for both Windows 95 and the Mac--fall between
the two extremes. (At press time, Novell was actively looking
for a buyer to take over and support Presentations, among other
products.) These well-known standards offer an array of options
-some of which may confuse the uninitiated--as well as basic
multimedia support for computer-projected screen shows.

We did not look at one popular program, Adobe Persuasion, because
it's due for a major update in early 1996; nor did we review
the very advanced multimedia authoring tools, such as Director
and Authorware, which can be used to create presentations,
but are fairly difficult to master and beyond the needs of
most home business owners.

In trying to decide which presentation package is right for
you, consider the kind of information you must communicate
in your work, as well as the number of PC demos, slide shows
or flip charts you put together each year. For instance, if
you typically make only a couple of presentations a year, you
may be better off with a presentation program that's a cinch
to learn and use than one that's more powerful and takes longer
to master each time.

ASAP: THE OPENING ACTS

If your primary goal is creating a suitable presentation quickly,
and you don't want to customize the design--rearranging elements
on the screen, selecting your own fonts and so on--ASAP is
made to order. Using ASAP, in just 30 minutes I created a presentation
that summed up a client's proposed move to a new site. The
end result was attractive, well organized and professional
looking--the colors were coordinated, the various fonts worked
together, and the spacing and proportions for each slide (which,
when strung together in a screen show or printed for use as
a handout or flip chart, form your presentation) were well
balanced.

ASAP's limited menu choices mean limited confusion. Rather than
trying to choose from numerous options, you simply select from
four main steps for assembling your presentation: writing the
outline, then choosing a slide layout, background and color
scheme.

Using a blank outline, you can create the text for each slide.
To help you figure out what to say, the program offers a few
limited samples of prewritten presentations, including an outline
for a company overview, which you can edit to suit your needs.
ASAP next lets you choose from thumbnail sketches of slide
layout options, such as bulleted lists, two-column spreads
and pyramid charts. What you see is literally what you get
-there's no tinkering with layouts in ASAP.

The choices for your slides' backgrounds, comparable to the
canvas of your presentation, are also presented as thumbnail
picklists--for example, you'll see templates that include a
world map background, which could be a nice backdrop for an
international business pitch, and a muted "Wall Street" template,
a sound choice to impress a conservative client.

If you don't need to sweat intricate design details or special
effects, and you have no desire to negotiate customization
options to jazz things up, you'll like ASAP. Use it to create
workmanlike, effective presentations in a jiffy.

FOUR SEASONED PERFORMERS

Freelance Graphics, Harvard Graphics, PowerPoint and Presentations
all provide a much wider range of options and flexibility than
ASAP, but for the most part each does an excellent job of guiding
you through the main steps at hand. The programs jump in at
the opening screen with wizards, coaches and other helpers
that stay with you as you build your presentation. Unlike ASAP,
however, once these helpers have taken you through the basics,
you can further customize your work, altering the design as
you choose and fiddling with the way data is presented.

Presentations uses easy-to-follow graphics to explain at the
start that each slide in your project will include three layers
 the background, the layout and the slide. You can designate
colors, shapes or clip art as part of the background for every
slide. The layout determines how your titles, subtitles, text
and so on are arranged on a page. Finally, the master slide
contains both layers, and is the overall template that ensures
a consistent design for each slide in your show; you can choose
a master slide design by sorting through an extensive gallery
of thumbnail images.

Like Presentations, the other programs contain many easy- to
use design options, including lots of backgrounds, layout templates
and clip art.

After the basics are in place, all of these programs offer a
slew of customization options. For example, you may want to
make some of your text stand out; in PowerPoint, you could
use the Text Anchor command, which lets you see how your text
looks when placed inside a graphical object--say, inside a
rectangle. Or, in Harvard Graphics, you could size up the options
for a table of data--anything from changing the look of your
column headings to determining exactly how you'd like your
grid lines to appear.

Harvard Graphics and PowerPoint also offer some specialized
design assistance featuring common-sense advice. For example,
Harvard Graphics' CheckDesign measures your slides against
certain design guidelines, pointing out, for instance, that
you've chosen a text size that clashes with your template,
or that you put too many elements on one side of a slide. In
PowerPoint, the AutoClipArt feature compares your text to keywords
in its clip-art database, then presents a list of appropriate
images to use in your slides.

While all these features contribute to a great-looking presentation,
it won't matter much unless you have something compelling to
say. Presentations' Show Expert feature does an especially
good job helping you organize your thoughts logically, and
build to a summary conclusion. I used Show Expert to construct
a presentation for a client that would demonstrate how my marketing
efforts had improved his business, and thus secure more marketing
funds for the future.

With that goal in mind, I contemplated the Show Expert's outline
choices: Did I want to persuade, inform or teach? Definitely
persuade. I was then asked to assess my audience: doubting,
positive, negative or neutral? My client has an open mind,
so I chose neutral. With that click, the program created an
entire outline for me, with slide-by-slide suggestions of how
to build my argument, such as describing the marketing challenges,
the benefits of my solutions and how much revenue my work had
brought in for the client. When the Show Expert was done, I
simply swapped in the facts for my situation and added my own
design elements. Freelance Graphics, Harvard Graphics and PowerPoint
offer comparable outline assistance.

All four of these programs include multimedia options. For example,
they all support basic transition effects--much like the slow
fades, dissolves or wipes you see on TV--that can be used between
any two slides in a computer presentation. You can also add
pre-existing audio, video and animation objects (such as a
line climbing a chart to indicate rising sales) to your presentations.
PowerPoint even lets you build simple animations on your own.

Frankly, it's hard to choose a best-of-breed among these four
for a PC user, although the Windows 95 releases of Freelance
Graphics, PowerPoint and Harvard Graphics are a notch above
Presentations for Windows 3.1 in their automation and multimedia
options. However, a Windows 95 version of Presentations due
to be released soon is expected to even the score on both counts,
while building on the solid ground rules that the current version
uses to get your presentation off the ground. If you already
own an office suite that some of these programs are a part
of--such as Lotus SmartSuite, Microsoft Office or Perfect Office
-you may not need to look any further. At the same time, Harvard
Graphics fans won't be disappointed in this latest version
of the software, either.

ASTOUND: A MULTIMEDIA STAR

If you want to move beyond multimedia basics to introduce some
showmanship, Astound is just the ticket; it strikes a solid
compromise between ease of use and control over program options.

Astound starts with a good selection of predesigned presentations
for a variety of situations, covering topics such as company
profiles and new product introductions.

If you're presenting complicated information in a play to gain
new business or launch a product, you may appreciate Astound's
ability to turn a presentation into an interactive event, allowing
the viewer to click through the data at his or her own pace.
Letting your client take a sort of self-guided tour can increase
the odds that he or she will retain more of the material you
present. You're also more likely to hold that viewer's attention
if you let the person select lively elements that Astound provides,
such as sound, video or animation, as part of your "show."

All of Astound's templates include predesigned animation and
other multimedia elements, which are more sophisticated than
any of the other presentation programs discussed above. Astound's
templates are constructed around multimedia elements; animations,
music and videos are part of the standard design in much the
same way the other programs rely on type styles and clip art
as integral parts of their templates.

With Astound, you can preview an excellent assortment of transition
effects. While high-quality animations are also highlights
in Astound's gallery of predesigned multimedia clips, you can
create your own animated segments, too, making objects move
across a path with detailed, but easily defined, controls.

When you have a combination of animation, transitions and other
multimedia effects in a slide, you can use the program's Timeline
to set one effect to finish before another begins, and control
the order in which the effects appear.

An impressive presentation can go a long way toward vaulting
you ahead of the pack for that all-important business deal.
With your ideas arranged into an informative, convincing and
attractive presentation, odds are you'll be called back for
an encore.

On-line Connections--Exploring The Information Highway: Gray matters: 
the smartest cybersites for seniors

By:
Jeremy Schlosberg

Shortly before Christmas 1994, Barbara Campbell's husband asked
her whether she'd prefer a tennis bracelet or a personal computer
as a holiday gift.

"I'd never had the slightest desire for a computer," Barbara
says. But something prompted her to go for the unknown, and
she chose the PC. After a few classes at a community college
near her Vero Beach, Fla., home, she began exploring America
Online. Before she knew it, she recalls, "I was hooked."

One year later, Barbara, 68, is a regular in a bridge-discussion
group, fires off e-mail to friends and relatives constantly,
and sets up private chat-room sessions with far-flung family
members. "Getting involved with computers is the most exciting
thing I've done in ages," Barbara says.

In fact, she spends so much time on-line that her husband occasionally
regrets having been such an accommodating Santa last year.
"Some days he wishes he had given me the bracelet," Barbara
admits, "but I'm glad he didn't."

Barbara's part of an enthusiastic community of seniors using
computers. According to Odyssey, a San Francisco-based research
firm, one in 10 Americans over age 60 owns a PC; more than
half of those computers are equipped with modems, and about
a quarter of seniors with a PC use an on-line service.

It's no wonder--there's a rich array of experiences on-line
targeted toward older people, be it information on volunteer
opportunities, the latest on the Medicare debate or simply
an opportunity to communicate with others. For instance, Ben
Titow, a 70-year-old widower in Tempe, Ariz., enjoys the chat
rooms. "I'm looking for interesting conversation and friendship,"
he says. "If more comes from it, fine." He doesn't hide his
age when he socializes on-line, but he doesn't make a point
of it, either--Ben's AOL member profile coyly states that he's
of the same vintage as Paul Newman.

"Seniors go on-line for exactly the same reason anyone else
does," says Jim Hursey, 65, a retired production systems manager
in Columbus, Ohio. "It's an interesting hobby, a chance to
meet like-minded people and a convenient source of information."

Of course, seniors have varied interests, which makes all of
cyberspace fair game, but the commercial on-line services-
and America Online in particular--offer lots of senior-specific
activity. The Internet, too, features a growing number of sites
for older people, including one Jim helped found, CyberSenior
Review. (To find some of the top on-line offerings serving
the senior community, see the box below.)

Some of the most comprehensive on-line areas for older people
come from San Francisco-based SeniorNet, a nonprofit group
serving people age 55 and older who are interested in using
computers to "increase their personal knowledge, enhance their
talents and share their wisdom." The organization has 20 Learning
Centers, located on university campuses around the nation,
offering introductory and advanced computer classes to seniors
for free or a nominal charge.

The group's on-line presence includes SeniorNet forums on AOL,
The Microsoft Network and the World Wide Web. "The idea from
the beginning," says SeniorNet founder and president Mary Furlong,
"was to create an electronic community for older people, and
provide them with access to resources and a place to share
their knowledge and ideas."

SeniorNet's Web site (http:// www.seniornet.com/) emphasizes
information and links to other resources; on the commercial
services, its forums stress the companionship many seniors
seek on-line. The AOL version (Keyword: Senior) gets the most
traffic of the SeniorNet areas, so we'll focus on it in the
descriptions below. The Microsoft Network forum, like the fledgling
on-line service, is less than six months old (look for the
SeniorNet listing in the People to People section)

The SeniorNet message boards on AOL cover a broad range of topics.
Arts & Leisure is the most popular destination; discussion
threads focus on some of seniors' favorite activities, including
music, film, literature, hobbies, politics, education and philosophy.

You'll also find plenty of postings (more than 5,000 as of a
recent visit) in SeniorNet's Generation to Generation message
board on AOL, which encourages communication between the young
and old in cyberspace. For instance, the Grandparents & Storytelling
folder recently featured discussion of a clever idea: seniors
using tape recorders to share stories--true tales, original
fiction, readings of cherished classics--with the younger set.

Other hot spots include the Community Center live chat area,
and Showcase & Exchange, a shared library of files created
by SeniorNet members, including everything from holiday recipes
and tips for holding a garage sale to lists of congressional
e-mail addresses and any number of other pet projects.

Given SeniorNet's focus on technology, it's only logical that
SeniorNet Online provides terrific information for "newbies"
 The Getting Into Computers message board is always busy, and
the Computer Tools library in the Showcase & Exchange area
is brimming with sounds, clip art and utilities for visitors
to download.

But if many older surfers make SeniorNet Online their first
stop for basic computer tips, most keep coming back even after
they've acquired some expertise.

"People go on-line for information, but they stay on-line for
the relationships they form," says SeniorNet's Furlong, who
is the co-author, with Steve Lipson, of Young@Heart: Computing
for Seniors (Osborne/McGraw-Hill)

Furlong knows of six couples who got married after meeting on
SeniorNet. The virtual community on SeniorNet has come together
in other ways as well. For instance, Furlong recalls that all
Los Angeles-area SeniorNet members were accounted for within
24 hours of 1994's major earthquake. And one local woman, moved
by the dangerous rescue work undertaken by visiting Marines
after the quake, got the names and home phone numbers of the
military personnel working in the area, used SeniorNet Online
to contact members who lived near the Marines' relatives, and
asked them to call the Marines' families and reassure them
about their loved ones' safety.

The American Association of Retired Persons sponsors areas on
AOL (Keyword: AARP) and Prodigy (Jump: AARP). AARP Online,
as it's known on both services, contains a tremendous amount
of information on issues crucial for the senior community.
The content on the two AARP offerings is similar, but the AOL
forum is easier to navigate.

Both AARP areas include libraries with information about the
organization, as well as articles and AARP position papers
on topics such as senior-related legislation, the emotional
side of aging and the logistics of living on a fixed income.
The information is thoroughly researched, well written and
comprehensive. If you need answers to any question pertaining
to life as an older person in the United States, you'll probably
find them in AARP Online.

Perhaps because the AARP is so well known--and its activism
regarding government programs such as Social Security and Medicare
has stirred some controversy in recent years--AARP Online's
message boards tend to attract a larger number of younger participants
than SeniorNet does. As a result, more heated debates ensue,
particularly in the Entitlements folders. But there's still
plenty of camaraderie here, especially in the folders labeled
Join In/Introduce Yourself and In Search Of; in the latter,
seniors can try to locate former classmates, army buddies,
and other friends with whom they've lost touch over the years.

Like other successful cybervenues, the most popular on-line
forums for older people reflect a genuine sense of community.
Many seniors--especially those putting down roots in retirement
homes or communities--seem to treasure the new link they gain
through cyberspace to family, friends, and people located all
around the world whom they're meeting for the first time. The
Baltimore-based Senior Campus Living network provides one particularly
innovative example. The project, which currently includes three
Maryland retirement complexes (with more planned for other
U.S. cities in the next few years), offers residents computer
training and access to the Internet from a central facility.

Margaret Williams, 77, lives in the Charlestown Retirement Community
in Cantonville, Md., one of the first centers in the Senior
Campus network. She was extremely wary when she signed up for
her first computer training session, nervously telling her
instructor, "I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into here."
But by the end of her session, she marched over and gave him
a "high-five." "I can't wait to tell my son that I surfed the
Net!" she announced triumphantly.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Try a juicy murder case 
(but weigh the depth penalty)

By:
Julie Cohen

In the 1st Degree

Interactive courtroom drama

3 stars

Give Broderbund Software points for impeccable timing: In The
1st Degree, the compelling murder-trial saga that's the company's
first interactive release since it unleashed Myst, hit store
shelves just as O.J. climbed back into his Bronco and rode
off into the Brentwood sunset. For viewers suffering withdrawal
from their daily courtroom fix, the game offers a fine substitute
-even if, these days, it's hard for fictional trials to compete
for drama with real life.

In this torrid tale, prominent art agent Zachary Barnes has
been shot dead; his business partner, artist James Tobin, has
been charged with the murder. You play as the San Francisco
prosecutor assigned to the case; you've got just a handful
of witnesses, and their stories don't all match. Ruby Garcia,
Tobin's live-in girlfriend, recently had a brief affair with
Barnes; Tobin could have killed Barnes because he was jealous.
But then there's the recent theft at the Tobin Gallery to consider;
both Tobin and Barnes stood to reap a substantial insurance
payoff. Could that figure in the case? Barnes' wife alleges
that Tobin masterminded the robbery, with his personal assistant,
Simon Lee, doing the dirty work.

It's your job to sift through everything Garcia, Lee and Mrs.
Barnes say, then present a case to the jury. But after the
courtroom battles of 1995, it doesn't take a legal eagle to
know that jury decisions are unpredictable, so you must plan
your courtroom strategy carefully. Do you argue a motive of
sexual jealousy, art theft cover-up or both? Tobin's defense
attorney is sharp; she'll jump on every weak statement or piece
of misplaced evidence. You have to play your witnesses just
right, ensuring they reveal only the information you need,
and do it as artfully as possible.

Our verdict? A thumbs-up--with extenuating circumstances. The
game's innovative use of video makes for splendid graphics,
but there's not enough gameplay to keep you glued to your screen.
It takes just a couple of hours to interview all the witnesses
and bring the case to trial the first time. If you play again
(if, say, the jury votes to acquit, or Tobin's attorney gets
all charges dropped), you can call the witnesses in a different
order, or take a slightly different tack when you question
them. But while you may uncover new evidence, by and large
you'll be working with the same basic material each time you
play.

Nevertheless, even inexperienced gamers will be able to uncover
-and enjoy--In the 1st Degree's secrets. The story is timely
and challenging, and it may give you a new appreciation of
our legal system--or at least something to do when you're not
watching Court TV.

$50 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Broderbund Software,
(800) 521-6263, (415) 382-4600.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Rubrics' cube

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Endorfun

Puzzle

3 stars

Expect the best. Endorfun is at once enchanting, uplifting,
frustrating and addictive. With its barrage of positive "subliminal"
messages, this New Age puzzle game will raise your spirits
as you maneuver its colored cube across an ever-changing board.

I am at peace. Or at least you start out that way; learning
the basics takes only a few minutes. Simply move your cursor
with the keyboard or mouse to roll a colored cube on a grid
so that it lands face up on a square of the same color. Each
time you make a match, a colored square elsewhere on the grid
lights up, and you must repeat the task.

I can do anything. But it's not as easy as it sounds. You can
learn how to roll the cube in a particular pattern to change
its color to suit your needs, but other colored squares pop
up to block your path, so you have to work fast and master
a variety of cube movements.

Abundance is my true state of being. With 42 games containing
at least seven levels each, Endorfun offers an almost unending
array of challenges within three types of gameplay: In Longevity,
you must keep your cube moving as long as possible without
getting trapped by colored squares on the grid; in Quickening,
a timed game, you must complete levels as quickly as possible;
in Abundance, you get points for every level you complete.
The puzzles and levels get progressively harder as you play.

I am the master of my life. Still, you have no control over
the reward for winning each game: another message of happiness
and love. Some people no doubt will consider these words about
as inspiring as a Stuart Smalley affirmation on Saturday Night
Live. But the least Endorfun can do is offer positive feedback
after coaxing you to spend so many hours under its spell.

$29.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Time Warner
Interactive, (800)482-3766, (818) 295-6500.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: The shape of things to come 
(wave after wave after wave)

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Zoop

Puzzle

2 1/2 stars

Zoop, an addictive puzzle that challenges you to think strategically
and act fast, offers five freaked-out forms ready to fire:
blue boomerangs, green "peanut M&Ms," purple beakers, blue
triangles and red chicken legs.

The playing field is shaped like a plus sign; each branch contains
four columns or rows that slowly fill up with a random assortment
of shapes. A square sits in the center, containing one shape
you use to shoot at the advancing columns or rows. Hit a shape
that matches the one you're firing with, and you eliminate
it from the grid, along with any matching forms that are directly
behind it. Hit a different shape, and your shooter changes
to match the one you just hit. The trick is to eliminate the
longest columns or rows first; if the shapes reach the center
square, the game ends with a bang.

Take one look at Zoop's dynamic design and it'll come as no
surprise to learn that the game was developed by Viacom New
Media, a division of the company that owns MTV. But just like
many music videos, the fun wears thin a little too soon. The
most significant difference between levels is their background;
even with occasional bonus forms appearing, each of the 99
rounds feels remarkably similar to all the ones before it.

Yet Zoop has one advantage that makes it stand out from the
crowd: It uses less than 3 megabytes of hard-drive space, ships
on two floppy disks and runs under Windows 3.1. (Oddly, it's
really a DOS game that happens to run under Windows--as opposed
to most Windows games, which can't run under DOS. If you want
to play it within DOS, just type the command gload at the C
\ prompt.) Now that's one radical retro feature we really dig.

$29.99 (Windows 3.1) from Viacom New Media, (800) 469-2539,
(212) 258-6000.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Do the shag

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Magic Carpet 2

Action-adventure

3 1/2 stars

Flying a magic carpet takes practice, but you won't find any
virtual transportation more fun. This action-packed three-dimensional
sequel (see Fun and Games, April 1995) sends you sailing over
the Netherworlds, where you use your mouse and keyboard to
cast spells of possession and destruction that help you capture
the mana (energy) of your enemies. With its fast action, maniacal
monsters and rich new worlds to explore, Magic Carpet 2 offers
serious gamers a rollicking ride.

The game picks up where its predecessor left off, with 25 new
worlds. But this installment features improved written instructions
and an optional tutorial mode, which lists your objectives
on the screen as you play.

If you've taken this ride before, you'll recognize the giant
bees, mana worms and dragons threatening your hide. But new
enemies abound. Six-headed hydras must die six times before
they'll give up their mana, and leviathans lurk beneath the
water, undetected by the navigational map on your screen. You'll
have to defeat the Seven Servants of Vissuluth--sorcerers and
demons who watch over their master's kingdom--and then contend
with Vissuluth, the Dark Lord himself.

You can destroy your enemies by acquiring meteors, lightning,
earthquakes and volcanoes, but fireballs are always at your
disposal, hurtling across the screen and erupting with a flash.
To protect yourself, you'll also find spells for invisibility,
healing, shielding and more--25 helping hands in all, each
with three levels of intensity. With its impressive twists
and turns, it's a safe bet you'll find Magic Carpet 2 more
than a rug-of-the-mill sequel.

$54.95 (DOS CD-ROM) from Electronic Arts, (800) 245-4525, (415)
571-7171.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Pick the prettier shade of 
green: ecological harmony--or money

By:
Julie Cohen

 
SimIsle

Simulation

3 stars

Island ecosystems rely on a delicate balance for survival. In
SimIsle, you can succeed by working with that balance, or destroying
it.

The program lets you choose one of 25 islands, each with its
own mission: Create a tourist haven that maintains a low pollution
rate but brings high incomes to the locals, for instance, or
build up a lumber-exportation business. If you choose the island
that looks suspiciously like North America, your mission will
be to make gobs of money regardless of world opinion, pollution
or the happiness of the island's native people.

You have 24 agents in your employ; send them to the villages
to create a work force, or to the mines and logging sites to
harness each island's resources. But you'll have to tackle
several tasks at once: For example, building a wildlife preserve
requires having a fenced-in area, but who's going to put up
the fence? That requires unskilled labor--so you must fill
your labor pool before you can move ahead toward your larger
goal.

Despite its politically correct setting, the game maintains
a balanced range of choices. There are no morality plays here;
it's just as easy to do well by exploiting all the available
resources for your personal gain as it is to preserve your
island's beauty while reaping benefits for the common good.
It's your conscience, and your call.

Whatever course you decide to take, you'll need plenty of patience
and planning. As is the case with the many varieties in Maxis's
ever-popular Sim series, a tutorial walks you through one scenario,
then leaves you on your own to figure out the rest. The 100
page manual contains all the data you need; as in real life,
however, it's up to you to decide how best to use it.

$34.95 (DOS CD-ROM) from Maxis, (800) 366-2947, (510) 254-9700.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Not quite full tilt

By:
Julie Cohen

Ultra 3-D Pinball

Arcade

2 1/2 stars

Ultra 3-D Pinball gives you two missions: Rack up as many points
as you can, and advance through three levels to build a starship
and win the game.

Each table--Colony, Mine and Command Post--presents five targets
that you can hit to pile up the points. Timing is everything;
once you start a bonus sequence, you may have only 30 seconds
to hit the next target.

As you meet your pinball challenges, you can work toward your
ultimate goal: building the starship. When you've done all
you can at a given table, you select your bonus: an extra ball,
a Continue (like winning a free game at the arcade), a new
table or a piece of the starship. The tricky part is figuring
out which bonus will bring you closer to the finale. If, for
example, you choose a Continue, you'll get to play a new game
when you're done with the last game in the program. True, you'll
start over with no points, but you get to keep all the pieces
of the starship you're already building. Alternatively, if
you've earned a few Continues, an extra ball might help you
at the table you're playing.

Besides the smooth 3-D action, the game gives you exploding
bulldozers, a unique flying missile glider that carries your
ball to a convenient point on the flippers, multi-ball play
and three sets of flippers per table. And yet, for all its
features, the program lacks flash. You'd need a 45-inch screen
to feel the full effect of the excellent graphics, and scores
are inflated to the point of meaninglessness. I hit 150 million
after keeping one ball alive for about 10 minutes, without
coming close to winning the game.

Ultra 3-D Pinball may save novices a few quarters for the laundry,
but pinball wizards should still visit the arcades if they
want to get their money's worth.

$49.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM) from Sierra On-Line, (800) 757-7707,
(206) 649-9800.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Fists of steal

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Supreme Warrior

Martial arts combat

2 1/2 stars

Supreme Warrior is a single-minded hand-to-hand combat game
in which your only goal is to defeat 12 martial arts masters.
Playing under the watchful eye of your mentor, Master Kai,
you'll face the Earth, Fire and Wind warlords and a total of
six bodyguards, then meet the supreme force of evil, Fang Tu,
with his two nasty bodyguards in tow.

The poor quality of the full-screen video sometimes makes it
tough to see what's happening on screen, but if you're an action
fan, Supreme Warrior still packs a mean punch. Each opponent
has a distinct fighting style; you have to execute your moves
with precision if you're going to make the contact count.

Keyboard manipulation is fairly straightforward if you use the
numerical keypad to throw punches, kick and block. A learning
mode helps you choose the right moves; once you master all
the basics, you can work on combinations that help you steal
powers from your adversaries. There are nine special moves
in all, with colorful, mystical names such as Jade Turtle of
Longevity (which boosts your endurance level), Plum Blossom
Rejuvenation Tea (which recharges your health and attack "chi,"
or energy) and Iron Lotus Shield (which grants temporary invulnerability)

True to its roots, Supreme Warrior can be played in Cantonese.
But don't worry about missing too much dialogue if you try
to play it that way; like the rest of the game, it seems to
be there strictly for kicks.

$59.95 (DOS CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Digital Pictures,
(800) 332-0032, (415) 345-5300.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Lock 'em up 
(just don't throw away the keyboard)

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Fade To Black

Action-adventure

2 stars

What do you do after 50 years of cryogenic sleep? If you wake
up in a cell in the lunar prison colony called New Alcatraz,
you try to escape. That means enlisting the help of dissident
John O'Connors, making your way to the moonbase O'Connors'
rebel affiliates occupy, and running covert missions to defeat
the mighty Morphs--the alien race that now rules the solar
system.

Fade To Black is a standard action-adventure game that sends
you racing through the mazelike corridors of New Alcatraz to
kill any creatures that block your path. Along the way, you'll
acquire various essential objects and tools. Look in every
locker you can--you'll find a variety of ammo and amenities
to help you overcome the Morphs. Bouncing mines ricochet off
the walls to find targets, while bullets can accomplish anything
from piercing armor to determining where the enemy is.

Fade To Black's polygon-rendered graphics have a blocky quality
that many game developers accept as the trade-off for quick,
smooth gameplay. Less forgivable is the clunky way you control
the action. It takes 30 keys to go with the flow: The four
cursor keys let you run, turn left and right, and duck, but
you'll also have to master keystrokes for large and small steps,
180-degree turns, loading your gun and so forth.

If you liked the similarly staged Alone in the Dark 3 (see Fun
and Games, July 1995), you might come back to Black; if not,
you'll probably just let it fade away.

$59.95 (DOS CD-ROM) from Electronic Arts, (800) 245-4525, (415)
571-7171.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Developers who 
can't play the corporate game hit the Web

By:
Stuart Gibbel

What do lost cats, acne and Spam have in common? All play a
part in the quirky games budding developers have posted on
the World Wide Web. These games tend to be crude by today's
multimedia standards, but many have a personal charm that commercial
programs often lack. That's because anyone with a little programming
know-how and an Internet connection can post one, ready for
the world to play, without worrying that a sales or marketing
department will think it too oddball to succeed. For instance,
if you're looking for an off-the-wall simulation, try Hairball
(http://netaccess.on.ca/~bnelson/games.html), the tale of a
cat looking for its owner in a cartoon world. Make a wrong
turn, and you lose one of your nine lives. The program's humor
may seem sophomoric, but then again, author Ben Nelson is only
13 years old.

Some games, like the absurd Find-the-Spam (http://sp1.berkeley.edu
 findthespam.html), wear out their welcome quickly; others,
like the Zit Game (http://www.stpt.com/cgi-bin/mine1)--think
Minesweeper played on an acne-riddled face--keep you coming
back. To find your own favorites, check out Uncle Bob's Web
Page Kid Page (http://gagme.wwa.com/~boba/kids1.html), Yahoo's
Web Games (http://www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Internet-
Games/In teractive--Web--Games/) or Zarf's List of Interactive
Games on the Web (http://www. cs.cmu.edu/afs/andrew/org/kgb

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Fast downloads? Look at Network TV

By:
Keith Kirkpatrick

Ever get frustrated that it takes so long to download images
to your PC, when Seinfeld shows up on your TV the instant you
switch on the tube? It may be a moot point before long. A new
technology standard developed by Intel, coupled with Malachi,
an add-in board from En Technology, can link your TV to your
PC for lightning-fast downloads. The system lets a broadcast
or cable station send digital data, such as interactive games
and multimedia software, to your television at a rate nearly
200 times that of a 9,600-bps modem. The TV can then transfer
the files via standard RCA cable to your computer.

According to Matt Cookson, an En Technology official, it's up
to TV programmers to decide what content they want to send;
whatever it is, it will be transmitted in tandem with regularly
scheduled TV shows (you can record the files on a standard
VCR to retrieve later). Malachi has been tested in New Hampshire
and Vermont, with users successfully receiving "the whole gamut,
from pictures of TV stars to text files to software packages,"
says Cookson. At press time, no major broadcasters had yet
agreed to deliver content using the system--but if they do,
you may want to make room on your coffee table for your keyboard.

Ultra 3-D Pinball demands sure aim and solid strategy to rack
up big points. Here are six tips you can bank on.

* Timing is everything. If you hit the flipper too early, the
ball will bounce right back to where it was before. Flipping
too late sends the shot into the opposite bumper. To time your
shot perfectly, fire just as the ball meets the flipper.

* Take advantage of the channel. When the ball rolls down the
channel alongside the flipper, raise the flipper to trap it.
Once the ball comes to a stop at the "elbow," you can figure
out your best shot, then lower the flipper to aim the ball
and set it in motion.

* Play the angles. Once you've caught the ball, wait until it
rolls down to the perfect spot on the flipper before you fire.
Flip while the ball is near the top, and it will move vertically,
toward the back of the table. The farther down on the flipper
the ball goes, the more the ball will veer to the opposite
side of the table when fired.

* Throw a left, then a right. This rescue technique can get
you out of a jam. If it looks like the ball is rolling right
down the middle of the table, try to get a piece of it with
one flipper at a time. The key to this maneuver is to make
sure you don't raise both simultaneously. In order to work,
it's got to be a one-two punch.

* Go for a pass. This one's tricky. The object is to flip the
ball from one flipper to the other, in order to get a better
aim at your target. It can be extremely helpful, but to use
this technique consistently well, your best bet is to practice,
practice, practice.

* Throw your weight around. Don't be afraid to "shake the table"
if the ball looks like it's headed for one of the lanes that
will take it out of play. After all, you can't flip the ball
if you can't get to it. A tap or two on the space bar should
do the trick; more than that, and you're flirting with a tilt.
--J.C.

Lifestyles + Learning--The PC Way: Where science and conscience collide

By:
Charles Bowen

The Day After Trinity

History, science

4 stars

The Trinity Site in New Mexico is the innocent-sounding name
of the spot where the first atomic bomb was tested in 1945.
The Day After Trinity, a finely focused, beautifully crafted
CD-ROM version of Jon Else's 1980 Oscar-nominated documentary
film of the same name, tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer
-the brilliant, fretful scientist who spearheaded the project
that unleashed the most terrifying, destructive weapon the
world had ever seen.

The story of "The Bomb" begins with the youthful exuberance
of America's wartime scientific community; it ends much more
soberly, as the bomb's developers mourn the horror and destruction
their work caused in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and come to terms
with its legacy--the Cold War and the nuclear arms race.

The disc incorporates the complete 88-minute film in QuickTime
video format, but that's only the beginning. The CD-ROM also
provides a vast collection of supporting material sure to impress
history and film buffs alike. You can hear real-time audio
commentary about the film from director Else, documentary scholar
Michael Renov and cultural critic B. Ruby Rich; and you can
pause at any point in the film to examine relevant documents
from a dossier of declassified files. You'll see papers from
the Manhattan Project, which created the bomb, as well as related
documents and letters from the FBI files.

A gallery of 100 black-and-white photos includes rare scenes
from Los Alamos, the New Mexico town where the nuclear scientists
lived and worked during the bomb's development. The program
includes biographical sketches of each person who appears in
the documentary or is even mentioned within the production.

Voyager, the disc's producer, is rapidly becoming multimedia's
class act, producing high-quality, affordable, socially relevant
discs time and again. The Day After Trinity is another feather
in the company's cap. Voyager has refreshingly resisted the
temptation to simply reproduce another medium's work, choosing
instead to build on it--and make it seem altogether better
and brand-new.

$29.95 (Windows CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Voyager, (800)
446-2001, (914) 591-5500.

Lifestyles + Learning--The PC Way: Bellying up to the toolbar

By:
Charles Bowen

Mr. Boston Official Bartender's and Party Guide

Entertaining

3 stars

Just in time for New Year's Eve, bartending's premier "little
red book"--the Mr. Boston Official Bartender's and Party Guide
-sets up its toolbar for service on the PC screen.

Mr. Boston pours more than 1,200 mixed-drink recipes onto two
Windows floppy disks. You'll find the potions in an index searchable
by name or ingredient, mixed in with introductory material,
advice on party preparation and tips on how to keep a well
stocked bar. Do you know how to properly chill or frost a glass?
When to stir and when to shake? How to open champagne or sparkling
wine? The answers are all here at your fingertips. When the
bar's dry, you can also pick up details on party tricks and
games, including the Bottoms Up Money Trick, the X-Ray Eyes
Coin Trick, the Lift a Bottle with a Straw trick, the Three
Glass Trick and the Iron Fist trick. In perhaps the neatest
trick of all, the disks install directly on your hard drive
and take up less than 6 megabytes of storage space.

The program is one of the first in a series of 36 electronic
books Time Warner is releasing on floppies in its new "Quick
Reads" series. Each will use the same simple interface, which
lets you find material by keyword, view illustrations, browse
chapters, and copy, print and mark information for future reference.
Upcoming disks will cover topics in business, cooking, self
help and entertainment; if they maintain Mr. Boston's quality,
you'll be glad there's still a long way to go before last call.

$14.95 (Windows) from Time Warner Quick Reads, (800) 759-0190,
(212) 522-7200.

Lifestyles + Learning--The PC Way: Start spreading the newsletters

By:
Sharlene Johnson

Microsoft Publisher CD Deluxe for Windows 95

Desktop publishing

4 stars

Publisher's easy-to-use PageWizards have long been a boon to
novice desktop publishers. Now, with a few minor additions
here and enhancements there, the updated Publisher CD Deluxe
for Windows 95 makes professional-looking newsletters and other
print projects a snap even for newcomers.

On the revised startup screen, you'll find Publisher's tried
and-true Wizards represented by icons rather than listed in
a text box; this minute change makes them seem more accessible.
The so-called "design assistants" practically do all the work
for you, helping you create anything from funky greeting cards
to formal letterhead to newsletters that get noticed. With
a storehouse of more than 1,000 pieces of clip art, 60 TrueType
fonts and 100 border designs, you may find you don't need to
buy separate art or font collections.

Experienced self-publishers and do-it-yourselfers can--and probably
will--skip the Wizards and start from scratch. Even so, step
by-step help is never hard to find; this version offers the
option of leaving the Help box up on the screen for easy reference
while you work. It also provides Tip pages (pop-up messages
that suggest shortcuts for the function you're using at that
time), Tool Tips (pop-up descriptions that explain each button's
function) and First-Time Help, which offers a quick overview
of a feature the first time you use it.

Given the near-overload of help features, you might think that
the hefty manual--more than 300 pages--would be superfluous;
but it provides a useful introduction to design, with helpful
articles on creating a distinctive layout, selecting the right
paper, using color and choosing appropriate fonts.

Publisher has several other new and enhanced features designed
to polish your work. For example, you can give your newsletter
the look of a first-class magazine with the addition of Fancy
First Letters, a table of contents, a masthead and "Continued
on..." lines that will help your readers find the pieces of
a story spread out over non-consecutive pages. The Outside
Print Setup will ensure that your file is shipshape for delivery
if you plan to use a professional printer.

With this more polished Publisher on your computer, putting
words into print is practically painless.

$79.95 (Windows 95 CD-ROM) from Microsoft, (800) 426-9400, (206)
882-8080.

MOBA: The Virtual Museum of Bad Art

Art

2 1/2 stars

Ever stand in a museum looking at a painting and ask yourself,
"Is that really supposed to be good?" Well, if the museum you're
visiting is MOBA, the answer is "No!"

For four years, Boston's Museum of Bad Art has been celebrating
awful artwork, and now its good humor and bad taste come together
in a fun and funny CD-ROM.

MOBA's disc takes users on a virtual tour of all 28 rooms in
the museum. Where else could you see Elvis as he might have
been drawn by Picasso? Or Lucy in the Field with Flowers, pulled
from a trash heap on a Boston street in 1992?

The pictures are accompanied by comments, anecdotes and put
ons from more than 90 visitors to the real museum: "I've seen
bad art in some of the best museums in the world," reports
Lorraine McGrath, "but this place is full of it."

"MOBA is a bad place to visit, but a great place to meet men,"
says Vicki Gold.

And what did Peter O'Reilly like best? Well, "I'm very impressed
with some of the frames," he comments dryly.

In terms of the MOBA collection, that's as good as it gets.

$19.95 (Windows CD-ROM) from Backyard Computing, (617) 444-6757.

Lifestyles + Learning--The PC Way: Moving memorials to the unknown soldiers

By:
Charles Bowen

 
Beyond the Wall

History

3 1/2 stars

Too often, war stories are recorded with little emotion or humanity.
Library shelves are filled with dissections of bloody battles
in terms of grand strategy and statistics, biographies of leaders,
and maps of troop movements; the men and women who were living
-and dying--in the trenches are inexplicably missing in action.

Beyond the Wall nobly tries to rectify this situation by preserving
personal stories from the Vietnam War. It's a powerful tribute
to the 58,000 fallen soldiers whose names appear on the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial, in Washington, D.C.

The CD-ROM documentary leads you on a 3-D tour of the famous
black-granite monument. Along the way, you can click on any
of 18 ghostly images to read excerpts from letters and hear
audiotapes sent home by soldiers shortly before they died.
You can also view personal mementos--from combat boots to stuffed
animals--left by grieving family and friends at the wall. Poetry,
music, photos, home movies, letters and diary entries come
together in a compelling collage.

The program also incorporates an extensive, searchable database
of the names on the wall, augmented with information on the
soldiers' hometowns, birth dates and military ranks, as well
as the exact locations where you'll find the names on the monument.

Another section describes how the wall came to be, beginning
with Vietnam veteran Jan Scruggs' inspiration after seeing
the movie The Deer Hunter, continuing through the design competition,
and ending with the construction and dedication in 1982. Along
the way, you'll hear comments from the winning designer, Maya
Lin, as well as surviving political and military leaders reflecting
on the era.

The disc's one serious flaw is its embarrassingly sparse section
called About the War. Rather than teaching us, the section
merely demonstrates that the story of the Vietnam War is too
long and complex to be covered as an after-thought. For that
reason, this is not a very helpful disc for students in search
of the facts, figures and fissures surrounding Vietnam. But
for anyone who wants to understand why the word still stirs
our emotions 20 years after the end of hostilities, it's an
excellent place to start looking for answers.

$39 (Windows CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Magnet Interactive
Studios, (800) 996-0011, (310) 369-2851.

Verse Search 6.0

Religion

3 stars

Bert Brown and Kent Ochel made history 14 years ago when they
put the entire Bible on computer disk for the first time. But
the result hardly seemed a match made in heaven; hard drives
were rare, compact discs unheard of--and searching the massive
text required the patience of Job.

Now, with Verse Search 6.0, mere mortals can tackle the task
with ease. The software will rapidly search the Old and New
Testaments, pull out verses containing specified keywords,
and link with relevant study manuals, maps, a biblical encyclopedia
and personal notes. It took only a second for the program to
locate all 1,515 verses mentioning "children," then narrow
the list to the several dozen that also mention "teaching"
or "training." The software makes it easy to copy material
 A dynamic data-exchange feature lets you use the program's
information in documents within WordPerfect, Word and AmiPro.
It also comes with two Bible translations (the King James version
and the New International translation), a Bible dictionary
and a collection of maps.

For serious students of religion, the publisher produces many
add-on features that can be used with the same search system,
including additional translations, study aids such as Greek
and Hebrew transliterators, and biblical guides. However, this
is not a multimedia program; it's designed for research, not
entertainment, so you'll find no audio, video or overview accompanying
its text and menu bars. But if you're more than a dabbler in
theological topics, Verse Search is a powerful tool that may
be the answer to your prayers.

$149.95 (DOS, Windows 3.1, Macintosh, DOS CD-ROM, Windows 3.1
CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Bible Research Systems, (800)
423-1228, (512) 251-7541.

Home Improvement 1-2-

Do-it-yourself

3 1/2 stars

As any devotee of the popular TV sitcom knows, there are two
kinds of people who attempt home improvement: the bungling
Tim types, who need all the help they can get, and the practiced
pros, like Al, who wield their power tools with poise and panache.
Fortunately, no matter which category you fall into, it's hard
to go wrong with the straightforward techniques in Home Improvement
1-2-3.

Although the disc--based on the book of the same name--is organized
to allow quick access to the numerous step-by-step project
instructions, detailed background information is also readily
available. In addition, buttons access safety alerts, tool
lists, designers' tips and shopping guidelines. The Skill Scale
button helps you decide if you're qualified to tackle a job;
Homer's Hindsight warns of common errors.

Home Improvement 1-2-3 offers built-in calculators and full
motion video--most of which, unfortunately, is limited to brief
chapter introductions. But the best thing about using your
PC as a plumber's helper is that you can print the illustrated
instructions for fixing a leaky faucet, then take them right
to the kitchen sink. After all, not even an expert like Al
would risk getting a nice hardcover book within soaking range.

Compton's Complete Street Guide

Mapping

2 1/2 stars

Take a left at the stoplight, drive a few blocks, then turn
right and hang a quick left at the gas station...." Lost yet?
Following directions is always tricky--you might reach your
destination, but then again, you might not. The custom maps
in Compton's Complete Street Guide aim to ensure you and your
guests never get lost again.

Like several competing street-level mapping programs, Street
Guide offers you a close look at any U.S. neighborhood. Its
strongest innovation is a palette of "stamps"--102 small pictures
you can drag and drop on your map. Use a tiny house to show
the location of your home, for example, then label it with
a brief description (such as "Our house"). You can flag landmarks
with arrows, stoplights, pointing hands and labels such as
"Turn left here." When you're done, print your map (for best
results, use a color printer)

On the downside, Compton's Street Guide lacks the search muscle
of some competitors--for example, the program stops short of
locating specific street addresses. But it'll get you where
you're going, with a fair amount of style.

$59.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM) from Compton's NewMedia, (800) 261

By:
Steven Korn

Care for a free preview of the Museum of Bad Art? Browsers are
always welcome at MOBA's Internet outpost (http://mirror.wwa.com
mirror/ orgs/moba/moba.htm). If it serves as a sort of crude
awakening to a low-rent aesthetic, the Web holds some sites
for further research.

The Outsider Art section of the WFMU Catalog of Curiosities
(http://wfmu.org/Catalog/ Sects/outside.html) sells two pertinent
books: Thrift-Store Painting, with 96 reproductions of art
bought in second-hand shops, and Black Velvet: The Art We Love
To Hate, which has 43 examples of "America's only parking lot
art form." Perhaps the artists were inspired by Walter Keane,
who found huge success in the 1950s with oil paintings of big
eyed waifs; you'll find an appreciation of this "thrift-store
expressionism," from the book Cult Rapture, at http://www.csn.net
central/feralhouse/keane.html.

And where will we find the unusual art of tomorrow? Keep an
eye on projects like HypArt (pictured above; http://rzsun01.
rrz.uni-hamburg.de/cgi-bin/ HypArt.sh), where anyone can claim
a piece of the virtual canvas and create a part of a communal
"painting." The creators rightly note that anyone can contribute
because "everybody is capable of producing art"--precisely
the spirit that gave us MOBA's gems.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Another coup for kids' 
favorite purple coupe

By:
Carol Ellison

Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo

Ages 3 to 8

Game

4 stars

Putt-Putt--the plucky purple roadster who stars in a winning
series of animated children's computer games--has yet to take
a wrong turn, as far as the tykes who test software in the
HomePC Kids' Lab are concerned.

"I love this game!" cried Thomas, 5, after getting acquainted
with Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, the latest of the cartoon car's
ongoing adventures.

"I love you!" added 6-year-old Brian when he saw Putt-Putt on
the screen. Then he leaned over and kissed the monitor.

This time out, our hero's off to the Cartown Zoo, where a variety
of baby animals have wandered off from their proper surroundings;
the snake and the hippo are trapped in Arcticland, for instance,
while the lion cub is stuck on a rock halfway up a waterfall.
Players must steer Putt-Putt through the zoo to find the missing
animals and the gadgets he needs to rescue them--a shovel to
dig through an avalanche, for example, or lumber to fix a raft.
It's up to the kids to figure out what tool to use in each
rescue mission; along the way, they can stop for a game of
hockey against a polar bear or snack on cotton candy.

In the HomePC Kids' Lab, Putt-Putt's charms never fail to capture
the hearts of players above the age rating on the box (3 to
8). Cara, 10, loved the game as much as her 6-year-old sister,
Laura, did. Cara hoped that her reward for outscoring the bear
at hockey would be something to use to help a baby snake off
the Arctic ice. Laura cheered for her sister and, like a good
New York (if not hockey) fan, chanted "Let's Go Mets! Let's
Go Mets!" when she heard the organ in the arena. Alas, the
hockey game was just for fun.

"I feel so bad," Cara lamented. "I'm here playing hockey with
this bear, and the poor little snake is freezing his burritos
off."

Maybe it's the music or the excellent cartoon graphics. Maybe
it's Putt-Putt's squeaky voice. Maybe it's the sheer fun of
the game. Whatever the reason, Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, the
fourth installment in the series, gleefully cements the joyful
jalopy's undisputed title as the most popular character ever
to roll into the HomePC Kids' Lab.

$39.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Humongous
Entertainment, (206) 485-1212.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: History repeats itself 
(say, haven't we seen this concept before?)

By:
Carol Ellison

Mission Code: Millennium

Ages 8 to adult

History

2 1/2 stars

Mission Code: Millennium sends kids racing through time in search
of objects stolen from their proper place in history. As employees
of Virtual Travel Inc., children traipse along a time line
and a map of Europe in an effort to return, say, a copy of
Shakespeare's Othello, James Watt's steam engine or Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony to their rightful era and location.

When players visit a particular historical time, on-screen robots
morph into characters decked out in period garb to briefly
introduce them to the cultural, political, religious and artistic
trends of the day. As children explore museums, laboratories,
libraries, theaters and architectural sites in each location,
they identify objects that may point their search in the right
direction. For example, the items might identify composers
and artists who lived in the same country or century as the
object kids are trying to place.

The helpful robots put history in a livelier context than many
other educational games. But the on-screen clues are limited
to factoids; children can easily end up wandering the centuries
for what seems like ages, collecting clues from numerous eras
until they figure out where each of the four objects belongs.
It helps a lot to keep a good encyclopedia handy.

"This game is cool. It's like, so...virtual," observed Alex,
10, as the program whisked him off from the travel agency's
space station to medieval Germany, where he heard a Gregorian
chant in a cathedral.

But by day's end, Alex had lost his enthusiasm for the disc,
saying that after playing it for a while, the game just didn't
measure up to "the high quality of Carmen Sandiego."

Parents will appreciate the game's educational efforts, and
with 120 items to place, the program has the potential for
many hours of play. But kids? Well, let's just say Carmen Sandiego
has better earned her place in history.

Snootz Math Trek/Bumptz Science

Carnival

Ages 6 to 10

Math/science

3 stars

Snootz Math Trek and Bumptz Science Carnival, two punchy PC
programs, prove math and science need not be alien concepts
for kids, as extraterrestrials cross basic skills with the
world of Pachinko games, pinball arcades and carnival sideshows.

Snootz presents kids with six math-related activities; for instance,
they'll help two silly Snootians, Flarn and Foozle, string
together sounds to form melodic patterns, or assemble puzzle
pieces to help fix a spaceship. Several of the games can be
played by two kids at once.

"I found it!" Eric, 7, declared after he uncovered the compass
directions he needed to chart a course to locate Flarn on a
busy street map. "I knew I could do it because I'm good at
math in school," he said. "I don't get anything wrong!"

Another alien, Bumptz, hosts the Science Carnival, where kids
find six games that present demonstrations and experiments
in a sideshow environment. In the underwater Bubblearium, for
example, players use clams to squeeze air out of Bumptz and
inflator fish to squeeze it back in, thus controlling his buoyancy
inside a water tank.

Meanwhile, Cara, 10, described another puzzle as "a little like
art, but it's really a science program."

She and our other young experts found numerous discoveries at
this science fair, which proved to be much more than middling
fun.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: All work and noteworthy play

By:
Carol Ellison

 
Big Job

Ages 4 and up

Exploration

4 stars

Toy trucks and tools are perennial favorites of the sandbox
set. In Big Job, there's plenty of dirt to haul, fires to extinguish
and projects to build; it's bursting with fun-filled activities
that show kids some of the science and sensitivities workers
bring to their jobs.

Unlike Kids on Site (see Kid Raves, October 1995), Big Job teaches
kids about their on-screen jobs instead of just having them
playact the roles. Rather than just driving a tractor or connecting
a fire hose, kids get briefings--sung to catchy tunes--about
the challenges that firefighters, farmers and construction
workers face every day.

When kids show up for work, they collect a time card and punch
in at the Big Job Clubhouse, where they select one of the three
occupations. They can view music videos about the job, play
games or sing songs that help teach them about their chosen
profession. Kids can even "drive" to work in a roadway simulation,
taking care not to run off the road or run out of gas.

The disc was a hit with both boys and girls in the lab--but
especially with the boys, who fought fiercely over who got
to play it.

"Fire truck! Wow! There it is! There it is!" cried Michael,
4, as he grabbed the keyboard from Benjamin, also 4, clicked
on the fire truck in the clubhouse and watched the crew douse
the on-screen flames. Grabbing back the mouse, Benjamin turned
to the jukebox and played a music video that showed firemen
in raincoats heading for the hoses. "It's about firemen," he
said, struggling to keep the mouse until the song finished.
"Look. Just look," he insisted.

Michael did--until the song finished. Then he rushed off to
try his hand at farming.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Now you see it, now you don't

Secrets of Magic with Dikki Ellis

No age rating (best for ages 10 and up)

Entertainment

3 stars

Magic is hot these days; this is the second of four programs
about magic scheduled to be released in time for Christmas.
So we turned to the experts who looked at the first program,
Magic with Jay Alexander (see Kid Raves, December 1995) and
asked for their verdict. After much debate, our panel gave
the nod to Jay Alexander, but agreed Dikki Ellis has plenty
of tricks up his sleeve.

The program, which also comes with a videotape, presents twice
as many video-based tricks as the Alexander disc, as well as
a "magician's room" that introduces various props, an encyclopedia
and information on basic performance techniques (a prop pack
is available for $5). But the wealth of material proved just
a little too much for the amateur magicians in our lab.

"It's good, but the problem is that the tricks are basically
ones you need to be David Copperfield to perform," said Alex,
10. "Jay Alexander explains himself more."

Kids who've tried to perform magic will enjoy the added depth
of this program. But there's one trick even Dikki Ellis couldn't
pull off: getting the videos on the Windows 3.1 disc to work
under Windows 95--they froze frequently. Villa Crespo, which
makes the program, says any Windows 95 users who experience
problems running the software under the new operating system
can exchange the disc for another Villa Crespo program.

$49.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM) from Villa Crespo Software, (800)
521-3963, (708) 433-0500.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Flight game goes over kids' heads

By:
Carol Ellison

 
First Encounter

Ages 6 to adult

Flight game

1 1/2 stars

With its 138-page manual, difficult DOS interface and key commands,
First Encounter is not a game; it's a commitment. Even junior
power users in the Kids' Lab found it daunting. "There's too
much reading," complained Alex, 10. "It's for people with too
much time on their hands."

The game, a flight simulator set in the 33rd century, asks players
to deal with the politics and economics of the day, avoiding
anarchists and enemy forces while buying and selling commodities.
The box says the game's appropriate for 6-year-olds, but we
know 60-year-olds who couldn't handle all that.

The program features fine graphics and masterful moments of
full-motion video; with a more realistic age rating, it might
have fared better. As it was, 10-year-old David's experience
was typical: He tackled the game with relish but soon tired
of rifling through the manual.

Still, he stuck with it longer than Alex, who threw his hands
in the air after about 30 minutes and declared, "I have no
patience for this."

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: King Pong

By:
Carol Ellison

 
Arcade Mania

No age rating (best for ages 8 to adult)

Game

3 1/2 stars

Remember the arcade games Pong, Tank Commander and Space Invaders?
Then Arcade Mania's Neutrino, Lunar Fox and Nova 3 will look
familiar--and better than ever.

In the Pong-like Neutrino, a nuclear facility is melting down
and kids must bat down walls of neutrons to save it. If they
fail, a helmeted man in white says a quick "uh-oh" before a
mushroom cloud erupts on screen.

In Lunar Fox, players shoot phaser-like bolts to squelch a rebellion
of unruly futuristic "neighbors" who maneuver their tanks through
walled mazes. And in Nova 3, it's up to kids to find and shoot
alien invaders at a space station.

You won't find any educational value here; the games are as
mindless and addictive as Tetris--and just as much fun, with
solid sound and exciting graphics.

Stephanie, 9, squared off against Duwan, also 9, at Nova 3,
then they teamed up, with the observer coaching the player
at the controls.

"Oooh...get that guy," Stephanie said, pointing out the invader
on the screen. Duwan did. The two slapped hands and cried,
"We beat it! We beat it!"

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: The dolldrums

By:
Carol Ellison

Fisher-Price Dream Dollhouse

Ages 3 to 7

Exploration/game

2 1/2 stars

For all its charms, the Fisher-Price Dream Dollhouse just couldn't
measure up to the expectations of the little girls in the Kids'
Lab. Clicking on cups and saucers with a mouse simply isn't
as much fun as staging your own tea party.

Laura, 6, was delighted to find clothes in a trunk in the bedroom;
she dressed the on-screen model in an assortment of outfits,
then explored all the rooms and games in the house. But when
she finished, she said her real dollhouse is "funner."

Abbe, 6, also checked out every room, chatting as she went.

"I'll move this dog right over here, and I'm going to close
the oven," she said, as she arranged her kitchen and prepared
a meal of chocolate-chip cookies. But she was ultimately disappointed
 "I don't know where the can opener is so I can open the dog
food."

Her favorite game was the ice- cream maker in the kitchen; kids
can create bizarre flavors to their heart's--or heartburn's
-content.

"This is going to be totally disgusting," Abbe said as she prepared
to make a batch of asparagus ice cream.

But as much as she seemed to enjoy exploring the dollhouse and
befriending the characters within the program, Abbe complained
that "mostly you just click and drag things around."

In the end, it didn't feel to Abbe like the kind of place she'd
want to call home.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Madeline still speaks 
little girls' language

By:
Carol Ellison

Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show

Ages 5 and up

Exploration/game

3 stars

Madeline, the star of storybooks, toys and even her own Saturday
morning TV show, has at last arrived on the PC. And there's
little doubt that girls of all ages will love this charming
disc.

The narration, by actor Christopher Plummer, frees children
who have not yet learned to read from the feelings of frustration
that come with stumbling through printed directions. Older
girls, meanwhile, can match pictures to words in English, French
and Spanish.

Lisa, 8, played a match game in English, then in French. When
she was done, Madeline congratulated her: "You did wonderfully.
Let's try something harder." But Lisa said non, and instead
dove back into the main adventure, finding everything she needed
to stage a puppet show to raise money to help a neighbor pay
his rent.

Although the solution to the mystery remains the same every
time kids play, many of the activities are open-ended; for
instance, players can paint different scenes as the backdrops
for their show, or dress the puppets differently each time.

"There's this attic, and you have to get up there to make the
puppets," 6-year-old Laura explained, then added that she hadn't
yet found what she needed to lower the attic stairs from the
ceiling--and quickly went back to work.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: For kids, sand's fun, 
the hourglass is not

By:
Carol Ellison

Trudy's Time and Place House

Ages 3 to 6

Readiness

2 1/2 stars

Trudy's Time and Place House is the latest entry in the normally
outstanding series of "House" preschool programs (see Kid Raves,
November 1994). But time and place are tough ideas for little
ones to grasp; this disc requires parents to be on hand to
put concepts in context.

Laura, 6, tackled a game that took her into space to view a
global map. She reacted with glee when she recognized a picture
of China's Summer Palace as "just like in the Great Movie ride
in Disney World," referring to the video of Mann's Chinese
Theater she'd seen there. Only when her mom directed her to
click on New York, where they live, and the program showed
the Statue of Liberty did the young traveler get her bearings.

More to Laura's age level--and liking--was the sandbox where
kids make their own topographical map by dropping symbols of
mountains, hills, rivers and towns into the sand. "Beautiful!"
declared Laura, as she admired the hills and valleys she'd
created.

Trudy's Time and Place House offers excellent instruction, but
parents should be sure the exercises are appropriate for each
child, or they may produce more frustration than fun.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Inside the Kids' Lab: 
Kids' icons are the friends on screen

By:
Carol Ellison

Sometimes, kids' software just can't stack up to a cute stuffed
animal. Children can't take the computer to bed with them at
night, cuddle a keyboard or curl up with a computer mouse on
a long road trip. But they do find a way to bring whatever
they love into their lives--and that includes their favorite
computer characters.

We learned that lesson during this month's software tests in
the HomePC Kids' Lab, where children of all ages try out software
and let us observe--and learn from--their reactions. This month,
our younger testers revealed how easily they get attached to
stellar software characters as friends and playmates. "Her
-she's my favorite," said Abbe, pointing out a mouse in the
Fisher-Price Dream Dollhouse. "Then her. Then her. Then him.
Then him," she added, pointing to the other residents in her
virtual home. And how much do kids love Putt-Putt? Brian and
Laura, both 6, kissed the little car on the screen, while Thomas
and Michael, both 5, rushed to hug the monitor.

Speaking of hugs, we send ours to all the young experts in our
Lab, as well as to the adults who helped bring you this month's
reviews. Thanks to preschoolers Michael Adamo, Benjamin Herman
and Thomas Volpe; and students Gabriel Ayache, Brian Corrigan,
Drew D'Agostino, Cara and Laura Forte, Abbe and Lisa Goldberg,
Alex Hyman, Jason Marder, Duwan McCormick, Stephanie McCarty,
Eric Rahamin and David Wasley. Special thanks also to the CMP
Publications' Child Care Center, its director Ann Erbes, and
teacher Debbie Doyle; Kids' Lab assistant Karen Garber; and
editorial assistant Keith Kirkpatrick.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Learning: How Net links enrich CDs

By:
Warren Buckleitner

This year, each of the three top-selling encyclopedias on CD
ROM--Compton's, Encarta and Grolier--includes an on-line feature
that lets you download up-to-date articles to your PC. But
those late-breaking links are just a hint of what's to come
as children's software merges with the information highway.
Bill Gross, the founder of Knowledge Adventure (which publishes
the popular Bug Adventure and Jump*Start software), believes
1996 "will be the year educational software stops being antisocial."
In his view, the software of tomorrow will be designed not
for one or two players at a single keyboard, but for kids all
around the world connected by the Internet for collaborative
education.

For instance, Knowledge Adventure aims to link its children's
reference discs to an on-line research service called Homework
Helper. Children will be able to learn more about subjects
covered in the software by clicking on an icon that accesses
Homework Helper automatically. Once connected, they can supplement
the software by reading up-to-date sources, including publications
and transcripts of National Public Radio broadcasts, and by
chatting with other kids using the service.

Kids with Internet access playing Headbone Interactive's AlphaBonk
Farm (see Kid Raves, May 1995) can jump from the game to Headbone's
Web page to read Svelt Velma the Sow's daily horoscope. And
fans of the company's Elroy Goes Bugzerk (Kid Raves, October
1995) can send messages to Elroy's e-mail address.

Thanks to the Internet, children can even participate in software
development. Last year, MECC involved classrooms in the production
of MayaQuest, which simulates a trip back in time to explore
the Mayan empire. Kids followed the adventures of MECC's developers
through Mayan ruins on the Yucatan peninsula--without leaving
their keyboards.

Warren Buckleitner is the editor of the Children's Software
Revue in Ypsilanti, Mich.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Kids' keyboards: 
Two types for tykes

By:
Carol Ellison

Most keyboards for kids are essentially standard keyboards dressed
up in childlike themes, but two models turn a PC into a brand
new toy. Vtech's Sound and Learning System and the Comfy Keyboard
are both charming, easy to connect and fun. We gave the 25
tykes in the CMP Publications Child Care Center in Manhasset,
N.Y., a chance to put them to the test.

The keyboard king? Comfy, by a nose. Age-rated for children
from 1 to 6 years old, the $129 Comfy (Windows 3.1, Macintosh
due in January) comes with one CD-ROM or floppy disk; other
programs are available for $24-34 each. The keyboard's buttons
are marked with pictures instead of letters, which makes the
Comfy great for little ones.

Vtech's $79.99 Sound Learning Keyboard (DOS), designed for children
3 to 7, features raised letter keys in alphabetical order,
a style suited for kids just learning to read. It comes with
one program on floppy disks; two others are sold separately
for $19.99. One drawback: The Vtech system's "escape" keys
are adjacent to all the others, inviting curious kids to constantly
-if inadvertently--boot themselves out of a program. And the
Vtech requires batteries, which--you guessed it--are not included.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: For ill children, 
PCs are just what the doctor ordered

By:
Carol Ellison

If you think high-tech toys are just fun and games, think again.
They "may have direct clinical benefit" in helping sick kids
get well, says Dr. Melvin Marks, medical director at Miller
Children's Hospital, in Long Beach, Calif.

Not long after Miller's staff began rolling televisions and
video games on trolleys called "fun centers" to the children's
bedsides, child-life specialist Rita Bright noticed that Super
Mario and his animated friends seemed to have a very soothing
-and even a therapeutic--effect on the kids.

When the Starlight Foundation, a wish-granting organization
for critically ill children, heard the news, it funded additional
trolleys--this time equipped with PCs--and a special children's
high-tech room at Miller and four other hospitals around the
world. A subsequent preliminary study at the University of
Southern California showed that there is more to entertainment
therapy than anyone suspected--and the results of the study
led to the formation of Starbright, a sister foundation developing
entertaining computer programs to provide medical information
to children and relieve the anxieties and suffering of those
with serious illnesses. The foundation has the backing of a
star-studded lineup of supporters, including film director
Steven Spielberg.

Starbright's chief project is a $60 million computer network
linking high-tech playrooms in eight pediatric hospitals across
the United States. Spielberg hopes one day to expand the network
around the world, allowing patients to log on, choose an electronic
persona--or "avatar"--from more than 150 characters designed
by his animators, and play together in a virtual world. Currently,
kids can fly their avatars through the clouds, race down a
drag strip or join one another to explore a cave. Or, they
can pop into a videoconference to see and talk with children
in other hospitals.

According to Spielberg, the inspiration for the network came
from a young cancer patient who asked the director if he could
turn on the light in E.T.'s finger, so E.T. could reach out
and touch the boy and return his life to normal. Of course,
that request was beyond what E.T.--and Spielberg--could do.
But with the network and other high-tech interventions, Spielberg
says, the diversion provided by fun and entertainment can help
relieve the pain felt by that child and others, and "take us
a long way toward that dream."

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: In an age of Model T's, 
this PC's a Corvette

By:
Fred Davis

Acer Aspire 2136

Computer

3 stars

Computer design is no longer simply a question of motherboards,
microchips and cables; consumers are beginning to look at PCs
as home furnishings, and they expect to see a little visual
style with their technical substance. The Acer Aspire 2136
sets a terrific example for this new breed--its dramatic angles
form one of the sharpest-looking PCs around.

The Aspire owes its singular good looks to a renowned high-tech
design firm in Sunnyvale, Calif., called frogdesign.  Instead of
a motley assemblage of boxy hardware and peripherals, the 2136
carefully coordinates its pieces The case, monitor, keyboard and
mouse come in slate gray or mossy green, unified by graceful,
flowing, futuristic lines.

Of course, the Aspire's design would mean little if its triumphs
were merely aesthetic; happily, it's functional, too. For instance,
holes in the monitor and case look cool--and keep the system
cool as well. The front panel of the PC case flips up to reveal
a handle; opening the case is simply a matter of grabbing the
handle and pulling it out.

Inside, the Aspire holds a potent 100-MHz Pentium chip, 16 megabytes
of RAM and a 1.2-gigabyte hard drive. The system includes a
quad-speed CD-ROM drive, 16-bit sound card, and 28.8-Kbps modem
with fax, answering-machine and voicemail capabilities. The
keyboard (which comes with a wrist rest) and mouse are both
color-coordinated and comfortable to use.

We breezed through our installation and setup in roughly 10
minutes, thanks to the system's color-coded cables and corresponding
connectors. The 2136 comes preloaded with Windows 95, and adds
a nice selection of on-line communications, education and entertainment
software to the mix.

The one disappointment in the model we tested was its 14-inch
monitor (which adds $299 to the base price). The built-in speakers
and integrated multimedia cable are nice touches, but the small
screen delivered somewhat fuzzy images. The 15-inch version
sells for $399; that may seem a pretty penny for an extra inch
of real estate, but it makes this stylish system a much more
attractive buy. $2,299 with 16 MB of RAM, 1.2-GB hard drive
and quad-speed CD-ROM drive (monitor sold separately), from
Acer America, (800) 309-2237, (408) 432-6200.

for Little Jack Horner

Fred Davis

Packard Bell Multimedia Corner Computer

Computer

3 1/2 stars

Talk about cornering a market: The Packard Bell Multimedia Corner
Computer is the first personal computer designed to fit snugly
into the least intrusive part of a room.

Packard Bell turned to frogdesign--the same firm that created
the Acer Aspire (see above)--to give its systems a face-lift.
Compared with the Aspire, the Corner Computer looks clunky,
and its case doesn't open as easily. But the way the PC angles
neatly into the corner of a room or desk, letting you reclaim
precious living or work space, is a real innovation.

While you'll find the model hanging out in corners, it isn't
loitering; this is one of Packard Bell's most powerful PCs.
Its 100-MHz Pentium processor and top-notch components achieved
some of the best performance results we've seen yet from Packard
Bell, which has taken some heat in the past for selling systems
with below-average components. But in the Wintune 2.0 tests
we ran--a set of benchmark performance comparisons--the Corner
Computer's RAM, video and hard drive results were more impressive
than those of the Acer Aspire 2136.

The unit we tested came with 16 megabytes of RAM, a 1.6-gigabyte
hard drive, a quad-speed CD-ROM drive, and a built-in TV tuner
and FM radio. The MPEG video system was fast and responsive,
and it delivers full-screen, full-motion playback from your
CD-ROMs. On the downside, the Corner Computer includes a 14.4
Kbps modem--anything less than a 28.8-Kbps model on a PC as
powerful as this seems unnecessarily skimpy.

$2,799 with 16 MB of RAM, 1.6-GB hard drive and quad-speed CD
ROM drive (monitor sold separately), from Packard Bell, (800)

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: IBM passes screen test 
with flying colors

By:
Julie Cohen

IBM ThinkPad 365CD

Multimedia notebook PC

3 stars

Portable-PC lovers' hearts may flutter when they see the rainbow
of colors on the ThinkPad 365CD multimedia notebook's screen,
but, ultimately, this system is more functional than it is
fun.

The 365CD has its share of snazzy features for the price: a
built-in double-speed CD-ROM drive, built-in sound and an active
matrix color screen. However, as with any notebook PC, portability
requires a few compromises: You'll need an external drive (included
in the base price) to use floppy disks, and there's only one
speaker.

Of course, the big compromise comes in overall performance,
which generally suffers compared with similarly equipped desktop
models. The ThinkPad packs an Intel-compatible 75-MHz 486DX4
chip, 8 megabytes of memory and a 540-MB hard drive, yet in
Wintune performance tests, it more closely resembled a 66-MHz
486DX2 desktop PC.

And yet, there is that screen. The active-matrix, 640-by-480
display delivers colors as vivid as you could hope for. And
at 10.4 inches diagonally, you'll have plenty of room to enjoy
them.

IBM also lets you take your pick of operating systems--either
Windows 3.11 and IBM's OS/2 Warp, or Windows 95 alone.

The ThinkPad 365CD isn't perfect, but it is a complete, portable
multimedia PC; road warriors can count on it to deliver value
-and color--if not the flash of a pricier notebook.

$3,000 with 8 MB of RAM, 540-MB hard drive, built-in double
speed CD-ROM drive and active-matrix display, from IBM, (800)
426-2968, (914) 766-1900.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: 8X is fast--
but CDs still need to catch up

By:
Julie Cohen

Diamond Multimedia Kit 8000

8X multimedia upgrade kit

2 1/2 stars

The Diamond Multimedia Kit 8000 comes with everything you need
to turn your system into a screamer: a state-of-the-art 8X
CD-ROM drive, 16-bit wavetable sound card and Yamaha YST-M5
3-watt speakers that deliver rich sound--all serving to enhance
the kit's stellar software selection, which includes favorites
such as Myst and Star Wars Rebel Assault. It's a fine package
-but it may still be racing a bit too far ahead of the technological
curve to justify its price.

At this point, the benefits of the 8X CD-ROM drive haven't quite
been realized. There's an advantage to using an 8X device,
but the real boost in speed comes in file transfer, not file
access.

The 1,200-kilobyte-per-second transfer rate dramatically speeds
the time it takes to transfer information from a CD-ROM to
your hard drive. On a Pentium-based Packard Bell Legend 814CD
PC, for example, the Diamond CD-ROM drive transferred 125 MB
of information in two minutes and 25 seconds; Packard Bell's
quad-speed CD-ROM drive took three minutes and 38 seconds.

But when we used the drive for research, we found no big difference
in search performance. And most game software today is still
designed for double-speed drives.

If the idea of installing a multimedia upgrade kit sends shivers
down your spine, the Diamond package may confirm your worst
fears. Plugging in the hardware components is easy enough,
but configuring the essential driver software took several
calls to Diamond Multimedia's courteous technical-support department.

Although the box says the kit complies with the Plug-and-Play
standard, we needed new drivers to install it under Windows
95--and even then it took a close reading of a one-page addendum
to the manual to finish the job. San Jose, Calif.-based Diamond
Multimedia offers no toll-free support, so your long-distance
company will determine what any similar problems will cost
you.

Should you spring for an 8X CD-ROM drive? It all depends on
how much you're willing to pay today--in time and money--to
get a jump on tomorrow's technology.

$599 (Windows 3.1, Windows 95) from Diamond Multimedia, (800)
468-5846, (408) 325-7000.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: Color costs a smidge, 
but print may smudge

By:
Michael J. Zulich

Lexmark Color Jetprinter 1020

Color ink jet printer

2 stars

Lexmark International is one of the companies now making inexpensive
color printing a reality. Unfortunately, the company's latest
entry, the Color Jetprinter 1020, sacrifices a little too much
performance for pizzazz.

Lexmark packs this ink jet printer with alluring features such
as 600-by-300-dpi color resolution, a 100-page input tray,
CorelDraw 3 on CD-ROM, and ColorFine 2, Lexmark's multifaceted
Windows driver. Two ink cartridges, a black one for text and
a cyan-magenta-yellow combination for color, are included with
the machine, as is a handy cartridge holder to keep the unused
ink moist. And installation is a breeze: Just connect the printer
to a PC, plug in the power cord, install the ink and the drivers,
and start printing. Lexmark provides illustrated instructions,
but you probably won't even need them. The printer drivers
come on one disk; installation requires little more than typing
setup.

In fact, the drivers may be the printer's standout feature.
They give you control over many functions, including resolution,
print quality, paper type, color use and image handling (an
automatic option helps if you'd rather not make all those decisions).
A pop-up window displays print-job status and ink level. If
your PC has a sound card, you'll even get spoken warnings if
something's wrong. Try to print without paper or with the wrong
ink cartridge installed, for example, and the software tells
you there's a problem; detailed, context-sensitive on-screen
help will guide you as you make the necessary corrections.

Unfortunately, these features are far more impressive than the
printer's performance. It outputs only about two text pages
per minute in automatic mode; that's too slow for our taste.
The print speed picks up by only about 15 to 20 percent in
draft mode, which appears to be primarily an ink-saving measure.

Text quality on plain paper was fuzzy using the automatic mode,
but it cleared up when we used heavier--and more expensive
-cotton-bond paper. Color images fared better; we saw just
the slightest banding, and dither patterns (the small ink dots
that make up the colors of a picture) were barely noticeable.
The Jetprinter accepted all kinds of paper and envelopes without
a hitch, but the ink was prone to smearing when moist.

The Color Jetprinter 1020 deserves high praise for its terrific
driver, and the price is nice. But if performance is the deciding
factor when you shop, its mediocre print quality and slow output
may take too big a toll.

$226 (Windows 3.1) from Lexmark International, (800) 358-5835,
(606) 232-2000.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: Net telephones today? 
You make the call

By:
John Eckhouse

 
Jabra-net

PC phone and headset

2 stars

The Jabra-net promises to turn your PC into a convenient hands
free telephone. It's a marvelous engineering feat, but the
effort it takes to get the necessary software to work may undermine
its general--and practical--appeal.

The Jabra-net plugs into your PC's sound card and provides excellent
sound quality. Using it with the Jabra Ear Phone, which contains
both a speaker and a microphone in one extremely small, lightweight
piece, makes the Jabra-net far less annoying to use than a
typical telephone headset. It's also a lot handier than using
a microphone and speakers for your phone calls.

With a Sound Blaster-compatible sound card and TAPI-compatible
modem (the Telephony Application Programmers Interface, a fairly
new standard, allows a modem to handle both voice and data
at the same time), you can use the Ear Phone and included PC
Phone software to dial and answer your telephone directly from
your computer. Or, you can make virtually free long-distance
calls around the world via VocalTec's Internet Phone software
(to use it, you need an account with an Internet service provider)

We received calls from Germany, Israel and Maryland through
the Internet software; the sound quality was fine on the domestic
call, but voices broke up frequently during international conversations.
In addition, it's a half-duplex system, which means it's more
akin to a walkie-talkie than a telephone--only one person can
talk at a time.

And for all the comforts of its Ear Phone system, Jabra seems
to know far too little about the software it packs in the box,
or the modems and sound cards that make the product work. We
ran into vexing installation problems with both a new TAPI
modem and the PC Phone software, but neither Jabra, the PC
Phone technicians, nor the modem maker would take responsibility
for solving all the difficulties we described over the (standard)
telephone. After six hours of struggle and repeated calls for
help, we were unable to get the PC Phone software to work under
either Windows 3.1 or Windows 95.

It doesn't minimize Jabra's accomplishments to say its ambitious
product may need a little more seasoning before it's ready
for a wide audience. But you might want to let the evolving
technical pieces fall into place before you lend the Jabra
net system an ear.

$99 (Windows 3.1) from Jabra, (800) 327-2230, (619) 622-0764.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: 
CD-R backup seems a little ahead of its time

By:
Oliver Rist

Hewlett-Packard SureStore 4020i CD-Writer

CD-Recordable storage device

2 1/2 stars

With the SureStore 4020i CD-Writer, Hewlett-Packard is introducing
recordable-CD technology to consumers for use as a backup or
extra storage device. But a $1,099 price tag and serious configuration
snags with SCSI drives make it unlikely the product will be
welcome in most homes anytime soon.

The AdvanSys SCSI adapter card that ships with the SureStore
fully complies with the Plug-and-Play standard. If your computer
has Windows 95 and an IDE hard drive, you probably won't face
major conflicts. No such luck if your system has a SCSI hard
drive: The SureStore doesn't work with all SCSI controllers,
and installation can result in stubborn snags.

The SureStore comes with two blank 650-megabyte CD-R discs ($16
apiece), but it does not provide the rails that slide it into
a computer's drive bay, nor an MPC audio connector, which you'll
need if you want to hear sound. Both are essential.

The SureStore's quad-speed disc-reading functions worked well
in our tests, with performance comparable to typical CD-ROM
drives. HP includes a utility that lets you play audio CDs,
and Mag-ic Lantern software, which lets you view Kodak Photo
CDs.

But recording to a CD isn't so straightforward. HP ships three
applications that use the drive's capability: Alchemy Personal
is a file-retrieval database that works with either your hard
drive or a CD. Easy-CD is a simple file recorder for CD-R devices;
it performs well as long as you're copying a relatively small
number of files from your hard drive to the SureStore--but
if you're copying data from a CD-ROM to the device, you'll
have to copy the files onto your hard drive first.

Finally, Easy-CD Audio will record any songs you select from
a regular audio CD onto your hard drive, then copy them to
a CD-R. But if you're thinking about pirating your favorite
music CDs, think again: You'd have to convert the audio tracks
into .wav files, which won't run on an audio-only CD player.

$1,099 (Windows 3.1) from Hewlett-Packard, (800) 810-0134, (415)
857-1501.

PC phone's a real conversation piece

By:
Julie Cohen

AT&T Computer Telephone 8130

PC phone

2 1/2 stars

If you want to use a PC as a phone center but don't need a system
as cutting-edge as the Jabra-net, consider AT&T's Computer
Telephone 8130, the first traditional style phone to connect to a
PC.

The 8130 looks like a standard business phone with a few extra
cords in the back--two connect to wall jacks, one hooks up
to your computer's serial port, and one connects to an electrical
outlet. The two-line speakerphone sports an LCD showing the
date, time, and caller's name or telephone number (if you've
subscribed to Caller ID). You can program up to 18 phone numbers
in its memory and make conference calls, too.

But what makes the phone special is its PC connection. Attach
the standard 9-pin serial cable, install AT&T's call-log software,
and you've got a mechanized receptionist. Every time you place
or receive a call, the log will store the date, time, duration
and phone number. Jot down conversation highlights with the
note-taking feature, and you have a handy record of the exchange.
You can also sort the information at your computer by name,
phone number or date.

The software comes with a phone directory that lets you store
information on up to 5,000 contacts; you can dial any of them
instantly at the click of a button.

This phone is purely a home product; it requires an analog phone
jack and does not work with the digital phone systems common
in offices--say, one that requires you to dial 9 to access
an outside line. And if you don't need extensive record-keeping
capabilities, you don't need the Computer Telephone 8130. But
for folks with a free serial port and a need to keep detailed
notes, it'll get you off the hook in style.

$199 (Windows 3.1) from AT&T, (800) 233-2650, (201) 581-3000.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: For a design innovator, 
PC style isn't business as usual

By:
Julie Cohen

When Acer America and Packard Bell decided they wanted their
new computers to look like they belonged in a stylish home
rather than a sterile office, each turned to frogdesign of
Sunnyvale, Calif., the firm that dreamt up the striking looks
for such landmarks of computer style as the Apple IIc and PowerBook.
For these new projects, the firm set out to meet two distinct
design objectives--one internal, the other external.

For Acer, the goal was to make consumers sit up and take notice
of the company's new home computers; frogdesign visualized
a system that would look more like furniture than office equipment.
"People put their PCs all over the place," says design manager
Matt Barthelemy. "It was critical that we design something
that would fit in anywhere in the home." That meant more than
just a smattering of color accents. The final product, the
Acer Aspire 2136, expresses a personality in fresh shapes,
bold colors and innovative proportions. The desktop version's
monitor and CPU fit together for an integrated look that sidesteps
limits imposed by traditional all-in-one systems; the mini
tower version sports so many playful touches--from a rounded
front to cute little feet--it might remind you of a silly seal
hamming it up to please a crowd at the aquarium.

While Acer focused on presenting a friendly face to the outside
world, Packard Bell wanted to reorganize its computer's internal
components to achieve revolutionary efficiency in its use of
space. The Multimedia Corner Computer frees up valuable real
estate on cluttered desktops. According to frogdesign project
leader Gadi Amit, the Packard Bell line was inspired by the
functions of multimedia; frogdesign cleverly hit on a form
that calls to mind an amphitheater, with speakers and components
built around a cylindrical shape.

Despite the seemingly radical new designs, Amit says his firm
knows there are limits to what computer shoppers will accept
when it comes to high-tech fashion. "There's a threshold we
try not to pass," he says. "Some of our best designs stay right
here."

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: 'Stripping' 
PCs to drive down prices

By:
Keith Kirkpatrick

Today, buying a home computer usually means spending at least
$1,500. But if companies such as Sun Microsystems, Oracle and
Apple Computer follow through with plans to introduce systems
designed for easy Internet access--and little else--you might
be able to buy a PC for $500.

Sun believes the Internet is the backbone of tomorrow's desktop
and is developing budget-priced machines with very small hard
drives; the company is betting you'll soon be able to download
any key computing resource from the Internet rather than store
it locally. The devices would work with the Sun-developed Java
programming language, which enables small applications to reside
in cyberspace. The idea is that you'd download such "applets"
and use them for as long as need them; when you're done, they'd
disappear from your hard drive.

Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, meanwhile, has announced his company's
intention to introduce a "Network Computer"--which will support
word processing, e-mail and Internet browsing--early this year.
The machine will have no hard drive, floppy drive or applications,
with all programs coming from the Internet. Similarly, Apple's
forthcoming Pippin system will function as a nontechnical "appliance"
that can run CD-ROM titles and use Internet services--but won't
be compatible with either Macintoshes or PCs. Apple had not
set a U.S. release date for Pippin when we went to press.

1995 - OH, WHAT A YEAR IT WAS!  THE INDUSTRY WAS ON A SHAKEDOWN RUN

By Mitchell M. Badler, Contributing Editor

     For all those in the imaging/workflow market who have been
predicting the big shakeout in the industry, 1995 was the year in
which they finally looked like prophets.  Acquisitions,
consolidations and alliances were the order of the day,
particularly since the big Association for Information and Image
Management (AIIM) Show last April in San Francisco.  More than two
dozen significant acquisitions, mergers or alliances were announced
and/or consummated in the last nine months of the year, and those
on what looked like an accelerating schedule.

     Wang's imaging and workflow agreement with Microsoft Corp. was
the biggest event of the year.  By putting its image viewer and
image controls into Microsoft's Windows 95, Wang pulled off a coup
that eventually can make imaging a "commodity" product.  The
arrangement provides significant marketing advantages for Wang as
its imaging products will be linked with Microsoft's operating
systems.

     The following were some (but not all) of the other major
developments of 1995 that will have effects on both vendors and
users into 1996 and beyond.

The Merger/Acquisition Dance

     *    Wang Laboratories Inc.'s acquisition of Sigma Imaging
Systems.  This was another big plus for Wang, transferring the
successful Unisys/Sigma alliance to Wang and giving it access to
Sigma's solid installed base.  It gave Wang's enterprise imaging
strategy a big boost, at a relatively low cost.  At year-end, Wang
announced a planned acquisition of Avail Systems to add
hierarchical storage management software capability.

     *    FileNet's acquisition of Watermark Software Inc.  The
latter retains its name and operates as a wholly owned subsidiary,
but the deal is beneficial to both companies.  In 1996 Watermark
clients will have access to FileNet IMS repositories and FileNet
clients will be able to migrate documents to the Watermark server. 
Not far down the line, the two companies will offer users access to
repositories on both servers.

     *    IBM Corp.'s acquisition of Lotus Development Corp.  This
was IBM's response to the Wang/Microsoft alliance.  IBM plans to
leverage Lotus Notes with its own workflow and imaging strategy. 
It should strengthen IBM's position in enterprise imaging and
workflow.

     *    Caere Corp.'s acquisitions, first of Calera Recognition
Systems Inc. and then of ViewStar Corp.  The former consolidated
two of the industry's leading optical character recognition (OCR)
vendors and put Caere on the road to dominating the market, with
hoped-for revenues of $100 million in the near future.  The latter
acquisition helps Caere extend beyond the desktop market.  ViewStar
continues under its own name, but by late 1996 look for Caere
offerings to be more fully integrated into ViewStar products. 
Caere also bought 20 percent of ZyLab, a leader in full-text
retrieval and indexing.  Combining full-text retrieval with OCR
allows expanding Caere to provide a more complete solution.

     *    Kofax Image Products' announced acquisition of LaserData. 
This expands Kofax's offerings by adding storage management
components to complement its Ascent line of image capture and
viewing software.

     *    BancTec's acquisition of Recognition International.  It
was driven by several factors:  a need for consolidation in the
item-remittance processing field where BancTec's competitors are
giants such as AT&T Global Information Systems, IBM Corp. and
Unisys Corp., and a concomitant need to broaden its product line
and to expand its markets, domestically and internationally.

     *    TMS Inc.'s acquisition of Sequoia Data Corp.  This deal,
announced in October, will create a product and services provider
with more than $5 million in revenue as well as a record of
profitable growth.

     *    The merger of Excalibur Technologies Corp. and ConQuest
Software, with Excalibur as the survivor.  The product lines of the
text retrieval and document management companies were retained but
sales resources were pooled in some markets.

     *    Cornerstone Imaging's acquisition of Pegasus Disk
Technologies.  Buying the producer of file and volume management
software for CD-ROM, CD-R, WORM (write once, read many) and
rewritable optical disk drives and jukeboxes advanced Cornerstone's
goal of dominating imaging's peripheral technology markets.

     *    The merger of ImageFast Software Systems and Compusearch
Software into a new entity, Compusearch Software Systems, typified
some of the mergers of smaller software firms.

Alliances as Well as Acquisitions

     1995 also was a big year for alliances.  Instead of joining at
the hip, many organizations wanted to keep their own identities and
strategies but knew they needed assistance either to grow or to
survive.  As already noted, the big development of the year was
Wang/Microsoft.  Other significant alliances entered into during
1995 were:

     *    The Eastman Kodak Co., Wang Laboratories Inc. and Imagery
distribution and development agreement.  This enabled Kodak to
re-enter the market by reselling Wang's image, workflow and
computer output to laser disk (COLD) products.  At the same time,
Wang  agreed to integrate Kodak's peripherals.  This strengthened
everyone's distribution position.

     *    FileNet and Novell Inc.'s distribution/development
agreement that will result in three workflow products.  Visual
Workflo for NetWare, a shared database product that ties into
FileNet's workflow software, will be distributed later this year. 
Also to be available this year are Ensemble Discovery Edition, an
electronic mail-based document workflow, and Ensemble, an
e-mail-based graphical workflow product.

     *    Unisys' strategic partnership with Wang.  This gives each
added distribution channels and plugs holes in existing product and
systems lineups.  Both companies come closer to each being a
single-source provider for its existing customers.  Unisys also
entered into a Master Sales Agreement with IdentiTech Inc. that
will help broaden its marketing base.

     *    AT&T Global Information Systems' partnership with Fiserv
for AT&T/GIS to market the software products offered by Fiserv's
Image Integration Business Unit.  This is part of AT&T/GIS' push to
become a one-stop provider of imaging services.

     *    Alpharel Inc.'s agreement with Control Data Systems Inc.
for the latter to integrate Alpharel's line of document imaging
into solutions for Control Data customers worldwide.

     *    Keyfile's alliance with Microsoft.  This will provide
seamless integration of Keyfile's workflow technology into the
Microsoft Exchange Server.  That opens up markets for Keyfile it
might not have reached otherwise.

     *    Action Technologies' agreements with PC DOCS, Saros and
Novell Soft-Solutions to offer Action Workflow DocRoute.  This
provides customers of all four firms with advanced client/server
workflow functionality by combining Action's client/server workflow
capabilities with complementary document managing offerings from
the other vendors.

     *    The integration of Informative Graphics' Myriad document
viewing software with Documentum's Enterprise client/server
Document Management System (EDMS) typified product integration
actions taken by some of the independent software providers. 
Typical of market-expanding alliances was one entered into by
Rimage with MultiMedia Masters & Machinery (4M) of Switzerland. 
Under that agreement, Rimage will market 4M's CD-ROM production
systems in North and South America while 4M continues to market on
its own in Europe and Asia.

What's Behind the Urge to Merge?

     A major cause of the shakeout in the industry was the
existence of too many companies for the size of the imaging
business, which still has not achieved the soaring altitudes
forecast for many years.  Not enough of the competitors were making
money.

     Thus, in some instances the acquisitions resulted from the
financial weaknesses of the players.  Despite having excellent
products, they needed deep pockets to be able to grow and/or stay
in business.  This was the case with ViewStar, which needed
financing.  In some allied situations it was because founders or
backers of pioneering firms apparently decided it was time to
"harvest" the fruits of their efforts.  That appeared to hold true
with Calera.  Before its acquisition by Caere, industry rumors had
Calera's venture capital backers impatiently waiting for a big
return.

     Then there were situations in which cost savings were a major
consideration.  The BancTec/Recognition International deal is
expected to result in cost savings of $25 million to $30 million. 
It also gave acquirer BancTec expanded international coverage.

     Sometimes a merger occurred because a deal was too good to
turn down.  FileNet's acquisition of Watermark sounded like one. 
The latter retained its identity and still got more than $60
million.  And, of course, IBM's $3.3 billion offer for Lotus was
the best example of a sweet deal.

     But there also were other factors pushing consolidations. 
These included a drive for market share, sometimes in one segmented
market, sometimes across the board;  rapid migration of older
systems to new platforms; the geometric acceleration of technology
typified by groupware's impact on workflow and its effects on
individual vendors; the glut of providers in some areas,
particularly software.  Finally, a number of the consolidations
late in the year probably were reactions to the Wang/Microsoft and
IBM/Lotus actions.

The Meaning for Users

     The various consolidations and alliances signal the rapid
maturing of the imaging/workflow marketplace.  For users, the
effect is positive.  Inevitably the multiplicity of vendors creates
confusion and caution.  The user sometimes wonders - with good
reason - how long a vendor will be around.  That raises questions
of technical follow-up and product obsolescence without an upward
migration path.  Vendor viability and reliability is becoming more
and more critical.  The emergence of powerful industry leaders -
fewer but still strong - is reassuring to users looking at future
purchases and hoping to protect current and past investments.

     Whether the urge to merge will result in decreased competition
(because of fewer players) or increased competition (from stronger
survivors) is yet to be answered.  How that turns out will affect
the questions of pricing and user cost.  But stronger players
should provide the base for faster development of improved
products.  The trick may be giving the user market time to absorb
and digest these continually upgraded products and systems while
earning a reasonable pay-back on investments in imaging/workflow
solutions.

CORPORATE COMMUNICATION GETS BOOST FROM 'INTRANETS'

By Robert D. Lamb, Associate Editor

     There was a time when most corporations didn't have elaborate
private telephone systems installed in their office buildings - but
they did have access to the public telephone system.  Those
employees with permission to use the company phone could call
clients, call home, call anyone outside the office building who had
a telephone.  But to contact someone inside the building required
a somewhat less technological means of communication.

     But necessity - or convenience (it amounts to the same) - is
the mother of invention, so it was inevitable that sooner or later
someone somewhere would come up with the brilliant idea to build a
miniature Ma Bell in the cloak room and connect it to a bunch of
telephones throughout the building.  Voila!  A private telephone
network was born!

     Something similar is happening to the Internet today.

     Corporations that have had access to the public computer
network have been using it to access and distribute public
documents and other information for several years now.  During the
past year and a half, however, Internet access has become an
essential part of the corporate infrastructure, due largely to the
exploding popularity of the World Wide Web, whose easy-to-use,
graphical interface has thrust the art of information distribution
into the mass culture spotlight.  Everyone - from Eastman Kodak Co.
(http://www.kodak.com) and ITR's publisher, BRP Publications Inc.
(http://brp.com), all the way down to Uncle Bob
(http://gagme.wwa.com/~boba/kidslinks.html) and the Geek of the
Week (http://csl04.cs.tamu. edu/ITR/geek.readme) - seems to have a
home page on the Web, and the sites are becoming increasingly
sophisticated while remaining shamelessly simple to use.

     But even more exciting:  The software used to view documents
over the Web is dirt cheap, and it doesn't matter what computer
platform you're using.

     Sooner or later, it was inevitable that someone, somewhere
would realize that a document coded with hypertext markup language
(HTML) can be viewed with any Web browser regardless of its
location - whether it was stored on a publicly accessible Web
server in Taiwan, on the hard drive in a desktop computer, or on
any computer connected to a company's private local area network
(LAN).  Why not, it eventually was asked, use this great new
technology to improve internal corporate communication?  Voila!  An
"Intranet" was born!

Granddaddy of Web Embraces Intranet Concept

     Netscape Communications Corp., the company that makes the
granddaddy of all Web browsers, the Netscape Navigator, also
provides server software, application development tools, security
software and management systems for Internet documents, Web sites
and other such applications.  Despite the fact that all of its
products are designed for use on or with the (very public)
Internet, the company itself for years has been using them in a
private setting for internal communications.

     But it wasn't until last spring that Netscape realized there
might be a market for such uses of its products and actually began
marketing its Internet products as Intranet products - software and
systems that can be used on any transmission control
protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) network for private
applications - and by then, many of its customers already had set
up their own Web servers and deployed their own Intranets.  Today,
more than 60 Fortune 100 companies are using Netscape products for
Intranet applications, according to a company spokeswoman, and
Netscape expects at least half of its sales to come from the
"behind-the-firewall" Intranet sector in the near future, she said.

     Last month, in fact, Netscape agreed to license its browser,
Netscape Commerce Server, and its Netscape Communications Server to
Open Text Corp. of Waterloo, Ontario, for use in the latter's new
Latitude Intranet System product suite.  Like its Internet sibling,
Latitude enables users to build, maintain and access electronic
documents and information using Internet technology (ITR, Oct. 9,
p. 7).

     "Intranets are the fastest-growing segment of the World Wide
Web," said Open Text President Tom Jenkins when the agreement with
Netscape was announced, "because they provide a convenient,
low-cost, high-impact communications channel."  A Forrester
Research analyst, John Robb, added that Forrester's Computing
Strategy Service expects Intranets "to become a substantial market
because they allow decentralized access to distributed,
business-critical information."

Re-Marketing Internet Products

     As corporations increasingly are discovering this, software
and hardware developers are falling all over themselves trying to
re-market their Internet products as Intranet "solutions."  In one
of the more dramatic examples of this, Attachmate Corp. - which has
dubbed itself "The Intranet Company" - a week ago announced that it
has completed its acquisition of The Wollongong Group Inc. 
Wollongong, whose name has been synonymous with TCP/IP
internetworking technology for more than 15 years, now operates as
an Attachmate subsidiary - but is known as the Intranet Products
Group.

     Attachmate's new "Intranet Products Group" plans to release
three Windows-based products during the first calendar quarter of
this year:  Emissary Workgroup, "for complete Internet/Intranet Web
conferencing, browsing, publishing, searching, tracking and
document management," according to the company's announcement;
Emissary Host Publishing System; and Emissary Intranet/Internet
Services, which will provide support and consulting services to
companies building an Intranet or developing an Internet site.

     Other companies, such as Quarterdeck Corp. and Cuadra
Associates, also recently have released Web software - oddly,
Quarterdeck's product is called "WebSTAR" and Cuadra's is called
"STAR/Web."  Neither of these products is being touted primarily as
an Internet product:  Both clearly are targeted to the Intranet
sector.

     Quarterdeck's WebSTAR for Windows 95/NT, formerly known as
WebServer 32, is a turnkey, scalable Intranet server that is "also
powerful enough" to run a public Web site, said Emerick Woods, vice
president and general manager of Quarterdeck's Internet
Applications unit.  Cuadra's STAR/Web is a common gateway interface
(CGI) program that connects the Cuadra STAR information management
software to standard commercial Web servers to enable employees to
retrieve information from large corporate databases.  Much of the
press release announcing STAR/Web reads like an essay on how
Internet technology is being used "for strictly private use on ...
internal [corporate] networks for in-house communications and
information storage and retrieval."

     As 1995 was the year the Internet exploded onto the public
scene, 1996 is likely to be the year that all the technology
developed for the Internet will be repurposed and quietly make its
way into the private scene.

KODAK GRANTED 772 PATENTS IN 1995

     Eastman Kodak Co. was ranked ninth among the top 10 companies
in the world in terms of the number of patents awarded in 1995. 
According to an annual listing published by IFI/Plenum Data Co.,
Kodak received a total of 772 patents last year, down from 890 in
1994, when the imaging company was ranked No. 8; the decline is
attributable to Kodak's divestitures in 1994.

     Dr. James W. Meyer, Kodak's chief technical officer, said the
ranking is "a tribute to the company's scientific and technical
staff and a measure of the company's commitment to innovation and
product leadership."  Kodak conducts its research and development
activities in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom
and the United States.

     Of the three U.S. companies listed in IFI's top 10, two--Kodak
and IBM Corp.--were companies involved in the imaging/document
management industries.  The third was Motorola Corp.

Will 1996 Turn Out to be the YEAR OF THE GHOST SITE?

     Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates has been known to be right
on the money, and in his latest book, "The Road Ahead," his analogy
that compares the Internet and multimedia feeding frenzy to the
American gold rush may be a harbinger of things to come.

     Unfortunately, as a new study by International Data Corp.
(IDC) notes, after the gold ran dry in the 1800s, ghost towns were
left behind.  The research and consulting firm predicts that 1996
will be a "year of disappointment" for investors and corporations
in the online marketplace, reflecting sluggish development of a
significant consumer base.  In addition, 20 percent of the Fortune
500 companies that have commercial Web sites will close or stop
maintaining them, resulting in "ghost sites."

     IDC also said the leading online information service providers
such as CompuServe Inc., America Online Inc., Prodigy Services Co.
and the Microsoft Network will realize more than 50 percent of
their revenues from offering access to the World Wide Web by the
middle of 1997, and that two of the four services will struggle for
survival.

     "Though we predict the overall growth in online subscribers
will continue to be very strong, we expect 1996 will show a high
turnover rate as users underwhelmed by the content on the Web
cancel their subscriptions and turn on their TVs," said Frank Gens,
senior vice president of research at IDC.  "Still, 1996 will be a
strategic investment year for businesses that expect to compete in
the growing electronic marketplace, because during the next five
years, the number of wired (i.e., online) users will rise to more
than 200 million, and by 2010, it will exceed 1 billion."

     Financial services companies, retailers and publishers will
bail out in the initial "hangover" period, Gens said, leaving the
door wide open for new leadership and the downfall of current
giants.  However, IDC predicts Microsoft will have a great 1996,
and its revenue will not be affected by potentially weaker holds on
the industry it may have with technology such as object linking and
embedding (OLE) and Visual Basic.

     Gens also forecasts that manufacturers of Internet appliances,
which allow users to access online information, will slash prices
in half by the end of 1996.  "The game console crowd is already
slicing away at the pricing for simple Web surfing devices," he
said.  "Within two years, Internet appliances will emerge as
giveaways - [from] less than $100 to free - by businesses that want
customers to access their online services."

     IDC is at (508) 935-4282 or http://www.idcresearch.com.

GATF RELEASES LONG-AWAITED SKILLS STANDARDS

The Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (GATF) released the
first two long-awaited books from the National Skills
Standards Project.

The Skill Standards Project was initiated in 1992 to develop
skill standards for education and training for the printing
industry. The first two standards, one on prepress/imaging,
and one on press, are now available. The finishing and
distribution skill standard will be available shortly.

Forty industry representatives of graphic arts firms,
associations, union, and education were members of the Project
Policy Committee that directed the project. Over 1,200
industry practitioners from throughout the U.S. spent hundreds
of hours developing and validating the standards.

This Skills Standards Project was funded by the U.S.
Department of Education (DOE). One half of the $516,127 grant
was received at the start of the project in 1992, while the
balance was funded by the DOE in March of 1994.

The skill standards grants were originally launched by the
Bush Administration. The Clinton Administration then included
the skill standards project as-a key part of its Goals 2000
initiative act which was signed into law in March of 1994.
The legislation includes provisions to establish a National
Skill Standards Board to oversee the implementation of
voluntary industry-based skill standards.

Initially, the printing industry was only one of seven
industries designated for a skills study of such magnitude,
but since the GATF project began, funding has been made
available to fifteen additional industries by the DOE and the
Department of Labor (DOL). Some of the other industries
include travel and tourism, computer-aided drafting,
biotechnical sciences, health science and technology,
electronics, retail trade, and metalworking.

The skills standards are available for sale for $20 each, or
you may order all three standards for $49. To order copies,
please contact the GATF Order Department at 412/621-6941. You
may also send requests by fax to 412/621-6598, or by mail to
4615 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.

NEW "LAMINART" PACKAGING PROCESS INCORPORATES
GRAPHICS INTO VHS SHELL CONSTRUCTION

Introducing "Laminart," a patented new process which bonds
high quality paper board printed graphics directly onto the
videocassette shell. It is available as a service from Oracle
Packaging in Toledo Ohio. Graphic treatments from black and
white to full color can be incorporated on all five sides of
the cassette shell, allowing over 57 square inches of
printable area on each shell, that will stay with it for its
entire life.

Laminart videocassettes are perfect for high-use use
applications like children's releases, as well as product
introduction videos, mass mailings and mixed media promotions.
Laminart lowers costs in many areas including production,
printing, packaging, and shipping. Minimalist packaging, is a
ID popular concept with environmentalists and manufacturers
alike. Laminart meets these requirements like few products
can. The package becomes the product.

Laminart gives video duplication companies an additional
product offering and provides customer benefits which can
result in larger production runs with lower shipping costs.
They are an economical alternative to conventional sleeves or
as an image enhancement to the overall package. Laminart uses
most of the cassette shell without compromising the strength
of the cassette itself. They are used for video press
releases, limited edition movie releases, premiums, training
films, rentals, direct to consumer fulfillment programs and
more. Technicolor, the world's largest video duplicator, is
licensed by Oracle to use the Laminart shell.

For a free sample of Laminart and a demonstration video,

TIFFEN DEVELOPING DIGITAL CAMERA
FILTERS FOR KODAK'S CINEON SYSTEM

Tiffen Manufacturing has introduced a powerful new series of
computer tools for cinematographers. In conjunction with
Eastman Kodak Company, Tiffen's new digital division, Tiffen
Digital, is developing computer software that will digitally
replicate the effects of its popular camera filters.  "It will
be offered as a component for digital compositing and
retouching software used with Cineon digital film
workstations," said CEO Steven Tiffen.

"This is another bridge linking motion picture film with the
most advanced digital postproduction techniques," said Mike
Inchalik, Cineon Products General Manager. "The development of
this software will enable cinematographers to digitally filter
images in postproduction, using a standard format and
terminology they will find familiar and predictable."

During the first phase of this development program, the new
software will emulate Tiffen's line of color filters. During
phase two, digital software emulating the company's diffusion,
(including ProMist and Soft FX), fog and contrast effects
filters will be created.

"The challenge has been one of translation and
transformation," said Marty Ollstein, who heads Tiffen
Digital. "Film images and digital images represent color and
other characteristics in fundamentally different ways. We've
analyzed reams of information, and have generated algorithms
that precisely replicate the effects of the Tiffen filters."

"During postproduction, cinematographers will be able to say,
'I'd like to warm up the skin tones with a tobacco filter
while leaving the rest of the scene alone," said Kodak
Application Specialist Carlo Hume. "During preproduction,
tests can be shot clean, and then auditioned with an infinite
variety of filter combinations to determine a look. Filters
can be combined without losing stops on the set as well."

"Tiffen and Kodak both have long histories in providing
innovative imaging technologies which serve the needs of
cinematographers," said Ollstein, a cinematographer and
director himself. "This is a natural next step in the
evolution of the marriage between film and digital imaging
technologies."

KODAK UNVEILS NEW FORMAT FOR KEYKODE NUMBERS 65 MM FILMS

Kodak has modified the machine-readable edgeprint on all of
the company's 65 mm camera and intermediate films. Eastman
Keykode numbers are now encoded at 120 perforation intervals
instead of 80.

"This will enable software developers to write efficient and
accurate programs for conforming the negative to video Edit
Decision Lists (EDL) in all four 65 mm formats," said Robert
Woolman, General Manager of Worldwide marketing and Vice
President, Motion Picture and Television Imaging. "Producers
of movie rides and other 65 mm movies can now take full
advantage of non-linear video editing systems in
postproduction."

Woolman explained that Kodak manufactures 65 mm film with
Keykode numbers compatible with all frame lengths -- five,
eight, 10 and 15 perforations - to accommodate the needs of
producers who create movie rides and other content for
special venue theaters. The five perforation 65 mm frame is
generally used to produce theatrical features and films for
the Showscan process. The longer 65 mm frames are typically
used to produce films in IMAX, lwerks and other large formats
for theaters at theme parks, museums and other special venue
attractions.

Kodak introduced Eastman Keykode in 1989. Basically, it is a
machine-readable barcode which replicates the human-readable
key numbers. The latter have been used by assistant editors
and negative cutters for decades to conform negative to the
editing done on workprints. It is a tedious and time-consuming
procedure subject to occasional human error. With Keykode
numbers, the barcode data captured during telecine transfer
provides a frame-accurate address for conforming cuts made
during editing.

Woolman explained that it is a complex procedure because film
for projection is typically exposed at 24 frames per second,
while the NTSC television system transmits and displays 30
frames per second. The telecine transfer process accommodates
this difference by converting every 24 film frames into 30
video frames. The introduction of Keykode numbers required the
development of computer software which tracks this difference
in frame rate when EDLs are provided to negative cutters and
assistant editors.

"Initially, we perceived Keykode numbers as an enabling tool
which allowed television film producers to take full advantage
of the breakthroughs occurring in electronic postproduction,"
said Woolman. "Film programs could be transferred to video for
postproduction. Keykode numbers enabled producers to simplify
the process of cutting the negative to conform to video
editing. We said at the time that the evolution of this
computer- based technology would be driven by the needs of the
marketplace."

During the past several years, with the evolution of
non-linear digital editing systems developed by Avid,
Lightworks and other companies, many feature films and
commercials have been edited electronically using Keykode
numbers to simplify negative cutting. "Many feature film
producers are now taking full advantage of the most advanced
digital editing technology," Woolman observed. "However,
producers who choose to work in the largest film format,
haven't had this option."

Crest National Video Tape and Film Labs, in Los Angeles, took
a major step toward building a technology bridge for 65 mm
film producers. The company modified a Rank-Cintel telecine
for high-quality transfer of 65 mm film to video for off-line
editing. They call this service Ultrascan HR. The modified
telecine is capable of scanning any 65 mm film and capturing
Keykode data in the process.

Jon Truckenmiller, vice president of engineering for Crest,
said that Ultrascan HR can be used to transfer 337 feet of the
largest (15-perforations per frame) film per minute at 1,100
lines of resolution. This enables them to make comparatively
high-resolution video dailies.

"We can now convert the telecine transfer to D-1 format and
transmit it directly to the postproduction facility," said
Truckenmiller "Avid has customized Media Composer digital
workstations used at the Sony Studios postproduction facility
for this purpose."

Truckenmiller said, "This means that a producer working at a
remote location -- say Africa or Australia -- can ship their
film overnight by air to a lab in Los Angeles. The lab can
generally process the film by noon, and deliver the negative
to us. Chances are that we will be able to transfer the film,
ship a video daily to the producer via satellite or air
express, convert the video to D-1 format, and transmit the
data to the postproduction facility, all in that same day. The
editor can be working on the film within 24 to 48 hours of
the time it was shot halfway around the world."

The missing link, Truckenmiller said, was the ability to
develop computer software for conforming 65 mm negative in the
15-perf format, to a video edit decision list. He said the 80
perforation interval on 65 mm camera film wasn't compatible.

"We needed a bar code interval which is evenly divisible by
five, eight, 10 and 15," he explained. "That would allow
software developers to create a program which is compatible
with all four 65 mm formats. We calculated that Keykode
numbers printed every 120 perforations would be the best
solution. We asked Kodak for their support." Kodak verified
this is a feasible solution, and they also provided
information and sample footage for evaluation to more than 30
producers, film labs, software developers and postproduction
facilities. Kodak also added a number of other enhancements,
including making the human-readable key numbers larger and
more legible.

"These types of interactions in the engineering community
happen everyday," Woolman said. "They are generally
transparent to filmmakers, yet, they can make a profound
impact on the creative process. In this case, it is now
possible to cut the time and costs required for the
postproduction of many types of special venue films produced
on our largest format film. There are also obvious creative
benefits associated with electronic editing which are now more
available to large format producers. The bottom line is that
this could make it more attractive to produce 65mm films."

DOCUMENT IMAGING STREAMLINES CITY ADMINISTRATION

Cathleen McKay, City Clerk of Ukiah, CA, recently released a
report for a Senior Management project for St. Mary's College
of California, showing how electronic document management has
revolutionized the way the city manages paper. In partial
fulfillment of the requirements for her B.S. degree in
Management, McKay's project documents how Ukiah's
newly-installed electronic document imaging system
significantly benefits the administration and the taxpayer.
Replacing the City's tedious, trouble-prone and
time-consuming manual system with a high-tech, cost and time-
effective electronic solution, McKay has ushered in the
future.

Questys Text & Image Management System, developed by Decision
Management Company, Inc. (DMC) of Laguna Hills, CA, was the
system chosen to manage Ukiah's exhaustive records.  Because
of its user-friendliness and sub-second full-text search
engine, the system is helping the City, along with dozens of
other cities, streamline their administrations.

McKay's planned objective in implementing an electronic system
was to achieve a 50% reduction in the time and space required
to manage Ukiah's records. To her credit, McKay found a 72%
reduction in actual records search, retrieval and copy time,
and a 52% reduction of records in Ukiah's Central File Vault.
In addition, the City Clerk was happy to report that staff
productivity went up, as costs went down-a record request
that used to cost an average of $52.00 of staff time to
search, retrieve and copy now costs the city a mere $1.02.

"It is clear this system will pay for itself within the first
year of operation," said McKay of the nearly $50,000 system.
In addition to the increased productivity and document
security, McKay believes that the system will be a source to
create revenue for the jurisdiction. Estimates show a
potential net cash flow of $56, 557 over a 1.5 year period.

With these favorable findings, McKay has applied for the
International Institute of Municipal Clerks' High Technology
Award. The City Clerk hopes to set an example for other
jurisdictions of an administration that is not only modem and
hi-tech, but also economically and environmentally sound.

WORLD NEUROLOGICAL IMAGING SALES TO GROW
AT 5% RATE, NEAR $3 BILLION BY 2001, LED BY MRI

Led by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and constrained by
cost-control pressures, worldwide sales of neurological
diagnostic imaging systems wig grow from $2.09 billion in 1994
to $2.94 billion by the year 2001 at a 5 percent compound
annual rate, projects a new study just released by Frost &
Sullivan.

MRI's revenue share will rise from 40 percent of the total
market in 1994 to 49 percent in 2001 while that of computed
tomography (CT) dips from 31 to 25 percent and that of X-ray
angiography from 27 to 21 percent in the same period,
forecasts the report, WORLD NEUROLOGICAL DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING
MARKETS.

Other, smaller segments include gamma camera imaging
systems, with 1.3 percent of 1994 market revenues, and
neurosonography and positron emission tomography (PET), with
0.6 of a percent each.

While sophisticated techniques like MRI and spiral CT have
significantly improved rates of successful primary diagnosis,
the refusal of third-party insurers to reimburse many MRI and
all PET procedures have often forced radiologists to choose
less costly imaging modalities.

Budgeting pressures are causing the low end of the imaging
market to grow faster than the high end, placing greater
emphasis on developing neurological applications for
ultrasound, gamma cameras and x-ray angiography. Vendors are
also introducing spiral-capable CT at a mid-range price while
developing lower- cost MRI and PET systems.

The current purchasing environment, which stresses
expenditure justification rather than spending on the latest
technology, has shifted manufacturer marketing focus toward
service as well as cost-effectiveness.

Neurological diagnostic imaging is penetrating increasingly
into the private office market.

WORLDWIDE NUCLEAR IMAGING SALES TO NEARLY DOUBLE
AND REACH $3 BILLION BY 2001, PACED BY ONCOLOGY APPLICATIONS

Paced by growth in oncology applications and new regional
markets, the world nuclear imaging market will nearly double,
growing from $1.57 billion in 1994 to $2.97 billion by the
year 2001 at a 10 percent compound annual rate, projects a new
study just released by Frost & Sullivan.

The dominant radiopharmaceutical agent share will rise from
64 percent of market revenues in 1994 to 69 percent in 2001
while PET explodes from 3 to 8 percent and gamma cameras
decline in share from 33 to 23 percent in the same period,
forecasts the report, WORLD NUCLEAR MEDICAL IMAGING (NMI)
MARKETS.

Manufacturers are trying their buyer base by marketing
products to multiple specialties within hospitals as new
applications emerge in cardiology, neurology and other areas
in addition to oncology.

Doctors using NMI are increasingly taking it upon themselves
to actively promote the technology to other medical
professionals and the general public as nuclear medicine vies
for investment and R&D monies as well as sales with computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Products have recently undergone significant price
reductions, with several models priced at 25 percent less than
their predecessors. Historically the high price of NMI
products inhibited growth in some markets.

The market will expand increasingly to new regions like
China, though barriers of cost and training are blocking
adoption in large parts of the developing world. Although the
U.S. still accounted for a 52 percent majority of worldwide
market revenues in 1994 with Europe the second largest
regional market, manufacturers are increasingly focusing
attention on the Pacific Rim and Latin America. Firms will
market overseas through joint ventures, distributors and
unique alliances. Companies are lowering costs by
manufacturing in regions where both labor and raw materials
are less costly.

PET systems are on the brink of commercialization.
Manufacturers are emphasizing the cost-effectiveness for
cancer management applications of these instruments.

January 1990

WHERE DOES THE U.S. EXPERT SYSTEMS MARKET STAND NOW?

     Once again we have decided to begin the year by trying to
provide our readers with an overview of what happened during the
past year and then to project what we think will happen in the
year ahead.
     As in the past two years, we have used a less than scientific
methodology.  We have asked vendors to give us information on
their sales, their customers, their number of employees, and the
applications they believe their products are being used for.  We
have talked with selected companies that are using expert systems
and asked them what they used in 1989 and what they plan to do in
1990.  We have checked notes that we took in conversations during
the past year, called a few people to ask discreet questions, and
checked the various documents that try to estimate the size of the
market, report companies sales, etc.  Then we put all the data
together and massaged it until it seemed to be more or less
consistent. We don't believe that any specific number is correct,
but we are confident that the overall picture is reasonably
correct. (When we obtained more specific information about
numbers we used in the past, we usually found that we erred by
being a little high.)
     We are late with this issue in large part because many
vendors who were quick to cooperate in the past were very
reluctant to do so this year. This partly reflects the fact that
the companies are increasingly dominated by marketing people
rather than technical people.  And,  it partly reflects the fact
that 1989 was a worse year for several vendors than they had
expected.
     We have promised anonymity to our sources  in the process of
gathering our data, so we will not discuss very many specific
numbers.  Instead, we will simply estimate the overall size of
each niche, and the relative position we believe the major players
occupy.

The Expert System Market in 1989 and in 1990:  An Overview

     Overall, we believe that the expert systems market enters
1990 in the best shape its been in during the last three years.
Broadly speaking, there are two aspects to the market.  There are
the companies that buy expert systems products and develop expert
systems to accomplish their corporate goals, and there are the
expert systems vendors: companies that sell hardware and software
to help people develop expert systems.

The Users

     The companies that buy and use expert systems products have
been steadily growing more confident during the last three years.
They have purchased expert systems products; they have built a few
systems; they have found that the technology works.  Their MIS
folks have been skeptical (most still are), but as new products
that work on mainframes have been introduced and as more people
learned about the practical details of expert systems development,
the companies have systematically increased their commitment.
     We currently estimate that the expert systems are being used
by the following industries in the following proportions:
     Manufacturing                           34%
     Defense and other governmental agencies 24%
     Finance                                 18%
     Other business and industry             11%
     Education                                8%
     Corporate R&D                            5%
     Our sample is relatively small, and the confusion about how
to classify certain applications is so great, that these numbers
must be considered only approximate. Even within categories there
are big differences. Computer manufacturers have been particularly
active in expert systems development and we have included them in
manufacturing.  Within the financial industry, insurance companies
are very active, brokerage firms are active, and banks are still
only mildly active. In both finance and manufacturing, we have
avoided trying to determine whether the expert systems
applications were actually related to core business functions, or
were used for generic overhead functions. (An expert system used
to manage a chip fabrication production line would perform a core
business function; a system used by the same company to assist
managers in analyzing personnel problems would perform an
overhead function.)
     Industries that fall into the "other business and industry
category that have a considerable interest in expert systems
include transportation, energy, and communications. There is also
a rising interest among retailers.
     In 1988, successful expert systems applications reached the
point where anyone really interested could convince themselves
that the technology worked and was here to stay.  There are now
several hundred working, mid-sized to large strategic applications
and several thousand small to mid-sized systems that are
accomplishing more modest tasks (like help desks and equipment
troubleshooting).  Nineteen eighty-nine saw the introduction of
the first large multi-user expert system, a trend that will
accelerate rapidly in 1990 as systems developed in 1989 are
fielded.
     Nineteen eighty-nine was the year that companies began to
standardize on the tools they would use to integrate expert
systems technology throughout their organizations. It was also the
year that companies began to worry about systematic methodologies
they could use to train their programmers to identify and develop
expert systems.

The Vendors

     On the other hand, the ranks of expert systems tool vendors
were thinned in 1987 and 1988.  Several companies went out of
business, while others realized their strategies were not working
and began re-sizing and re-coding in an effort to survive.  These
were the years that the Lisp vendors realized that only a very few
companies were going to want to buy their tools.
     In 1989, mainframe tools triumphed.  Vendors that hadn't
thought you could run expert systems on mainframes suddenly
decided to develop a mainframe version, while the companies that
had focused on mainframes all along did very well.
     From the perspective of both the users and the vendors who
are now correctly positioned, 1990 will be a good year.  The
ramp-up for corporate-wide use of expert systems is just
beginning, however, and 1991 and 1992 promise to be even better.

Who Sold What

     We'll consider what happened in 1989 by first considering
what happened within various niches, and then we'll try to pull it
all together.

Hardware Companies

     While Lisp machine, language, and most tool vendors went
through a tough time during the last three years, the major
hardware vendors who are selling equipment to the companies that
are actually using expert systems have been doing OK. The
conventional hardware vendors enjoyed significant hardware sales
(which they attribute to expert systems) and they expect more in
the years ahead. Indeed, given how relatively slow hardware sales
have been in the last two years, conventional hardware vendors
such as IBM, DEC, and Sun now see expert systems as one of the
more promising ways to sell more hardware in the 90s.
     We expect that the hardware being used primarily for expert
systems development and implementation is being sold by the
following vendors in roughly the following proportions:
     Various PCs running MS-DOS (IBM and clone makers) 20%
     Macintoshes (most equipped with TI or Symbolics    5%
          Lisp chips)
     PCs and Unix workstations running Unix            15%
     DEC hardware running VMS                          15%
     IBM mainframes running MVS                        15%
     Lisp workstations from Symbolics and Texas        20%
          Instruments
     Other                                             10%
     Some of the hardware being used may have already been in
place (e.g. the mainframes) but most companies have or will be
acquiring new hardware as they continue to expand their expert
systems development efforts, and if present trends hold up, they
should be acquiring them from the companies listed above.
     The Lisp workstation figure looks high at 20%, we believe
most of those workstations were purchased before 1989 and that the
use of Lisp workstations will decline steadily over the next two
to three years.
     We think that some companies (including the military, NASA,
and the aerospace companies that service them) will continue to
acquire Lisp workstations for high-end applications, but we
predict that most of the companies using Lisp-based software will
begin running Lisp on a Lisp co-processor or on DEC hardware. (The
military will probably move toward Lisp-chips embedded in other
hardware.)
     SUN sold about 60% of the Unix workstations being used for
expert systems development.  SUN claims that it derives about 5%
of its revenues from the AI market and that AI is its second
largest market in Europe.
     In 1989 companies began deploying expert systems on
mainframes so multiple users could access the systems
simultaneously.  We expect that multi-user applications will
expand rapidly in the next few years, and that the overall use of
mainframes will increase accordingly.
     No companies reported applications running in OS/2, but we
expect that that is a result of our sample size.  In any case, we
believe this will change in the next few years as OS/2 begins to
replace DOS at more companies.

Language Vendors

     Some high-end users are working directly in Lisp on Lisp
machines, on DEC hardware, on Unix workstations, and on
Macintoshes equipped with Lisp co-processors.  In addition, anyone
who is using a Lisp-based expert systems building tool needs to
have Lisp resident on their hardware. A few people in the U.S. are
still experimenting with Prolog.  Thus, there is a continuing
niche for symbolic l   guage vendors.
     The dominant commercial vendor is Lucid, whose Lisp is on
most commercial platforms. (A new fast version of Lucid Lisp was
just announced for DEC hardware, adding DEC to the already
impressive list of hardware vendors supporting Lucid, including
IBM, Sun, HP, Apollo, and NCR.) In addition, KEE, the best selling
Lisp tool, is written in Lucid.  Clearly, Lucid is going to
survive.
     Lisp  is used extensively in schools.  However, much of it is
Gold Hill's Golden Common Lisp.  So, Gold Hill can also survive by
selling Lisp and tools to the university market. Franz Lisp,
Quintus Prolog, and Arity Prolog are all still selling
interpreters and compilers as well. None of these companies has
become as large as its founders had hoped, but they all seem to
have found some level at which they can survive.
     Lisp will not go away.  It is a powerful and very flexible
language that is just right for rapidly prototyping very large and
complex systems. Several different companies in 1989 went out of
their way to tell us that they expect to be doing more work in
Lisp in the future.  The latest versions of Lisp are much faster
and easier to manage than the versions of only a few years ago. As
more and more students move from school, where they learned Lisp,
into companies, Lisp will grow slowly and continue to occupy a
highly specialized niche. (The same is also true, to a much lesser
degree, of Prolog).

Tool Vendors

     The expert systems tool market changed quite a bit in 1989
and some of the changes caught us off guard:

Small PC/Mac Tool Vendors

     We define small PC and Mac tools as tools that sell for from
$100 to about $1000.
     Many small PC vendors have disappeared in the last two years.
Of those that remain, Paperback Software's VP-Expert occupies an
overwhelmingly dominant position.  VP-Expert has now sold some
60,000 copies, which means it doubled its sales in 1989.  A large
portion of the VP-Expert sales went to schools, but VP-Expert is
also the most popular small PC tool in the corporate environment.
     As we write this, the trial between Paperback Software and
Lotus over VP-Planners's alleged infringement of VP-Planner on
Lotus 1-2-3's interface is taking place. Assuming Paperback
Software survives this challenge and continues to improve
VP-Expert, it should be able to hold on to the low end of the
expert systems tool market for the foreseeable future.
     Information Builders' Level5 is clearly the second
best-selling small PC tool, and it certainly sold several thousand
units.
     We always have trouble classifying Level5.  The PC version is
priced as a small tool and it has about the same capabilities as
most of the small tools -- rules and backward chaining -- but it
is associated with Focus and there are versions of the tool
running on DEC machines and on IBM mainframes. In addition, Level5
has features that facilitate its integration and assure easy
database access. Where Paperback Software is really mass marketing
VP-Expert, we expect that most of Information Builders' sales are
to companies who acquire site licenses.
     Other tools that companies are using to develop small systems
include 1st-Class, Exsys, KnolwedgePro from Knowledge Garden, and
Crystal from Intelligent Environments.  TI's Personal Consultant
Easy is still being used, although it is less common now than a
year ago.
     With the exception of VP-Expert, which is priced and sold as
a mass-market commodity (and Level5, which we'll consider later
when we consider workstation and mainframe vendors), the other
small tool vendors are either hurting or face the prospect of very
modest growth.
     Figure 1 shows our estimates of the small PC tool sales in
1987, 1988, and 1989 (see printed version of this issue, available
from Cutter Information Corp.; (800) 888-8939, (617) 648-8700).
Last year we projected that small tool vendors would sell 70,000
units in 1989. Obviously the small tool market has not grown as
fast as we expected.
     Paperback Software sold the great majority of units sold in
1989.  The income the small tools market received was lower than
expected both because fewer units were sold and because VP-Expert
sells for only $249 (often discounted to much less).
     We expect that Paperback Software, having the momentum it
has, will continue to sell well in 1990, but we anticipate that
the overall market for small tools will be about the same in 1990
as 1989.  Educational institutions and individuals who want to
experiment with expert systems account for most of the sales.
These sales will continue, but they're probably not going to
experience much growth in the coming year.
     Another factor that limited the growth of the market for
small tools was the relative lack of Macintosh sales. Human
Intellect Systems' Instant Expert ($69) is probably the best
selling tool for the Macintosh.  Information Builders introduced a
Mac version of Level5 in 1989, but apparently there isn't much of
a market for expert systems tools among Mac users.
     We expect that some of the smaller tool vendors will merge
with other companies during 1990.  Some of these tools would
provide the right vertical marketing company with a great
foundation on which to develop a series of problem- or
application-specific tools.  A training company could take one of
these tools, modify its interface, and create a whole series of
highly specific tools to help trainers (who are generally not
programmers) develop manuals, small equipment repair aids, etc.
     We keep expecting small, reasonably priced PC tools that are
specialized for specific applications (like manual development, or
small help desks, etc.) to appear.  So far they haven't.  Thus,
the people using the small PC tools are mostly "Lotus-literate
programmers or students who are using the tools as a way to learn
about expert systems technology or are using them to develop small
applications.
     In our opinion, there are real opportunities for the small
tools that help non-programmers accomplish specific tasks. The
current crop of tools, including VP-Expert, are still too
difficult to use to attract this audience.  Hence, as companies
standardize, they will increasingly use tools they acquired under
site licenses, and the market for the various standalone, generic
small PC tools will decrease.

Mid-Sized, PC/Workstation Tool Vendors

     We define these tools as products that run on PCs, Unix
workstations (i.e. SUN), or DEC hardware. These tools range in
price from $2,500 to $25,000, but most sell for between $5,000 and
$8,000.
     Last year we assumed that 4,500 mid-sized PC/workstation
tools were sold in 1988.  We realize now that some of the units we
included in that figure were, in fact, European sales.  We now
estimate that the total PC/workstation tools sold in the U.S. in
1988 actually totalled some 3,500 units, and the sales income
generated by mid-sized tool sales was $23.5 million.
     We projected that 1989 mid-sized tool sales would climb to
7,000 units.  We now believe that, in fact, there were about 4,500
mid-sized tools sold in 1989. We believe the vendors made about
$30 million on such sales. Clearly the market didn't grow as fast
as we projected.
     What is much more interesting is who sold the most mid-sized
tools in 1989 -- Aion Corp.  We did not anticipate this, nor did
the managers to whom we talked in early 1989 about their plans for
the year. Apparently companies decided to standardize in 1989,
and, having made that decision, they decided to buy PC tools that
were compatible with the mainframe tools they intended to buy.
Since many companies chose Aion's ADS for their mainframe tool in
1989, they also chose to cut site licenses with Aion. In
considering who sold the most units, we only considered
developmental versions of tools.  Aion led in developmental
versions sold, but they also sold a phenomenal number of delivery
or runtime licenses, mostly in conjunction with site licenses.  A
telling bit of information:  the Texas Instruments instructors at
TI's Information Systems Center, who formerly taught internal
courses on how to use Personal Consultant Plus, now teach TIers
how to use the PC version of Aion's ADS.
     Other important vendors selling in this market include Neuron
Data (Nexpert Object), AI Corp (KBMS), Software A&E (KES II),
Inference Corp. (ART/IM), and Information Builders Inc. (Level5
for the VAX).  AI Corp introduced a DOS version of KBMS in
mid-1989.  We expect that the same logic (i.e. that companies that
have standardized on a mainframe tool will buy PC versions of the
same tool) will hold in 1990 and that companies choosing the
mainframe version of KBMS will also push KBMS PC sales up rapidly.
Inference Corp.'s Unix workstation version of ART/IM enjoyed
significant sales in 1989, presumably because companies who are
considering using ART on the mainframe want to explore its
potential.
     Information Builders Inc. didn't play a large role in the
mid-sized tool market in 1989, but it will probably play a larger
role in 1990. In mid-1990, Information Builders is set to
introduce their new tool, Level5 Object.  Unlike Level5, which is
a backward-chaining simple rule tool, Level5 Object will be a
powerful hybrid tool with high quality user and developer
graphics. The PC version will to be priced at around $1,000. If
the tool is as good as the demos and sells for $1,000, it will set
a new price/value standard for the industry and put both the small
PC vendors and most of the mid-sized tool vendors under
considerable pressure.
     In effect, the mid-sized/workstation niche, as an independent
market niche, is disappearing (at least in the U.S.). Companies
clearly want to field expert systems on mainframes and they are
committing to mainframe companies. Once committed, they are using
the PC tools sold by those companies rather than buying mid-sized
tools from vendors specializing in selling tools for $5,000 to
$8,000.
     The exceptions, at the moment, are companies that want to
develop and field their applications on VAX hardware. We expect
that Nexpert Object may still be the best-selling mid-sized tool
for DEC hardware, but it must be getting some competition from
DEC's VAX Decision Expert and will soon get some more from DEC's
Epitool.  That's an important exception, of course, because DEC
equipment is being widely used in manufacturing --  the industry
that is buying most of the expert systems software at the moment.

     AI Corp has just introduced a DEC version of KBMS and Aion
has committed to developing a DEC version in the future. Thus, at
some point in the near future, even those operating on DEC
hardware will have the option of buying tools that not only run on
a DEC, but on an IBM as well.
     Some new vendors entered the mid-sized market in 1989.  The
most interesting tool is probably Meta Knowledge's Kappa.  Still,
given what we have just said, new vendors that start out on the PC
and then try to add platforms until they finally get a mainframe
version are going to have a very hard time.
     It's probably too late for any small to mid-sized company to
try to introduce a new generic tool.  The market wants
integration, and there are some good vendors in the market that
are offering exactly that. It will be very hard for a small
company to compete by offering a tool that just runs on a single
platform when there are vendors that have tools running on PCs,
Unix workstations, VAX machines, and IBM mainframes.
     We expect that the mid-sized tool market will grow modestly
in 1989.  With the benefit of hindsight, we expect that most of
the mid-sized sales will be to companies that have standardized on
a mainframe tool and then buy PC or DEC versions of that tool to
use in training and in the development of expert systems.

Mainframe Tool Vendors

     The mainframe vendors sold about 175 units and made $11
million on tool sales in 1988.  We projected that they would sell
400 units and make $25 million in 1989.  In fact, we believe they
sold about 237 units and made about $22 million selling mainframe
tools.
     We just described the sharp increase in market share that
Aion achieved in the PC/workstation market. We expect that in 1990
the PC versions of Level5 Object and KBMS will also enjoy
considerable sales.  We had not anticipated this, although clearly
we should have.  Many companies have apparently decided to go with
mainframe tools but, logically enough, they have begun by
acquiring only one or a few mainframe versions of the tool, and
then have proceeded to acquire a large number of PC versions of
the tool.  This strategy allows their developers to begin learning
about the technology and to create and test applications without
forcing the company to spend the larger amounts of money required
to make the tools available on the mainframe.
     It seems that companies are committing to mainframe delivery,
but are holding off on purchasing the software required for that
delivery until it is needed. In other words, mainframe tool sales
will lag behind the sales of the PC versions of the mainframe
tools.
     Accordingly, even though mainframe tool sales fell below what
we expected this year, we believe the mainframe tool market is in
very good shape.  We predict that mainframe tool sales will easily
reach 400 by the end of 1990, and will accelerate even faster
thereafter as companies develop the applications that require the
mainframe software for delivery.
     Clearly, the dominant mainframe tool vendor in 1989 was Aion.
Equally clear is the fact that almost everyone who is considering
buying ADS is also considering KBMS.  The fierce competition
between these two companies will continue unabated through 1990
and probably for several years thereafter.  (We will be reviewing
Aion's ADS and AI Corp's KBMS in the next issue of the
newsletter.)
     Nineteen ninety will witness the introduction of Information
Builders' Level5 Object and IBM's TIRS.  In addition, Inference
Corp. will probably play a larger role as a result of its recent
deal with Arthur Andersen Consulting (See Trends).
     In 1989, we saw the triumph of the mainframe approach to
expert systems.  From now on, with the exception of relatively
specialized vendors like Paperback Software, the Lisp vendors, the
domain-or problem-specific vendors, and perhaps one or two tools
that are very effective on DEC VAX systems, any company that does
not have a credible mainframe version of their product will not be
able to play a significant role in the expert systems tool market.
The competition in the mainframe market should be very fierce in
1990.
     IBM probably didn't make much money selling expert systems
tools in 1989, but it was very active.  In addition to continuing
to work on ESE and KnowedgeTool, they began selling IBM/KEE and,
much more important, they announced their AD/Cycle with a
knowledge-based systems component.  In the context of its AD/Cycle
announcement, IBM also announced that it will begin selling a new
hybrid tool with impressive graphics, called TIRS.  We expect TIRS
will quickly replace all three of IBM's early offerings and become
the first tool that IBM sells in any significant numbers. (That
TIRS is limited to mainframes and OS/2 machines will limit its
sales, but there are enough people who want to buy from IBM and
have been waiting for a credible tool, to guarantee that IBM will
play an increased role in the tool market in 1990.

Lisp Tool Vendors

     In 1988 the large Lisp vendors sold about 900 units and made
about $20 million on tool sales.  We projected that they would
sell 1100 units in 1989 and make about $23 million on tool sales.
In fact, we believe that 970 Lisp-based tools were sold in 1989
and that the vendors made about $22.5 million in the process.
     Last year we considered IntelliCorp's KEE, Inference Corp.'s
Lisp version of ART, and Carnegie Group's Knowledge Craft in this
category.  We placed Gold Hill Computer's GoldWorks in the
mid-sized tool category and we placed Gensym's G2 in the
domain-specific category.  This year we have included both
GoldWorks and G2 in the Lisp category. We changed because we
decided that the fact that a tool is written in Lisp is much more
important to potential clients than the hardware or the size of
the tool.  In addition to the vendors listed above, we considered
both AIT's Mercury and DEC's Epitool as part of this market.
Epitool has just been introduced in the U.S., but has significant
sales in Europe.
     Clearly IntelliCorp's KEE is still the best selling Lisp tool
and almost everyone agrees that it defines the top of the entire
expert systems market in terms of features and functionality.
Inference has switched most of its attention to selling the C
version of ART and Carnegie Group is concentrating on consulting
and on problem-specific tools.  AIT's Mercury (fast database
access) and Gensym's G2 (real-time applications) are currently
attracting buyers with specialized needs, and DEC's Epitool is
about to test the proposition that customers will buy a Lisp tool
if the programming interface makes you think you are programming
in Pascal rather than Lisp.  We expect Lisp tool sales to decline
to 900 units in 1990, and we expect the income vendors earn on
Lisp tool sales to decline accordingly.
     There is a continuing rumor that IntelliCorp will introduce a
C-based tool in 1990.  If they do introduce it within the first
half of 1990 and it is as successful as Inference Corp.'s C
version of ART, we expect that overall Lisp tool sales may decline
significantly, since, in effect, the last major Lisp tool vendor
will appear to be moving out of Lisp and will be refocusing its
sales effort on the non-Lisp tool market.  That might mean a few
more Lisp sales for some of the more specialized vendors, but it
will probably be the final blow to generic Lisp tools.  There will
continue to be a small market for problem- or
application-specific tools written in Lisp.  However, most of the
people who want to work in Lisp will probably work in the language
itself.

Problem- and Application-Specific Tool Vendors

     There were a number of domain-specific tools introduced in
1989.  Carnegie Group added Service Maintenance Planner, Text
Categorization System, and Cost & Manufacturability Guide to their
earlier diagnostic specific tool, TestBench.  TI, which also sells
TestBench, added Line Balancer, Technicians Assistant, and a
variety of airline planning and scheduling applications that it
developed in its Symbolic Spreadsheet product.  TI is eager to
tailor any of these applications to help solve any transportation
company's needs. IntelliCorp introduced KLUE.  DEC announced XSAFE
and started marketing AI WARE's CAD/Chem product. Syntelligence
sold a copy of Syntel, its tool for developing financial
applications. These products range in price from a few hundred to
one million dollars.
     Last year we estimated that 100 problem- or
application-specific tools had been sold and that the vendors had
made some $3 million.  We projected the sale of 200 units in 1989
and revenue of $6 million.  We believe that more than 200 units
were sold, but we are very unsure of the money that vendors made
in the process. For our summary calculations we take the very
unreliable figure of $6 million and project an equally unreliable
$12 million for 1990.  In most cases, these sales blend into
consulting and these figures have to be regarded as particularly
suspect.

Application Vendors

     The early vendors who tried to sell expert systems off the
shelf failed to make a go of it (although Syntelligence is still
trying).  At the moment, there are many small to mid-sized expert
systems applications being sold. Most are modest in size and very
narrowly defined.  We have not tried to estimate the number sold
or the money being made in the process. Later this year we will
publish a catalogue of expert systems for sale.  We'll try to make
a reasonable estimate of the market at that time.

Consultants and Software Houses

     Companies like Cimflex-Teknowledge and Carnegie Group have
really transformed themselves into software development shops that
specialize in expert systems development.  IntelliCorp and
Inference Corp. will probably follow in the next couple of years.
In addition, some of the small expert systems tool vendors are
making most of their money from consulting and will probably be
absorbed by software development groups in the coming year.
     Almost all of the expert systems tool vendors earn a
considerable amount of their money from expert systems consulting
(which we have tried not to count as a part of their tool
revenue).  TI, for example, is earning far more money selling
consulting services than it is selling tools.  As a general rule,
you can add 35% to 40% to the tool income of an expert systems
vendor to reflect the income that vendor is earning from
consulting. (There are only a few significant exceptions -- Neuron
Data and Aion, for example.)
     In addition, established software development groups are
doing lots of work in expert systems.  The largest is clearly
Arthur Andersen Consulting (see Trends), followed probably by
Coopers & Lybrand and Arthur D. Little.  In addition, most of the
other major software development groups are doing at least a
little work in expert systems consulting.  There are likely a
number of groups doing specialized work for the military that we
don't know about.
     We don't have any hard estimate of the money the conventional
software houses made by doing expert systems consulting or by
incorporating expert systems into their other work, but we assume
that, taken together, the figure must be over $20 million.

The Total Size of the U.S. Expert Systems Market

     Nineteen eighty-nine was a good year for users of expert
systems, but it was a confusing year for vendors. In retrospect,
1989 was part of the transition that began in 1987. The transition
was not simply away from Lisp-based tools, as some thought, but
toward tools that could be based on mainframes and hence be
simultaneously delivered to multiple users.  The C-based
standalone workstation tools had trouble this year just as the
Lisp-based tool vendors did in 1987 and 1988. The only expert
systems tool vendors who really look good right now are those that
have the same tools on all of the major platforms, including the
mainframe.
     Aion and AI Corp are in the best position.  Information
Builders Inc., Software A&E, Inference Corp. and Neuron Data are
all still in the market, but each will be playing catch-up in 1990
as they try to improve their tools capabilities and their
mainframe credentials to match the two leaders. We only expect a
couple of them to really make it.
     IBM and DEC are both limiting their tool offerings by
limiting the platforms on which their products will run, but IBM
could be a very serious contender in 1991 if TIRS turns out to be
as nice as it looks and companies really begin to shift from DOS
to OS/2 (TIRS doesn't run in DOS).
     Last year we tried to put a dollar figure on the total expert
systems market and then on the total AI market.  This year we
thought that there was too much information we didn't have, so we
decided to take a pass.
     We have calculated the total income of tool vendors in 1989
and projected it for 1990.  The numbers are presented in Table 1
(see printed version of this issue, available from Cutter
Information Corp.; (800) 888-8939, (617) 648-8700).
     We expect that the best-positioned vendors will expand their
PC/workstation sales next year and begin to get the mainframe
sales that this year's sales have, in effect, set in motion.
     If you really want information on the broader market and can
afford to pay for it, you should buy Ovum Ltd.'s new report
"Knowledge-based Systems: Markets, Suppliers and Products." ($995,
$1035 outside North America) It arrived just as we were completing
this newsletter and we examined it closely to see how Ovum's
assumptions matched our own.  We have a few disagreements; we
think they overestimate the role of Symbolics and AI Corp and
don't give enough weight to Aion and IntelliCorp.  Moreover, they
say VP-Expert sales have faded, which is clearly wrong. (It's as
if they gathered their information on the East Coast and didn't
spend enough time in Palo Alto). Ovum's figures are about twice
ours; we expect they didn't take into account the discounts the
vendors are offering and the effect of site licenses on income.
Still, we know how hard it is to come up with reasonable
information on the various parts of the AI market and this report
seems to us worth quite a bit of study if you are interested in
vendor income estimates.
     In addition to a complete analysis of the U.S. market, the
Ovum report has the best analysis we've seen of the expert systems
market in Europe.

January 1990

WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN 1990

How Did We Do in 1989?

     Before we begin to make predictions for 1990, let's take a
look at what we predicted for 1989.
     1. "Lisp machine vendors and Lisp-based generic tools will
all but disappear in 1989.  Lisp-based problem- or domain-specific
tools will do better, but..."
     We said this last year and still predicted that some 1100
Lisp-based generic tools would be sold. We estimate that about 979
units were, in fact, sold.
     Although Symbolics is showing a profit, it has switched its
energy toward software and TI is maintaining a very low profile
these days.  We think we were right on this one.
     2. "C, Mac, and mainframe tools will dominate the news in
1989."
     As noted above, nothing much happened on the Mac, but C and
mainframe tools certainly dominated the news.  We'll take a mostly
right on this one.
     3. "Several new problem- and domain-specific tools will be
introduced."
     We were certainly right on this one.
     4. "The hottest subject in 1989 will be object-oriented
programming techniques.  All of the tool vendors are scrambling to
introduce or improve their capabilities.  Object-oriented
techniques make developing expert systems faster and easier.
Rule-based tools provided most of us with an introduction to
expert systems, but hybrid tools are now rapidly becoming the
standard for expert systems work."
     This was certainly correct.  ADS now has objects and
Information Builders' Level5 Object (formerly called Level5
(Release2) is in beta testing and about to be released.  We talked
to several companies about standardization during 1989 and no one
was considering a tool that didn't have (or was about to have)
objects.  Everyone now realizes that objects are necessary for
many high-end applications.
     In addition, the object-oriented conferences were very hot in
1989. Many programmers who know little or nothing about expert
systems are rushing to learn about OOP.
     5. "The Mac tools introduced in 1989 will be really
impressive and will raise the standard for what we expect for the
small PC tools."
     Human Intellect Systems Instant-Expert Plus (introduced in
1988) remained the most interesting small tool on the Mac.
Hyperpress' Intelligent Developer was interesting but needed more
work. The same goes for Logic Programming Associates' (and Quintus
Computer Systems) Flex. IBI's Level5 for the Mac is a very
professional tool, but not very exciting.  Paperback Software
failed to deliver its Mac tool, as did Gold Hill. Little's Cameo
(in Hypercard) is interesting, but not commercially available.
     The Mac is being used by Lisp programmers in conjunction with
either a TI or a Symbolics Lisp co-processor to run larger
Lisp-based tools like ART or KEE, but those are hardly small PC
tools.
     We missed on this one. So far, the Mac isn't playing a very
interesting role in the world of small expert systems.
     6. "Nexpert Object will dominate the workstation tool market
in 1989, but will probably start to face some real competition
from tools that have about the same capabilities and interface but
cost closer to $800."
     Nexpert Object no longer dominates the mid-sized workstation
tool market, Aion does.  It hasn't gotten any $800 competitors,
but it will when Level5 Object comes out at $1,000 in mid-1990.
We were wrong on this one.
     7. "The major marketing battle in 1989 will be fought between
ADS and KBMS. Aion will try to add object-oriented capabilities
while KBMS will concentrate on getting its tool to run as fast as
ADS-HPO."
     We were right on here.  Aion did add objects and AI Corp did
manage to get KBMS to run a lot faster.  And they certainly did
battle in the offices of many companies that are trying to decide
which tool to buy.
     8. "The overall market will grow slowly as companies continue
to try to sort out how to integrate expert systems techniques with
their current practices."
     We were right on this one.  Actually the market grew a little
faster than we expected because companies began to standardize and
several site licenses were sold, but we still think this
prediction accurately reflects the overall market in 1989.
     9. "Consultants and vertical market VARs will do very well,
since companies will turn to them both for assistance in training
their own personnel and for developing high-value tailored expert
systems applications with high price tags."
     We believe that we were right on this one, too.
     10. "The research community will continue to show a lot of
interest in neural nets, but there won't be very many commercial
applications."
     Right again.
     11. "Interest in and applications of natural language will be
more pronounced in 1989 than in previous years, driven primarily
by the introduction of KBMS with its Intellect interface."
     There certainly was a growing interest in natural language in
1989. Natural language vendors showed up in numbers at the AAAI
convention (IJCAI in Detroit) for the first time.
     Most of the natural language activity was incorporated in
expert systems applications or focused on front ends for
databases.  MCI International, for example, developed a system
that scans incoming messages and sorts out time-critical money
orders. They have sold the system to several banks.
     Natural language hardly begins to rival the interest in
expert systems, nor is it worth the effort for most expert systems
applications, but it is slowly and surely growing.  We'll take a
right on this one too.
     We admit that our 1989, predictions were pretty general and
rather conservative, but we're still pleased to say that we got 8
right, 1 mostly right and only 2 wrong.  Buoyed up by our success
in 1989 we have decided to be more specific and less conservative
in predicting what will happen in 1990.  We'll be really happy if
we get 75% of our 1990 predictions right.

What We Predict for 1990

     1. 1990 will be a good year for people promoting expert
systems within corporations and for the few expert systems tool
vendors who are positioned correctly.
     In spite of tight money and continued confusion about
hardware, operating systems, and networking, corporations will
invest in expert systems because they are directly related to
solving hard, strategic problems; increasing productivity; and
improving quality; all key corporate concerns.
     Fortune 500 companies will continue to standardize on tools
and buy site licenses, which will make the winning expert systems
tool vendors stronger, while eliminating the less successful
vendors from the market.
     Most corporate MIS groups are only beginning to be won over
to expert systems, so 1990 won't see really large numbers of
systems deployed or integrated in the way that DEC has.  We
believe 1991 and 1992 will be even better years, as MIS people
realize just how many problems they can ameliorate or solve with
expert systems techniques.
     In other words, the AI winter is over, the weaker vendors
have been weeded out or are dying, and the vendors who have
successful products are about to enjoy some prosperous years.  The
people within corporations who have been championing expert
systems are about to become respectable prophets, as MIS groups
slowly but surely realize that expert systems technology will be
an important key to success throughout the 1990s.
     2. The term "expert systems is about to disappear. By the end
of 1990, almost everyone will be saying"knowledge-based systems
(KBS). We certainly admit that "expert systems suggests the wrong
thing; (it refers to a specific role that only a small minority of
the systems ever played) and that "knowledge-based systems puts
the emphasis on the technology, where it belongs. (The only proper
alternative would be inference-based systems.)
     "Expert systems has held on primarily because the media have
used the term in popular articles. As the hype around expert
systems dies down (and the popular computer press focuses on OOP
and neural networks), corporate analysts and programmers will
prefer to talk about the technology using a more accurate term.
     We'll have a hard time adjusting; "expert systems just comes
tripping off our tongue, but we'll try. (We may even change the
name of the newsletter.)
     3. Throughout 1990, the main marketing news will continue to
be generated by Aion and AI Corp, although later in 1990, IBM's
TIRS will begin to give both companies some modest competition.
     By the end of 1990, Aion will be the most successful expert
systems vendor, with sales topping $30 million.
     4. Level5 Object will be very well received and will
effectively drop the price of a good, hybrid mid-sized tool to
$1,000.
     5. The Lisp-based hardware and tool vendors are still in for
a rough time.
     IntelliCorp will introduce a C version of KEE.  KEE will
remain the best of the Lisp-based tools and the preferred choice
of high-end developers, but IntelliCorp will be forced to shrink
since it is still too large for its limited niche.  Symbolics will
try to shift from hardware to software, but they will have trouble
and they too will probably also find themselves trying to shrink
their overhead.
     TI will increasingly focus on doing Lisp development in the
context of highly targeted consulting.  They will focus on
introducing a SPARC II chip with Lisp-like capabilities and then
position themselves in the Unix world.
     Gold Hill will need to shrink some more and will probably
increasingly focus on supplying Lisp software for universities.
     The Lisp companies that survive will follow TI, Teknowledge,
and Carnegie Group and become specialized software development
houses. They will de-emphasize software sales and focus on helping
clients develop strategic software applications.
     One or more of them will be purchased by larger software
houses who want to add an expert systems capability to their
portfolio of consulting capabilities.
     At least one major Japanese or European software house will
enter the U.S. market by acquiring one of the Lisp vendors to get
a foothold in sophisticated software development in the U.S.
     The use of Lisp will continue to grow throughout the decade.
The demand for Lisp-based products and consulting services during
1990, however, will be less than the supply being offered by the
various Lisp vendors.
     6. DEC and IBM will both play a steadily increasing role in
the expert systems market.  They will both continue to benefit
from the growth of expert systems-driven hardware purchases.
     DEC will play a larger role in the short run by helping
manufacturing companies develop an overall strategy for using
expert systems and integrating them throughout the company.
     IBM will play a greater role in the longer term by continuing
to work on its tool offerings until it gets a winner -- probably
in the context of their AD/Cycle.
     Both companies will continue to play a limited role in the
tool market in 1990 because both companies are still trying to use
their tools try to force companies to commit to their hardware.
Most companies, however, will insist on buying tools that run on
several different platforms, including mainframes, PCs (in DOS and
later in OS/2), VAX machines, and Unix workstations.
     7. Neural network applications will increase and you will
hear more about them as they get integrated into existing expert
systems building tools. Neural networks will still remain a
research subject and not a commercial technology throughout 1990.
     8. Object-oriented programming will continue to be a hot
topic throughout 1990.  Many programmers who know nothing of
expert systems will get excited about using C++, Object-oriented
CASE tools and Object-oriented databases. (By the middle of the
decade, C++ will be the dominant OOP language and will begin to
replace C.)
     Most of the OOP folks don't know much about expert systems.
They stress rapid prototyping but don't understand inferencing or
the use of heuristic rules. In 1991 and 1992 there will be a real
opportunity for expert systems people within corporations to help
the OOP folks develop a methodology based on what they (the expert
systems people) have learned about developing object-based
programs and managing rapid prototyping efforts.
     By 1992 or 1993, the best of the OOP tools will incorporate
some inferencing and will be positioned as CASE tools. Some of
them will probably be developed by the same vendors who are now
selling expert systems tools.
     We regard OOP as a spin-off of AI, or at least a kindred
technology, and will devote an increasing amount of attention to
it as it matures.  We haven't tried to estimate the financial size
of the OOP market in this issue, but we will take a crack at it
later in the year.
     9. Problem- and application-specific tools will continue to
be introduced.  No one tool will have a large impact because each
will be specialized for very specific niches, but they will
certainly create consulting opportunities for companies that will
increasingly consider themselves software consulting firms, as
Texas Instruments' Knowledge Engineering Group has done.
     10. While the early vendors of expert systems applications
were unsuccessful, there is a growing number of vendors, mostly
selling expert systems that run on PCs (see the Trends article on
Ask Dan) or applications that are highly specialized, such as
DuPont's Packaging Advisor or Beckman's PepPro, that are doing
quite well. The successful products all emphasize that they
perform a job well and de-emphasize the technology that underlies
the product.  No one wants to buy a tax program simply because
it's an expert system -- they want to buy a tax program that's
more powerful, flexible, and easier to use than its rivals.
     (We'll be publishing a catalogue, "Expert Systems for Sale,",
1990.  We don't expect people to buy expert systems from a
catalogue, but we want to show just how large and diverse this
specific subset of expert systems applications has become.  We
haven't tried to put any financial numbers on application sales in
this issue, but we'll come up with an estimate as we develop the
catalogue, and we predict that it will be a more impressive number
than most will expect.)
     11. The hot expert systems topic of 1990 will be a systematic
methodology.  There will still be some market for consultants and
trainers who want to talk about "What Expert Systems Are but the
most successful consultants will be those who can help companies
train conventional programmers to recognize opportunities, build
expert systems, and integrate with existing corporate systems.
     If someone develops a methodology that rests on a structured
approach to developing hybrid systems (the successor to the
top-down structured programming systems based on data flow
diagrams), corporations will beat a path to their door.

Arthur Andersen Consulting and Inference Corp. Sign an Agreement

     Just as we were going to press, we received an announcement
that Inference and Arthur Andersen Consulting have signed an
agreement whereby Andersen will have access to Inference's expert
systems tools for use in its system integration business.  The
agreement also provides for Inference to assist Andersen in
application development.  Inference estimates this agreement will
produce between $5 and $10 million in revenue over the next three
years.
     This agreement will go a long way to ensure that Inference is
seen as a vendor who can supply tools that run on PCs, Unix
machines, VAX hardware, and on IBM mainframes.
     It also lends support to our contention that conventional
software consultants will want to acquire the consulting skills
that are currently possessed by companies like Inference,
IntelliCorp, and Carnegie Group.

Ask Dan, Now Andrew Tobia$' Tax Cut

     For the last two years we have recommended Ask Dan, a
PC-based expert systems application that helps individuals and
small business prepare their taxes.  (We weren't alone in this --
"Business Week" rated Ask Dan #1 for two years in a row, as well.)
The important thing about this program is that it doesn't put a
lot of emphasis on being an expert system; it just does the job
better than the competing (non-expert) programs.  The interface is
really excellent -- it reproduces the IRS forms and allows you to
fill out the forms, open windows to get advice, and eventually,
print out your returns.
     For those who are interested, Ask Dan in now being
distributed as part of the Andrew Tobia$ series under the name TAX
CUT.  If you have been using Ask Dan, Tax Cut will seem completely
familiar. If you use the Tobia$ Managing Your Money software, Tax
Cut will work with the data from that program.
     Tax Cut is available from MECA Ventures, Inc. and is
available in most software stores.  List price is $79.95, but
Egghead Software has it listed for $45.

NCR UNVEILS SIIPS
New Product Features POD, Customer-Facing Applications

     NCR Corp. of Dayton, Ohio, hopes to boost its standing in the top
250 U.S. banks this year with its long-awaited Scalable Image Item
Processing Solution (SIIPS), due to be released at presstime (IPR,
Sept. 28).
     SIIPS is a client-server-based image system that supports NCR's
7780 transport and is compatible with the widely-used Check Processing
Control Software (CPCS) from IBM Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., and
SuperMICR software from Computer Associates of Islandia, N.Y.  
     End users who have waited more than a year for SIIPS to be
released look to the system as an alternative to image-based item
processing systems from IBM, Unisys Corp. of Blue Bell, Pa. and
BancTec Inc. of Dallas.

Better Way To Handle Checks

     Newly renamed NCR (see story, p. 7) hopes SIIPS can take
advantage of rising interest among large banks for imaging to boost
productivity, reduce labor costs, beef-up services and generate new
fees, said Mike Visser, assistant vice president of item processing
products at NCR.
     Ed McHugh, director of payment systems at Unisys, estimates that
the market for imaging in the top 250 U.S. banks could exceed $300
million this year. 
     Some 70 percent of these banks already have at least one image
application in beta testing or live production, he added.  These range
from image proof-of-deposit (POD) to image-cash management to low-
volume transports for niche work.
     McHugh added that the number of imaging applications used by top
banks could rise as merged banks integrate their individual processing
systems to reduce costs and boost productivity.  
     In addition, NCR believes image systems, such as SIIPS, will draw
interest from banks trying to manage their growing check volumes. 
Despite the promise of electronic alternatives, check volume has grown
by at least 2.3 percent annually since 1989, noted Jim Moore,
president of Mentis Corp. in Durham, N.C.
     "I can't imagine a competitive bank not having the beginnings of
an imaging strategy in place this year," said Geoff Emerson, general
manager at IBM.

Expect More SIIPS-like Products

     NCR is confident it can tap into this growing interest in imaging
and sell SIIPS to at least 20 of the top 250 U.S. banks this year,
Visser said.  
     He admits that this will be a tall order since NCR faces
competition from IBM and Unisys, which have offered their own high-
speed image check processing systems for several years.  But NCR plans
to stress its system's scalability, low cost of ownership and host
software compatibility, Visser explained.
     "If the scope of SIIPS is to totally replace what goes on in
check processing right now, NCR will have its hands full with four or
five installations this year," an industry watcher told IPR.  "If the
scope of SIIPS is only to replace proof departments, NCR could get
seven or eight deals."
     The source added that large banks will be reluctant to buy SIIPS
this year because NCR doesn't have a proven track record in high-speed
image processing.
     In addition, NCR is counting on SIIPS to give the vendor momentum
in large banks, noted Greg Schratwieser, president of International
Consulting Inc. in Fairfax, Va.  Some long-time users of NCR
technology lost faith in the vendor because it took so long to develop
SIIPS, Schratwieser claimed.
     Indeed, it was end users who urged NCR to develop SIIPS itself to
ensure the system has adequate maintenance, quality measures and
support, Visser said.
     SIIPS is the first product to be released by NCR since the
company announced last year it was splitting from AT&T and creating a
new Financial Industry Business Unit to focus on financial systems
(IPR, Sept. 28,).
     "SIIPS is the kind of product we will focus on after the
restructuring," Visser explained.  "It's designed for one of our
traditional business markets, but it leverages our company's
technology and resources in new ways."   
     He added that SIIPS also is a "more complete" item processing
solution than any other product offered by NCR.  "Our business has
been built largely with solutions partners, who understand a
particular application area well and build their processing software
on top of our 7780 transport," Visser said.

A Completely Client-Server-based System

     A key feature of SIIPS is its "completely client-server-based"
architecture, which reduces the image system's upfront costs and makes
it more affordable for banks with lower check processing volumes,
Visser claimed.
     Large-scale image check processing solutions from IBM and Unisys
have elements of a client-server system, such as personal computer-
based keying workstations.  However, they still rely heavily on some
type of mainframe, Visser explained.  "We don't have a mainframe
anywhere in our system," he added.
     This client-server configuration reduces the equipment costs
built into the SIIPS system versus mainframe-based image check
processing systems, Visser said.  "We have seen examples where
equipment costs for SIIPS were between 30 percent and 50 percent less
than equivalent systems from our competition," he said.     

High-speed Balancing, Key-ahead Functions

     Client-server technology also allows NCR to offer a scaled-down
version of SIIPS, which processes about 100,000 proof-of-deposit (POD)
items, for less than $1.5 million -- roughly half the price of an
image system from one of NCR's competitors, Visser estimated.  "Our
smallest configuration is a lot less expensive because our servers and
transports cost less," he said.
     SIIPS also offers the benefit of compatibility with legacy
systems, such as CPCS and SuperMICR software.  "SIIPS thinks it's a
reader-sorter, and it will do all the sorts that the host system wants
it to do," Visser explained.  This helps banks protect their
investments in existing IBM mainframe-based CPCS systems, explained
John Spencer, senior vice president at Frost National Bank of San
Antonio.  Frost currently uses several SIIPS applications.  
     SIPPS also includes a high-speed balancing feature that
identifies and ranks probable causes of error in out-of-balance
transactions.  
     For instance, the system automatically sends items that it
believes are miskeyed to a data-entry clerk for rekeying.  If the
transaction remains out-of-balance, the system sends another item for
reentry or looks for other errors, such as deposit slip mistakes, lost
documents or recognition errors.
     Another useful feature is a key-ahead function built into the
system's image display terminal.  Visser explained that two check
images are displayed on the screen at a time, allowing operators to
key ahead as they would on a proof machine.  The function could help
in training new proof operators, he said.

SIIPS in Live Production at Wachovia

     SIIPS POD and image delivery applications already are in live
production in processing centers at Wachovia Corp. of Winston-Salem,
N.C., National City of Cleveland, and Frost.  Additional sites
currently are being rolled out.
     Wachovia helped NCR develop the SIIPS POD application and
installed the system at the bank's operations centers in Atlanta,
Columbia, S.C., Raleigh, N.C., and Charlotte, N.C.  Wachovia processes
peak volumes of more than 2 million unencoded items per day using the
four systems, with the Columbia center alone processing more than
800,000 items per day, Visser said.
     "We needed a solution that would coexist with our existing
technology and one that wouldn't outgrow our needs in a couple years,"
said Paul Boone, executive vice president of check operations at the
bank.  Wachovia expects the SIIPS POD system to reduce the bank's
labor and maintenance costs, Boone said. 
     National City, which also worked with NCR as a development
partner, installed SIIPS POD alongside IBM's CPCS version 1.11 host
software at its operations center in Columbus, Ohio.  The bank also
plans to install SIIPS in its three other operations centers, starting
in Cleveland.
    Frost implemented multiple SIIPS applications, including CD-ROM
image delivery, image statements, and SIIPS POD, at its operations
center in San Antonio.  The bank processes more than 300,000 unencoded
items per day.
    Frost currently is installing SIIPS at its remote center in
Houston.
    Meantime, NCR is developing a pre-encoded capture application,
interface software for the IBM 3890 reader-sorter, wholesale and
retail remittance and lockbox applications, and recognition software
upgrades based on technology from AT&T's Bell Labs.  (Mike Visser, NCR

BRANCH OPERATIONS BOOST SIIPS THROUGHPUT

     Changing your branch operations can substantially increase SIIPS
POD throughput, notes system documentation obtained by IPR. 
     For instance, having tellers separate work that includes adding
machine tapes from work that does not, can reduce the time required
for document preparation at the SIIPS POD site.  (Mike Visser, NCR

ADVICE FROM INDUSTRY LEADERS FOR 1996

    *  Make imaging your top priority, suggests Don Avedon, president
of Avedon Associates Inc., in Potomac, Md.  Corporate customers will
begin to expect imaging services as they hear about your competition's
offerings.  Consumers also increasingly will have firsthand knowledge
of imaging through home banking packages such as Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows-based products, he says.
    "As more people gain access to imaging ... processors will have
an easier time getting consumers and senior management to accept the
technology," Avedon said.  "It also will be easier for vendors to sell
imaging systems to banks."

    *  Consider adding image check processing, even if you're a bank
with less than $150 million in assests, says Tommy Green, president of
Greenway Corp. in Carrollton, Ga.  "More and more small banks are
adding image systems as a result of falling software and hardware
prices and increasing pressure to keep up with nearby banks that offer
image-based services," Green explained.  
    As evidence, he points to People's State Bank of Groveland, Fla.,
a $60 million asset-bank that recently inked a deal to implement
Greenway's PrimeImage check processing system.  The bank processes an
average 6,000 items per day.
    Green speculated that smaller banks within a 50-mile radius may
partner to buy imaging systems.  For example, First Bank and Trust of
Carrnesville, Ga., and Bank of Toccoa of Toccoa, Ga., purchased
imaging equipment from Greenway but plan to process their checks at
First Commerce Bank of Commerce, Ga.  "By not buying a check sorter,
the banks save about $125,000," Green said.

    *  Balance the benefits of individual image applications with
your long-term, enterprise-wide strategy, recommends Geoff Emerson,
general manager, IBM Corp.  in Charlotte, N.C.  "Consider how all of
your image applications fit together to ensure that your long-term
strategy stays on track," he said.
    Emerson also suggested end users watch for "customer-facing"
image applications with beefed-up functionality.  He explained that
vendors, such as IBM, will focus considerable attention this year on
developing and improving applications where customers know their bank
is using image technology.
    "More and more vendors will provide solutions that allow banks
and processors to use image technology in new ways," Emerson said.

    *  Get your feet wet with electronic check presentment (ECP), if
you already haven't, suggests Steve Takahashi, group senior vice
president for ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc., in Chicago.  Takahashi
believes more banks will develop ECP systems this year and begin to
exchange items electronically to slash check fraud, boost
productivity, develop new return item products, and take advantage of
ECP-related discounts offered by some Federal Reserve banks.  
    "Many banks have developed ECP systems, but they haven't gone
live," he noted.  The problem is, most banks only are set up to send
but not receive ECP transmissions.  ABN-AMRO hopes to begin exchanging
ECP items early this year.

    *  Educate operations employees in on-line communications and
prepare your company for using the Internet to move large volumes of
paper-based information, such as contracts and mortgages, Avedon says. 
"The information technology world eventually will be tied together by
telecommunications," he noted.  "But the typical document imaging
person knows very little about telecommunications."
    Avedon recommended that processors purchase telecommunications
manuals for employees and include operations managers in meetings
where telecommunications staff discuss long-term plans for network
upgrades.  (Don Avedon, Avedon Associates, 301/983-0604; Geoff
Emerson, IBM, 704/594-8099; Steve Takahashi, ABN-AMRO Services
Company, 312/904-7477; Tommy Green, Greenway, 770/834-0090.)

LOWER PRICES, MORE COMPETITION FORESEEN IN REMITTANCE MARKET

    It's going to be a buyer's market this year for image-enabled
remittance systems, predicts Bob Kirk, president of Enterprise
Consulting in Dallas. 
    "There are some significant sales to be made, but I don't think
this will be as big a year for image remittance vendors as the last
two years," Kirk said.  "Most of the large processors have purchased
image remittance systems, and many will focus this year on maximizing
benefits from these new systems."
    Kirk speculated that reduced demand from large processors for
image remittance systems could force vendors to complete up to twice
as many sales in order to make the same amount of money that they made
last year.  
    He added vendors will sell a "fair" number of retail lockbox
systems this year, but most of the buying activity will be in the
wholesale lockbox market. 
    "This is going to be the year that many of the top 50 banks
decide to replace their existing systems because of their high labor
and maintenance costs and limited ability to facilitate new, revenue-
generating features such as CD-ROM delivery," Kirk explained.  These
banks will demand wholesale systems with better data entry
capabilities and beefed-up image production, he added.
    "Nobody has introduced a full-scale imaging system for wholesale
lockbox," Kirk noted, adding that most of the systems used by the top
50 banks rely on technology that is nearly 10 years old.  A number of
these banks already have hired consultants to develop wholesale
lockbox imaging strategies.

Mix and Match System Components

    Kirk also predicted that a growing number of medium- and high-
volume processors will purchase system components from several vendors
to get the best networks, servers, personal computers, transports and
operating systems.
    "As the concept of open systems takes hold, users will realize
that they don't have to rely on one company to provide them a total
solution," Kirk said.
    Indeed, several vendors will introduce platform independent
software this year for remittance processing, predicted Steve McNair,
president of FTP Consulting Services Inc. in Euless, Texas.  "The
vendors offering these systems will make the same base software
available for all of the major hardware platforms in the market,"
McNair explained.  "This will allow end users to mix and match
software and hardware to get a best-of-both-worlds solution."
    Similarly, NCR Corp. of Dayton, Ohio, is working with several
software vendors to qualify their applications to run on NCR's
platform, noted Mike Visser, NCR's assistant vice president of item
processing products.  The company hopes to offer more products that
better suit its customers needs, he said. 
    Combining components from several vendors also helps users
improve system functionality and control costs, Kirk noted.  "When you
buy a solution from one provider, your ability to control costs is
severely limited," he explained.

Consider Small Scale Remittance Systems

    Small-scale image remittance systems, which are designed for
processors with volumes of up to 100,000 transactions per month, also
will become more popular this year, McNair speculated.  These systems
generally are personal computer-based and feature image-enabled
transports with optical character recognition (OCR), intelligent
character recognition (ICR), courtesy amount recognition (CAR), front-
and-back-audit trails, encoding and sort capabilities.
    "Target markets for these systems will be low volume retail
applications such as rural water, gas and electric companies, and
small insurance, mortgage and retail processors," McNair said.  He
added that small-scale image remittance systems offer significant cost
savings versus conventional remittance products in terms of their
relatively low price tag and reduced maintenance costs.  (FTP,

VENDOR URGES BANKS TO START SMALL 

    Software Earnings Inc. of Memphis, Tenn., hopes to boost its
share of the image market this year by convincing banks to "gather the
low-hanging fruit" before image-enabling their proof-of-deposit (POD)
operations.
     "Banks have been scared-off by image proof-of-deposit because it
would force them to change all of their documents and reengineer their
entire organization," says Larry Jones, director of image products
marketing for Software Earnings. 
     "We're telling banks to get their feet wet with imaging by
applying it to applications like exceptions processing, which is
costly and accounts for just 2 percent of a typical bank's total
volume," Jones said.  By gaining experience with image-exceptions,
banks can get comfortable with the technology on a small scale, while
still providing imaging to their customers, he says.
     In addition, image-based exceptions processing offers banks a
higher marginal return on their investment than image-enabled POD and
in-clearings.  The reason:  Compared to the cost of handling a check,
exceptions items are up to 300 times more expensive, depending on the
type of exception, Jones explained. 
     "Vendors have been trying to create an attractive payback on
image-enabled POD for five years and it's still not there," he said.
     "Processors have got MICR-based POD down to a science, which
means banks need to achieve high volumes before they'll see a
significant return on their imaging investment," Jones explained. 
Plus, image-exceptions systems cost about $500,000, while enterprise-
wide, image item processing solutions cost up to $70 million per
institution, he estimated. 
    ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc. of Chicago, which recently signed
a deal with Software Earnings for multiple imaging applications (IPR,
Oct. 26, p. 8), adds that the revenue potential of image-exceptions is
"icing on the cake."  
    "The overall cost of the system is easily cost-justified by the
savings realized through reject repair, balance assist, and the return
items interface," said Steve Takahashi, its group senior vice
president of check operations.
    By adding image-based exceptions processing, Takahashi hopes to
reduce his bank's exceptions staff by 25 percent.  (Larry Jones,
Software Earnings Inc., 513/445-4178; Steve Takahashi, ABN-AMRO
Services Company Inc., 312/904-7477.)

AT&T GIS REVERTS TO NCR NAME. 

    Hardware giant AT&T Global Information Solutions of Dayton, Ohio,
changed its name back to NCR Corp. in anticipation of splitting from
AT&T next year.  NCR also announced a multi-year deal to make Bell
Labs of Basking Ridge, N.J., its primary research organization, and
unveiled an updated company logo.  "The name change is not a magic
elixir for solving the problems of this company," admitted Lars
Nyberg, NCR's chief executive officer.  "Our return to profitability
depends on our ability to deliver in the marketplace."  AT&T announced
plans last year to split into three companies (IPR, Sept. 28, p. 1): 
AT&T, which will provide communications services; a yet-to-be-named
systems and technology company; and NCR, which will focus on business
computing.  AT&T Global Information Solutions (GIS) was forced to
change its name since it won't be permitted to use the AT&T name and
logo after the spin-off.  NCR, which merged in 1991 with AT&T, was
renamed AT&T GIS in January 1994.  However, many industry players
continued referring to the company as NCR, we're told.  An updated NCR
logo will be phased in on equipment this year.  (NCR, 513/445-6646.)

    Chemical Banking Corp.'s Geoserve division is offering check
images on CD-ROMs to controlled disbursement customers of Chemical
Bank Delaware.  The service helps companies file, store and retrieve
checks faster than paper-based checks, the bank says.  Geoserve
piloted check imaging in the third quarter of 1995 with 10 companies,
ranging in size from Fortune 10 to middle market.  "In particular, the
ability to pull up a copy of a check during the reconcilement process
was cited as a key benefit by almost all of the participants," said
Vince Caranante, the bank's vice president and senior product manager

TIPS TO BOOST DEMAND FOR IMAGE STATEMENT BINDERS

    Hold after-hour receptions for key bank customers, such as
merchant accounts, to boost the number of customers that pick up their
image statement binders, recommends Phillip Crane, director of
marketing for Vulcan Binder and Cover in Vincent, Ala.  
    Serve refreshments, give customers a tour of your imaging
operations and have your marketing department speak on the benefits of
image, Crane suggested.
    More and more banks provide free binders as a customer service
when they make the transition to image statements.  Of the 200 banks
that Vulcan knows are adding imaging, only 12 have decided not to
offer binders to their customers.
    Crane noted that getting customers to pick up their binders can
help improve customer acceptance of imaging.  Here are other statement
binder tips:

*  Hold a series of seminars, luncheons and visits with your merchant
customers and their certified public accountants to give them their
binders and to let them know what technology is available and how it
can be tailored to their needs, suggests Dean Tingey, senior vice
president at First National Bank and Trust Co. in Asheboro, N.C.  Have
branch managers provide a contact at each business and help the
marketing department make calls to set up the meetings.

*  Have your binder supplier print your bank's name and slogan on the
side of boxes containing image statement binders, Crane suggested. 
Stacking the boxes in a pyramid in each of your branches will draw
attention to your bank's image statement roll out and help solve your
storage crunch, he explained.  Tip:  Consider mailing binders to
customers, such as the elderly, who may have trouble picking up their
binders at their branch, Crane said.

*  Show customers sample binders before implementing imaging, says
Theresa Lyons, customer service representative at Jeff Davis Bank  in
Jennings, La.  Display binders on customer service desks in your
branch offices, along with posters touting imaging.  Also, have
customer service representatives show the binders to new customers and
to community organizations, Lyons recommended.

    Another tip:  Send customers neon-colored, "statement-stuffers"
with information about imaging and the available statement binders,
Lyons suggested.  Customers are less likely to discard brightly-
colored information before reading it.  (Dean Tingey, First National

Competition sharpens in PC conferencing market+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Competition is intensifying in Japan's personal computer (PC)
market as the age of PC conferencing approaches, industry sources
said Friday.
     Like teleconferences, PC conferences enable participants at
distant locations to engage in discussions through the displays on
their personal computers.
     However, PC conferences are less expensive than teleconferences,
as they do not require large display screens.
     The sources said domestic and foreign electronics makers have
entered the market in which sales of PC conference terminals are
estimated at 3 million units in fiscal 1995.
     Two U.S. electronics makers, PictureTel Corp. and Compac Corp.,
teamed up last summer to enter Japan's PC conference market, while
the world's largest semiconductor maker Intel Corp. will market a new
system for PC conferences.
     Japan's top PC maker NEC Corp. has introduced a new system in a
bid to dominate the market, the sources said.
     Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the world's largest consumer
electronics maker, plans to introduce its own system featuring a
built-in, multifunction camera.
     They will be joined by other Japanese and U.S. competitors, such
as Japan's top mainframe computer maker Fujitsu Ltd. and Apple
Computer Inc. of the United States, the sources said.

Powerful magnet for VCR motors, computer HDD developed+

NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Aichi Steel Works Ltd. said Monday it has developed a new
magnet for use in videocassette recorder (VCR) motors and computer
hard disk drives (HDD) that is capable of providing 70% more energy
than that of the most powerful conventional magnet.
     The new magnet, ''Magfine 17,'' is an anisotropic magnet made
of the magnetic powders of neodymium and plastic.  The new product
provides energy at 17 mega gauss-oersteds (mgo) compared with 10 mgo
provided by the most powerful conventional isotropic magnet, the
company said.
     The company will start marketing the product next month.
     The new technology involves heating and consolidating the
magnetic powders by taking advantage of the critical ''moment'' when
melted plastic becomes liquid, an Aichi official said.
     With the technology, Aichi Steel has succeeded in arranging the
all particles of neodymium in the same direction, he said.
     For the time being, the product will be integrated into VCR
motors to move the magnetic heads of a VCR and magnetic sensors, it
said.
     Expectations are high that the new magnet will be integrated
into the CD-ROMs and HDDs of notebook personal computers, he added.

NEC develops new voice info system+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     NEC Corp. has developed a new voice information system that
uses flash memory microchips and can record up to four hours of
voice data, a company official said Tuesday.
     With the new system, voice data is compressed from 64 kilobits
per second to 16 kilobits and transformed into digital data, the
official said.
     The compressed data is recorded on a 32-megabit flash memory
chip installed in ''Chip Whisper,'' a business card-size device newly
developed by NEC, the official said.
     A flash memory chip, an electrically erasable programmable
read-only memory, is able to record 30 minutes of voice data, he
said.  Because they retain data even when the power is turned off,
they are popular for portable products such as notebook personal
computers.
     NEC will preview Chip Whisper at a Tokyo art gallery in January,
and visitors will be able to use the system to hear recorded
explanations about the works on display via an earphone.
     Some galleries previously used frequency modulation (FM)
broadcasting or dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, but the
NEC system is more practical because it does not require broadcasting
equipment and can convert data more easily than a DRAM system, the
official said.
     Chip Whisper can contain up to eight flash memory chips, which
would allow for recording of up to four hours of voice data.  NEC is
considering marketing the new system for such purposes as foreign
language learning, the official said.

Softbank to acquire U.S. publisher through bond issue+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japanese computer software wholesaler Softbank Corp. said
Tuesday it will issue 70 billion yen worth of convertible bonds to
raise funds for the acquisition of a U.S. publishing house.
     The Tokyo-based company said it has signed an agreement to take
over New York-based Ziff-Davis Public Co. and its holding company for
1.8 billion dollars.
     The entire proceeds from the bond issue will be used for the
acquisition, the company said.
     The price of the bonds, due on March 29, 2002, will be fixed
later, it said.  The deadline for subscription payments has been set
for Jan. 26.

Sega, Matsushita deny report on video game format+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
denied a news report Friday that they have reached an agreement to
standardize specifications for next-generation home video game
equipment.
     The companies' spokesmen said separately that home video
equipment makers are in general examining such possibilities, but no
specific negotiations or developments have been made between the two
companies.
     The denial followed a report by the mass circulation daily
Yomiuri Shimbun that the two firms have reached an agreement to
standardize specifications of their 64-bit video game machines by
next fall to effectively compete with the largest player Nintendo Co.
     The daily reported that Matsushita has already supplied a newly
developed 64-bit machine to Sega for feasibility studies.
     When the specifications are set, the companies plan to ask other
video game manufacturers to adopt them, the daily said, adding that
using the same specifications will help them reduce development costs.
     About 10 manufacturers are currently competing in the field, and
their products are essentially incompatible with each other.

Digital cameras making inroads into consumer mart+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Digital still cameras, once reserved for professional use, are
now filtering into the consumer market on active personal computer
sales, but whether they can emerge as a strong ''new kid on the
block'' in the computer peripherals sector hinges on how far prices
drop.
     Casio Computer Co., primarily a digital watch and calculator
maker, made a splash in the digital still camera market in February,
when it debuted a model priced at 65,000 yen, undercutting prices of
100,000 yen or more for models offered mainly by conventional camera
makers.
     ''The company had no intention to instigate price busting in the
digital camera market,'' says Koichi Nishizawa of Casio's public
relations section.
     The attractive pricing, and a built-in liquid crystal display
which serves as a viewfinder and monitor, however, earned the model
instant popularity.
     ''Monthly production has already hit 20,000 cameras and is
expected to reach 30,000 in early 1996, compared with the initial
pace of 3,000,'' Nishizawa noted.
     Casio expects the world market for digital cameras costing
around 100,000 yen or less to total just more than 300,000 cameras in
the year through March, of which 200,000 will be made by the company.
     It forecasts total shipments to hit one million cameras in 1996,
according to Nishizawa.
     Digital cameras do not use conventional photosensitive film but
capture images with a charge-coupled device (CCD), which turns optic
signals into electronic ones, and store photos digitally on built-in
flash memory chips or cards mounted with such chips.
     The new gadget saves users the trouble of developing film, while
enabling them to readily transfer photographic data into personal
computers (PCs) for monitoring, image processing, printouts and
on-line transmissions.
     The proliferation of PCs is essential for consumer-use digital
cameras to penetrate into the consumer market.  ''Some 90% of QV-10
clients are using the product with computers,'' Nishizawa said.
     Digital cameras, for instance, allow individual PC users to
produce custom-designed greeting cards with photos, compile databases
with visual information and take in pictures more easily for Internet
home pages than with conventional photo scanners.
     Corporate users have also found value in the camera.  Insurance
agents are taking digital shots of accident sites for on-line
transmissions to the head office to evaluate payments, while housing
and used-car dealers are compiling easy-to-edit digital catalogues.
     Inspired by Casio's success, electrical appliance makers Sanyo
Electric Co. and Sharp Corp. are poised to separately tap the budding
consumer-use digital camera market with promising growth potential.
     Sanyo will begin supplying its products to a U.S. computer
peripherals maker later this month under an original equipment
manufacturing contract, while Sharp is studying the possibility of
launching a consumer-use model, spokesmen for the companies said.
     Casio's Nishizawa concedes concern over appliance makers'
expected entry into the market, saying, ''The noncamera makers will
likely market digital cameras in much the same style as Casio has,
thereby clashing head on with us.''
     Among conventional camera makers, Chinon Industries Inc. expects
to put out a digital camera priced below 50,000 yen in February, a
spokesman said.  The company currently sells a 140,000 yen model
equipped with a zoom lens and a close-up photography mode.
     Most camera makers, though, seem to have reservations as yet
about offering models costing below 100,000 yen because they do not
want to compromise picture quality, says Yasuharu Hirose, head of the
Japan Camera Industry Association's general management division.
     The resolution of digital photos depends largely on the number
of CCD pixels, which totals 1.3 million to six million in models
costing millions of yen and used primarily by the media, the printing
industry and professional photographers -- the initial digital camera
users.
     Casio could lower the price of the QV-10 chiefly because it
adopted a 250,000-pixel CCD, compared with 410,000-pixel CCDs used in
rival 100,000 yen-plus models offered by Ricoh Co., Olympus Optical
Co., Kodak Japan Ltd. and other companies.
     Faced with user complaints over the QV-10's picture quality,
Casio will consider raising the number of pixels as it expands its
digital camera line, Nishizawa said.  The company plans to offer a
second model in the spring, he added.
     Camera makers are also cautious about low-end models because
they could eat away at sales of traditional compact cameras, while
''Casio and other noncamera makers have no product that directly
competes with digital cameras,'' Hirose of the industry group said.
     Proponents of low-priced models, however, argue that digital and
traditional cameras are two different products.
     ''Low-priced digital cameras should not be compared with
traditional cameras,'' says Hiroshi Morozumi, supervisor of Chinon's
marketing and sales department.  ''Their picture quality in print
pales even in comparison with that of disposable cameras.''
     Casio shares that view.  ''Our digital camera is such a casual
tool that you can take a visual note of a train schedule at the
station and erase it when you no longer need it,'' Nishizawa said.
''But conventional cameras are more for appreciating pictures
themselves.''
     The tide, however, seems to be turning toward low-priced models
in the digital camera market.  Camera maker Nikon Corp., which has
concentrated on digital models selling for 1 million to 1.4 million
yen, said it is considering releasing a consumer-use model selling
for 100,000 yen or less.
     ''Casio's model showed (consumer-use) digital cameras wouldn't
budge at conventional prices,'' says Masaki Isogai, manager of the
planning section of Nikon's electronic imaging division.  ''The price
is a key problem for consumer-use models.''
     With Japan's PC shipments estimated to have topped five million
in 1995, compared with 3.4 million in 1994, digital camera makers
expect their products to stand a good chance of appealing to a
broader spectrum of PC users.
     However, Chinon's Morozumi says, ''The price will have to come
down to 10% to 20% of computers themselves if digital cameras are to
be counted as a computer peripheral.''
     It is not just the price, though, that companies have to be
concerned with.  ''Digital camera makers need to propose what fun the
users can have with the product by, for instance, offering the camera
and image-processing software as a package,'' he said.

Sony Pictures to enter video CD software market in March+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Sony Pictures Entertainment (Japan) Inc. said Monday it will
enter the market for video compact disk (CD) software March 21,
introducing 10 movie titles.
     Sony Pictures, a domestic movie unit of electronics giant Sony
Corp., said the 10 titles are ''Stand By Me,'' ''Easy Rider,'' ''Taxi
Driver,'' ''The Addams Family,'' ''Kramer vs Kramer,''
''Ghostbusters,'' ''Last Action Hero,'' ''No Way Out,'' ''Silence of
the Lambs'' and ''Robocop.''
     Based on the Motion Picture Experts Group-1, or MPEG-1, standard
for data compression, video CDs are 12-centimeter compact disks which
hold a maximum of 74 minutes of audio and digital full-motion video.
     It is becoming increasingly easier to play such CDs on
audiovisual equipment and personal computers.

Japanese electronics transplants overseas total 1,062+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The number of overseas production bases operated by major
Japanese electronics makers totaled 1,062 at the end of June this
year, the Electronic Industries Association of Japan reported
Tuesday.
     The association said the figure is based on a survey of 436
member companies.
     It said 690 or 65% of the total were located in Asia, 194 in
North America and 138 in Europe.
     The association said a total of 282 Japanese affiliates were in
operation in China and Malaysia.
     The expansion overseas by Japanese electronics firms was
prompted by the yen's steep appreciation in the early 1990s, the
association said.
     The number stood at 770 in 1990, it said.
     ''The time has come for the Japanese makers to reorganize their
production bases in Asia, but the number of production bases to be
opened by them in the region will continue to increase, though at a
slower pace,'' the association said.
     The association said the Japanese affiliates were located in 43
countries around the world as of June 1995, with the United States
accounting for 153, topping the nation-by-nation list.
     Workers employed by the Japanese affiliates totaled 766,000,
including about 7,000 dispatched from Japan, the association said.
     It said 55 research and development affiliates were located in
North America and 25 in Asia.

Foreign appliance makers to launch sales blitz: paper+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Foreign consumer electronics makers are gearing up to boost
sales in Japan, introducing lower-priced products in electrical
discount stores throughout the country, a business daily reported
Tuesday.
     General Electric Co. (GE) of the United States will expand into
the western Japan market following its strong performance in eastern
Japan, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
     In June GE started selling refrigerators through Kojima Co., a
major Japanese home-appliance retail chain.  Brisk sales of 10,000
refrigerators a month have prompted GE to consider advancing into
western Japan, the daily said.
     The company will shortly enter into a tie-up with Daiichi Corp.,
Japan's third largest retailer of consumer electronics goods and
based in Hiroshima, according to the paper.
     The consumer electronics titan plans to offer not only
refrigerators but microwave ovens and air conditioners as well in
western Japan.
     Whirlpool Corp., another major U.S. appliance maker, has
launched sales of low-priced microwave ovens through Kato Denki Co.,
a discount store operator based in Mito, Ibaraki Prefecture, that
handles consumer electronics.
     South Korean appliance makers Samsung Electronics Co. and LG
Electronics are poised to begin selling lower-priced, wide-screen
television sets at large-scale retailers in suburban areas early next
year, the daily said.
     Samsung will put on sale 24-inch and 28-inch TVs that are
gaining popularity in Japan, with its overall 1996
consumer-electronics sales target for the Japanese marketplace at 21
billion yen, a 50% surge from this year's figures.
     Prices for the company's wide-screen TVs are likely to be set
at around 100,000 yen, or 20 to 30% lower than similar domestic
models.
     Meanwhile, LG Electronics is in negotiation with domestic
retailers for introduction of its 20-inch TVs in Japan, the paper
said.

Electronics firms to jointly study chip-making equipment+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Japan's 10 major electronics makers will launch a joint study
on equipment to produce semiconductors for 12-inch wafers, a
business daily reported Friday.
     The 10 manufacturers, including NEC Corp., Toshiba Corp. and
Hitachi Ltd., will establish a company for the study with joint
investment of 30 billion yen by the end of March, the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun said.
     It will be the first time in about 20 years that such companies
cooperate with each other in a study of this kind, the paper said.
     The new company will test semiconductor-manufacturing equipment
made by each manufacturer and examine the most suitable manufacturing
conditions for equipment to produce 12-inch wafers on a large scale,
the paper said.
     The new company will start operations at the end of 1996 and
complete the joint study in four years, it said.
     The 10 companies will produce such wafers individually following
the results of the study, it said.
     Semiconductor makers have so far been studying such equipment
individually, but they decided to cooperate with each other to cut
down on study expenses, the paper said.
     Twelve-inch diameter wafers are expected to replace 8-inch ones,
currently standard in the microchip market, in the near future.

NEW RECORDS ESTABLISHED FOR PC LAN SERVERS

Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft Corporation has
unveiled audited transaction benchmark results that establish
new records in the highly competitive market for database,
application and PC LAN servers. The results further
demonstrate the companies' leadership in providing customers
the industry's most powerful, most cost-effective open server
platforms.

Breakthrough results of 3194.4 transactions per minute (tpmC)
at $196/tpmC, based on the TPC-C(2) benchmark Revision 3.0,
were achieved on the AlphaServer 2100 5/300 64-bit SMP system
running Microsoft Windows NT Server operating system V3.51 and
Microsoft SQL Server V6.5 client/server database management
system. No other Microsoft SQL Server platform from any system
vendor delivers such impressive results.

The 3194.4 at $196/tpmC result is the industry's best price/
performance using any system, any database, or any operating
system. In fact, no other system has ever come close to
breaking the less-than-$200/tpmC barrier.

With a total system cost of $626,102, the AlphaServer 2100
5/300 delivers transaction performance and price/performance
superior to any other system priced below $1 million -- 24%
better throughput performance and $46/tpmC less than its
closest competitor, the Intel-based Compaq ProLiant 5/133

Model 2. It also provides better performance and price/
performance than many systems costing much more than $1
million (see charts below).

The Digital/Microsoft combination even outperforms a Tandem
Himalaya K10000-16 system with 16 processors and costing $3.5
million. And compared with competitive systems from IBM, HP,
Sun, Bull, AT&T, and others, these results are far superior.

"These independent benchmark results again demonstrate the
breakthrough performance and affordability of the Alpha
architecture," said Pauline Nist, Digital vice president of
the Alpha Server Business Segment. "For customers, this
represents the industry's best value in high-performance
server capabilities. It also further demonstrates the
engineering achievements of our strategic alliance with
Microsoft."

The TPC-C benchmark is the industry-standard test for
measuring database transaction processing performance and
price/performance. The $/tpmC result reflects the cost of
acquisition and ownership of the system over a five-year
period, including hardware and software maintenance, software
upgrades, and extended warranties.

"Today's news is one more way Digital and Microsoft are
bringing to customers computing solutions that offer
unprecedented value and flexibility," said Rich Tong, general
manager of the Business Systems Division at Microsoft.

"These TPC results demonstrate the power of the Microsoft SQL
Server and Digital Alpha platform for transaction- and
compute-intensive business applications in heterogeneous
environments."

Heterogeneous Computing Environment

The AlphaServer 2100 5/300 benchmark was conducted using three
CPUs and 2 gigabytes of memory. These results were achieved
in a heterogeneous computing environment, using Visigenics
ODBC client software for SCO UNIX running on Digital's
Intel-based Prioris PC systems.

"No longer must customers limit themselves to a single
operating system to get interoperability, performance, and
affordability," said Nist. "With these results, Digital has
proved that one of the best ways to solve business problems
can include a heterogeneous environment. Digital demonstrates
that a customer can leverage the strengths of both Windows NT
and UNIX to provide a cost-effective high-performance
solution." Competitive Comparisons

Digital also announced a limited-time leasing offer on all
Alpha servers and workstations. Through June 1996, Digital
Financial Services, a division of GE Capital, is offering
customers who migrate to Digital from competitors' systems a
60-day payment holiday on all 36-month leases. The program is
available to all direct and partner channels worldwide.

The Digital/Microsoft Alliance

Digital's AlphaServer systems provide a highly scalable
enterprise platform for the Microsoft BackOffice suite, which
includes Microsoft Windows NT operating system, Microsoft SQL
Server, Microsoft Systems Management Server, Microsoft SNA
Server, and Microsoft Mail Server. In June, Digital announced
an OEM agreement with Microsoft to bundle the Microsoft
BackOffice server suite with Digital AlphaServers and
Intel-based Prioris servers.

In August, Digital and Microsoft announced a major alliance,
the Microsoft-Digital Alliance for Enterprise Computing,
which will help customers implement and support Windows-based
computing in the enterprise. The enterprise level performance
numbers announced today demonstrate the results of the joint
efforts of Digital and Microsoft to deliver Windows NT-based
solutions to the enterprise.

SWITCH INTERCONNECTS MOST LAN-BASED E-MAIL SYSTEMS

Corporate America's growing dependence on E-mail to facilitate
high speed communication in the workplace, and the use of
different platforms to perform different tasks has given rise
to a new problem: Multiple, incompatible E-mail systems that
cannot communicate with each other. With fast, reliable and
cost-effective communication being essential to maintaining a
competitive edge in today's global marketplace, the inability
to communicate with clients, vendors, distributors, and other
employees can hinder growth and stifle profits.

With increasing frequency, companies are finding that they
have a mix of E-mail programs that don't communicate with each
other installed on PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations and
legacy mainframes. When E-mail systems can't communicate with
each other, savings gained by effective communications cannot
be realized.

At some point, senior management wakes up to the fact that in
the "paperless office", corporate-wide E-mail is essential.
The task of integration is usually assigned to the corporate
Information Systems (IS) group who are faced with the
challenge of integrating the various existing departmental
E-mail systems.

This is a complicated task that involves making systems
interoperate, share directory information and documents across
different platforms.

This does not mean, however, that a standardized,
corporate-wide E-mail system needs to be purchased. Mail
integration technology is widely used to connect disparate
systems. The numerous benefits of integrating existing systems
make the concept a sensible alternative.

First, businesses preserve their initial investment. This
investment is not limited to the cost of the original E-mail
system packages, but includes the cost of servers needed to
run the system and the training of users.

These users often have limited computer experience and are
reluctant to give up their favorite E-mail system after
spending hours getting accustomed to its features and
capabilities. By switching E-mail systems in an effort to
standardize, users are taken out of their friendly computer
environment and placed into an unknown one.

Mail integration software solves this problem by allowing
users to seamlessly communicate with a variety of other mail
systems in a "friendly" manner. The address and message is
"switched" to make it appear as if users are communicating
with a computer on their very same E-mail system!

Second, mail integration can buy a company time to implement
an enterprise-wide migration strategy to wean users off older
legacy based mainframe systems and prepare them for a
standard-based information system. Additional benefits depend
on the particular features offered by the mail integration
software they select.

The technological demands of integration are extensive.
Choosing a mail integrator requires a careful examination of
features, benefits and reputation. Integration vendors
approach the issue differently and the results differ. Alisa
Systems has long been an industry leader in mail systems
integration. They have a reputation for being the best in the
business according to high tech computer publications and
other independent sources whose job it was to compare
integration systems.

Alisa offers a complete mail integration package called
AlisaMail. AlisaMail is a full-featured E-mail switch that
interconnects the most popular LAN-based electronic mail
systems. It provides seamless and transparent exchange of
electronic messages, fully editable documents and binary files
between WordPerfect GroupWise, Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail,
CE Software QuickMail, X.400, SMTP and Digital VMSmail,
ALL-IN-1 and Message Router. This includes spread sheets, word
processing documents, graphic and binary files. Most
importantly, AlisaMail is built on a relational database,
Sybase, that makes the system extremely flexible. "The really
strong point of the system is it's easy to customize how
information is presented." said Don Cole, president of Alisa
Systems.

The OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory Synchronization and
Message Switch are the strengths of the system and separate
AlisaMail from the competition.

The OpenDirectory is implemented using a Sybase SQL relational
database and can be used as a corporate directory service.
OpenDirectory, a unique AlisaMail feature, eliminates
complicated addressing schemes by maintaining a common address
book synchronized with each mail system.

This "master" directory can include an address book of
customers, employees and vendors that contains information
such as their title, organization, department name, E-mail and
postal address, telephone and FAX number, as well as a
photograph. The OpenDirectory provides a centralized address
book for all the E-mail users in their company. It is accessed
by either the user's E-mail client or an Alisa client/server
application called PeopleFinder.

PeopleFinder supports quick and easy on-line searching of the
AlisaMail Open Directory. Users may search specific fields in
the database such as Name, Title, Organization and Location.
Available for Windows, Macintosh and DEC VMS, PeopleFinder
allows users to browse the OpenDirectory and its contents to
display information not accessable in the user's address book.

Existing desktop client/server development tools and
applications can also be used to access the OpenDirectory.
With Sybases's openserver technology you can even connect to
other corporate databases.

Auto Directory Synchronization works hand in hand with the
OpenDirectory and is the key to mail systems integration.
Without Auto Directory Synchronization, the Open Directory
would be useless. Open Directory creates and maintains a
master directory of all E-mail users in by requesting
directory updates from each separate mail system. When changes
are made in one E-mail system such as adding, modifying or
deleting an E-mail address, the information is then
transferred to the master directory and then used to update
all the other directories.

In medium to large companies where there can be many changes,
AlisaMail allows the updating to be performed automatically.
The superior performance of our Auto Directory Synchronization
is made possible by the flexibility of the SQL database. "In
essence, AlisaMail makes each mail system's directory an
aggregate of all the users. It represents the entire
population and there is no distinction in where these people
live." said Cole.

AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects the
different E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.

The gateway and Message Switch act as a store-and-forward
message hub and also handle the conversion of message formats
as required by the E-mail systems. The Message Switch
preserves the functionality of each mail system because it
stores the message in its unaltered format. The format of the
message is then converted only if the recipient mail system
requires conversion. If the receiving mail system does not
support all the functionality of the sender's, the Message
Switch will preserve as much functionality as possible.

Alisa Systems takes full responsibility for the success of
your E-mail integration. Alisa Systems will conduct on-site
surveys to determine your specific mail integration needs and
provide a customized solution. They will even install
AlisaMail on site for you, train you and help you fine-tune
the system to maximize performance in your environment.

"There's lots of bits and places for information to be stored
in a corporation and people need access to it," says Cole,
"There is a technology out there that can help you run your
business and save money."

@INTERNET: LOOKING AHEAD AT THE INTERNET
Predictions about the most important developmental issues for 1996

By:
Thom Stark

I devoted my first column of 1995 to a discussion of the things I thought
would most affect the development of the Internet in the year ahead.
Because I'm an aficionado of tradition, it's time for me to dust off my
crystal ball; make a few mystic passes; and try to define the events,
technologies, and trends that will most significantly affect the evolution
of the Internet in 1996.
   Perhaps I should begin by evaluating the predictions I made in 1995. In
last January's column, ``The Constant of the Internet Is Change'' (Jan. 23,
1995, Page 79) I speculated that the two key developments of the year would
be the defunding of the NSFnet backbone and the rollout of the Microsoft
Network (MSN).
   My NSFnet thesis was that the shutdown would free the Internet from the
constraints known as ``appropriate use''--the policy that no commercial
traffic should use the taxpayer-funded NSF high-speed backbone--and thereby
open the Internet to general business uses. It's fair to say I was right on
this one. If anything, I underestimated the impact that removing the
constraints on business uses would have on the character of the Internet in
general and the World Wide Web in particular.
   My other prediction was that Microsoft Corp.'s bundling of MSN with
Windows 95 would put the company in position to successfully dictate
standards to the Internet, bypassing the Internet Society's
consensus-oriented IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) process.
   With Microsoft having voluntarily limited MSN subscriptions to 500,000
users through the end of November 1995 and with the slow adoption of
Windows 95 by the corporate users Microsoft was counting on, I'd have to
say I blew it on this one. Although it's probably true that the perceived
threat of MSN was a critical factor in motivating other online services,
particularly America OnLine Inc. and CompuServe Inc., to roll out enhanced
Internet services of their own--and in CompuServe's case, to radically
restructure its pricing--the effect of MSN on Microsoft's capability to
dictate standards was indiscernible. Much to my surprise, the standards
bully turned out to be Netscape Communications Corp., maker of the wildly
successful Netscape Navigator.
   Netscape has come under intense criticism from the IETF community for
becoming ``the Microsoft of the World Wide Web'' because of its proprietary
extensions to existing and proposed HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
standards (http://home.mcom.com/assist/nettes/htmltensionshtml).
   You wouldn't know it from the widespread adoption of those very
extensions (how many Web sites have you seen that feature blinking text,
background images, or variable-width horizontal rules?), but there's a fair
amount of resentment on the part of old Internet types of what is viewed as
Netscape's high-handed imposition of its proprietary HTML tags on the
standards promulgation process.
   Unfortunately for the old guard, I think this trend will continue in
1996. In fact, I think the mossbacks will lose this one by a knock- out.
The newly released Navigator 2.0 (ftp://ftp1.netscape.com/netscape/)
incorporates still newer, Netscape-proprietary tags, such as frames
(http://home.mcom.com/assist/nettes/frames.html), that I think the
Web-building community will rush to adopt wholesale. The old IETF
decision-by-consensus mechanism is simply too slow and cumbersome for the
warp-speed evolution rate of the Web. I'm afraid that consensus will wind
up taking a permanent back seat to expediency on this and other Web-related
issues. The major question is this: Besides Netscape, who else will get to
drive?
Microsoft is pitching Internet Explorer 2.0
(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ download/msie20.exe), which uses
client-side image maps in a proprietary fashion different from the Netscape
method. Microsoft offers tags to create scrolling marquees and for playing
and controlling embedded Audio-Video Interleave (AVI) movies
(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie20html.htm).
   Unfortunately for Microsoft, I suspect that the attraction of marquees
won't be strong enough to persuade Netscape's loyal user base to abandon
the greater flexibility of frames and plug-ins. As for AVIs, the charm of
animation will, in many users' minds, be far outweighed by the cost in time
to download these often-huge files at the agonizing pace of 14.4Kbps.
   This brings up another battle that's looming on the horizon in 1996: The
number of Web sites implementing Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java
(http://java.sun.com) programming language applets vs. those offering
similar functionality via Microsoft's equally proprietary Blackbird
technology. Again, I think the road ahead for Bill Gates' gang is a rocky
one. Netscape Navigator 2.0, which already owns an enormous share of the
Web browser marketplace, natively supports Java. Microsoft's Blackbird, on
the other hand, isn't even supported by its own Internet Explorer. By the
time Microsoft makes it onto the battlefield, the war will be over and Sun
will have won.

Brilliant Browsers
   Unless I miss my guess, one of the more important trends of 1996 will be
the integration of additional service functionality into the Web browser
user interface. As Marc Andreessen agreed in a LAN Times interview (``The
Great Netscape,'' April 24, 1995, Cover), the role of the Web browser is
rapidly expanding to consolidate E-mail, ftp (File Transfer Protocol), news
reader, Internet Relay Chat, and other Internet services that used to
require separate applications. This should be good news for corporate LAN
environments, where that unified interface should reduce the complexity of
training and help-desk support needed by the user community.
   Finally, there's the rise of the corporate intranet. The twin
technologies of the Web and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)-based
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions-enhanced Internet-standard
E-mail deserve a place in the corporate LAN environment. One offers an
easy, inexpensive means of enterprisewide document publication. The other
promises to free us from the tyranny of proprietary mail transports and
file-attachment schemes.
   Are the prospects for a sub-$500 Internet access terminal turning into
the next big development in Internet technology? I think that, instead, the
so-called ``3270-Jr.'' is more likely to be the next pen-based personal
digital assistant--an engineering driven solution in search of a problem.

Internet contenders as Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.

@INTERNET: `CHERRY-PICKED' INTERNET

   Charles Mbacha, technical systems analyst with Standard Chartered Bank
in Nairobi, Kenya, writes:
   I just read Thom Stark's article on ``Best-of-Breed Internet
Applications'' (Oct. 9, 1995, Page 101). I wonder, however, whether one
should wait until the ``hype'' about best-of-breed Internet applications
has died down a little bit. Then one could go for a product that seems to
be robust enough and incorporates at least 95 percent of the features that
users need, such as substring searching, cross-posting to multiple groups,
virtual terminals, key remapping, dial-up support for NDIS (network driver
interface specification), and rule-based filtering.
   Could you recommend an approach to this selection minefield?

Thom Stark responds:
   Unfortunately, the hype surrounding computer applications of all kinds
doesn't look to fade away any time soon. In fact, that was kind of my point
 ... along with the fact that no single vendor has a best-of-breed solution
to offer across the board. Where news readers are concerned, I stand by my
recommendation of Forte Inc.'s Agent/Free Agent product. Most everyone
agrees that Qualcomm Inc.'s Eudora is the E-mail front end to use. And
Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator is clearly the best World Wide
Web browser on the market.
   The principal drawback to this ``cherry-picking'' approach is that you
have no centralized source of support other than your internal help desk.
Unfortunately, the pick-and-choose approach is the right one, at the
moment.
   The real issue is that this market is evolving at a breathtaking rate.
Applications developers of all sizes are climbing aboard the Internet
bandwagon, so the competition will be heating up, not declining, for some
time to come. With competition there inevitably comes hype.
   The best advice I can give you is to haunt USENET groups and ask for
advice from other users, look at the comparisons in trade magazines (but
take them with a barrel of salt), and ask companies for evaluation copies
of their software.

LAN ANSWERS: DUPLEXED DUPLEXING QUESTIONS
Plus, copy with hop counts and overflowing SYS: volumes

By:
Al Berg

   Welcome to 1996! Because January was named for the Roman god Janus, who
showed true system fault tolerance by having not one, but two faces, it
seems fitting to start off the new year with not one, but two duplexing
questions:
   Q. Mark Meyer, a vice president with Suburban Air Freight Inc. in Omaha,
Neb., writes: ``We run a Novell Inc. NetWare 3.12 network, and I have set
up duplexed drives in the server. My problem is I cannot figure out how the
duplexing is designed to work in the event of a drive malfunction.
   ``Novell says to unmirror the drives and use the good one if one drive
fails, but they do not say how to determine which drive is good or how to
rebuild the system. I would assume that there is a simple explanation on
how to use the duplexed drives when there is a problem, but I have not
found it. Any input you can provide on the problem or location of this
information would be appreciated.''

   A. The reason Novell's documentation is terse on the subject of
procedures for duplexing is that the process is mostly automatic. Here's
how things are supposed to work: When you set up two drives in a duplexed
configuration, all of the data written to drive A is also written to drive
B. (You can set up duplexing to more than two drives for even more security
and fault tolerance, but I have never seen that configuration in the
field.)
When LAN clients make disk-read requests, NetWare takes advantage of the
two disk drives and uses both to satisfy those requests in the most
efficient manner, yielding a significant per-formance improvement over
non-duplexed drives.
   When one drive in a duplexed pair fails, NetWare simply issues a couple
of error messages to the file-server console and system-error log and
starts operating in nonduplexed mode, using the remaining drive. Users will
not see any real difference in the operation of the LAN, except for a drop
in performance on disk reads.
   Here's where the element of danger arrives: It is extremely easy to miss
the error message that tells you your server is flying on one engine. If
the message scrolls off the screen and you (like many system managers)
don't periodically monitor your error log or use a server-monitoring
product such as Frye Computer Systems Inc.'s NetWare Early Warning System,
HiTecSoft Corp.'s ManageWare, or Network Computing Inc.'s LANAlert, you may
not know about the failed drive until it is too late--when your remaining
drive fails, and there is no backup. I can't count the number of sites I
have responded to where I ran into this situation. The moral of the story:
Keep an eye on the system-error log or install some software to do it for
you.
   Assuming you know that drive B has failed, the fix is simple: Bring the
server down at a convenient time (if your drives are not hot-swappable),
pop in a new drive, and create a NetWare partition on it. Then load the
INSTALL.NLM and select Disk Options and then Mirroring. Look for the
partitions marked Not Mirrored in the list that appears. Pressing `Enter'
on one of these partition listings will bring up a menu. Press `Insert' to
choose the other nonmirrored partition as the other half of the duplexed
pair. The remirroring process will begin automatically, bringing the two
drives into sync. While the server is remirroring, performance will be
slow, so it is a good idea to do this at night.
   Some people get confused by the seemingly interchangeable use of the
terms mirroring and duplexing in NetWare. Let's straighten this out once
and for all: The difference between mirroring and duplexing is simply that
with duplexing, the disks in a mirrored pair are on separate controllers.
Duplexing offers protection against a controller failure and improved read
performance.

   Q. Our second duplexing question comes from Ed Villanueva, a
self-described ``con- fused CNE'' at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J. He
asks: ``What is the proper way to set up disk duplexing? Should the two
disk controllers have the same interrupt and base memory locations, or
should they be different? Should I load the disk drivers twice?''

   A. The answer to Ed's question points out the difference between
server-hardware settings and NetWare settings. The disk-controller card
settings, such as interrupt numbers and memory base addresses, need to be
unique to allow the server to differentiate between the two cards. In most
cases, putting two cards at the same interrupt or base memory address will
lead to immediate problems, such as one or both cards not being seen by the
operating system.
   Duplexing is done at the operating-system partition level. The members
of a duplexed pair of disks are identified by the ID numbers of the NetWare
partitions on them, not the settings of the disk controllers. You'll need
to load the disk driver software for each controller card installed in your
server (identified by the slot or card settings) to make the system see all
of the drives.
   If you want the inside scoop on mirroring and duplexing, including some
important information on what to do when things don't go as planned, check
out Novell's October 1992 NetWare Application Notes (part number
164-000031-010). On Page 1, you'll find a great article titled ``NetWare
3.x Mirroring and Duplexing Tips and Tricks,'' which is recommended reading
for all system managers--even for you 4.1 people.

   Q. To move on to a different subject, Sanjay Jain, of Cambridge, Mass.,
E-mailed this question: ``When I type DISPLAY SERVERS at my file-server
console, it displays my server name with a hop count of 0. Sometimes I can
also find the server listed with a hop count of 1. What's going on? What
are hops, and what do they measure?''

   A. No, your server isn't having a psychotic break, Sanjay. The hop count
shown in the DISPLAY SERVERS output tells you how many IPX routers a packet
would have to go through to get to each listed server. If a packet starts
out at your server and simply returns to the server, it doesn't have to
traverse any routers--thus the hop listing of 0. If your server shows a hop
count of 1 on the same screen, this indicates that the server is hosting a
service that advertises itself via the Service Advertising Protocol (SAP),
such as a print server. If a packet is already in your server and needs to
get to that service, it has to traverse the virtual LAN segment (actually
your server's bus) inside the server to get to there. The virtual LAN
segment inside the server is identified by the Internal IPX network number
in your server's AUTOEXEC.NCF file.
   OK, Novell, here's another plug for the Application Notes: The October
1995 issue (part number 164-000047-010) includes an article titled ``Using
TRACK and Other Console Utilities in a Mixed NetWare Environment.'' This
document has a lot of useful information on hops and DISPLAY SERVERS and
how to use these tools to see what is going on on your network.
   By the way, the NetWare Application Notes are published monthly, and
although they aren't cheap ($95 per year or $135 outside the United
States), they contain lots of good information and should be on any serious
system manager's bookshelf. You can get more information from Novell at
(303) 297-2725 or (800) 377-4136.

   Q. Finally, I received this note from Irving Weiss, a LAN administrator
at Touro College in New York: ``Our backup NetWare 4.1 server's SYS: volume
ran out of space and now refuses to mount. I could delete some files to
make room if only I could get the volume mounted. Do you have any ideas?''

   A. NetWare 4.1 gets really cranky when the SYS: volume fills up. The NDS
(NetWare Directory Services) database information is stored on SYS:, and
DS.NLM requires some free disk space to do that voodoo that it does so
well. Because everything in 4.1 has some connection to NDS, the server will
do the electronic equivalent of assuming a fetal position and whimpering if
SYS: has no space.
   Fortunately, there is a pretty simple solution to this problem. Grab an
extra disk drive, install it in the server, bring the server up with the
-ns option (don't try to execute STARTUP.NCF and AUTOEXEC.NCF), load the
disk driver and INSTALL.NLM from the DOS partition, and add the new drive's
space to the SYS: volume. Then, down the server and bring it back up. You
should now be able to delete some files.
   When you want to remove that extra disk, you'll need to back up
everything on SYS:, destroy SYS:, and restore the data. I'd suggest making
a New Year's resolution to take a look at your disk configuration, Irving.
We at NETLAN recommend that 4.1 servers be configured with a SYS: volume
and at least one volume for user data and programs. We also recommend that
the two should be kept separate to avoid these types of problems.

   Well, another year of LAN Answers has gotten off to an active start. And
if the new year brings new problems to your LAN, drop me a fax or an
E-mail. n

LIEBING ON NETWARE: TIME-SAVING TIPS ASSIST USERS
Using server console commands in NetWare 3.x and NetWare 4.x

By:
Edward Liebing

   'Tis the start of a new year, and I'd like to first thank you for all of
the phone and E-mail messages. For the new year, I'd like to start on a new
topic--the server console commands for Novell Inc. NetWare 3.x and 4.x.
I'll keep you posted on upcoming changes in Client32.
   If you're like me, it's hard to instantly recall all of the commands you
can perform at the server console, especially if you don't use them very
often. Although most people know the simple, everyday commands such as CLS,
CONFIG, and DISPLAY SERVERS, there are more that are very useful. This
article will show you the console commands for both NetWare 3.x and 4.x.
I'll end the column with a tip on console shortcuts--creating .NCF batch
files.

NetWare 4.x's HELP Screen
   With NetWare 4.x, using the console commands has become more accessible;
you can type HELP `Enter' at the console prompt and see a list of all of
the console commands you can perform at the server. The only console
commands listed here that don't apply to NetWare 3.12 are Language, Restart
Server, and Help.
   In NetWare 4.x, you can also type HELP followed by a particular command
to see information that is specific to that command. For example, if you
wanted to see the syntax of a command such as BIND, you would type HELP
BIND `Enter' at the server console prompt. You would see a message similar
to the following on the server screen:

OFFICE: help bind
BIND protocol [to] LAN-
Driverboardme [driverrame-
ter...]
[protocolrameter...]

   This links a specific network board to a communications protocol.
Packets received by a LAN adapter will be discarded unless it has been
bound to a protocol.
   The LAN driver and protocol stack modules must be loaded before this
command can be used. For example:

BIND ipx to ne3200 [slot=3,frame=Ethernet] net=12345678

   As a reference point to begin looking at the console commands, the chart
on this page contains a list of the commands for both NetWare 3.x and
NetWare 4.x. Those that are marked as NetWare 3.x have only been tested on
NetWare 3.12; I gave up my 3.11 server a while back. I will discuss these
console commands one by one in future articles.
   One of the stroke-saver tips that I've used over the years has been to
create .NCF files that I use just like DOS batch files. The differences are
the extension name (.NCF instead of .BAT) and that these batch files are
run at the server console prompt. And it works the same for both NetWare
3.x and NetWare 4.x OSes.
   Batch files are great because they let you forget all the sticky
parameters you most likely have to go and look up anyway. Let's say you are
running NetWare 3.x, and you want to include a -P parameter when you want
to load the MON-
ITOR utility to show the Processor
Utilization option. To do this, go into the SYS:SYSTEM directory and create
an M.NCF file with the following command:

LOAD MONITOR -P

   Once saved, all you have to do is type M `Enter' at the server console
prompt, and the Monitor utility with the Processor
Utilization option enabled will appear. You don't have to include -P for
NetWare 4.x because the Processor Utilization option appears
automatically.
   An example for NetWare 4.x is using the /D option when loading the
SERVMAN utility. The !H parameter displays all kinds of diagnostic SET
parameters in the Server parameter option. So in this case, you would go
into the SYS:SYSTEM directory and create an S.NCF file with the following
command:

LOAD SERVMAN !H

   Then any time you need to use the diagnostic SET parameters, you would
type S `Enter' at the server console prompt. You can also use this method
to create large batch files for loading and unloading AppleTalk drivers,
CD-ROM software, VREPAIR on NetWare 3.x servers, and so on.
   The keys to creating batch files are to remember where you put the .NCF
files and watch your filenames. The easiest place to put the .NCF files is
in the SYS:SYSTEM directory because NetWare always searches that directory
for .NCF files. You can, however, specify other search directories as
well.
   For example, if you wanted to create a local directory, such as
C:\NCFFILES, you can add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.NCF file:

SEARCH ADD 2
C:\NCFFILES

A Batch of Help
   With this searching capability in place, when you type in a command at
the server console prompt, NetWare will first search SYS:SYSTEM to execute
the command and then go to the other directories marked as searchable. Just
be sure not to turn off access to DOS if you do this.
   You must also remember to watch how you name your batch files. For
instance, don't name batch files after console commands, such as UNLOAD.NCF
or BIND.NCF. This can cause confusion, and your batch files may not work.
   Next time, I'll explore console commands and see if I can turn up good
information with a tip or two along the way.

NETWORK MANAGER FINDS EASY FIX FOR THE LITTLE TAPE THAT COULDN'T

By:
Rick Ingersoll

   I came in Friday night to do our network backup. I went through the
usual procedures: Remove old tape, place a new one in the tape drive, run
the backup program, then wait for it to complete.
   After about 10 minutes I checked to see that all was well when I noticed
the backup software had not changed to the normal screen for running the
backup. It seemed to have simply stopped running.
   I downed our three servers and the workstation running the backup
software and then rebooted them. There was no change in the symptoms.
Thinking that perhaps some file or files in the backup software had become
corrupted, I deleted and reinstalled the system. No difference.
   I returned to work on Saturday, read the documentation, and then called
the software maker's technical support. They suggested upgrading the
IPX/NETX to IPXODI/NETX on the workstation running the backup software. I
downloaded the current files from Novell Inc. and did the upgrade. Still no
difference.
   I ran a tape cleaner through the tape drive, and it ran fine. Then I
realized that when I put the backup tape in the tape drive and closed the
drive door, something didn't sound quite right. I pulled the tape out and
looked at it. It looked OK at first, but on closer inspection--looking
under the tape label--the tape had jumped off one of the spools and was not
able to turn properly.
   The tape drive was not sending a tape-ready signal to the backup
software because of the messed-up tape.
   My fix was simple: remove the labels from the other backup tapes and not
put labels over the tape area of the tape spools. This allows inspection of
the tapes for problems before I start the backup.

EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER: VIRTUAL REALITY-BASED LESSONS

By:
Thomas Kaneshige

   Organizations find that trainees retain more material when the teaching
environment is in virtual reality and not in a traditional classroom. And
although one might expect virtual reality (VR) applications to be in the
unreachable realm of a multimillion-dollar flight simulator, today's
low-end VR software costs less than you might think. Plus, it is designed
to run on standard desktop PCs.
   Among those pioneering the effort are Motorola Inc. and Northern Telecom
Inc., which have traditionally invested heavily in classrooms and training
centers. The companies have recently begun migrating to desktop VR software
that simulates hands-on work experience. For instance, the computer screen
might show a 3-D schematic of a control station, piece of equipment, or
overview of a manufacturing line. Students would then interact with the
virtual objects while hearing the same sounds they would hear on real
equipment.
   Motorola and Northern Telecom found that their low-end VR training
software not only is cheaper and easier to deploy for geographically
dispersed students but, in general, also yields better results. Motorola
tested VR in 1994 before implementing a pilot program. The test compared a
sample of people trained with VR with those trained in the classroom. The
results showed VR students outperformed the others once they were placed on
the job.
   Nina Adams, president of Adams Consulting Group in Western Springs,
Ill., and an observer of Motorola's first-year pilot program, said the
program illustrates the excitement VR can generate in people. ``What is
significant is that [after VR training] we took people into the room with
real manufacturing equipment and they were able to perform,'' said Adams.
   Another advantage is the capability to portray working scenarios that
may not currently exist or to simulate critical experiences without
real-life risks.
   A customized VR training tool can be designed, produced, and implemented
within four to six months--less if the customers know from the outset
exactly what they want. And the software does not require special graphics
boards or accelerator cards. Companies opting for VR training tools can
also eliminate costs such as air fare, hotel accommodations, and
instructors' fees--not to mention the cost of maintaining a training
facility.
   ``Northern Telecom's findings show an average savings to customers of
$3,800 per student per course,'' said Roger Frampton, director of worldwide
communications for Superscape Inc., a vendor of VR software in Palo Alto,
Calif. ``VR applications can run on all sorts of desktops or tower or
notebook PCs. That means even if you buy a standard PC to run the software,
the hardware is yours to keep.''
   But the high cost of VR--a customized VR application runs anywhere from
$50,000 to $100,000--still makes it a big-budget commodity. Most of
Superscape's customers are Fortune 500 companies. Analysts and users,
though, agree that VR training software is teetering on the edge of mass
availability.
   According to Darrell Ferris, Northern Telecom's senior manager of VR
applications design, the migration of VR training tools from flight
simulators to the desktop opens up a whole new arena. ``Right now our
question is, What would be the virtual-reality applications? Look at Home
Depot--instead of having weekend workshops or selling books, why not sell a
customer a piece of VR training software? Why not put that stuff on the
Internet? My team thinks the thing is going to explode. You just need to
map it out.''

GETTING AHEAD BY PLAYING ON THE JOB

By:
David Loysen

   When the small defense contractor I was working for won a bid to install
a 220-node Novell Inc. NetWare LAN for the U.S. Army, I quickly grabbed
control. The chance to set up a whole network with no legacy data or user
expectations was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
   I was able to design almost everything the way I knew it should be done.
We bought all of the hardware, rented a warehouse, and set up the network.
After extensive testing with the Army's computer guys, we packed up the
completed network and loaded it into a moving van.
   One week later five other people and I were onsite, ready to set up the
network. There were 22 rooms on two floors; each room would get 10
workstations. One additional office would serve as the wiring closet and
server room.
   All this was in a 1940s concrete-walled building. Because I knew it was
going to be difficult to install the network cabling, I decided to put a
12-port hub in each room. This way I could minimize the number of long
cable pulls. All the network cable was going above the dropped ceiling and
then down the walls. It would be messy but fast to install--or so I
thought.
   The space above the ceiling was a jungle of 50 years worth of electrical
wiring, plumbing, and wire used to hold the suspended ceiling. We spent a
whole day on just two rooms. At that rate, we would be throwing cable for
the next two weeks.
   That night we all met in a bar to try to figure out how we were going to
speed things up. Despite our $150 bar tab, nobody had come up with a viable
solution to our cabling woes.
   The next day, while driving onto the base, we were stopped as a caravan
of jeeps and four-wheel-drive trucks crossed the road in front of us. This
sparked an idea.
   I dropped everybody off and headed back into town. When I returned with
a toy remote-control tank, two small flashlights, a spool of fishing line,
and a supply of batteries, everybody thought I was nuts. And when I taped
the flashlights to the top of the tank and tied the fishing line to it,
they were sure I had lost it.
   But when I slid aside a ceiling tile and drove the tank 100 feet along
the top of the ceiling tiles to the next room and then pulled a cable
through with the fishing line, they declared me a genius.
   We went through three sets of batteries for our tank and managed to
finish the job early. I'm still not sure which felt better: winning a bonus
for completing the job under deadline or handing my boss an expense report
with a receipt from Toys-R-Us on it. After I explained how well my
impromptu solution worked, he paid without hesitation.

AVALAN DELIVERS 32-BIT VERSION OF REMOTELY POSSIBLE

By:
Brad Edwards

   Remotely Possible/32 from Avalan Technology Inc. is a Microsoft Windows
95 application--the 32 stands for 32-bit--that lets you control remote PCs,
transfer files, and chat with other computers running Remotely Possible.
With it, telecommuters can access network resources at the office,
help-desk staff and network administrators can solve problems remotely, and
teachers can share computers with their students.
   Remotely Possible/32 works with its 16-bit counterpart, letting a
Windows 95 computer control both Windows 95 and Windows 3.x machines. In
the 16-bit version, however, modem, LAN, and TCP/IP protocols were sold
separately. Remotely Possible/32 will eventually include support for
modems, IPX, NetBIOS, NetBEUI, and TCP/IP in one package. TCP/IP and modem
support is currently offered, and Avalan will ship the LAN protocols to
early adopters when LAN support is available (scheduled for this month).
   The company has also added several features to this version of Remotely
Possible, including the capability to control multiple machines from one
machine or control one machine from multiple machines. The product also
lets you control another machine, transfer files, and chat simultaneously.

Pretty Safe
   Like most remote-control programs, security is a very real concern with
Remotely Possible/32. Basic security measures include a defineable access
list of users and passwords for each computer. In addition, you can enable
and disable specific features for each user, letting someone send files but
not receive them, for instance.
   Remotely Possible/32 also includes a call-back feature, which can
greatly improve network security. After receiving a correct login name and
password, the computer being accessed ``calls back'' the network address.
This requires that the remote user be connecting from a specific computer.
   Unfortunately, a few security features are missing. For one, Remotely
Possible/32 can't combine its access list with the one you can create in
Windows 95 for sharing files and printers, and maintaining two lists is a
hassle. And although information transmitted between PCs is compressed, it
isn't encrypted. A snoop with a packet sniffer could eavesdrop on chat
sessions and file transfers.

Visual Tics
   Remotely Possible/32 comes on a single floppy disk and loads via a
Windows 95 setup program; installation doesn't get much easier than this.
During setup, you must provide a unique license number for each machine you
are installing Remotely Possible on. Thus, you will need a minimum of two
licenses, one for each side of a connection. After installation, you will
want to configure protocol and security options. The program is very
intuitive, and accomplishing this is easy. In fact, Avalan has done a nice
job with all aspects of the user interface.
   When you're ready to use Remotely Possible, it scans the network for
available hosts and lists the ones it finds. To connect, you simply click
on the appropriate host and supply a username and password. From the menu,
you can select remote-control, chat, or file-transfer options.

Taking Control
   Controlling a remote machine is as easy as controlling your own. By
default, the remote screen appears full-screen on your desktop, but you can
also view it as a separate, smaller window. The file-transfer function now
supports drag and drop and long filenames. If you want to transfer a file
from your desktop to a remote machine, you simply drag it to the
file-transfer window. It would be even better, how-
ever, if you could drag a file directly to the remote desktop.
   We ran into a few display problems with Remotely Possible. Once, the
font in a remote DOS window suddenly became larger, causing words to
overlap. And screens weren't always repainted correctly. Fortunately, we
found these problems insignificant and expect many, if not all, of them to
be fixed by the time the LAN protocols are included.

Save a Tree
   Avalan's online help is terrific. Many entries include a screen shot
from the program. Also, you can check the function of items and windows by
just clicking on them. In fact, online help is so good that you may not
need a printed manual. That's fortunate because Avalan doesn't include
printed documentation unless you specifically request it; the company will
provide it at no charge. We applaud their effort to help the environment.
   Remotely Possible/32 is a great program if you need to connect to and
control remote Windows 95 PCs. To many people, Remotely Possible/32 will
prove invaluable. However, if you're looking for a way just to share files,
first check out the built-in networking capabilities that Windows 95
offers. n

REMOTELY POSSIBLE/32
   Avalan Technology's Remotely Possible/32 offers remote-control,
file-transfer, and chat capabilities for both Windows 95 and Windows 3.x
machines. With the remote-control option, you can control many computers
from one PC or one computer from many PCs. Remotely Possible will be of
most use to telecommuters, help-desk personnel, network administrators,
instructors, and anyone who needs remote access.

XIRCOM OPENS THE DOORS
Netaccess proves network access was never easier

By:
M. Harry Johnson

   With the increasing number of telecommuters and mobile users, LAN
administrators face a growing challenge in providing high-performance
remote-access links. Here to help, Xircom Inc.'s Netaccess Multiport Modem
Card is scaleable, stable, and cost-effective. Netaccess comes with either
four or eight internal modems on a single full-length ISA expansion card,
allowing it to work with both older, slower servers and new, high-end
ones.
   The Netaccess card works with remote-access software so mobile users can
dial in as additional nodes on the network. Although access is slower than
a direct link to the network, the 28.8Kbps transfer rate and V.42 data
compression provide surprisingly satisfactory performance. Because multiple
connections on the single board are tied directly to the bus, Netaccess
does not experience performance losses caused by routing data through
serial-port bottlenecks.
   And because the modems are already on the card, users need only phone
lines and RJ-11 cables, eliminating the cost and potential problems of
external modems and cabling. If additional connections are desired, up to
eight Netaccess cards can be used in the same system, providing up to 64
access ports.

Flip a Switch
   Installation of Netaccess is about as simple as it gets. After selecting
a mode of operation on the basis of the software to be used, you simply
turn a thumb-wheel switch to set port configuration and I/O addresses.
   Xircom provides drivers for Asynchronous I/O (AIO) and NDIS (network
driver interface specification) WAN applications and can also be configured
to operate in COM mode. AIO-compatible applications include Novell Inc.'s
NetWare Connect and FUNK Software Inc.'s WanderLink; NDIS WAN programs
include Microsoft Remote Access Service. Both the AIO and NDIS-WAN drivers
use Xircom's proprietary Xircom Mobile API (XMAPI) architecture to increase
data throughput and decrease server overhead by bypassing the system's
serial ports.
   A single four-port Netaccess board supports COM ports 1 through 4 or 5
through 8. When multiple boards are used, up to 64 COM ports can be
simulated on a single system. COM-port mode supports programs such as Lotus
Notes, Symantec Inc. Norton pcANYWHERE Access Server, and Citrix Systems
Inc. WinView for Networks.
   In addition to its applications support, Netaccess supports all standard
asynchronous protocols. To minimize transmission errors, the Netaccess card
uses V.42 and Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) Class 2 through 4
error-correction methods. The card is capable of achieving data-compression
ratios of up to 4-to-1 by its use of V.42bis and MNP5 compression.
   Netaccess also includes good management tools. The AIO driver contains
an SNMP MIB (Management Information Base) structure to facilitate network
management of the device. Over 20 board parameters and 17 port parameters
can be reported by accessing the MIB structure via a NetWare SNMP agent.
Network-management workstations running applications such as
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s HP OpenView or Novell's NMS (NetWare Management
System) can also access the MIB, allowing the monitoring and control of
Netaccess cards in systems attached to the network.
   On the downside, although access to the LAN is limited only by the
applications accessing Netaccess ports, phone communications are restricted
by the board. Analog transmissions are supported, but digital phone links
and PBX systems are not.
   We tested the four-port Netaccess on a NetWare 4.1 server running
NetWare Connect Services 2.0. On both our test machines, one with a 33MHz
Intel Corp. 486 and the other with a 90MHz Intel Pentium processor, error
correction and performance were consistent. After configuring the board and
copying the necessary driver to the server, we set up the system to load
the Xircom drivers on bootup. The company recommends loading NetWare
Connect after the Xircom driver, and in our testing we found this was
necessary for proper operation, not just preferable.
   After configuration, Netaccess ran very smoothly. Dialing in with the
NetWare remote clients, we experienced stable performance and consistently
high throughput, even when all four ports were being used simultaneously.
   Although we experienced no problems, Xircom does provide help in case of
trouble, including a DOS diagnostic utility called MTERM and the necessary
cables. To trouble shoot, you simply connect the loop-back cables to the
RJ-11 ports, load MTERM, and follow screen instructions.
   If you still have problems, Netaccess' documentation is thorough. It
includes complete installation instructions and reference guides for both
Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc.-compatible AT commands and S-register
commands. Technical support is available via the Internet.
   If you are looking for a cost-effective solution to handle a growing
number of mobile users, Netaccess may be just what you need. It works with
AIO, NDIS-WAN, and COM-port remote-access software, delivering stable,
high-performance modem connections.

435 employees.

NETACCESS MULTIPORT MODEM CARD
   Xircom's Netaccess Multiport Modem Card provides mobile users with the
connectivity they need--without breaking your remote-access budget.
Netaccess is fully compatible with third-party software such as Novell
NetWare Connect, Microsoft Remote Access Service, and Symantec Norton
pcANYWHERE Access Server. Netaccess can reliably handle up to 64 users
without bogging down--value that is well worth the price.

TWO COMBO CARDS JOIN THE RACE
Xircom, ActionTec Electronics deliver 28.8Kbps Ethernet/modem PC Cards

By:
John L. Payton

   Two more combination Ethernet/modem PC Card adapters have joined the
high-speed connectivity race: ActionTec Electronics Inc.'s ComNet 28.8 and
Xircom Inc.'s CreditCard Ethernet+Modem 28.8. The companies come to the
playing field with significantly different backgrounds. ActionTec,
previously known as PreMax Electronics Inc., boasts one of the broadest PC
Card lines on the market, whereas Xircom has focused mainly on network
communications.

ActionTec ComNet
   Your users will find it easy to install the ComNet card, mainly because
the DOS-based setup severely limits available options. Only Novell Inc.
NetWare and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups network drivers are included,
and the program offers only two IRQs (interrupt request lines) for Ethernet
operation: 15 and 10. If the modem portion is configured for COM2, only IRQ
3 can be used. If COM3 or COM4 is chosen, the IRQ selection broadens, but
it remains restricted to a value less than the one chosen for the network.
COM1 is entirely unavailable.
   After our installation, the network driver refused to load at all if any
interrupt other than the two ActionTec recommends was selected. In fact,
one of the recommended values allowed the driver to load but would not
activate the Ethernet adapter.
   The manual was of little help. Although it is a satisfactory reference
for modem use and commands, it offers little trouble-shooting information.
The Ethernet portion seems like an afterthought, even though it is located
at the beginning of the book. Technical support was much more helpful in
configuring the card, although they did seem inexperienced with advanced
issues.
   After finding a working network-adapter configuration through a process
of trial and error, we loaded the required Card and Socket Services--no
point enabler was available--and the network drivers. This left memory
available for programs distressingly low, although we could run Windows and
a single program. Our Ethernet communications were smooth, and ComNet
supports Novell's LANalyzer for Windows. The card's physical connection is
the only drawback in this area: ComNet provides an RJ-45 intended to
replace the patch cord.
   The modem portion of the card fared about as well. We had to fight to
make the card work but couldn't argue with performance. Simultaneous
Ethernet/modem operation worked as well as standalone and was actually
easier to configure because the manual's instructions for using the
modem-only enabler are completely inaccurate. And although the manual
claims that cellular capability is available, ActionTec's technical support
staff told us this isn't so--another strike against the documentation.
   ComNet's software bundle is impressive. The package includes Traveling
Software Inc.'s LapLink for Windows, Starfish Software Inc.'s Sidekick
personal organizer, McAfee Associates Inc.'s VirusScan, and CompuServe
Inc.'s Spry Mosaic browser, as well as access software for CompuServe,
America Online, and GENIE. Strangely, no basic communications or fax
software is included.

Xircom CreditCard
   Xircom's CreditCard Ethernet+Modem (CEM) 28.8 has evolved nicely from
the CEM II we reviewed in a comparison last spring (see ``PCMCIA
Ethernet/Modem Cards,'' April 24, 1995, Page 101). Its sophistication is
evident from the moment the installation program auto-detects and loads
Windows. The installation software is also extremely flexible, letting you
customize nearly every aspect of the card. We achieved a working
configuration on our first try. The Ethernet and modem portions operated
well--both independently and simultaneously--even without the help of Card
and Socket Services.
   Xircom technical support told us that, like the CEM II, the CEM 28.8
will not work with LANalyzer. As it turns out, this is not the case at all.
As long as you load the RXMONSTK.COM driver before the Multi-Link Interface
Driver, LANalyzer runs quite well, omitting only runt packets from our
analysis. We had mixed feelings about the situation. We were glad the CEM
28.8 was compatible with LANalyzer, but we worried that technical support
might be offering incorrect information in other areas as well.
   The CEM 28.8 has a separate module for 10Base-2 connections, increasing
its connection flexibility, and administrators will appreciate the card's
SNMP manageability. Unfortunately, a cellular module is not available,
although Xircom is redesigning the card to work with its standard cellular
kit. The company says it will offer an inexpensive swapout when the
redesign is complete.
   The manual, which we barely needed, is well-organized, with equal weight
given to both Ethernet and modem functions. The separate trouble-shooting
guide includes tips for a large number of configurations, evidence of the
testing Xircom has put the card through under different environments. The
CEM 28.8 comes bundled with Delrina Corp.'s WinFax Lite and WinComm Lite,
as well as Shiva Corp.'s ShivaPPP client software.
   You probably won't be surprised to hear that we strongly favored the CEM
28.8. There are some similarities between the products: Both companies
offer support via voice, fax, and BBS; both advertise cellular capability
that does not yet exist; and both achieved about the same performance in
our testing. However, ComNet's requirement of Card and Socket Services
depletes resources that could be put to better use, and CEM 28.8's setup
and documentation were clearly superior.
   ActionTec Electronics Inc., 750 North Mary Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94086;

NETSHIELD VS. NET-PROT
Two stellar products offer virus protection for your network

By:
Tom Springer

   Approximately 100 new computer viruses appear each month, adding to the
6,000 known viruses currently in existence. Network file servers are
especially susceptible to infection, and experts agree that virus
prevention is much easier than virus removal. Both NET-PROT from Command
Software Systems Inc. and NetShield 2.2 from McAfee Associates Inc. are
effective virus-detection programs that, when used with the companies'
disinfection tools, can help keep your system free of uninvited guests.

The Match Game
   Although NET-PROT and NetShield each use proprietary virus-scanning
technology, the basic functionality of the two products is the same. Both
perform on-demand, on-access, and periodic scanning of network traffic to
prevent viruses from loading. NET-PROT, however, can only perform periodic
scans weekly; NetShield offers daily, weekly, or monthly scans. For added
flexibility, both tools let you specify certain files and volumes for
exclusion from a scan, although only NetShield will let you exclude
directories.
   If a scan detects an infected file, both NET-PROT and NetShield can
delete the file or move it to a specific location. To disinfect a virus,
however, you must run workstation versions of the server software.
NET-PROT's version, F-PROT PROFESSIONAL, is included with the product, but
NetShield's offering, VirusScan, must be purchased separately.
   NetShield's management console integrates very well with
VirusScan-convenient when you want to immediately disinfect a file after
virus detection. NET-PROT, on the other hand, requires you to exit the
operator's console and run F-PROT PROFESSIONAL from DOS.
   Each product uses its own scheme to maintain network performance during
a scan. NET-PROT uses configureable utilization levels; you set scans to
occur only when CPU utilization falls below a certain value. This method
ensures that a periodic scan will not run when the network is busy.
NetShield uses a priority scheme, with a highest priority of one and a
lowest of 10. McAfee claims that a priority one periodic scan is about 10
times faster than a priority 10 scan.

Caught Them All
   Both products could detect all our test viruses, but NetShield took much
longer to do so. NET-PROT scanned a 500MB volume in just over two minutes,
but a priority one NetShield scan of the same volume took almost six
minutes.
   NetShield beats NET-PROT regarding administrator notification. Both
products can broadcast a network message to specified users when a scan
detects a virus, but only NetShield offers E-mail and pager notification.
Unless you constantly check NET-PROT's log file, you may be unaware a virus
has infected your system, giving it more time to spread.
   NET-PROT and NetShield offer basic password-protection capabilities and
optional security features. For example, NET-PROT can automatically log off
any user who tries to copy an infected file to the network, and NetShield
can restrict write access to certain files, directories, or users. Overall
though, we found that NetShield provides a little more flexibility for
those networks that need extra security.
   And although both companies claim their products can detect previously
unknown viruses, some new viruses always go undetected, and McAfee and
Command Software continually update their lists of known viruses. With a
site license you can download the latest updates from Command Software's
list without charge; McAfee, on the other hand, requires a two-year
maintenance fee.

What It Takes
   NET-PROT and NetShield use a Microsoft Windows-based management console,
and NET-PROT includes a DOS version if you don't prefer a GUI. Neither
product supports Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh or IBM OS/2 systems.
   NET-PROT requires a file server with 85K of free RAM running Novell Inc.
NetWare 3.x or 4.x. The management console only requires DOS 2.0 or
higher.
   NetShield requires a NetWare 3.x or 4.x file server with 718K of free
RAM and 18MB of free disk space. The operator's console requires at least a
386SX, 4MB of RAM, a VGA monitor, DOS 5.0 or higher, and Windows 3.1. If
you are running NetWare 3.11 or 3.12, you will also need several NLM
patches. They are included on the CD-ROM release and are available for
download. The NetShield client works with either Windows 3.1 or Windows
95.
   Despite NetShield's slower speed, we really had no complaints about
either product's performance. Note, however, that NET-PROT requires
significantly fewer system resources than NetShield.
   We were up and running with NET-PROT in about five minutes; NetShield's
installation, on the other hand, was much more difficult. We discovered
that if the attributes for AIO.NLM and AIOCOMX.NLM are set to read-only,
the installation program--after it is 97 percent completed--will notify you
that the target directory is read-only and you should check to see if you
have the appropriate rights. This message can be confusing, especially if
you are running the installation from a supervisor account with complete
privileges. To finish the installation, you must change the attributes of
the two NLM files.
   Also, NetShield uses search path 1 to point to the system directory. If
another module previously defined search path 1, NetShield will not load.
We think the program should be smart enough to use the next available
search path.
   Although NetShield is more powerful and has more features than NET-PROT,
it is also slower and considerably more expensive. Generally, we prefer
NET-PROT for single-server systems and NetShield for multiserver
environments. How-
ever, you won't go wrong with either; both provide excellent ways to keep a
network free of viruses.

NET-PROT
   Compared with McAfee's NetShield, Command Software's NET-PROT lacks some

MICRO LOGIC INFO SELECT IS A PIM FOR EVERYONE

By:
Thom Duncan

   If you believe the hype, groupware applications suites are the wave of
the future--along with the increased RAM and hard disk requirements they
will entail. Supposedly, the days of the small single-purpose program are
over. Don't believe it. One of the best information-management utilities
we've seen came to us on a single floppy disk and runs well on an Intel
Corp. 386-based machine with Microsoft Windows 3.1 and 4MB of RAM.
   We speak of Micro Logic Corp.'s Info Select 3, a note-taker, planner,
and PIM (personal information manager) fused into a single package. That
description isn't an exaggeration; Info Select really is all those
things--and more. Even better, Info Select's interface is just as
versatile.
   Info Select's opening window is a split screen, with a treelike
directory called the Selector on the left and a work space on the right.
The Selector contains different data types--Notes, Topics, Forms, and
Calendars--each of which is indicated by its own icon. Other icons in the
Selector indicate that a particular item in the database has an associated
file, is read-only, has a user-imposed search barrier, or is a template
that can be used for the creation of new items.
   Notes are used for free-form text documents; if you suddenly get an idea
for a new project, you can just press `Alt-Tab' to access Info Select and
start typing. Notes' word-processing features are basic but adequate,
including simple page-layout options. If you're organized, you can place
Notes into categories. Topics act like folders, classifying data into
headings and subheadings. You can use the flexible Forms feature to take
phone messages, prepare purchase orders, conduct surveys, manage invoices,
or organize any type of field-oriented information. Design tools for Forms
are also basic but functional. With Calendars, you can schedule
appointments, one-time events, recurring events, ticklers, and so on.
   For such a simple program, Info Select contains fairly sophisticated
search capabilities, and we searched our sample database at very acceptable
speeds. Search tools include exact, neural (fuzzy), Boolean, size,
data-range, and change-date searches.
   Info Select's interface includes a tool bar, a folder bar, and a status
bar. The tool bar provides a quick way to perform common tasks--pulling up
a Calendar, for instance--and it can be customized or hidden from view. The
folder bar provides shortcuts for formatting font style, size, and color.

Stripped Down
   Info Select's network capabilities stay true to the lean, mean design of
the rest of the product. Co-workers can share name and address databases,
keep group to-do lists, and distribute just about any kind of information
to other Info Select users. Although multiple users can view shared files,
only one user can edit a shared file at a time.
   Installing Info Select on a network is fairly straightforward. In
addition to its built-in data-sharing capabilities, the program can hook
into your E-mail system, letting you send and receive Info Select data.
After installing Info Select on a server, you must create a subdirectory on
a shared drive; Info Select files that contain shared data are placed in
this directory.
   For a workstation to be able to use the data-sharing capabilities, it
must be manually configured. After installing Info Select on the
workstation, you run the network-installation program, which asks for the
path to the shared directories.
   Info Select is an information manager designed to yield maximum utility
to those with minimum experience. Users won't have to learn complex
data-entry procedures, nor will they be forced to upgrade older PCs to take
advantage of Info Select's excellent features. This isn't a full-fledged
groupware application, but if your users need to share basic data, this
could be a fairly painless way to achieve it.

                 INFO SELECT
This one-floppy-disk wonder gives network users an amazing amount of
functionality. Users can enter notes in a free-form manner or in structured
manner on the basis of personal preference. Info Select searches and finds
data in acceptable times without indexing and, thus, without adding to hard
disk space.

MULTISTACK MORE THAN SUM OF PARTS
Digital's component collection combines existing network technology in
better way

By:
Tere' Parnell

   At first glance, there's nothing breathtaking about Digital Equipment
Corp.'s MultiStack System, the recently announced manifestation of the
company's enVISN strategy. The hub, switch, and router technology that
makes up the MultiStack System has been around for a while. But although
the MultiStack doesn't offer any original functionality, it does deliver
the management paradigm that administrators of small- to medium-sized
networks have been waiting for.

What We Waited for
   The MultiStack System is a hot-swappable collection of internetworking
components that includes Digital's 90 series repeaters, the RoamAbout
wireless network hub, and the NetRider remote-access hub. The excitement
about the MultiStack System is that it can be managed as a single SNMP
management domain using HUBWatch, Digital's management software. By
providing for stacks of key components up to 16 hubs high, Digital finally
delivers the flexibility and management network administrators have always
needed. What's more, all this is available at a realistic price. For
example, 10Base-T hubs cost as little as $50 per port.
   Because of its extreme manageability, remote-access capability, and
compact size, the MultiStack System is especially well-suited for
branch-office networks. Initially, you can stack the components on a table
top in the branch office. Later, as the office grows, you can mount the
MultiStack components in a standard 19-inch rack. You can distribute
MultiStack components throughout your network as necessary up to 185 meters
apart, and you can install 90 series hub modules in a DEChub 900
MultiSwitch hub chassis.
   The MultiStack System also integrates with Digital's DECswitch family to
form what Digital calls ``switched edge stacks.'' This provides a fairly
easy and inexpensive way to implement switching in high-traffic segments.

Tough Installation
   We found piecing together the components of the MultiStack System a
challenge. We had to wade through a swamp of documentation--much of it
inadequate--to find the tidbits of information we needed. Configuring
HUBWatch is also an involved and time-consuming process. Allow yourself
plenty of time to get acquainted with this system before expecting to
perform management miracles with it. Still, once configured, MultiStack is
an administrator's paradise--a neat, compact stack manageable as a single
domain.
   To test the MultiStack System's hardiness, we flooded the ports of one
of the hubs until it auto-partitioned and lost its connection to the rest
of the stack. Even then we could see the device on HUBWatch, although we
couldn't manage it. Management for the rest of the stack was unaffected
thanks to MultiStack's use of a separate channel to integrate SNMP
connections. This provides a particularly robust means of managing all
devices in the stack, although sometimes--as in our test--maintaining
contact with a partitioned device isn't much help.
   Digital's MultiStack System, a new paradigm in network management,
delivers internetworking the way it should be. This relatively low-cost
system brings together hubs, switches, remote-access hubs, and wireless
devices into a compact and easy-to-manage stack. Although you've seen
devices like these before, you've never seen them work together quite like
this. They snap together quickly and easily, and once the configuration
headaches are behind you, they manage as a single SNMP domain with
Digital's HUBWatch software. The system is flexible, sturdy, easily
expandable, and cost-effective. Our only question was, what took so long?

List Prices: $795, DECrepeater 90T-16 stackable hub; $995, DECrepeater 90TS
stackable hub; $2,245, RoamAbout Access Point; $3,650, NetRider Access.

DEBATING DESKTOP MANAGEMENT
Group identifies performance, control, and cost as issues hindering tool
deployment

By:
Claudia Graziano

(SAN FRANCISCO)
   Desktop-management tools still have a way to go before securing a place
in corporate America.
   At least that seemed to be the general conclusion drawn by a group of
vendors, analysts, and users assembled here last month to discuss the topic
of desktop management.
   Participants in the round-table discussion--moderated by the Enterprise
Management Institute and sponsored by LAN Times--cited a mislaid emphasis
on completing tasks rather than meeting business objectives as a key reason
for the slow adoption of desktop-management tools.
   Although the purpose of the round table was to take stock of the current
state of desktop management, there was little discussion of the technology
behind the tools themselves. Instead, the discussion centered around more
philosophic topics, such as defining the functions of desktop management
and exploring the relationship between LAN managers and users within an
organization.
   Representatives from top desktop-management software
developers--including Intel Corp., McAfee Associates Inc., and Microsoft
Corp.--agreed that users should be more aware of what it takes to manage
their systems but disagreed on how much awareness was appropriate.
   ``Users hate the fact that they don't see any perceived value in systems
management,'' said David Hamilton, network- and systems-management product
manager at Microsoft. ``They're concerned about the Big Brother issue;
they're concerned about administrators having too much control.''
   But reconciling users' wants and administrators' needs can be a
balancing act.
   ``I think it's scary to give [users] a lot of control,'' said Rick
Kreysar, vice president of marketing at McAfee in Santa Clara, Calif. ``Too
much perceived value and you're going to up your support calls.'' He
suggested that perceived value may be in making management processes that
occur at the desktop invisible to the user.
   Other participants pointed out that restricting users' desktop
activities could cause a similarly negative reaction.
   ``People are looking at ways to minimize the amount of effort it takes
to maintain a certain number of users,'' said Stephen Saks, chief
information officer for California Trucking Association in Sacramento.
``But what sometimes happens is you wind up with more support calls, with
IS individuals fixing problems that don't exist,'' he said.
   Another key point of discussion centered around getting other
departments in an organization involved in desktop management.
   ``It's hard to [justify tools] to the head of the engineering or
manufacturing department. The MIS guy understands the cost benefits [of
desktop-management tools], but the head of the manufacturing department is
the guy who ultimately has to sign off on it, and he may not understand how
that's going to increase his department's productivity,'' said Kreysar.
   ``In a lot of ways desktop management is still an evangelistic market,''
said Ken Mackin, systems-management strategy manager at Intel in Hillsboro,
Ore. ``There is a lack of education about what these tools can do.''
   From a customer standpoint, there is also a great deal of skepticism
about what tools can do, volunteered California Trucking's Saks. ``There
are a lot of [vendor] promises made but very few are kept,'' he said.
``You're going to hear a lot more `I'll believe it when I see it' '' as
tools evolve.
   In many ways, the notion of network management is changing, said analyst
Michael Howard, president of Infonetics Research Inc. in San Jose, Calif.
   ``I predict that in five to seven years we won't even use the term
network management because we're going to get to the point with ATM where
there will be no network monitoring. You'll probably outsource that to your
phone company.'' Instead, business management will become the focus. ``I
would suggest that there is an eighth layer to the OSI [Open Systems
Interconnection] model, and that's the business layer.'' Desktop and
systems management will be inherent in how organizations apply network
resources, he said.
   ``Our job will be done when PCs are managed by the human-resources
department,'' summed up Intel's Mackin.

On defining desktop management:
   ``We believe that you need to make a clear distinction between systems
and network management. Systems-management solutions should function
whether or not the network is there.''--Ken Mackin, systems-management
strategy manager, emerging technologies group, Intel Corp.

   ``I'm afraid of breaking network and systems management up. I think that
we have to turn it around and start looking at business issues like cost of
ownership and work from that perspective, rather than be too careful with
our definition of what the particular areas are.''--David Hamilton,
network- and systems-management product manager, Microsoft Corp.

   ``Desktop management, from my perspective, is how do I provide my end
users with the tools that let them be as productive and creative as
possible? Far too often you end up frustrating the user [with management]
instead of providing them with something that gives them the ability to
perform at a higher level.''--Stephen Saks, chief information officer,
California Trucking Association

On the cost justification of tools:
   ``Network management is easier to [cost] justify than systems management
because network management is about routers and hubs and bridges. These are
things people can understand and care about. I think we're not as
user-focused or as business-oriented as we need to be to sell systems
management.''--David Hamilton, Microsoft

   ``When you go and tell executive officers, `We can reduce our workload
by using this tool,' they're not going to care because it doesn't impact
the bottom line.''--Stephen Saks, California Trucking Association

   ``If you can turn your management products into middleware and deliver
that data to some financial-management package, then all of a sudden you
can make a business case for buying and installing a particular
[management] module or solution.''--Ken Mackin, Intel

   ``Management has to be central; it has to be built into the network from
the ground up. If we assume management is a value add, we're going to have
trouble moving on.''--David Hamilton, Microsoft

On the struggle for control:
   ``Our biggest problems are caused because [network managers] don't have
centralized control, but at the same time, users don't want you to have
centralized control.''--Rick Kreysar, vice president of marketing, McAfee
Associates Inc.

   ``The only effective way to control the desktop is to have an absolutely
clear corporate mission about what you are controlling and why you are
controlling it.''--Michael Howard, president, Infonetics Research Inc.

   ``Too many developers are out there trying to convince the IS people
that they are the important ones--that they make the decisions and that
they will dictate to everyone else.''--Stephen Saks, California Trucking
Association

   ``Desktop management is like outsourcing in that you're really
transferring responsibility of the system to someone else. If you think of
management in terms of outsourcing, it changes what you think you can
[control] and how you try to do it.''--Rick Sturm, principal, Enterprise
Management Institute Inc.

On promoting the use of tools:
   ``When we say we need to provide business solutions instead of
technology solutions, I think what we really mean is that we need to think
about who we're defining solutions for, and we need to recognize that the
financial person in an organization needs to be involved.''--Ken Mackin,
Intel

   ``Networks are becoming a commodity--almost. The people who take care of
commodities are not as sophisticated as the people in the glass house. You
can no longer give somebody a tool and expect them to figure it out, write
their own code and macros and such.''--Rick Kreysar, McAfee

   ``I agree we have to make management [tools] easy for the administrator,
but we also have to convince end users of its value. Whether its helping
them tune their systems, making applications work together, or showing them
that they get better help-desk support.
   ``I'd like users to know [management] is there and see value in it
rather than have to hide it.''--David Hamilton, Microsoft

MICROSOFT TO SPEED UP SNA OVER WIDE AREA

By:
Brian Riggs

   Network administrators are eyeing Microsoft Corp.'s upcoming
architecture for distributed SNA gateways that promises to combat session
loss, excessive bandwidth utilization, and complex management.
   Distributed gateways, made possible when Microsoft integrates the
Distributed Gateway Service into its new SNA Open Gateway Architecture
(SOGA) later this month, are intended to transform SNA Server into a
scaleable framework for transporting and managing SNA traffic among
multiple branch offices.
   The first products to support SOGA include Sourcecom Corp.'s Incarda
server internetworking card and Polaris Communications Inc.'s System 2000
Gateway. Bay Networks Inc., Sync Research Inc., and others are expected to
announce products later in the year.
   SOGA-supporting hardware is expected to let SNA and LAN traffic run over
wide-area connections without excessive timeouts, high bandwidth
requirements, or complicated management techniques.
   SNA network administrators have used recent versions of SNA Server to
connect branch offices to a centralized host via SDLC (Synchronous Data
Link Control) leased lines or the 802.2/Logical Link Control protocol.
Alternately, remote LANs can connect to a central SNA gateway using
standard LAN protocols. But these solutions have led to timeouts and high
bandwidth utilization.
   ``What we need is a way to run IP without having to encapsulate it into
SNA,'' said Mark Lee, systems consultant at the Bank of Hawaii in
Honolulu.
   The Bank of Hawaii currently connects 70 branch offices to its Honolulu
headquarters by running SNA over X.25 lines. Lee, who is planning to use a
Unix server for data warehousing later in the year, has been looking at SNA
Server as a way to send IP over the SNA backbone. ``Microsoft came in and
showed us how we could use [the current version of] SNA Server, but we
found it to be unreliable and slow,'' he said.
   Lee said he is counting on SOGA's upcoming Distributed Gateway Service
to transport both host and server traffic over native TCP/IP.
   Existing approaches to SNA transport have worked well in campus
environments because fiber and 100Mbps Ethernet provides users with plenty
of bandwidth, according to Lynn Nye, president of NetResults, a consultancy
in Portland, Ore.
   But when SNA data from branch offices is transported over the wide area
at the 56Kbps and 1.544Mbps speeds that are typical of WAN services,
response times between host and branch can slow to a crawl, he said.
   Moreover, when using equipment such as 802.2 connectors, SNA transport
is subject to unpredictable delays caused by session loss. And when
transported over the wide area via TCP/IP, client transmissions to
centralized SNA gateway servers can carry as much as 200 percent more
overhead compared with local- and campus-area transmissions.
   SOGA's Distributed Gateway Service, on the other hand, lets
administrators deploy SNA gateways at each branch site. All remote gateways
connect to the host and all traffic between gateways uses native TCP/IP,
IPX, or Banyan Systems Inc. VINES.
   Without the 802.2 connectors, SNA WANs based on SOGA are not expected to
experience session loss. And because SNA is running natively over IP,
traffic will occupy considerably less bandwidth, letting network
administrators use small, less-expensive WAN lines, Nye said.
   From a management perspective, network administrators using SOGA will be
able to pool logical units (LUs) over the wide area. This is expected to
reduce the total number of LUs that need to be managed. With gateways at
each branch site and all gateways connected with TCP/IP, administrators can
extend IBM's NetView management platform over the wide area. ``In the past,
[network managers] could only see central-site gateways with NetView,'' Nye
said.
   But because SOGA's Distributed Gateway Service lets SNA gateways be
distributed to all branch locations, managers will have a complete view of
all gateways on the WAN, he said.
   For more information, call Microsoft in Redmond, Wash., at (206)
882-8080; Sourcecom in Santa Clarita, Calif., at (805) 294-0555; and
Polaris in Beaverton, Ore., at (503) 643-1533.

WINGRA E-MAIL SWITCH MAKES MISSIVE ACCESSIBLE

By:
Brent Dorshkind

   Aiming to bring E-mail integration to a wider audience, Wingra
Technologies Inc. has announced Missive/AIX, a software-based switch that
starts at $15,000 and runs on an RS/6000 workstation.
   The switch, which can route and convert E-mail messages among a wide
range of LAN, mainframe, and Internet mail systems, is aimed at customers
who can't afford or don't need the company's VAX-based message switches.
The product is also one of the first E-mail tools to use World Wide
Web-based administration tools.
   Missive/AIX is the first of a series of products that will utilize open
systems and emphasize ease of use. The company plans versions of the
product for Microsoft Windows NT as well as other flavors of Unix.
   ``Wingra has moved from the proprietary world into the enlightened Unix
world,'' said Mark Levitt, senior analyst at International Data Corp., a
market-research company in Framingham, Mass. ``That opens up a much larger
potential customer base.''
   That customer base will get an E-mail switching core that includes a
1988 X.500-compliant directory; an integrated message router; document
conversion software; and IPX, TCP, and Digital Equipment Corp. DECnet
transport-level protocol stacks. Individual E-mail packages are then tied
into the Missive/AIX core via ``channels,'' that average $3,000 a piece.
The $15,000 entry price includes channels for two E-mail systems.
   Wingra is shipping channels for Lotus cc:Mail and Notes Mail, Microsoft
Mail, Novell Inc. GroupWise, and other MHS (Message Handling Service)- and
Global MHS-based E-mail systems such as ON Technology Corp. Da Vinci eMAIL.
Digital VMSmail, Digital Message Router, and E-mail systems based on
SMTP/MIME (Simple Message Transfer Protocol/Multipurpose Internet Message
Extension) channels are also available. A channel for IBM PROFS is
scheduled to ship by April, and X.400 support is due by year-end.
   Missive/AIX administrators can also access the user directory from a Web
browser. This not only simplifies management but also allows remote
administration. Registered users can browse the directory to search for
E-mail addresses and modify a configureable subset of attributes, such as
document conversion profiles, phone numbers, and addresses. Users without
browsers can use E-mail to query the directory for other users' E-mail
addresses.
   Missive/AIX is targeted to threaten message switch products from vendors
such as Control Data Systems Inc. and Lotus Development Corp that often
cost $100,000 more and require extensive customization--often at additional
expense.
   ``I was in the market for something easy,'' said an E-mail administrator
at an East Coast financial services firm, who--citing company
policy--declined to be identified in print. He claimed he was able to bring
Missive/AIX online, fully configured to integrate cc:Mail, Notes Mail, and
Unix SMTP mail systems in only one and a half hours.
   Innosoft International Inc. and Worldtalk Corp also offer low-cost
message switches. However, the real challenge to Missive/AIX could come
from the next-generation of E-mail products, which support SMTP and X.400
natively.
   Even with the deployment of such E-mail packages, Missive/AIX and
products like it will still have a place when companies have multiple
E-mail systems. ``Even those users who have committed to migrating to a
single E-mail system will need time to do that,'' said Levitt. ``Until
that's in place, they will still need products to connect their existing
systems.''

ATTACHMATE TO CONNECT MAINFRAMES TO NET
Acquisition yields Web-based workgroup products for legacy systems

By:
R. Scott Raynovich

   Following its planned acquisition of Internet software specialist The
Wollongong Group Inc., Attachmate Corp. will deliver a series of workgroup
products that let businesses use World Wide Web-based applications to
connect to mainframe systems.
   Products planned for the first quarter include the Emissary Host
Publishing System and Emissary Workgroup. In addition to allowing mainframe
data to be converted into HTML (HyperText Markup Language) format, the
products will also offer E-mail, group conferencing, and Internet browsing
capabilities. The server-side products will be based on Microsoft Windows
NT and the client-side products will be based on Microsoft Windows 3.1 and
Windows 95.
   Industry watchers say Attachmate's approach will permit the integration
of mainframe systems with Web applications, improving connectivity across
internal TCP/IP-based corporate intranets or the Internet.
   ``A lot of people don't want to deal with emulation or other software to
bring the mainframe interface to the desktop,'' said Clay Ryder, analyst
with Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. ``If you can deliver
mainframe data as a Web page, you'll deliver a universal access client.''
When its deal to acquire Wollongong is finalized, Attachmate will get
Emissary, a highly regarded Web browser that also integrates messaging and
file-system functions. Emissary is based on Wollongong's Client Object
Linking Technology (COLT), which links OLE-based objects and applications
through a single interface. Emissary will form the basis of Attachmate's
new browsing interfaces, and Attachmate's OpenMind collaboration software
will be combined with Emissary to further develop its capabilities.
   Attachmate officials said their goal is to offer an architecture that
lets companies use Emissary Workgroup and Emissary Office as the standard
corporate interface for exchanging information.
   Sandy Bateh, assistant computer systems officer for the city of
Jacksonville, Fla., said he may eventually use the Attachmate products to
provide the city's desktops with both mainframe and Internet access.
   Bateh said he has been using Attachmate products for mainframe access
and would like to consolidate Internet browsing with mainframe access. This
would be cheaper than paying licensing fees for both Attachmate's
host-connectivity products and Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator.
   Some analysts say that using COLT to exchange OLE objects over networks
in combination with Attachmate's collaboration technology will make the
Emissary products attractive to IS managers trying to consolidate client
platforms.
   ``Emissary's automatic-update feature and Attachmate's
software-management features are the types of things that will help IS
deploy Internet products,'' said Tim Sloane, director of messaging for The
Aberdeen Group Inc. in Boston. Sloane said vendors such as IBM, Digital
Equipment Corp., and Oracle Corp. have provided tools for integrating
databases into the Web but that the products are limited to their own
proprietary technologies.
   Attachmate's Host Publishing System will come with database tools that
let programmers integrate PC applications with IBM DB2, DB2/400, and
SQL/DS databases. The publishing system itself will enable on-the-fly
conversion of IBM host screens into HTML pages, letting users browse
mainframes just like Web servers.
   Emissary Workgroup will include the Windows NT-based server components
and Windows 95 and 3.1 clients for Internet and file browsing, group
conferencing, and document management.
   Both Emissary Workgroup and the Host Publishing System are expected in
the first quarter. Pricing has not been set.

WANG TO COMBINE IMAGING, HSM TOOL
Avail acquisition to enhance document-image management and workflow
products

By:
Stephen Loudermilk

   Wang Laboratories Inc.'s move to acquire Avail Systems Corp. last month
could put an end to the cumbersome task of storing large document images on
many different enterprise servers.
   In upcoming products due in the first half of next year, Wang plans to
combine storage-management technology gained from Avail with its OPEN/image
and OPEN/workflow server software, company officials said. Furthermore,
this convergence of storage-management and imaging technology resulting
from the merger will expand on existing partnerships that both Wang and
Avail have with Microsoft Corp.
   A front end to Wang's ImageView client piece will be integrated by
Microsoft in the next release of Microsoft Windows 95, code-named Memphis
and due next year, Wang officials said. Separately, Microsoft has already
embedded Avail's NetSpace Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) software in
Windows NT, and it will also be included in Cairo, the forthcoming version
of NT due in 1997.
   From their desktops, users will be able to click on an ImageView icon in
the Memphis version of Windows 95 and launch a full-blown document-imaging
application. Network managers, meanwhile, will be able to view,
manipulate, and archive document images on Windows 95 desktops and then
store the massive-image data types on tightly linked Windows NT servers.
   Billerica, Mass.-based Wang exchanged 1.8 million shares of its common
stock for Avail, valued at $18 per share or approximately $32 million.
Avail will become the Enterprise Storage Division of Wang's software
business unit.
   Robert Wight, president and CEO of Avail in Boulder, Colo., expects the
merged products to simplify the job for users now managing proprietary
hardware dedicated to either imaging or storage-management software.
   ``There is a natural need to integrate [imaging and storage management]
together,'' said Wight. ``We are taking a new step in going away from
proprietary products with [new] products that do imaging, backup, and
storage management on [any] NT server.''
   Gerry Murray, senior analyst with International Data Corp. in
Framingham, Mass., said that a lack of imaging and storage-management
integration has affected large companies burdened with too many imaging
systems.
   ``This is a real nightmare and obstacle for large organizations,'' said
Murray. ``For large companies with 10,000 employees, there are about five
or six different imaging systems, and there is a frustration in waiting for
the image at the desktop.'' Murray explained that having a variety of 
servers can complicate the task of processing and sending images to Windows
95 clients.
   Bob Abraham, vice president of Freeman Associates in Santa Barbara,
Calif., agreed. ``Now the marriage and the integration can happen. The user
wants an open approach that was previously separate between Wang and
Avail.''
Murray said the convergence of imaging technology with storage-management
systems lets images be stored as just another data type in workgroup
environments.
   ``The storage-level piece of the puzzle links a production-level system
and a workgroup,'' he said.
   NetSpace users expect that the Wang plans for product integration will
improve the performance of document imaging and other applications.
   ``We are using [Avail's] HSM software for CAD drawing,'' said Earl
Huskamp, MIS manager at Professional Engineering Consultants in Wichita,
Kan. ``If Wang adds more storage--such as optical jukeboxes--that would
help me out.''

NOVELL'S ROAD AHEAD
After a tumultuous year, company looks to steady the ship

By:
Amanda Mitchell Henry

   After spending the better part of last year cleaning house, Novell Inc.
is now under pressure to deliver promised technology to skeptical
customers.
   Unburdened by products such as Unix and misfit business applications,
Novell has freed itself this year to persevere in its goal to make NetWare
4.x a de facto networking infrastructure on which a company's core services
run. One key to that strategy is the agreements forged with Hewlett-Packard
Co., The Santa Cruz Operation Inc., and possibly other vendors to ship
versions of those companies' Unix operating systems with integrated NetWare
services.
   That infrastructure strategy has also conveniently given way to new
phrases coined by Novell, such as Client Network Computing--a paradigm
whereby NetWare no longer competes head to head with Microsoft Windows NT.
Rather, Novell is pledging to better integrate its products with those from
Microsoft Corp. and has, for example, developed a working prototype of a
server interface between NetWare services and NT.
   ``We decided that we are not going to fight it out in [the
applications-server] market. Instead we will provide networking services to
all sides,'' said Novell CEO and Chairman Robert Frankenberg, whose Client
Network Computing concept includes a set of programmable services that
would be provided by the network. Under the company's abandoned plan for
SuperNOS--the hybrid operating system that had been slated to combine
NetWare 4.x and UnixWare--Novell would have competed squarely with
Microsoft on the applications-server front.
   And the newer, leaner Novell is not finished. On a conciliatory note,
Frankenberg admitted that his ``objective is to execute product plans on
time with great quality and not disappoint our customers. In the past we
haven't done that, so this will be an intense focus for us.''
   In recognizing that a directory-enabled infrastructure is nothing
without the software, Frankenberg has pledged to round up by year-end at
least six times as many of the 140 NDS-compliant applications that exist
today. As promised in last fall's product road map, in 1996 Novell will
also ship the Green River version of its operating system with support for
NetWare Distributed Print Services (NDPS) and its Net2000 SDK (software
developer's kit).
   And as many as 200 Novell Embedded Systems Technology (NEST)-enabled
devices will be available by year-end, as opposed to today's 24 products,
to spread the NetWare infrastructure within reach of office products.
   On the applications side, Novell is hanging on to its groupware product,
despite the pending sale of its other business applications, and is due to
ship its Lotus Notes competitor, GroupWise XTD, this year.
   Making ship dates is key, according to at least one reseller. ``We are
looking for Novell to stick to its schedule of new products,'' said Andrew
Percy, chief technology officer for systems-integrator Edge Information
Systems in San Jose, Calif. ``The three key pieces we are expecting for
next year as things that will help us develop our business will be the
arrival of SMP [symmetric multiprocessing] products through the OEM
process, the GroupWise XTD product, and the [Microsoft Windows 95] client
software.''
   Novell's Windows 95 client for NetWare is currently in its second beta
release.

To Be or Not to Be--Bought
   From the outside looking in, a whittled-down Novell may appear to be
turning itself into an opportunity ripe for acquisition. Not so, according
to Frankenberg, who contends he is simply busy divesting himself and the
company he runs from a strategy once bent on competing directly with
Microsoft. ``We have no interest in making ourselves more valuable to a
suitor. I actually think that we are more valuable independent.''
   Numbers show that Frankenberg--now in his second year at Novell's
helm--has his work cut out for him because, for the first time, the company
is facing a market-share battle. Last year Novell lost three points from
its leading position among NOS makers, dropping to 62.2 percent in a market
that reached $1.2 billion, according to a 1995 midyear LAN
operating-systems analysis by International Data Corp. in Framingham,
Mass.
   At the same time, IDC's report found that Windows NT is picking up steam
in a market where Novell has firmly held its ground. Although Novell was
heartened to find that NetWare 4.1 shipments reached 96,100 and earned 22.6
percent of the LAN OS market, many of those sales replaced NetWare 3.x
shipments.
   Among the OSes mentioned in the report, Windows NT managed to increase 
its market share by the greatest amount with shipments jumping 70 percent
between the first and second quarters of 1995. Windows NT landed a 13.3
percent share of the market for the first half of 1995, with 68,000
file-server licenses sold.
   This year, Frankenberg said he wants to ``gain that [lost market share]
back, plus a couple of more points.''
   But Novell's greatest challenge is in winning new installations, said
Jesse Berst, editor of Windows Watcher newsletter in Redmond, Wash. ``Both
NetWare 4.1 and Windows NT started from a very small base. So while the
companies trumpet about increases, it's not just the percentage of growth
year over year and not just unit shipments that's important. The key marker
is new business.''

Eye on the Internet
   Frankenberg is looking to add more Internet capabilities to Novell's
lineup, so the World Wide Web craze has not been lost on Novell. Last month
the company shipped its $995 NetWare Web Server and last November delivered
on its long-awaited AT&T NetWare Connect Services.
   Furthermore, Frankenberg outlined plans for Novell to become ``protocol
agnostic'' beginning with this summer's release of Green River, which will
include IP out of the box as a configuration option.
   Nevertheless, the company missed its year-end deadline to ship Ferret
and Corsair, Novell's browser and Internet-development environment,
respectively. And it is now in the shadow of a recent Web marketing thrust
by Microsoft. The software giant plans to integrate its forthcoming
Internet Information Server directly into Windows NT as a key piece of an
all-Microsoft Web-access solution.
   Frankenberg pointed out the bottom line when analyzing a product that
has yet to be delivered: performance. ``Think about what a Web server
does,'' he said. ``It's a file and print server in the form of printing
electronic documents. NetWare does that better than anything else on the
market.''

LAN TIMES SURVEY: SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS

By:
Sean Pfister and Adrienne Russell

   LAN management can be compared to politics: Everybody talks about the
problems, but most people find it difficult to do anything about them.
   According to a recent survey of LAN Times readers, the network- and
systems-management problem is well-understood: As networks grow in both
size and complexity, so do the responsibilities of the LAN manager. At
various times any combination of network analysis and planning, server
management, and desktop management all fall under the purview of the
average network manager, but not with equal weight. Many, it turns out,
simply don't use available management tools.
   The most telling and least surprising finding from the survey is that
network managers can expect an increase in their workload for 1996. An
average LAN Times site is moving from one LAN segment to three LAN segments
per network manager in the next 12 months. Across all organizations
surveyed, the average number of PCs will increase a year from now by an
average of 8 percent and LAN segments will increase by 71 percent, but the
size of networking staffs are projected to decrease somewhat, from an
average of 11 to about nine.
   More than half of all managers surveyed are responsible for networks at
remote locations. Of these, about six in 10 manage remote networks from
local consoles. Despite this, 34 percent take at least one monthly trip to
a remote location for trouble shooting LANs. The 40 percent of managers not
administering remote networks locally take an average of five trips per
month for trouble shooting.

Setting Priorities
   With projected increases in LANs and PCs and no real growth in staff,
which aspects of network management do administrators think are top
priorities? Judging from the results of the survey, network managers are
more focused on the server and network-traffic parts of their jobs than on
issues related to desktop management, including software distribution and
metering and asset management.
   We asked LAN Times readers to rate the importance of key management
issues for the efficient functioning of their networks. The ratings were
conducted on a 1-to-6 scale, with 1 being ``not at all important'' and 6
being ``very important.'' We also asked managers to tell us how dependent
they are on hardware and software tools to help them with key
network-management issues.
   Respondents tend to consider the management of network-related issues
more important than desktop-related or financial and administrative issues
such as metering or asset and inventory control.
   Of the six categories we asked about, server management and network
traffic are on the top of the priority list for effective functioning of
the organization's networks. Seven out of 10 LAN administrators reported
that server management is important (a 5 or 6 rating), whereas slightly
fewer are concerned with network traffic. Just under half the managers
surveyed reported that managing specific network devices such as hubs and
routers is important. In contrast, for each of the three desktop-related
categories measured, one-third or fewer assigned a rating of 5 or 6 on the
importance scale.
   Network managers' responses to queries about their single greatest
management need range from the specific (``full implementation of SNMP'')
to the more general (``increased budgets, more time''), while passing
through the somewhat humorous (``software for managing people''). A rather
large portion of the respondents are concerned with network diagnostics,
traffic loads, performance monitoring, and so on.
   Just under half the network managers surveyed reported the use of
server-
management or network-analysis tools at their work locations. Four in 10
managers currently use network-device management.
   Desktop-management tools are less commonly used. Roughly 19 percent of
network managers surveyed use software-distribution tools, 28 percent use
software-inventory tools, and 33 percent use software-metering tools.
   For both the network- and desktop-related tools, the usage patterns vary
significantly depending on the size of the networks managed. At sites with
30 or fewer PCs installed, the percentage of network managers using network
solutions is generally lower than at larger sites. Only nine percent of
managers at small sites use network-based software distribution, for
example, compared with 37 percent at sites with 150 or more PCs.
   In the case of network-analysis tools, this difference is particularly
pronounced. At small sites, 24 percent of network managers analyze network
traffic flow, and at large sites, 78 percent do so.
   Even though large sites are more likely to manage desktops through the
network, they still follow the same general usage patterns as all sites:
Tools to manage servers, traffic, and network devices are more common than
network-based solutions for desktop administration.

Winds of Change
   Six months from now, however, this picture should look somewhat
different. Although the use of network-related management tools will
continue to outstrip desktop- related solutions, the gap will narrow.
   The fastest growth is predicted for software distribution over the
network, which will nearly double--from 19 percent to 37 percent--during
the next six months. Rapid growth is also expected for software metering
and inventory. More than half of LAN managers will use network-based
software metering, and 46 percent will use software-inventory programs.
   In spite of the projected growth in all categories, network-management
solutions are not particularly widespread now, nor will they be ubiquitous
in six months. Why are some network managers not using available tools?
Typically they reported that the tools, whether for network or desktop
management, are not necessary for the kinds of networks they manage.
   Respondents were also asked for each category whether price, difficulty
in use, or difficulty in evaluation had any bearing on their decisions not
to implement any of the network- or desktop-management tools. For each
category measured, the largest proportion of respondents indicated that
their networks do not require the types of tools specified.
   Among users of the tools, the typical reason offered for use is based on
the workload. Respondents indicated that the tools lessen the need for
support staff. Given the prognostication for personnel growth in the next
year, it's not surprising that network managers cite this when implementing
the tools.

NET THREAT TO NOTES PUTS LOTUS IN ACTION
Strategy embraces Web, lowers price

By:
By Brent Dorshkind

   Lotus Notes has an image problem--again.
   Just as users started to understand Lotus Development Corp.'s flagship
product, the World Wide Web threatens to make Notes irrelevant in the
groupware field it pioneered. Once again, the company faces an uphill
public-relations battle, this time to position Notes as a player in the
white-hot Internet market and the nuts-and-bolts messaging-applications
space.
   To that end, Lotus' latest communications strategy, announced last
month, folds key Internet technologies into the Notes platform. The company
has also revised Notes pricing to make it a more attractive client/server
messaging and groupware platform. However, critics fault the Notes-centric
Web strategy for doing little to attract new users while delivering a
lackluster client/ server messaging strategy.
   ``The issue with all of Lotus' Web efforts has been to facilitate
additional features for people who are already Notes users,'' said Andrew
Percy, chief technology officer at Edge Information Systems, a
systems-integration firm in San Jose, Calif. ``I don't believe it wins them
any additional business.''
   New and current Notes users will find a midyear upgrade to the Notes
release 4 server beefed up with Web-focused technologies, including HTTP
(HyperText Transport Protocol), HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language. In addition, the company
will give away InterNotes Web Publisher 2.0 free of charge when release 4
initially ships this quarter. Originally a $3,000 add-on product, Web
Publisher 2.0 translates Notes documents into HTML pages. Prior to the
midyear upgrade, release 4's HTTP functionality will be delivered via a
bundled, yet separate, HTTP server.
   With Internet protocol support, Notes servers will extend their audience
to include Web browsers in addition to Notes and MAPI (Messaging API)-based
clients. Notes will dynamically convert Notes documents to HTML or vice
versa, depending on which type of client accesses the server.
   Meanwhile, Notes release 4 clients will include the InterNotes Web
Navigator to let users browse the Web from within Notes. Web Navigator
requires a connection to a Notes server so remote users will have to dial
in to the Notes server for Internet access.
   ``The Web, in many people's minds, is a direct Notes competitor,
especially in information publishing,'' said Jamie Lewis, president of The
Burton Group, an industry-analysis firm in Salt Lake City. But Lewis added
that Notes can do some things that the Web-based products cannot, for
example field-level replication and sophisticated security functions such
as being able to hide fields of a document from certain users.
   According to Lewis, the question is, ``How much of Lotus' installed base
and how much of the new customer base--the potential marketplace--needs
those features?''
   That question clearly weighs on Internet-focused companies such as
Netscape Communications Corp. The company's recent activity validates the
Lotus strategy of blending groupware and the Web. Netscape purchased
Collabra Software Inc., whose Collabra Share brings discussion-database and
replication technologies into the Netscape fold. Moreover, the Internet
company last month added an E-mail server to its line of applications
servers.

Back to Basics
   Although the Internet is clearly the hot spot for Lotus, it is not the
sole focus of the company's 1996 communications strategy. Lotus has also
taken steps to ease the costs of deploying Notes as a messaging solution by
introducing the $55 Notes Mail client and dropping the price of the Notes
Desktop client from $155 to $69.
   Due to ship with Notes release 4, Notes Mail effectively replaces Notes
Express as the entry-level Notes client package. With Mail, users can work
with E-mail, document libraries, discussion databases, and the Internet via
the Web Navigator. Unlike Desktop, the new client will not be able to run
custom applications. Neither Mail nor Desktop have the
applications-development capabilities of the full Notes client.
   Mail's price gives Lotus a messaging and groupware package that should
effectively compete with Novell Inc. GroupWise XTD and Microsoft Exchange,
both of which are scheduled to ship this quarter. However, those low-priced
messaging platforms will also provide groupware functions such as
discussion databases and replication, perhaps blunting Lotus' competitive
edge.
   Moreover, GroupWise XTD and Exchange are shrink-wrapped ready-to-use
applications, whereas Notes is a development environment. Consequently, the
price of deploying a Notes network goes beyond the costs of clients,
servers, and applications administration to include the groupware
applications that supplement E-mail.
   ``The cost of Notes is not buying the product,'' said Percy. ``The cost
of Notes is accessing the features, which means developing applications.''

ORACLE HITS BUSINESS-APP SUITE SPOT

By:
Bradley F. Shimmin

   The integrated suite of services unveiled by Oracle Corp. last month
promises to drive down the cost of managing multiple line-of-business
applications.
   Set for delivery in March, the Oracle InterOffice Suite will couple
World Wide Web, E-mail, document-management, multimedia, client/server, and
even management services all within the Oracle7 RDBMS (relational DBMS).
The InterOffice Suite server will be available in Workgroup and Enterprise
editions for Intel Corp. CPU-based machines running Microsoft Windows NT
and SunSoft Inc. Solaris. It will rely on extensions to the Oracle7 RDBMS
that let users search, access, and manage multiple data types such as
audio, video, and text in a consistent and simple manner, said Joe
Vassallo, vice president of InterOffice products at Oracle in Redwood
Shores, Calif.
   Through a document-server extension, for example, users can search for
not just the contents of large text items but also the actual meaning of
those items, creating a summarization of the meaning in a text object.
   The InterOffice server will provide these services for Microsoft Windows
95 clients; however, it will also make them available from Oracle's Web
browser, called PowerBrowser, which will let developers give users access
to the same features from either Windows or the Web.
   Supporting both Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java and the Oracle Basic
programming languages, PowerBrowser lets developers reduce the number of
applications used on desktops, said Vassallo.
   By bringing traditionally nonrelational data such as Web documents,
groupware, E-mail, and video streams inside an RDBMS, InterOffice is also
capable of bestowing transactional capabilities traditionally found only in
RDBMSes, such as row-level locking, shared SQL, and read consistency.

Physician, Manage Thyself
   By centralizing these heterogeneous services within a single datastore,
which can be managed from a single console, Oracle hopes to lower
management costs by minimizing the number of applications servers required
in an organization, said Vassallo.
   For example, users can add access to real-time video services to an
existing Oracle RDBMS through the InterOffice suite without purchasing a
separate video server, Vassallo explained.
   Without a single solution, ``a company must buy a whole bunch of
separate management tools, databases, Web servers, workflow products, and
scripts to connect the Web server to the database server,'' said Dan
Kuznetski, research director for Unix and server operating environments at
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
   Yet some believe that the most important aspect of the InterOffice Suite
is its capability to reduce cost of ownership through its effective
management of these services, said Kuznetski. ``By managing this one
package with one tool,'' he said, ``Oracle reduces installation, tuning,
management, and problem resolution.''
   To this end, the suite comes equipped with the InterOffice Manager,
which manages servers, clients, services, and even systems information
through Intelligent Agents.
   These agents, according to Oracle Chairman and CEO Larry Ellison, let
managers automate time-consuming tasks such as disk-space management,
backups, and even applications distribution. ``It helps you keep track of
all the software you have throughout the network because it does the
distribution for you,'' he said. ``So instead of running around with a
floppy disk, you just put one copy of the software on one server, which
distributes that software to other servers, which in turn distribute
software to client computers.''
   However, IDC's Kuznetski points out that although existing Oracle
installations will benefit greatly from the InterOffice Suite,
organizations already housing adequate solutions for individual components
will not be swayed without some strong marketing by Oracle. For example,
though the RDBMS itself is well proven, there are many products in the

IBM ALSO SWEET ON SUITES

By:
Bradley F. Shimmin

   IBM is a believer in the idea of a server-based applications suite, as
well. So much so, in fact, that it intends to combine no less than seven
server components within its soon-to-be-released suite, code-named Project
Eagle.
   To be available by the end of this quarter, Project Eagle will join
communications, Internet, database, transaction-processing, directory and
security, groupware, and management components across all of its hardware
offerings in the hope of giving customers a single-vendor solution that
meets not only a company's applications-services needs but its scaleability
needs as well, said Mark Nunn, IBM's worldwide brand manager for Project
Eagle in Armonk, N.Y.
   ``This provides fundamental, base technology layers that an organization
can rely on as rock solid and completely reliable, so they can bet their
businesses on this,'' Nunn said. ``Customers can start small and move to
larger systems.''
For example, because the suite's security, directory, and distribution
architecture is based on the Open Software Foundation's Distributed
Computing Environment, applications built with suite components such as IBM
DB2 and Lotus Notes can be easily scaled from IBM OS/2 PC machines to
OS/390 mainframes without extensive modifications, explained Nunn.
   ``Often when you start off with your first client/server application,
you start in a pilot mode, but that builds and builds as you become more
comfortable with it,'' Nunn said. ``Because companies look for multiple
lifetimes in these applications and data they are collecting, they might as
well invest them in systems that will be there for the long term.''

ALANTEC TO JOIN FORE'S SWITCH FOLD
Acquisition adds departmental and backbone LAN-switch expertise

By:
Michelle Rae McLean

   Continuing its buying spree of products that drive the need for ATM
backbones, Fore Systems Inc. last month purchased Alantec Corp. The buyout
adds high-end Ethernet switches to a product line that ranges from
remote-access multiplexers to carrier network switches.
   The stock-swap agreement, which will make Alantec a wholly owned
subsidiary of Fore, brings a mix of LAN-backbone and departmental switches
into the fold. The Alantec PowerHubs' support of multiprotocol routing may
prove key to Fore's plan to offer products that integrate legacy LANs with
ATM.
   The Alantec products ``give Fore the reach into the LAN side that it
needed,'' said Skip MacAskill, senior research analyst at The Gartner Group
Inc. in Stamford, Conn.
   Alantec's desktop, departmental, and backbone PowerHubs offer
higher-capacity switching than the desktop-only product gained in Fore's
May acquisition of Applied Network Technology Inc. Alantec's switches are
also the first to market in supporting multilayer forwarding, combining
both fast bridging and routing.
   ``Until other companies can add routing to their switches, the Alantec
products give Fore an important advantage and immediate product delivery,''
said MacAskill. Companies' router-based infrastructures will require the
integration point between legacy networks and ATM backbones to consist of a
product that supports routing, he said.

Running With the Routers
   Though switches are beginning to replace routers as the core device in
networks, the need for routing functionality has not disappeared. Alantec's
expertise in integrating routing capabilities in LAN switches should
complement other interswitch routing technology Fore acquired when it
bought RainbowBridge Communications Inc. last May.
   Fore is banking on departmental and backbone switches to drive bandwidth
usage, increasing customers' need for the higher-speed backbone that ATM
switches are designed to support.
   ``All our acquisitions and alliances are for products that provide
on-ramps to ATM and that help customers migrate to ATM,'' said Eric Cooper,
Fore's chairman and CEO.
   Alantec had already included ATM interfaces and Fore's SPANS ATM
software on some of its switches, and bringing that support to all PowerHub
models is a priority, said Cooper. Making those switches stronger edge
devices, which connect Ethernet segments to ATM backbones, could end Fore's
reliance on NetEdge Systems Inc. for that technology, said analysts.
   Fore will have to overcome the integration challenge of combining
network-management products typical to every acquisition. The company plans
to bring management of the PowerHubs under ForeView by the end of this
year. The companies also plan to merge their U.S.-based direct sales forces
and will likely maintain their distribution partners overseas.

IS MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY BLOCKING PROGRESS?

By:
Jeremiah Caron

   Often overlooked, somewhat misunderstood, and sometimes even scoffed at,
LAN-management technology may very well be the most daunting inhibitor to
more widespread adoption of client/server computing architectures in
corporate information systems.
   The problem can be attributed both to set-in-their-ways managers and to
technology vendors. But indications are that this situation is changing for
the better. Vendors and managers appear to grasp better than ever the need
to bring the control and accountability of a centralized computer system to
the chaos of distributed systems.
   In preparation for this issue's Manager's Outlook on LAN management
(``The LAN-Management Paradox,'' Page 23), LAN Times conducted a reader
survey to gauge opinions and use of today's technology (an analysis of the
results starts on the Cover). A paradox was revealed: A relatively low
usage rate of all but the most basic server and internetworking
device-management tools defied an overall understanding of the need for
better management tools due to increasing workloads.
   Many survey respondents stated that they simply did not need elaborate,
integrated management tools to do their job. In some cases, that response
can be attributed more to the technological failings and pricing of the
solutions out there than to a lack of need. In other cases, it's possible
that managers just aren't able to see the potential financial savings that
better network control affords.

Accepting the Inevitable
   However, as network managers move up the corporate-management food chain
it's a sure bet that the need for better client/server accountability and
more efficient management will become apparent.
   We're at a crossroads now. The fiercely independent adolescence of the
PC LAN is coming to grips with more button-downed enterprise
responsibilities. While LAN managers are still reluctant to
``mainframe-ize'' their environments by turning user-productivity tools
into terminals, they also expect technology vendors to meet their needs
with more flexible, integrated, and easy-to-use management capabilities.
   This expectation is evidenced by a sharp increase in positive responses
when readers were asked about their purchase plans for the next six
months.
   Thankfully, the internetworking, operating system, and utilities vendors
also seem to be getting it. The march of progress means that more
manageability will be built into applications and systems, representing a
move away from the add-on management mentality.
   That's good because it goes a long way toward solving another paradox
residing at the heart of the first: Too often today's management tools add
complexity and cost to a networking system, thus discouraging the very
managers they're designed to help.

EDITOR'S NOTE

By:
Leonard Heymann, Editor in Chief

   LAN Times is launching the Manager's Outlook report to give network
managers a comprehensive review of key issues facing them in 1996. Our goal
is to paint a detailed picture of both the products and the strategies
needed to solve the most demanding network problems.
   LAN management, the topic of our first Manager's Outlook, in particular
requires a thorough evaluation of both products and strategies. Looking at
just one angle of LAN management, such as the product side, portrays a
false view.
   Network-administration suites, for instance, are rapidly maturing
products that appear ready for prime time. But our survey reveals that
users are far from embracing them -- and, for that matter, LAN-management
products in general. Issues such as cost and training, as well as doubts
about whether the products offer any tangible benefits, are giving managers
cause for concern. So exploring the strategies, even ones as basic as
standardizing the desktop, is the only way to reveal the true state of the
art of LAN management.
   Our new Cost Justification column, written by Testing Center Manager
Tere' Parnell -- who has spent much of her time in the trenches as a
network manager -- also appropriately debuts with LAN management. Selling
products in general to management is one of administrators' most
challenging tasks. But selling management tools is even more difficult
because their benefit to the company isn't always obvious. Parnell's column
offers specific examples to prove the tools will boost the productivity of
your business.
   Manager's Outlook will appear quarterly, examining such topics as
multi-processing servers, groupware, and ATM migration. Let us know what
you'd like to see in these reports and whether we hit the target on LAN
management. Send your comments to lheymann@wcmh.com.

OUTLOOK FROM OREM
Novell CEO Robert Frankenberg chats with LAN Times' Director of Editorial
Products Susan Breidenbach and Associate News Editor Amanda Henry

Q. Novell's business applications are up for sale. Is there a sense that
the Microsoft Corp. strategy that was being mimicked by the acquisition of
WordPerfect just didn't work for Novell?

A. Yes. The attempt was to match Microsoft product category by product
category. It became clear to me that it could not be done.

Q. Is Novell now ceding the applications-server market to Microsoft and
Microsoft Windows NT?

A. We've said for a long time that NT's real competition is Unix--it's
not Novell NetWare. NetWare is a network operating system that provides
security and the capability to share, communicate, manage, and access
information across a wide and local area. That's its focus. The fact that
it is very lean,and you can put a database on top of it and use the
database manufacturer's tools to create an extraordinary price-performance
solution means that, yes, you can do a certain kind of application serving,
and you can do it better than on any other platform.
   We haven't ceded the applications-server market to Microsoft or Windows
NT. Microsoft doesn't own it yet. The Unix world is still much larger than
NT. And as we have talked about, we will have NetWare incorporated into
every copy of [The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.] SCO Unix and [Hewlett-Packard
Co.] HP-UX.

Q. How can you get something besides your own applications to support NDS
[NetWare Directory Services]?

A. First off, we now have 140 NDS applications shipping. Since the
beginning of 1995, we have shipped 25,000 SDKs [software developer's kits],
which is more than ever in our history. So we are paying attention to
developers, and frankly, Novell didn't pay enough attention to developers
in the past. We would love to see Lotus Notes make use of the directory. It
would make enormous sense for us and for them since Notes runs on top of
NetWare Connect Services [NCS]. With directories, as with many other
technologies, there is this chicken-and-egg question. Is NDS in enough
places so that it's interesting to developers, and are there enough
developers to make NDS interesting to users?

Q. What you have laid out here addresses infrastructure, but it's the
availability of NDS-compliant applications that will undo the
chicken-and-egg perception.

A. Part of what we've done is that with NCS, the directory underpins that
are in every environment. The second path is to get it into all of the Unix
systems. The directory is a service not just to manage components of the
network but to be used as the directory for applications services that are
written to it. It's not just for keeping track of users and what their
attributes are.
   One of the things you will see next year is the capability to access the
directory from an Internet browser and make use of the information that's
held in the directory. So instead of getting on the Internet and doing a
interminable search to find something, the directory can go right to the
topic that you're interested in.
   Frankly, this time last year was when we started shipping a directory
that was solid and that had the right utilities so that people had the
confidence that this thing was going to work. Up until then, there were
significant questions.

Q. One of NT's strengths is that it runs on non-Intel Corp. platforms.
What is happening with regard to NetWare and non-Intel platforms?

A. We dropped Processor Independent [PIN] NetWare. Unix is how we will
address NetWare running on non-NetWare platforms. We had a team of 100 for
each platform, and that was not cost justified.

Q. You have been criticized for being late with your strategy. If you had
it to do all over again, would you have implemented any sooner the changes
that you have recently made at Novell?

A. First, I had to unsnarl [the PIN partnership] mess. I also had to get
the products to work. Novell's and WordPerfect's flagship products didn't
work. Now we have put in place a framework that fixed the strategy. Could
it have been faster? Yeah, maybe. But not a lot faster.

IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT
Put off by high prices and a confusing marketplace, LAN managers shy away
from the very tools that aim to simplify their jobs

By:
Claudia Graziano

   Pick up any trade magazine, and you're bound to find more than a few
articles extolling the virtues of LAN-management software. Yet more than a
few LAN managers are passing up these software tools altogether, preferring
instead to stick to managing desktops, applications, servers, and other
devices manually--or not at all.
   Taken at face value, the results of the LAN Times 1995 Manager's Survey
paint a rosy picture of the state of LAN management. It would seem LAN
managers are doing so well they simply don't need the tools we write about.
But is that what LAN managers are really saying?
   By all accounts, the price of LAN ownership is high. Analysts from
groups such as Forrester Research Inc. and Gartner Group Inc. continue to
put the price of supporting networked PCs somewhere between $3,000 and
$5,000 per PC annually. Of that, roughly half is management-related costs,
analysts say. So how come more organizations are not using management tools
to help reduce these costs? One theory is that organizations aren't really
aware of how much they're spending to support LANs.
   ``LAN-management costs are hidden costs,'' said Waverly Deutsch,
computing-strategies services analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass. ``The costs have to do with network downtime and the LAN manager's
time spent running from site to site.''
LAN managers know they spend too much time putting out the proverbial
fires. But many feel the available tools are more trouble than they're
worth.
   ``All we've been doing is trying to administer this thing,'' said Dave
Bullamore, computer consultant for North Carolina's Department of
Agriculture in Raleigh. ``We don't have any time to plan ahead or think
about the future.'' Bullamore, who is one of three IS staff members who
manage the NCDA's approximately 600 PCs spread out over 14 Novell Inc.
NetWare LAN segments, said cost and complexity are the two main reasons his
department has been slow to deploy management tools.
   ``The state is pretty tight about adding new positions, so we're being
forced to evaluate some network-management tools,'' he said. ``But we just
don't have the time to set up a test lab to evaluate all these tools. They
all have so many pieces. Just figuring out how to set them up is a lot to
learn.'' So far, Bullamore has chosen Novell's LANalyzer for keeping tabs
on traffic levels and Bay Network Inc.'s Optivity for managing the NCDA's
35 SynOptics Ethernet series hubs. But non-trouble-shooting tools are hard
to justify, he said. ``We're looking at [Intel Corp.'s] LANDesk Management
Suite and Novell's ManageWise, but they get pretty expensive when you start
talking $40 or $50 per node.''
   In fact, cost justification seems to be a problem for many organizations
when it comes to management tools.
   ``The question is not about whether to use management tools, it's who is
going to use the tools,'' said Ken Brown, industrial engineer at RR
Donnelly & Sons Inc. in Crawfordsville, Ind. ``A lot of these tools require
one person just to manage the software. Unless we can show that kind of
tool is cost-effective, like if it eliminated the need for staff, there's
no way it's going to get approved.'' Brown, whose job it is to review any
purchase requests that come from one of the organization's six LAN
managers, said his staff rarely asks for software funds.
   So exactly how is RR Donnelly managing its 700 PCs? ``Our network
managers are fairly well-experienced. Each handles about a hundred or so
PCs, and they seem to get everything they need done. Also, our users are
pretty well-educated. We have in-house training classes for them, so they
don't need a lot of support.'' But not everything at RR Donnelly is done
manually.
   Larry Freund, LAN administrator, said his department wrote its software
for administering the group's two Oracle Corp. databases and managing its
two IBM OS/2 LAN Server file servers. He also uses home-grown
applications-metering software. ``At the time we needed it, there weren't
any OS/2-based management tools,'' he said.
   For others with larger networks, the cost of management software is even
higher.
   ``By the time you buy the basic package and all the support and
training, [enterprise] management platforms become an extremely high-ticket
item,'' said Brian Sugano, manager of communications services for the
county of San Mateo in Redwood City, Calif. ``These types of tools are so
expensive they're really only applicable to large companies that have a
[wide-area] infrastructure to support,'' said Sugano, who uses IBM's
NetView 6000 for managing the county's 3,000-node network spanning multiple
city offices. ``Management platforms require extensive training to
configure the system,'' he said. Consequently, ``we've become a training
ground for NetView. It's hard to keep the trained people on staff.'' Sugano
added that he too struggles with the problem of cost-justifying tools.
``Management is an application nobody sees. It's hard to get money for
it,'' he said.

Making a Case for Tools
   Forrester's Deutsch agrees that tools on the market today are numerous
and somewhat immature but feels that ignoring management tools is a serious
mistake. ``Yes, tools are complicated. Yes, tools are hard to evaluate.
That's because every tool has its own interface, its own data repository,
its own way of executing actions.'' But management problems are going to
get worse, not better, she said. ``With more companies moving
mission-critical applications off host systems, network managers are going
to be faced with a lot more than user-productivity problems.''
   Not surprisingly, developers agree these tools are too important to
overlook.
   ``Management has been perceived as a value-add, and I think that's
absolutely wrong,'' said David Hamilton, systems- and network-management
product manager for Microsoft Corp. Trying to manage devices and
applications after they've been deployed is almost certainly going to lead
to downtime and poor service for networked users, he said.
   But developers, too, need to do their part to increase adoption of
management tools. Making products simpler to use, increasing integration
among so-called suites of tools, and committing to standards such as the
Desktop Management Interface (DMI) are a few ways vendors can help.
Fortunately, just about every major management-applications developer has
already pledged support for DMI, a budding standard that aims to make
desktops and related components universally manageable. But work is still
underway to give management applications a means for accessing DMI
data--how PCs and related components describe themselves--remotely.
   In the absence of a completed standard, vendors have yet to put their
development money where their mouth is. However, given the Desktop
Management Task Force's schedule for completing the specification's missing
link, it could be midyear before vendors are able to embed support for DMI
in their applications.
   The problem of integration, on the other hand, could take longer for
vendors to solve. Right now, suites offer little more than a convenient way
to purchase software, said Ted Schlein, vice president of networking and
client/ server technology for Symantec Corp., a management-applications
developer in Cupertino, Calif.
   ``Point solutions should leverage one another'' through functions such
as event forwarding and real-time data sharing. But ``there isn't a great
deal of that kind of integration yet,'' Schlein said.
   For its part, Symantec is embarking on a strategy to not only integrate
its own products but also work with other vendors to promote cross-product
integration. ``We don't want to have to force customers to do everything
the Symantec way. That's not real life,'' Schlein said.
   Symantec is just one of many vendors trying to deliver better integrated
LAN-management product suites. Competitors McAfee Associates Inc. and
Seagate Enterprise Man- agement Software Co., in particular, are grappling
with integrating product lines inherited through recent company
acquisitions. Not only do these companies face the challenge of pulling
together products with completely different development histories, but they
must do so at a more meaningful level than just at the GUI.
   For instance, Santa Clara, Calif.-based McAfee is working on reconciling
product lines acquired over the past two years from Automated Design
Systems Inc., Brightwork Development Corp., Saber Software Corp., and
Mountain Network Solutions Inc. And Seagate's newly formed management
division is busy sorting out product lines acquired from Frye Computer
Systems Inc., NetLabs Inc., and Network Computing Inc.
   Given the current state of flux of most of these products, many
developers are not surprised at LAN managers' reluctance to invest in
them.
   ``The massive consolidation in the industry brings up valid concerns
about the viability of these vendors,'' said Bill Larson, McAfee's
president and CEO. But Larson and others believe market consolidation is
ultimately good for LAN managers for a number of reasons. First, a
consolidated industry means fewer products for LAN managers to evaluate. A
second benefit is fewer points of contact--or even a single point of
contact--for technical support and training. Third, a
survival-of-the-fittest marketplace stands to yield more sophisticated
product offerings.
   Of course, the downside of all this consolidation is that LAN managers
are essentially put on hold while vendors sort out their integration
strategies.
   ``Because there are no integrated tool sets, people can't yet see the
vision of what's going to be possible,'' suggested Michael Howard,
president of Infonetics Research Inc., a consulting company in San Jose,
Calif.

The Art of Simplicity
   Making tools easier to evaluate and purchase is a subtler change
expected in the evolution of management software. Developers admit they
haven't done a great job of making tool purchases easy to justify to the
powers that be, but they say they're working on it.
   ``If administrators are not implementing tools, it's because we haven't
given them a reason. Vendors need to make a business case for management
tools, not just an IS case,'' said Ken Mackin, manager of the
systems-management strategies group at Intel. An avenue that Intel and
others are exploring to help get corporate types more involved in managing
the network is making data collected by management applications accessible
to de- partments other than IS. Inventory data, for example, should be
accessible to the finance and human-resources departments. ``Companies have
to have adequate systems management to know what the cost of ownership is.
Once you have cost of ownership, then you can justify the purchase of tools
because you can show how to reduce those costs.''
And while tools aren't likely to get any cheaper, they are supposed to get
simpler to use. As hardware and software become instrumented with
management--either through standards such as DMI or built-in devices and
even the operating systems themselves, developers say administrators will
see complexity drastically reduced. ``Right now, [management] vendors have
to play integrators,'' Mackin said. But once management becomes built in to
more components, vendors will be able to concentrate on managing the
network, not the management system.

REGAINING CONTROL OF THE DESKTOP
Standard configurations are today's panacea for controlling costs, but
their effectiveness may be short-lived

By:
Jill Marts

   While the majority of IS professionals applaud the added freedom the
personal computer provides users, many--especially those managing large
numbers of nodes--are finding the cost of maintaining disparate PCs too big
a pill to swallow.
   An effective and common solution is to restrict desktop configurations
by instituting policies and standards to give all desktops the same look
and feel. Many users, IS professionals, and industry analysts, however,
charge this practice is obliterating the personal from the PC.
   But standardized desktops offer a number of critical benefits, the most
important of which is cost-effectiveness. The less time managers spend
reconfiguring desktops, the more time they have to support and maintain the
network. Standardized nodes are also easier to manage--IS staff don't need
to maintain a mountain of different applications--and they're more secure,
which increases the integrity of the information system as a whole. These
advantages, claim the proponents of standardization, far outweigh users'
loss of control over their desktop environment.
   ``The time and effort we spent trying to diagnose individual problems
just wasn't worth it. Our desktop standard is by far the most
cost-effective thing we could do,'' said Gary Light, manager of advanced
technology at Concord Hospital in Concord, N.H.

Varying Levels of Control
   Solutions for regaining control of the desktop vary from such mild
measures as instituting restrictive policies to providing centralized
access to some or all applications on the server. An even more extreme
measure eliminates hard drives from PCs altogether.
   Which strategy you choose, or if you standardize at all, often comes
down to the size and type of network you manage. Large organizations stand
to gain the most from uniform configurations, along with those that don't
rely heavily on user creativity. Banks and health-care organizations are
good examples of companies that stand to benefit most. Their business
procedures are usually already standardized, so uniform desktops generally
do not adversely affect productivity. Software-development companies, on
the other hand, are probably not good candidates, because businesses of
this type usually depend heavily on user creativity.
   Most organizations that implement desktop standards take a
middle-of-the-road approach, which involves using one or two standards,
running some or all of the applications from the server, and instituting
policies.
   When Concord Hospital moved toward standardization, Light found it
necessary to develop two desktop standards. The common standard works for
approximately 75 percent of the hospital's users. It includes the Novell
Inc. NetWare 3.12 Requester and provides access to a half-dozen
applications on the server such as Novell WordPerfect, Microsoft Excel, and
Lotus Freelance Graphics. Only Microsoft Windows and the Windows swap files
are installed locally.
   Light found this standard wasn't feasible for the remaining 25 percent
of the hospital's workstations, most of which are located at nurses'
stations and require health-care-specific applications. Be- cause doctors,
nurses, and other medical personnel need to be able to walk up to any of
these workstations and access data, this alternate configuration had to be
highly standardized so that all clinical workstations would have the same
look and feel.

The Case of the Missing Tools
   The combination of uniform configurations and user policies that help
maintain the setup has paid off for Concord Hospital. Policies that
restrict users from bringing in software, copying it off the servers, or
editing files such as CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT have been mostly adhered
to.
   Whereas automated tools are readily available to help maintain the
configurations and enforce policies once they've been established,
Concord's IS staff hasn't taken advantage of them, other than using McAfee
Associates Inc.'s SiteMeter for metering software licenses on the server.
Missing from the playing field are automatic software-distribution and
inventory--tools that Light acknowledges contribute to a weakness in
Concord's strategy.
   ``Sooner or later we're going to have to get off the stick and find the
tools that work for us,'' Light says. ``But it takes a substantial amount
of time and energy to learn how to effectively use those packages.''
   Without software-distribution, metering, and inventory tools,
maintaining standard configurations amounts to a lot of leg work for IS
staff. Light's reticence to implement most of these tools echoes a larger
trend among network administrators in general. The LAN Times 1995 Manager's
Survey revealed that less than 35 percent of our readers are using
distribution, inventory, or metering tools (see graphic, Page 41).
   Light expects Concord's network to grow from 400 PCs to 800 PCs in the
next few years. By that time, he says, automated tools will be a
necessity.

Banning the Hard Drive
   For some organizations, centralizing all applications on the server and
providing one or two standard configurations is simply not enough.
   Andy Kiolbasa, networking chief of technology at ITT Fluid Technology
Corp., which designs, manufactures, and distributes pumps and valves, says
his company is sold on stringent desktop standards and policies. The
Midland Park, N.J.-based company has more than 2,000 workstations located
at sites in five countries.
   In 1987, ITT began eliminating hard drives from all its workstations.
Kiolbasa and his staff wiped out the existing ones and partitioned them
down to 20MB to be used as very fast boot disks or swap files. As new PCs
were added to the network, they were purchased without hard drives. Now,
with about 70 servers running NetWare 3.12, the company has more than 200
PCs without a single hard drive connected to each server. All applications,
including Windows, are centralized on the file servers.
   Kiolbasa's attitude toward desktop standards is matter-of-fact: ``There
isn't any reason to install [Microsoft] Word on 2,000 local hard drives and
then have some users destroy the configuration. We install one copy on our
server, make sure we have the proper licenses, and we're done.''
   Unlike many administrators, Kiolbasa doesn't see standardization as a
way to avoid using management tools. He uses ON Technology Corp.'s
WinINSTALL product for automatic software installations and updates. The
advantage, Kiolbasa says, is that the IS staff writes the routine only once
to give a new Windows user access to Word, for example, and WinINSTALL
automatically installs the program into the Windows environment when the
user logs in.
   The IS staff also uses Bindview Development Corp.'s BindView NCS to
monitor hardware and ensure users' configur- ation files conform to the
standard.

A Creativity Killer?
   While there's no shortage of standardization proponents, there are
others who contend this strategy isn't a panacea for all desktop-management
woes.
   Most administrators who manage desktops through standardization will be
the first to admit that there are at least some drawbacks. For one thing,
user resistance often runs high when administrators attempt to institute
standards in an environment that previously lacked them. And even with
successful implementations, IS professionals can't expect to get total
control of the workstations. Removing all hard drives, for example, works
well until someone gets a laptop.
   ``Given the constantly changing PC industry and the fact that users have
ultimate dominion over their machines, it's unlikely that any desktop
standard will remain standard for very long,'' said Chris Thomas, manager
of emerging technology for Intel Corp.'s enterprise-server group in
Hillsboro, Ore.
   Productivity issues surround standardization as well. Some argue it's
very restrictive to expect people to have only a certain set of tools in an
environment that uses PCs as personal-productivity devices.
   ``There are certain things that are good about policies and standards,
but the blanket approach is very short-sighted,'' said Steven Saks, vice
president of IS at the California Trucking Association (CTA) in Sacramento,
Calif. ``What you're doing is eliminating the unique abilities of each
individual and turning them into drones.''
   Saks opted to go light on standards at CTA and has placed more emphasis
on policies to manage the desktops on his 60-user, four-server NetWare
network. He limits creativity, he says, to a given product but never to
types of products. So, for example, he permits only one word processor and
one spreadsheet program, but doesn't forbid the use of other types of
applications on different desktops that individual users may need. In
addition, he has instituted policies that prevent users from sharing
workstations or passwords.
   Although consolidating products on a single platform or set of platforms
offers great potential for reducing cost of ownership, many agree that
offering a restricted set of products isn't a long-term solution.
   Intel's Thomas says that restricting desktop configurations is probably
the worst way to think about managing the desktop, but it is the easiest
option for administrators right now.
   ``As a way of getting your arms around the task, it's a good starting
point,'' Thomas said. ``But it doesn't replace the need to find solutions
that deal with the evolving desktop.'' Thomas emphasizes that the crux of
the problem is that the platforms themselves are not standardized on how
they set up and configure other products.
   The real, longer-term solutions to unruly desktops will most likely come
from vendors as they work to provide more manageable platforms and
products. Eventually, when most hardware and software adheres to some of
the simple standards of installation and management, it will be less
important for support staff to limit choice.
   Thomas compares the situation at hand to that of the telephone
industry--it was not until companies agreed on wiring infrastructures and
voltage levels that any phone from any company could be plugged in to the
wall and work. In the PC industry, as products consolidate and standardize
at the OS level, it will be easier to use different platforms more
readily.

TOOLS THAT FOLLOW THE RULES
A new breed of policy-based software promises to tighten security and cut
costs

By:
Claudia Graziano

   When Novell Inc. introduced NetWare 4.x two years ago, network
administrators found they had a lot more to contend with than just
installing the new enterprise NOS. For the first time, many administrators
were required to organize a standard naming convention for networked
resources and establish guidelines for giving users access to those
resources. In short, upgrading to NetWare 4.x meant instituting
corporatewide policies to govern the network.
   Since then, the idea of policy-based management has caught on as a way
to reduce administrative costs, tighten security, and even speed
trouble-shooting by setting standards for dealing with a variety of
situations, ranging from adding new users to the network to reacting to
system faults. To make the process of coordinating corporate policies and
management practices easier, network- and systems-management applications
developers have begun building policy-based management capabilities into
their tools.

Automatic Management
   Policy-based management may seem like a futuristic prospect, but it's
closing in on reality--many administrators already have policies in place
to help them manage the network. Backing up file servers every Friday, for
instance, or inventorying the network twice a year are examples of common
policies used to maintain network operations. The only difference is that
these policies aren't automated. Rather than being organized in a database,
management policies are often written on scratch pads, saved in E-mail, or
just noted mentally.
   Management-applications developers are out to change this scenario to
help organizations take control of growing enterprise networks.
   ``The advantage of policies is that they ensure a consistent
environment. Client/server environments that are not consistent break,''
said Scott Harmen, vice president and general manager of Tivoli Systems
Inc.'s applications-management division in Austin, Texas. Security
management, for example, requires policies to determine which users have
access to what network resources. Without such policies, security is bound
to be compromised. Policies can also help streamline administration tasks,
such as configuring new users' desktops and preventing the use of
unauthorized software.
   The key to policy-based management, of course, is automation.
Administrators of mainframe and Unix environments have long used
job-scheduling utilities to automate certain tasks. Now those same types of
tools are finding their way into the PC LAN world. Seagate Enterprise
Management Software Co.'s Ashwin, for example, lets administrators schedule
background and after-hours processing jobs for Microsoft Windows NT and
Windows 95 machines, as well as Unix workstations and IBM mainframes and
minicomputers.
   ``Basically, any utility that has script-writing capabilities can
accomplish rudimentary automation,'' said Waverly Deutsch,
computing-strategies services analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass. What's needed are applications that not only automate
administrative tasks but also provide an interface for managing the
policies themselves.

The Ground Up
   Two applications developers that are pioneering policy-based management
at the desktop are McAfee Associates Inc. and Symantec Corp. Last March,
both companies licensed code from Microsoft Corp. that will let each
developer exploit management capabilities already built in to the Windows
95 operating system. Specifically, the code provides links to the Windows
95 Registry, which records changes to desktop configurations. The code will
also provide links to an embedded policy editor, which contains 50
predefined user-configuration ``profiles.''
   By tapping the Registry and the embedded policy editor, McAfee,
Symantec, and others will be able to create applications that can centrally
manage desktops on the basis of administrator-defined policies. For
example, user access rights, start-up applications-- even background
colors--can all be defined from a remote-management console.
   McAfee plans to release the first application that incorporates the
licensed code next month. The new product, called Saber Tools 1.0, is a
combination of McAfee's NetTools and the former Saber Software Corp.'s
Saber Menus. According to Product Manager David Wilbanks, Saber Tools will
extend Microsoft's desktop policy-editor functions to the server, letting
administrators browse Novell's NetWare directory to select individuals or
groups of users for applying policies.
   Although administrators can already access Microsoft's policy editor
remotely, changes can be made only for one user at a time, Wilbanks said.
And the embedded policy editor has no system for manipulating several
policies at once. In contrast, SaberTools will let several policies be
grouped and applied to users with a single command.
   Policies that administrators might choose from the Saber Tools policy
editor include restricting users' access to files, directories, servers,
and even executeables. Policies that restrict users' access to the start
menu, for example, can be helpful in reducing the number of support calls
to the help desk.
   ``If users accidentally change or delete their IP settings, they may
lose their network connection,'' said Wilbanks. ``This could take up to 30
minutes to fix.''
   Other policies may enforce company directives, such as not bringing
software from home. Symantec's Norton Administrator for Networks and Norton
Desktop Administrator--both slated to incorporate policy-based management
by mid-1996--will let administrators set policies that deny users access to
the network if virus checking or metering is disabled at the workstation.
   ``There's been no way to enforce this level of security in the past,''
said Jonathan Niednagel, senior product manager for Symantec in Cupertino,
Calif.
   Policy-based management is also making its way into high-end management
applications. Last June, Hewlett-Packard Co. introduced an add-on to its HP
OpenView platform, called AdminCenter. The Unix-driven management software
is aimed at streamlining administrative jobs such as configuring users and
applications. But unlike emerging PC-based solutions, AdminCenter provides
a sophisticated mechanism for organizing policies and reconciling
conflicting policies.
   The software uses a knowledge base to store the policies hierarchically.
Administrators can designate policies for the global environment, for
specific domains, or even for specific workstations. AdminCenter
automatically assigns ratings to policies that allow very specific,
low-level policies to overrule more general, high-level policies.
   For example, a high-level policy dictating that only users with an ID
number between 100 and 500 can access the accounting server may be
overruled by a low-level policy that says users in the remote accounting
office can also access the server. But high-level policies are overruled
only if the administrator who writes the low-level policy has the
appropriate access privileges.

In a Similar Vein
   Tivoli Systems Inc. offers a similar product for policy-based systems
administration called Tivoli/Admin. Part of the Tivoli Management
Environment product suite, Tivoli/Admin lets customers attach policies to
any systems-management function controllable from the TME console.
Currently, the software supports only Unix clients and servers, but Tivoli
is promising a version of its Admin product that runs on Microsoft Windows
NT Server in the first quarter. The new version of Tivoli/Admin will let
customers control not only Unix and Windows NT clients but also Windows and
NetWare clients.
   Like HP's AdminCenter, Tivoli/Admin uses object-oriented code and a
rules-correlation engine to manipulate default and user-defined policies.
However, it has no system in place for resolving policy conflicts.
   ``Basically, the most recent policy wins,'' said Martin Neath, vice
president and general manager for TME core products.
   But for some, this lack of higher intelligence is a minor detail.
   Steve Henderson, systems engineer for GTE Telephone Operations Corp. in
Tampa, Fla., said Tivoli/Admin saved his department from having to
continuously modify and develop its own internal policy-based management
software.
   ``The [policy-based management] software we'd written was a maintenance
nightmare. Somebody had to recompile the code every time there was a
change. It just didn't evolve naturally,'' he said. ``But doing things one
machine at a time just wasn't going to work for us.''
   Henderson's group began rolling out Tivoli/Admin more than two years
ago, when the concept of policy-based management was unknown to most. But
faced with several thousand Unix clients to manage, Henderson said his
group had a vested interest in putting its mainframe experience to work in
the client/ server world.
   Although Tivoli/ Admin has helped reduce the administrative burden, the
product provides little in the way of security enforcement. ``Tivoli/Admin
doesn't really cover things like controlling access to certain servers once
users get on the network,'' Henderson said.
   The benefits of policy-based management aside, analysts say the
technology's inherent complexity may not be worth the pain of implementing
such solutions for some organizations.
   ``It's very, very difficult to implement a policy-based management
system,'' said Jill Huntington-Lee, senior analyst with Datapro Information
Services Group in Delran, N.J. ``Not only do you have to deal with feeding
a lot of data into these systems to get started, you have to deal with a
lot of internal company issues.''

Corporate Culture Cops
   In fact, defining corporate policies for the software to enforce has
proved such a challenge to early adopters of Tivoli's Admin product that
the company retains a team of integrators to help customers through the
process.
   ``You have to have a clear business case for implementing policy-based
management,'' Huntington-Lee continued. The technology can be particularly
valuable to financial, government, research, and other organizations where
access to systems needs to be strictly regulated, she said.
   Regardless, companies need to do a lot of work beforehand to get the
most out of policy-based management.
   Companies evaluating this technology ``need to examine the
administration processes they have in place now and compare that to the
processes they want automated,'' said Huntington-Lee. From there, companies
need to figure out whether the products that are available present a
realistic solution.

THE FUTURE WITH OR WITHOUT SNMP
Vendors are delivering their own technologies in the absence of
standards-based SNMP solutions

By:
Sylvia Clark

   Ask LAN administrators to name their standard for network management and
most will answer SNMP. But despite its popularity, the protocol has some
profound limitations that make it inappropriate for managing every LAN.
Proposed revisions to SNMP are also steeped in controversy, as proponents
of alternative management strategies butt heads over standards for
controlling networks.
   Network management ought to be simple: Managing network devices from
multiple vendors requires a standard for defining and gathering management
information. Today that standard is SNMP, but the protocol wasn't intended
to be a long-term solution.
   The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) originally proposed the SNMP
standard as a stopgap measure until businesses could migrate from TCP/IP to
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)-standard networks, which were expected
to include a robust and secure network-management standard. When this
migration failed to occur and TCP/IP grew even more popular, the IETF
attempted to approve a new version of SNMP to address its shortcomings.
   Unfortunately, the new version has failed to appear, and administrators
are now left with growing networks and no effective way to manage them.

Defining the Limits
   Some of SNMP's limitations stem from its architecture, which uses
passive agents on clients that are activated only when polled by a
management application. This design is SNMP's first drawback: Polling
consumes a significant portion of network bandwidth and can limit what's
left for business applications. And because the agents can't proactively
report exceptional events, SNMP managers must continuously collect and
process information--even when no problems exist--which limits the number
of devices a single console can manage.
   SNMP also lacks any means of communicating among managers, so the
management function can't be distributed. This effectively limits SNMP's
scaleability and, therefore, capability to meet the requirements of a large
organization.
   Even if management could be distributed, SNMP couldn't deliver the
sophisticated information needed to tune a complex network. This is because
SNMP managers cannot retrieve large amounts of data, such as a complete
routing table, in a single inquiry. The MIB (Management Information Base)
format, used to store collected data on the client, is inflexible, and
SNMP's TCP-centric nature means it does not mix well with the IPX, OSI, and
AppleTalk networks found in most large organizations.
   Another drawback is that managers' agent-to-manager communications are
rudimentary at best. Agents can notify managers of problems but have no way
of verifying the information was received, and they can't provide any
detail in the notice. Instead, the manager must poll the agent to determine
what happened.
   The worst of SNMP's drawbacks is that the protocol turns a blind eye to
security. It doesn't provide for authentication or data encryption, which
leaves agents open to manipulation by unauthorized managers. It also
permits the interception of authorized commands.
   The IETF attempted to fix the limitations of SNMP by producing a second
version of the protocol, SNMP version 2. But this standard has been plagued
by conflict among the proponents of differing technologies. The result has
been a confusing series of different SNMP 2-proposed standards.
   Originally developed in 1993, the SNMP 2 proposal provided for security,
bulk information retrieval, manager-to-manager communications,
remote-configuration capabilities, protocol enhancements that would expand
its usefulness beyond TCP networks, and other performance enhancements.
   But after reviewing the proposal it developed, the IETF deemed SNMP 2
too difficult to implement and use, especially in the area of security.
After much debate within the IETF over two competing security models,
called SNMP 2* and USec (Users-based Security), the SNMP 2 working group
suggested an interim version of the protocol that would omit the original
revision's controversial elements.

Attempted Revamp Also Stalled
   This ``new'' SNMP version is referred to as SNMP2t, SNMP2C, SNMP1.5, or
just SNMP 2 and includes commands for retrieving large quantities of data
to give management applications better performance, better error messages
to help management applications better diagnose configuration problems, and
protocol enhancements.
   However, the updated version 2 also lacks some of the most-needed
critical enhancements--security, manager-to-manager communications, and
remote configuration--and falls short in solving a wide range of
network-management problems.

Not Up to the Challenge
   Unfortunately for network professionals, this situation won't be
resolved anytime soon. The IETF has decided to suspend work on the updated
SNMP 2 until September, hoping that a cooling-off period will bring
agreement when work resumes.
   Meanwhile, outside the IETF in an unofficial capacity, a ``blue-ribbon
panel'' of users and vendors is attempting to develop yet another solution.
Tentatively called SNMP version 3, this SNMP standard is designed to have
more security and functionality than the current SNMP 2 and could
ultimately become a de facto standard if it is adopted by systems vendors.
   But SNMP 2--if it is delivered at all--will ultimately be a day late and
a dollar short. It will not be much use to LAN managers because the
deficiencies addressed by version 2 are not critical, so the benefits of
upgrading don't justify the costs of replacing existing SNMP technology
investments.
   This situation leaves administrators faced with a network-management
dilemma: SNMP is not up to managing large complex networks--let alone the
whole IT infrastructure--and SNMP 2 is delayed and deficient. OSI's Common
Management Information Protocol, on the other hand, has the scaleability
and security to handle today's large heterogeneous networks, but little
commercial support exists for it outside the telecommunications industry.
   In the absence of standards-based solutions to solve management
problems, suppliers are delivering their own technology to provide
customers with much-needed management functionality.
   Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Solstice Cooperative Console (CC), which is an
add-on that links multiple Solstice SunNet Manager management servers
within an enterprise, is a good example of a product that has developed
value not found in SNMP today.
   Solstice CC performs selective data replication by sharing topology,
event, and SNMP trap information with servers using Sun RPCs (remote
procedure calls) and real-time connections. This capability gives
administrators management control over other domains. Solstice CCs can be
configured as peers so each has full control over the other's domain, or
they can be centralized or divided by geography or area of expertise.
   Fujitsu Ltd. has a similar module for its NetWalker SNMP management
platform. And other vendors are expected to develop similar solutions. In
fact, early this year, multiple suppliers are planning a collaboration to
create interoperable Solstice CC-type solutions, allowing disparate manage-
ment consoles to share information.

Circumventing the Process
   Solutions such as this, in which technology is shared among several
suppliers, not only will yield better scaleability for a single-vendor's
platform but will also give network managers the benefits of an official
standard, including competitive pricing, interoperability, and no vendor
lock-in.
   Long overdue, this solution nicely sidesteps the broken-down
standards-approval process. If it emerges as a common solution, it could
evolve into a de facto standard or even gain the acceptance of an official
standards body for solving manager-to-manager communications problems in
SNMP.
   But for now, the reality of SNMP is that it was never intended to do
more than basic monitoring and management of network devices, so it can't
be extended to incorporate systems management. Its prevalence makes it a
tempting choice, but until suppliers somehow expand the technology, SNMP
management platforms and applications will never provide requisite
functionality, scaleability, and security.
   SNMP's convoluted evolution is a good example of what happens when
standards bodies fail to deliver timely solutions. In the absence of such
solutions, market pressures eventually force vendors to step in and provide
the needed technology. It's possible that collaboration among
network-management vendors may give the IETF the stimulus it needs to get
back on track. But what's certain is that the demands of customers are
growing too complex to tolerate the bottlenecks caused by a delay in the
standards-approval process.

OUTSOURCING'S REFINED ALTERNATIVE
An a la carte strategy is quickly gaining ground over the four-course
approach to outsourcing

By:
Jill Huntington-Lee

   When the job of managing a network gets too big for an internal IS
staff, most companies call on outsourcers to pick up the slack. But while
these consultants can work miracles getting your company up to speed on the
latest technology and methodologies, they're also expensive and often
demand the authority to make over your network in any way they see fit.
   But a scaled-back alternative to expensive consultants, called
``out-tasking,'' is rapidly gaining ground and promises some relief for the
tenacious conflict between growing networks and shrinking budgets.

   Out-tasking uses ``boutique'' consultants to handle specific,
well-defined activities of a LAN-management or other IS effort. In contrast
to the four-course dinner approach of big systems integrators, out-tasking
is strictly a la carte--a strategy its proponents say prevents runaway
systems projects and unneeded services.

Getting a Jump Start
   Inventory and asset management, performance analysis, and automated
backup are three of the fastest growing out-tasking services today.
Server-performance analysis, software-distribution services, cable
management, and even network- and systems-resource accounting and
charge-back services will soon be available from specialized providers.
   Out-tasking lets user organizations jump-start important but
long-neglected management tasks such as inventorying desktop hardware and
software, analyzing network-performance trends, instituting automated
backup, and building an adequate help-desk infrastructure. Critical tasks
such as these aren't complicated, but they are time-consuming--and that
makes them perfect candidates for out-tasking.
   Customers who have contracted out-taskers for these services are
reporting dramatic gains. At ASC Services Co., a Chicago-based IS
consultancy that specializes in architectural and construction issues, MIS
Manager David Weinstein drastically cut the time needed to inventory a
customer's PCs by giving the job to out-tasker Micropath Inc. in Bellevue,
Wash.
   ``Micropath is conducting a complete inventory of our client's network,
which spans more than 20 offices across a five-state region,'' Weinstein
explained. ``This effort would take me over a year--Micropath is doing it
in less than three weeks.''
   According to Bill Holder, director of operations at Micropath, the
company's business is based completely on out-tasking inventory chores.
``Our customers typically don't have enough staff to adequately inventory
thousands of PCs,'' he said.
   A true specialist, Micropath comes armed with its own software and a
full suite of commercial inventory packages. The company also offers a
60-page, step-by-step methodology for do-it-yourself inventories, but most
clients let Micropath do the work. ``Our customers usually want us to
perform the initial inventory because we've done this many times before,''
said Holder. ``When we're done, we leave behind a database and a management
report with recommendations for ongoing asset-management and
change-management policies, so the customer can maintain it themselves on
an ongoing basis.''
   Of course, administrators building a network from scratch are in a
better position to use a disciplined approach to inventorying from day
one--but most organizations don't have the luxury of starting from a clean
slate.
   ``In the 1980s, many companies were buying PCs like crazy,'' Weinstein
said. ``But often, the records kept weren't adequate, and no one really
knew who had what or what software was out there.'' A comprehensive
inventory is a crucial first step toward positive network management and is
required by many network-management programs.
   Inventorying is only one area targeted by out-taskers. Performance
trending and analysis is another fast-growing service. Out-taskers take the
gigabytes of cryptic data churned out by systems-management tools and turn
it into cogent reports showing patterns and trends.
   ``Often network administrators lack the time to develop the software and
processes necessary to support thorough performance analysis,'' said Steve
Waldbusser, principal architect for out-tasker International Network
Services Inc. (INS) in Mountain View, Calif. ``Writing scripts or programs
to support those processes takes even more time. We provide the processes
as well as the software, so the solution is about as turnkey as it gets.''
While a performance-analysis service is certainly appealing to companies
lacking technical staff, even large companies with vast technical expertise
find time-saving services such as those offered by INS cost-effective. INS
claims as clients several of the nation's largest banks and many regional
Bell operating companies.

Glass-House Performance Stats
   Performance analysis also appeals to network managers with glass-house
experience. ``I came from a background of minis and mainframes, so I was
used to getting hard statistics on performance,'' said Jim Sedlacek,
network-planning manager for Cleveland Clinic. ``We use [Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s] SunNet Manager for monitoring about 30 routers, but we didn't have
a way of putting all the raw statistics into useful reports without a lot
of programming.''
   About a year ago, Sedlacek learned about the performance-analysis
services provided by 3DV Technology Inc. in Chicago. 3DV's RouterPM service
provides in-depth reports of Cisco Systems Inc. routers, including
serial-line utilization, bidirectional analysis of congestion at the
LAN/router interface, and interface-related signal-quality problems.
   3DV handles everything, including installing proprietary data-collection
software on a Microsoft Windows NT-based PC running on an Intel Corp. 486.
The software, which supports distributed polling, queries routers 24 hours
a day and converts raw data into trended reports in weekly or year-to-date
format.
   Currently, 3DV's performance-analysis reports are restricted to MIB
(Management Information Base) II objects and variables stored in the
private MIBs of Cisco routers. 3DV plans to expand its support to include
Cabletron Systems Inc. hubs in the near future. Competitor INS supports
RMON (remote monitoring) and Cisco private MIB objects, as well as Bay
Networks Inc., 3Com Corp., and Chipcom Corp. devices and MIB II and Cisco
routers.
   The dramatic growth of startup out-taskers hasn't been overlooked by
mainstream IS consultancies, which are busy developing out-tasking services
of their own.
   ``While we are capable of full-service outsourcing, most of the services
we offer today are out-task,'' said Dennis Duyme, director of program
management for enterprise-network management at Bell Atlantic Network
Integration Services in Frazer, Pa. Unlike 3DV or INS, Bell Atlantic's
service supports performance analysis through an active in-band connection
to the customer's site.

Slashing Monitoring Costs
   Bell Atlantic compiles baseline-performance information and provides
trend-analysis reports on selected devices, the 10 busiest devices by
month, router ports, and router-interface error profiles. According to
Duyme, his company can provide fault and performance monitoring for just 40
percent of what it would cost customers to do it themselves.
   Administration isn't the only cost that can be pared by out-tasking. The
BBN Systems and Technologies Division of Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., claims its analysis of networks can save customers from
buying too much bandwidth.
   Using an internally developed tool called StatsWise, BBN staffers
analyze the health, capacity, and traffic levels of a customer's network.
The service is targeted at companies that have tried to resolve performance
problems by buying more band-width but haven't seen the expected
improvement, according to Pete Nelson, director of marketing for BBN's
Enterprise Management Group. ``We're able to use StatsWise to gather
detailed information about how the network is actually behaving over
time,'' Nelson said. ``Then, we can make recommendations for reconfiguring
the network based upon this information. Some customers request baselining
annually, but most want it on a monthly or quarterly basis.''
   Automated backup is another network-management function that's a good
candidate for out-tasking. Rimage Corp. in Minneapolis, a provider of
floppy disk-replication services, has launched a rapidly growing backup
service called Televaulting that automatically backs up network file
servers to an offsite location. For charges that the company says typically
run from $250 to $350 per month, Rimage installs an agent on a nondedicated
node at the customer's site. At a prescheduled time, the agent logs in to
each server and backs up the data via an ISDN connection to a regional
Rimage site. File encryption helps ensure security while in transmission
and at Rimage as well.
   A typical departmental server with 2GB of data takes less than an hour
to back up, said Keith Stacy, general manager of the Televaulting service.
``After encryption and compression, the amount that is actually transferred
is usually between 1 [percent] to 2 percent of the client data files
[because] only incremental changes are transferred during a typical backup
session.'' Customers can request full backup periodically for archival
purposes, usually on a quarterly basis.
   Although most customers are initially interested in Televaulting for
disaster-recovery purposes, many end up using it to supplement or even
replace their daily tape-backup processes. Televaulting stores its
customers' data in optical-jukebox storage systems, allowing for rapid
recovery in the event of data loss at the customer's site. The base fee for
Televaulting is $150 per agent per month, with small incremental fees for
the number of megabytes transferred. For a 100-user network, typical
billing fees run about $250 to $350 per month.

Can You Really Trust an Outsider?
   Although the concept of out-tasking is permeating the network-management
community, network administrators still question the wisdom of a third
party handling even well-defined areas of network maintenance, operations,
and planning. Many organizations retain highly competent
technical-operations and support staff, capable of writing scripts and
evaluating performance.
   Ultimately, the tab for managing a network is not only the salaries of
the support staff but also the cost of opportunities missed when resources
are unavailable. It's important to ask yourself whether you want your best
people counting computers and answering phones. Out-tasking, when used as
part of a focused systems-management effort, can free talented computer
professionals to pursue loftier goals.

THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE LAN MANAGER
Accelerating technologies and the need to simplify their effects are
placing new demands on network professionals

By:
Susan Breidenbach

   There seems to be a sudden acceleration in the advance of technology and
its applications today. It's as if information networks have reached some
critical point of evolution and are starting to take over their human
masters, like the cyborgs in ``The Terminator.''
   LAN managers have never had to cope with such fast-paced change.
   ``I've been in this business for 12 years, and I've never seen a time
when things were moving as rapidly as they are now,'' said Greg Scott,
information-services manager for Oregon State University's College of
Business in Corvallis.
   A lot of different elements--robust client platforms, symmetric
multiprocessing, distributed databases, directory services, faster
networks, telephony, new WAN services, maturing middleware, and better
development tools--are all converging in the PC LAN space. The scope and
complexity of what LAN managers have to deal with has increased
significantly. Individuals who previously confined themselves to the bottom
layers of network computing now have to know what goes on in the upper
layers to understand the impact of client/ server applications on the
network.
   ``It's getting very sticky,'' said Mark Brooks, a senior LAN specialist
for TIAA-CREF in New York. ``It's one thing to do [Network General Corp.]
Sniffer-type trouble-shooting, but it's a whole different ball of wax when
you're trying to diagnose problems in the upper layers. You have to get
involved with client/server equipment, which traditionally was handled by
the programmer group.''
A class of tools for trouble-shooting client/server applications is
emerging, but it is plagued by a lack of standards and use of experimental
technology. The products are very expensive and difficult to use, and some
radical improvement is needed before they can bail LAN managers out.
   Meanwhile, client/server applications are creating some unusual
problems. ``You end up having strange, sporadic occurrences you can't
identify, and everyone says, `It's not me,' '' said Brooks. LAN managers
have to be able to make very fine-tuned changes to the servers or clients
or the infrastructure in between. And to do that, they need to grasp the
whole picture.
   Life was a lot simpler when LAN managers just had to know Novell Inc.
NetWare and how to get to the mainframe. But LAN managers who are still in
this mode are an endangered species threatened by an almost universal move
toward centralization and standardization. The autonomy that was the
hallmark of the original PC LANs is falling victim to the need to achieve
some economies of scale and make things easier to manage.
   ``Our company is trying to find the right mix of centralization and
departmental autonomy,'' said Bill Eckenrode, a senior network specialist
at E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. in Wilmington, Del. ``The trend was
decentralization for a long time, but in the last six to 12 months we've
moved back to a more centralized philosophy. The company is trying to adopt
an end-to-end service paradigm, getting everyone to be part of a larger
whole.''
Not all LAN managers like to acknowledge this state of affairs. ``There is
a reluctance to say the mainframe people were right--that we need to have
more centralization,'' said Brooks.

Centralization Ups the Ante
   Instead of having a lot of little database servers and point solutions
scattered among various divisions and departments, with multiple
intermediary boxes between the database and the end station to accommodate
a mix of protocols and operating systems, companies need to consolidate
them into a few bigger servers running enterprise solutions on standard
platforms.
   Basic server administration and management, such as backup, external
communications, and security, can then be centralized. And applications
development can be decentralized to provide some solutions flexibility.
   Yes, putting more people on bigger servers can strain existing network
infrastructures. But upgrading those infrastructures will be a lot cheaper
in the long run than building up staffing in small, decentralized groups.
   All this centralization increases the challenge--and associated risk--of
being a network professional. LAN managers who have been installing NetWare
for years suffer sticker shock when they see the price of a Microsoft
Windows NT-based server with dual Intel Corp. Pentium 100MHz processors,
140MB of RAM, and a 20GB disk array. Some of these systems can cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Challenge From the Specialist
   An even greater source of stress is the increasing importance of LANs
and the applications and data they deliver. A few years ago they were a
minor appendage to a company's information systems. Today they are the
information system for a lot of businesses. Organizations are putting a lot
of trust in a few individuals, expecting them to sort through all the
complexity of network computing and keep things under control.
   ``The stakes are higher these days--a little higher than many LAN
managers are comfortable dealing with,'' said Ken Kozikowski, information
center manager for T.J. Maxx in Framingham, Mass.
   While the demands of client/server computing are broadening the
requisite knowledge base of the LAN manager, other forces are pushing skill
development in the opposite direction. Specialization tends to be a
byproduct of centralization.
   Departmental LAN managers had to be generalists, but centralized
organizations can build up teams of specialists with deep knowledge in
certain areas. But specialist status is a double-edged sword.
   It's nice to have a skill that is in high demand right now, but going
down the specialist path limits future options.
   ``A lot of people are resistant to specialization,'' said Sandra
Lieb-Geiger, technical-support supervisor for Andersen Consulting in San
Francisco. ``You try to turn them into an expert, but they are concerned
that the need for expertise in that area might vanish overnight as
technology takes a sudden turn.''
   Technology does take sudden turns, and the road is starting to fork,
too, with the network infrastructure splitting off from network resources.
LAN managers will have to decide which path to take.
   ``On the Internet, resources and infrastructure are not the same thing
and are not managed by the same people'' said Patrick Corrigan, managing
director of The Corrigan Group in Portland, Ore. ``The same thing will
happen on corporate networks.''
   Meanwhile, today's LAN managers have to be familiar with all the
different client and server environments, the applications, the
infrastructure, and the WAN links. With expanded responsibilities and
downsized staffs, they have less time to wade through more information.
   ``I'm not an expert in the client/server area, but the peek I've had
behind the curtain is very sobering,'' Scott said. ``You can suck up the
information you need and march ahead or start thinking about a career
change. I don't see much in between.''

Relief in Sight?
   Technology will come to the rescue eventually, as it has so many times
before. Developments such as true plug-and-play network components and
mature directory services that have been integrated with E-mail and other
applications will help enormously. Technology will be used to tame
technology. And, with time at such a premium, products that are easiest to
use--not fastest or cheapest--will win.
   Meanwhile, networks have to be managed and a combination of teamwork
with the right leadership is critical. One way to deal with the
contradictory needs for specialization and broad knowledge is informal
cross-training. With this strategy, different groups of specialists can
take turns educating everyone else about a particular area of technology at
monthly staff meetings.
   Above all, LAN managers need to keep the application of technology in
perspective.
   ``Your company is best served if you concentrate on interpreting its
business needs and putting to use the infrastructure you already have in
place,'' Kozikowski said. Upgrade pressure differs from industry to
industry, but even the network professionals in IS-intensive businesses
need to filter out a lot of noise.
   Outside of science fiction, technology won't really take over because it
can't sustain itself. But it will bury individuals who can't ignore all the
hype about the latest and greatest and focus instead on the new
developments that must be mastered. The ability to make this distinction is
the single greatest skill that today's LAN managers can have.

THE LAN MANAGER EVOLUTION

By:
Susan Breidenbach

   A day in the life of the typical LAN manager is quite different today
than it was when LAN Times was first published almost a dozen years ago.
The job's scope and complexity have increased enormously along with the
importance of the LAN platform itself in the corporate IS hierarchy.
   This trend is becoming even more marked as a number of key
elements--extremely robust client and server platforms, distributed
databases, directory services, high-bandwidth networks, telephony, new WAN
services, maturing middleware, and better development tools--all come
together. Driven by these factors, the PC LAN is increasingly hosting
mission-critical applications, not just connecting users to them.
   As one of our Reader Advisory Board members said recently, LAN managers
today are coping with ``a whole different ball of wax'' (see ``The Changing
Role of the LAN Manager,'' Page 48).
   And as the LAN manager's role changes, so does the type of person
filling that role.
   The original network and systems professionals were technoids who rarely
ventured outside their own domain. Most lacked the people skills they
needed when the PC revolution suddenly turned their users into computer
operators. But technology saved the day when better interfaces--menuing
systems and then GUIs--enabled the development of products that could be
used by people who didn't know assembly language.
   The new wave of network professionals included the pioneers who
installed and managed the first PC LANs in the early 1980s. They were an
eclectic bunch--shoe salesmen, office managers, auto mechanics, and even
lawyers wanting to make an honest living--who bootstrapped their way up,
learning as they went. And, of course, there's the LAN manager who was the
person sitting closest to the printer when the organization decided to
install a network for sharing it. Anyway, they were looking for a new
challenge, or at least for a more accessible information system, and this
nascent technology looked promising.
   Today, rookie LAN technicians tend to have a computer science or IS
background, and in a way, that's unfortunate. They seem more apt to be
interested in technology for technology's sake rather than as a solution to
a business problem. The shoe salesmen and office managers brought a
real-world perspective to the job that may be missing now.
   ``Today, we get computer-science types who learn how things operate at
one point in time and think that knowledge will carry them for the next 20
years,'' said Patrick Corrigan, managing director of The Corrigan Group in
Portland, Ore. ``I think we'll see a lot less innovation and less ability
to see through vendor hype.''
   This new generation of LAN managers may also have less ability to home
in on the root of the problem during trouble-shooting. About 15 years ago,
the dean of my university's engineering school lamented the effect that
calculators were having on the mental-arithmetic skills of engineering
students. ``They are losing the ability to `guesstimate,' a skill that is
very important in the design and planning process,'' he said.
   Similarly, while the original LAN managers learned networking through
hands-on experience, the new breed is more likely to be separated from the
network by textbook theory and layer upon layer of GUI interfaces and other
tools. They lack the intuition that comes from years of direct contact with
the basic network technology that is so critical to diagnostics.
   In these circumstances, one would expect technical wizards with good
diagnostic skills to be at a premium. However, vendor claims about
plug-and-play interoperability, management tools, and self-healing networks
often have nontechnical executives thinking that these skills are of
decreasing value.
   Today, some network administration tasks can indeed be automated, or at
least handled by a quasi-technical staff equipped with the right tools. But
the ultimate responsibility for the network needs to rest in the hands of
people who have a real-world perspective and a complete understanding of
networking technology.
   Some of the original LAN pioneers may, in fact, be out of their depth,
but individuals always fall by the wayside as technology advances--even
those with formal computer-science education. The old guard is a precious
resource that companies need to exploit to the fullest as they take their
networks into the 21st century.

RAID 5 IS AN IDEAL SOLUTION FOR ENTRY-LEVEL STORAGE

By:
Roger Cox

   Today's network administrators are increasingly relying on RAID
solutions to manage their storage. According to a survey conducted by
Peripheral Concepts, a market-research company, RAID use has doubled over
the past two years.
   It's no wonder why: The Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Peripheral Concepts
estimates that the hourly costs of downtime are reaching $20,000 an hour
for a Novell Inc. NetWare installation. There is no need to address the
virtues of fault-tolerant storage. Rather, I will focus on bringing
attention to RAID 5, a superior solution for entry-level fault-tolerant
storage.

5 Alive
   RAID 5, defined as block-level data striping with distributed parity
over a minimum of three drives, offers the best cost/performance for
transaction-oriented networks. In particular, a three-drive RAID 5 storage
solution offers several advantages over such two-drive solutions as NetWare
embedded mirroring: superior storage scaleability, better performance,
richer fault tolerance, and a lower overall price.
   Superior scaleability. The storage requirements of network file servers
are constantly evolving to meet the needs of workgroup expansion and
application complexity. Therefore, the capability to add storage
incrementally--as you need it--is key. With NetWare embedded mirroring, you
must add two drives when you need to increase your storage capacity. Or you
can replace your existing two drives with two new, larger-capacity drives.
Either approach has serious cost implications.
   With RAID 5, on the other hand, you only buy the capacity you need to
meet expanding storage requirements.
   Increased performance. Local-area network administrators are constantly
looking for ways to increase performance. Today's top-performing file
servers require high performance I/O, which translates to faster SCSI disk
drives, faster spindle revolutions-per-minute read and write rates, and
lower access times.
   To determine the performance relationship of a two-drive
NetWare-embedded mirroring configuration to a three-drive RAID 5
configuration, Adaptec Inc. ran a series of standard tests in its
performance-analysis lab. Using a three-drive RAID 5 configuration proved
to be 28 percent faster than the two-drive NetWare embedded-mirroring
configuration. Moreover, reconstructing a failed drive in the three-drive
RAID 5 configuration was 60 percent faster than NetWare embedded mirroring.
(Benchmark reports are available directly from Adaptec).

   Far richer fault tolerance. In addition to providing better performance,
increased partition capacity, and protection against data loss, a prime
mission of any fault-tolerant storage solution is to eliminate server
interruption caused by a failed drive. By providing such capabilities as
hot-spare, warm-swap, and hot-swap drive support, contemporary RAID 5
adapters allow for real-time data recovery without having to restore an
entire database.
   Hot-spare drive support enables you to automatically reconstruct data
without user intervention. Warm-swap drive support lets the user pause
activity on the SCSI bus while you replace a failed drive. Hot-swap drive
support lets you replace a failed drive without having to interrupt server
activity. (When shopping for a RAID 5 solution, remember to keep in mind
that hot-swap drive support must be supported by the drive enclosure.)
   Lower price. Recent reductions in the cost of storage peripherals and
adapters have made RAID 5 a viable and popular alternative to NetWare
embedded mirroring. As network storage requirements increase and storage
capacity must be added, the cost advantage of RAID 5 becomes very
favorable. With RAID 5, you purchase additional drives one at a time. This
advantage is important for two reasons: First, you minimize your storage
expansion cost, and second, because the cost per megabyte of storage is
constantly falling, every megabyte of disk storage you can put off buying
until the future will cost less.
   RAID 5 is an essential, cost-effective solution for today's
business-critical networks. When evaluating your storage needs, it is
important to consider cost, price/performance, scaleability, and the type
of fault-tolerant storage requirements needed to support your network
users.

THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB
Now that you've told us what you want in a network-management package, the
LAN Times Testing Center shows you where to find it

By:
Reggie Lisle

   Not long ago, a crescent wrench, a socket set, and a Saturday afternoon
were about all you needed to work on the family wagon. But now that it
seems you need specialized gear just to change the oil, your trusty toolbox
isn't the help it used to be. It's the same with network management.
Veteran administrators remember the days when management tools could fit on
a few floppy disks. Now, the utilities that ship with a NOS, although fine
for certain tasks, won't take you very far. It won't be long before you're
searching in vain for the right tool for the job.
   If you're looking to add to your tool chest, there are a number of
options, and the LAN Times Testing Center takes a look at four leading
network-administration suites in this issue. In some cases, we had to look
at a company's entire product line because of the modular approach of their
utilities. We evaluated Seagate Enterprise Management Software's Seagate
Frye Utilities for Networks, Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite 2.01,
McAfee Associates Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation 5.5, and Symantec Corp.'s
Norton Network Series 2.0.
   (Because of recent acquisitions, both the Seagate and McAfee product
lines are in transition. Seagate Enterprise Management Software, a division
of Seagate Technology Inc., is a joining of Frye Computer Systems Inc.,
NetLabs Inc., and Network Computing Inc. Most of the modules reviewed in
this comparison were formerly part of Frye's management suite. McAfee,
meanwhile, plans to rename its network-management strategy McAfee Systems
Management sometime this year. For the sake of clarity, we will refer to
Seagate's product line as Seagate Frye Utilities and McAfee's product line
as Saber LAN Workstation throughout the comparison.)
The products we tested deal with both desktop and LAN management, but we
chose to lump all of them under the moniker network administration. After
all, it is becoming more difficult to determine where the desktop ends and
the network begins.

Your Call
   To find out which management features were most important to you, we
conducted a phone survey of some LAN Times readers. This survey was
conducted by the Testing Center independently of the larger study referred
to elsewhere in this issue, but the results were similar. We asked network
managers what tasks were crucial for administering their networks and what
kinds of utilities they needed that don't ship with their network software.
The three most important tasks were asset management, license metering, and
software distribution; server monitoring and suite integration were deemed
slightly less important. These five tasks, along with a miscellaneous
classification that includes remote-control and anti-virus capabilities,
were the criteria on which we based our testing.

How Not to Make a Network Quilt
   End-to-end management of a network is like a bad patchwork quilt:
Components from different vendors are roughly stitched together--and the
seams don't always hold. Corporate networks usually boast several
generations of PCs, and they grow haphazardly rather than according to an
overall strategy. Some companies have three different support staffs just
to keep their patchwork running: One to manage the wiring and phone
systems, one to administer the servers, and one to take care of user
requests. Vendors, the consummate promisers, continue to claim that as soon
as some standard becomes well-established, this network quilt will
transform itself into something resembling your grandmother's afghan with
its smoothly interlocking pieces. Still, no single tool has emerged that
can handle an entire enterprise. Even large systems-management packages
such as Hewlett-Packard Co. HP OpenView or IBM NetView still require
different consoles and management utilities to fully control the network.

Boon or Bane?
   Standards can serve as stumbling blocks or as an impetus to needed
change. One promising standard, SNMP, provides control over compliant
devices such as hubs, routers, and UPSes (uninterruptible power supplies).
However, SNMP's coverage is spotty, and its implementation can be a bit
confusing.
   The Desktop Management Interface (DMI) specification, developed by a
group of vendors spearheaded by Intel Corp. and called the Desktop
Management Task Force (DMTF), also holds promise. However, of the products
we tested, only Intel's LANDesk adheres to the DMI. The DMI specification
was published about three years ago and is a potentially elegant solution
to the expensive problem of managing desktop PCs and other network devices.
It was designed as a way to gather meaningful information from the
thousands of desktops scattered across corporate LANs and WANs.
   Unfortunately, it lacked a vital component: a way to pass collected data
across the network. With the recent announcement of the Remote Desktop
Management Interface (RDMI), however, that problem will soon be solved.
Vendors predict they will begin adhering to the RDMI standard within 12 to
18 months. Of course, we've heard promises before.
   DMI-enabled applications may still conquer the desktop, but the
specification's fate will likely be decided by Microsoft Corp. The software
giant is wavering in its support of DMI--perhaps until it can come out with
something more in its favor. Naturally, the company with the biggest say in
what happens to the desktop can afford to watch from the sidelines for a
while. Microsoft Windows 95, for instance, has some desktop-management
features built in, but it is not yet DMI-compliant.
   We recommend that you continue to use your current
systems-administration tools to manage an imminent Windows 95 rollout. Of
the vendors in this comparison, only Symantec has released products that
are Windows 95 and 32-bit certified: Norton Utilities for Networks, Norton
Anti-Virus, and Norton pcANYWHERE. Within six months, expect the release of
additional Symantec products and offerings from the other vendors that take
advantage of Windows 95's management hooks. If you plan to stick with
Windows 3.x for a while, these four products currently shipping, although
far from perfect, should help you get a better handle on your network.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

   For this special issue of LAN Times, the Testing Center takes a look at
four leading network-administration packages: Seagate Enterprise Management
Software's Seagate Frye Utilities for Networks, Intel Corp.'s LANDesk
Management Suite 2.01, McAfee Associates Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation 5.5,
and Symantec Corp.'s Norton Network Series 2.0. Our evaluation was based on
criteria deemed most important by a sample of LAN Times readers: asset
management, license metering, software distribution, server monitoring, and
suite integration. We added a miscellaneous criterion for capabilities that
did not fit neatly into the other five categories. Three of these four
companies offer a collection of multiple products (or modules) to meet
these management needs, with varying degrees of communication between the
parts. Intel was the only company that offered a tightly integrated
solution.
   Although Seagate Frye Utilities for Networks is a modular suite, the
company has put a lot of effort into integration. In addition to the
suite's common management console, many of the modules can share data. We
gave the product high marks for server monitoring but only an average score
for the license-metering utility.
   LANDesk was the best overall network-management solution; it won the
comparison and just missed getting a Best of Times award. LANDesk now
supports NDS (NetWare Directory Services), and we liked its server
monitoring and software distribution. However, we wish we could have
exported data from the inventory utility to the license-metering module.
   After the company's acquisition of Saber Software Corp. last fall,
McAfee's network-administration tools are in a period of transition.
Although all the modules scored well, we wish integration was a little
stronger.
   Symantec has put a lot of effort into the Norton Network Series, which
encompasses a range of top-of-the-line products. We especially liked the
asset-management module in Norton Administrator for Networks.
Unfortunately, the package lacked a server-monitoring tool, which
dramatically affected its overall score. With an adequate server-monitoring
feature, Norton Network Series could have scored as high as any of the
other products in the comparison.

WHAT WILL ALL THAT DEALING MEAN?

   Mergers and acquisitions among companies that produce network-management
software have been fast and furious in the past six months. If you've tried
to keep track, you may have found it simpler to count the companies not
involved in some sort of maneuvering. Indeed, all of the software makers in
this comparison, except for Intel Corp., have recently made changes to
their product lines due in part to changes in their corporate composition.
   By purchasing Frye Computer Systems Inc. last August, Seagate Technology
Inc. acquired the popular Frye Utilities, distributed now by Seagate's
Enterprise Management Software division. In the longer term, Seagate is
developing an end-to-end network- and systems-management package that will
integrate the Frye Utilities with technologies and products from other
acquisitions such as Arcada Software Inc. and Palindrome Corp.
   Seagate is aiming to produce management and backup tools for Novell Inc.
NetWare, Microsoft Windows NT, and Unix platforms, as well as developing a
32-bit version of Frye Utilities. This edition will take advantage of the
Windows 95 architecture and should be available by the middle of this
year.
   McAfee Associates Inc., which recently purchased Saber Software Corp.,
has an ambitious plan to create a series of enterprise-management products
for NetWare and Windows NT, called McAfee Systems Management. Although the
strategy is not surprising, the speed at which the company hopes to meet
these goals is. This year, McAfee plans to release 13 major products that
run on Windows 95, are SNMP-compliant, have TCP/IP support, share a common
OLE management console and scripting language, and are scaleable.
   Symantec Corp. recently finalized its purchase of Delrina Corp., which
followed a long line of acquisitions. Symantec was one of the first vendors
to offer 32-bit programs for Windows 95, such as its Norton Utilities, and
the company will be releasing most of its product line for Windows 95
sometime this year.

NOT READY TO RUMBLE

   Some people view Novell Inc.'s ManageWise and Microsoft Corp.'s Systems
Management Server as two heavyweights trading blows in the
network-management arena. Unfortunately, they're more like fighters who
never face each other in the ring because they work for different
promoters.
   The LAN Times Testing Center has received numerous requests to compare
the two products, but so far there hasn't been much to compare. There are a
few similarities: Both Systems Management Server (SMS) and the LANDesk
portion of ManageWise perform software distribution, for instance. But the
differences far outweigh the similarities.
   A very powerful package with many wide-area capabilities, ManageWise 2.0
combines Novell's LANalyzer 1.0 and NMS (NetWare Management System) 2.0
with Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Manager 1.51. It is designed for multiserver
NetWare environments in which the need to control non-PC, SNMP-compatible
devices such as routers, hubs, and UPSes (uninterruptible power supplies)
is critical. ManageWise's strength is its openness, and Novell encourages
independent software vendors (ISVs) to write software that takes advantage
of its services. In fact, Novell offers a 120-page list of compatible
products.
   Systems Management Server 1.1 runs on Microsoft Windows NT and is part
of the Microsoft BackOffice suite. It also requires Microsoft SQL Server,
another component of BackOffice. SMS offers robust remote-control and
traffic-monitoring capabilities, as well as an excellent
software-distribution utility with an integrated inventory database. Its
strengths are an easy-to-use GUI and good integration of the different
features. Microsoft also encourages ISVs to write software that takes
advantage of SMS' services.
   The bottom line? We will compare the two products only when ManageWise
can manage Windows NT or SMS can manage NetWare. Until then, neither can
legitimately claim the championship belt.

SURVEY OF READERS DETERMINES CRITERIA

   Although the feature sets of the four product lines overlap in several
areas, each network-management package has certain capabilities that the
others do not. Because we wanted an apples-to-apples comparison, we
telephoned a number of LAN Times readers to determine the areas they
considered most significant when evaluating a network-administration
product. In order of importance, they were asset management, license
metering, software distribution, server monitoring, and integration. A
miscellaneous category was created as a catchall for features we thought
worthy of mention but that did not fit neatly in our test criteria.
   We used three servers and 12 workstations to perform our testing. A
Compaq Computer Corp. ProSignia 486/66 with 32MB of RAM ran Novell Inc.
NetWare 3.12; a Hewlett-Packard Co. NetServer LM 486/66 with 24MB of RAM
and the latest copy of Microsoft Corp.'s File and Print Services for
NetWare ran Microsoft Windows NT 3.51; and an HP Vectra 486/33 with 24MB of
RAM ran NetWare 4.1. We used 12 HP Vectra 486/33s with 8MB of RAM for the
clients: Three ran Microsoft DOS 6.22, eight ran Windows 3.1, and one (with
16MB of RAM) ran Windows 95. Although 32-bit editions of these programs
will not be released until later this year, the 16-bit versions operated on
the Microsoft Windows 95 workstation without any obvious problems.
   We installed each suite or group of products on the NetWare 4.1 server
and then on the NetWare 3.12 server. Those products that supported Windows
NT were installed on the NT server. They were then evaluated according to
the following criteria.

Management Material
   The LAN Times readers we surveyed deemed asset management, license
metering, and software distribution the most important capabilities in an
administration tool, and we gave these criteria higher weighting in our
scoring. The main goal of asset management is simple: Find out what
hardware and software exist on your enterprise. Thus, we looked for the
capability to detect resources on both servers and workstations.
   We also wanted to see whether workstation audits were performed by login
script or batch file. We checked for Desktop Management Interface (DMI)
compliance by using various Management Information Formats (MIFs). For
license metering, we checked to see if the packages supported network and
local drives, multiple servers, applications suites, and remote checkout.
   To test software distribution, we performed a standard battery of tests,
including installing the Microsoft Office suite in a number of ways. First,
we loaded the suite from the workstation running each product's management
console, then from a local server on the same segment as the workstations,
and finally from a remote server across a router.
   We weighted server monitoring and product integration slightly lower
than the first three criteria. Even though there are hundreds of possible
server statistics, we looked for the most common and useful ones, such as
current connections, disk and volume information, and memory utilization.
For integration, we looked specifically at links between the
asset-management and software-metering modules, as well as how they
integrated with a common management console. And as previously mentioned,
we added a miscellaneous category for unique features that did not fit the
other criteria.
   Finally, we kept useability in mind throughout the testing process,
although it didn't get its own criterion. All of these products are
supposed to make the administrator's job easier. If a tool's learning curve
is too high, then you may not be getting your money's worth.

TAKING STOCK OF EVERYTHING

   Asset management is one of the biggest areas of concern for LAN
administrators. Without a good asset-management strategy, important
questions such as ``Are we using all the software we've bought over the
past year?'' and ``What hardware do we have, and where is it?'' cannot be
readily answered. Utilities that perform hardware and software inventories
are not a panacea, but they are an immense help in tracking what's on the
LAN.
   As we tested the inventorying functions of the four products, we
repeatedly encountered a particular error. Although the utilities were
capable of finding everything on our test network, they often made mistakes
in reporting the processor speed of some machines. Everything else worked
well, however, and we gave good marks across the board--with Symantec
Corp.'s tool receiving the highest score.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   LAN Directory (LAND) is the Seagate module that performs hardware and
software inventories. This utility was very easy to install, and we were
inventorying workstations in short order. LAND correctly identified all our
workstations and the applications loaded on them thanks to its built-in
list of 6,000 software titles. In addition to its basic capabilities, LAND
can track inventory history and noncomputer equipment.
   Although LAND makes it easy to scan individual user records, the syntax
of its report writer is not easy to understand. If you need more
information than the two dozen canned reports provide, you will be better
off modifying one of the samples rather than creating a new one from
scratch.
   WinLAND is the recently released edition of LAND for Windows 3.1. It
ships with a version of the Watcom International Corp. Watcom SQL database,
which enables more ad hoc queries to be performed from a third-party
program.

LANDesk
   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk is tied tightly to Novell Inc. NetWare. Its
hardware and software inventory functions are placed in a NetWare login
script and can be set to execute every time a user logs in to the server or
at other predefined intervals. You can also set up the server to
continuously scan for new software. Viewing inventory information is easy.
A number of canned reports are available, or you can customize them with
user-defineable data such as serial numbers and installation date.
   Because of its close ties to Novell's NMS (NetWare Management System),
LANDesk can inventory SNMP-capable devices. Discovered workstations and
devices are managed by a utility similar to the Microsoft Windows File
Manager. Individual workstations can be identified by a unique name, the
hardware address of the network card, or the last user to log in at that
station. LANDesk was the only Desktop Management Interface (DMI)-compliant
product that we tested.

Saber LAN Workstation
   Although Saber Software Corp.'s Saber LAN Workstation (SLW) 5.0 had an
adequate inventory tool, it was considered weak compared with McAfee
Associates Inc.'s LAN Inventory, a part of BrightWorks 2.1. McAfee's
acquisition of Saber has left the asset-management part of SLW 5.0 out in
the cold for now. In SLW 5.5, most of the old BrightWorks utilities have
replaced Saber's tools.
   LAN Inventory is demanding; it needs seven NLMs on the file server and a
TSR on each workstation. (The TSR is a Btrieve Technology Inc. Btrieve
requester that will no longer be needed when McAfee converts to a Microsoft
FoxPro database scheme.) We thought the product performed an adequate, but
not stellar, job of gathering inventory information from our workstations.
BrightWorks currently supports Compaq Computer Corp.'s Intelligent
Manageability firmware, which is very similar to the DMI specification.

Norton Network Series
   With its built-in list of thousands of software packages, Symantec's
Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) 2.0 accurately identified the
applications on our test system, but if an application you use is not on
the list, you can add it. And it took just a few mouse clicks to generate a
comprehensive report about our workstations.
   Starting with a scan of the system BIOS, NAN delivers a level of detail
in its hardware inventory matched only by Frye's LAN Directory. Both DOS
and Windows versions are available, although the Windows version provides
more information about Windows drivers and statistics. Last but not least,
NAN lets an administrator run the inventory program from a floppy disk on a
standalone computer and then merge collected data into the master database
when convenient.

NOT JUST FOR METERING ANYMORE

   Application license metering isn't the hot new technology it was several
years ago. Now, it's almost a necessity. Increased vigilance by the
Software Publishers Association and the Business Software Alliance has sent
a stern message to pirates: Comply or else. However, savvy managers have
found an additional benefit to the tools they first used to get
legal--allocating and managing existing licenses to reduce the number of
new licenses they are forced to buy.
   Last summer, we reviewed eight metering tools, including the four that
are part of the network-management packages in this comparison (see
``Software-Metering Tools,'' July 3, 1995, Page 65, and ``Another Look at
Software-Metering Tools,'' July 24, 1995, Page 101). Then, as now, we were
more interested in license management than in simple license metering.
McAfee Associates Inc.'s SiteMeter earned a Best of Times last summer, and
it received the top score in this comparison.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Software Metering And Resource Tracking (SMART) is Seagate's
license-metering module. A Microsoft Windows version isn't available, but
the DOS interface is fairly easy to use. SMART is an NLM-based product and
uses a TSR to monitor clients. It can monitor single-user, concurrent, and
suite licenses on both local and network drives. SMART identifies files to
meter only by filename or path information; it can't use other identifiers
such as file size and date.
   When license limits are reached, SMART can passively monitor the
situation, keeping a log for the administrator, or it can actively prevent
applications from being used until a license is available. Overall, if
you're looking for an effective metering tool and don't need to manage
licenses, then SMART deserves a closer look.

LANDesk
   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite offers an NLM-based metering
solution that provides a good way to manage licenses across multiple
servers. Several NLMs access the metering database, transfer access and
metering information between workstations and servers, and scan for file
opens and closes.
   In a typical multiserver environment, a management server contains the
primary metering databases and a relay server stores copies of
applications. When a user loads a metered application, only eight packets
pass among the workstation, relay server, and management server. This
reduces the amount of interserver chatter so effectively that LANDesk can
operate adequately over a 56KB per second WAN link. LANDesk uses path
information to identify executeable files (including applications suites)
on Novell Inc. NetWare file servers, but it can't monitor local hard drives
or servers based on other platforms.

Saber LAN Workstation
   The license-metering product for the previous version of Saber LAN
Workstation was known as Saber Enterprise Application Manager (SEAM). After
McAfee's acquisition of Saber, however, SEAM has been scrapped in favor of
McAfee's own SiteMeter 5.1, which McAfee acquired when it purchased
Brightwork Development Inc.
   As an NLM-based product, SiteMeter requires NetWare 3.1 or higher. It
tracks applications by monitoring file opens and closes on the server. It
also offers TCP/IP support with license load balancing, which reduces WAN
traffic by allowing SiteMeter to automatically migrate licenses to the
server from which they are most commonly requested. Unlike most other
NLM-based metering products, SiteMeter doesn't ship with a TSR for
monitoring local hard drives, an option we think most administrators would
prefer to have.
   An administrator can gather license statistics--in real time or over a
specified period--on all metered servers on the internetwork. Seagate
Technology Inc.'s Crystal Reports Microsoft Windows-based software is
included with SiteMeter for generating reports.
   Installation is easy, but you will need to have the latest versions of
CLIB.NLM and BTRIEVE.NLM on your file server. Once you configure one file
server with license and permission information, you can use the
license-replication feature to copy the information to other servers, which
is a real time-saver.

Norton Network Series
   Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) includes the software-metering
portion of the Norton Network Series. It is a client-based product that
uses DOS and Windows TSRs (Symantec Corp. calls them Agents) along with an
administrative program to monitor and enforce license limits. The product
can meter concurrent, server, and site licenses on network and local
drives.
   Installation can be time-consuming because an Agent must be running on
each workstation to be monitored. However, NAN's software-distribution
feature can be used to ease this chore, loading the Agents when users log
in to the network.
   Because NAN links its asset-management and metering pieces, it is easy
to create a list of the applications on your network to be monitored. In
addition, NAN includes over 5,000 predefined applications; if a program is
not on the list, you can add a description to the database. Our one
complaint in this regard was that the list of metered applications must be
manually copied to other servers. However, data from all of the servers can
be combined into a single report.

LET THE SUITE DO THE WALKING

   Visiting every workstation on the network to install the latest software
upgrade is one of the most tedious, time-consuming jobs a manager is
responsible for. That's why software distribution over the LAN is one of
the best ideas ever developed for network administration. Intel Corp.'s
LANDesk won this portion of our comparison, with its innovative, yet
easy-to-use, tool.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Seagate's software-distribution module is called Software Update and
Distribution System (SUDS), and we liked it almost as much as LANDesk's
tool. Some of the common tasks that can be performed are searching and
replacing in text files, finding duplicate files on workstations, and
uninstalling packages. It also has a scheduler that lets file distribution
be run after business hours. This feature requires that a TSR run on the
target workstation.
   Seagate offers single-server, server-to-server, and WAN versions of
SUDS. The server-to-server option is useful for updating NLMs and other
files between servers. This feature is similar to Symantec Corp.'s Norton
Administrator for Networks' Site Manager utility, but it can also schedule
and execute console commands that load and unload NLMs on the target
server. The wide-area option lets an administrator distribute jobs to other
SUDS servers on the WAN. A single copy is sent across the link; the
receiving SUDS server distributes copies to its workstations. This reduces
WAN traffic and is great for slower (dial-up or 56Kbps) connections.

LANDesk
   Intel's software-distribution solution is the easiest we encountered, at
least for networks with standardized workstations. LANDesk uses a
management agent on a reference workstation to track changes to that
client's installed software. When it's time for an upgrade, LANDesk applies
changes made at the reference workstation to all clients on the LAN. Most
other software-distribution packages use server-based rules to upgrade
software.
   There are drawbacks to LANDesk's method, however. If software needs to
be uninstalled, LANDesk will restore .INI files to the state they were in
before installation. On the surface this seems good, but it could cause
problems if something else has been installed since the last LANDesk
distribution job.
   There are several ways to choose recipients of a distribution job. You
could query the hardware-inventory database and then specify only the
machines with a certain minimum configuration.
   Like the other packages in this comparison, a job can be performed even
if users have logged off, although their network drivers must still be
loaded. And like SUDS, LANDesk is able to work efficiently over the WAN.
Each local server is responsible for distributing software to its
workstations.

Saber LAN Workstation
   The program that handles software distribution for McAfee Associates
Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation (SLW) 5.5 was formerly known as SiteExpress
3.0 when it was part of the BrightWorks package. Like most of McAfee's
current product line, this program is targeted at Novell Inc. NetWare 3.x
and 4.x networks with DOS and Microsoft Windows workstations. It performs
standard distribution jobs well, and workstation distribution can be
scheduled to occur at login or logout. The product relies heavily on a
Microsoft Visual Basic-like scripting language that administrators may not
want to take the time to learn, although it is powerful and relatively easy
to use.
   The SLW 5.5 utility supports TCP/IP, which lets administrators
distribute software to remote IP servers that are not part of the local IPX
network. And thanks to NDS (NetWare Directory Services) support, software
can be distributed to NDS tree objects. In our testing, we created an NDS
user object on our NetWare 4.1 server and used this tool to send a simple
distribution job.
   Because distribution jobs usually create a high amount of network
traffic, the SLW 5.5 utility can compress the files it moves. However, we
didn't notice much of a difference on our relatively small test network. On
much larger distribution jobs, compression could make a substantial
difference.

Norton Network Series
   Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) delivers a decent implementation
of software distribution. Although creating distribution jobs is harder
than it is with the other packages in this comparison, the distribution
phase is the fastest and most trouble-free of the quartet.
   Like SLW 5.5, NAN relies heavily on a scripting language, in this case
Symantec's version of BASIC, and the company has included a number of
sample scripts. NAN can even record keystrokes for fast customization of
jobs. If you use the scripts provided, you should not expect any problems.
   We experienced difficulties, however, when we tried to create custom
scripts without consulting the manual. Fairly complex jobs can be created
if you're willing to spend the time, but the process isn't easy. We also
think it's wise to test any procedure before scheduling a job on the
network.

PREVENTIVE ADMINISTRATION

   Most servers are either tucked away in some nook or cranny or secreted
in closets and locked rooms. Unfortunately, this arrangement promotes an
out-of-sight, out-of-mind attitude. When a server exhibits a problem, the
first sign an administrator often has is a slew of phone calls from frantic
users. With the server-monitoring feature of a network-management package,
however, an administrator can monitor a server's health, often heading off
problems before they occur.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Seagate has a number of packages for server monitoring. Taken as a
whole, this set tops even Intel Corp.'s LANDesk. Unfortunately, by having
to buy separate products, you'll pay a quite bit more for the combined
functionality than you will for the other suites in this comparison.
   Network Management for NetWare is a DOS-based module that can take the
place of native Novell Inc. NetWare utilities such as SYSCON, PCONSOLE,
FCONSOLE, and FILER. If you spend a lot of time switching between these
utilities, Network Management for NetWare is well worth the cost. We used
it to add and delete users, set up print queues, monitor user connections,
and identify old NETX.EXE shell versions.
   Early Warning System for NetWare is an NLM-based module that monitors
server events and can respond in a number of customizeable ways. Early
Warning System can alert administrators via pager, fax, or E-mail of
critical problems, or it can run an automated procedure for less crucial
events. This module integrates with Seagate's license-metering module to
alert administrators when a license limit has been exceeded.
   Console Commander for NetWare is essentially a scheduler that executes
scripts at a predetermined time. We used it to unload and load a series of
NLMs on our NetWare servers. It is a capable, but bare-bones, utility.

LANDesk
   Intel's offering has some very comprehensive server-monitoring
functions, and its object-tree structure makes operation easy. When you
select a server object from the tree, a list of applicable management
options appear. Intel has added over 100 new monitoring parameters to this
version of LANDesk. Again, they are presented as a collapsible tree that
makes it easy to view information and set alarm thresholds.
   The new alert manager, Alert Management System, can receive alerts from
the other LANDesk modules. It also lets you execute predefined tasks in
response to an alert, similar to Frye's NEWS. Network administrators can be
notified via E-mail or pager.
   LANDesk includes a substitute for Novell's RCONSOLE.NLM to remotely
control the server's console screen from a workstation. The difference
between them is RCONSOLE uses a text password stored on the server, but
LANDesk encrypts the password.

SLW
   The Saber LAN Workstation line from McAfee Associates Inc. has some good
server-monitoring tools from Brightwork Development Inc. These utilities
will be upgraded and repackaged into the Server Manager, which should be
available by the middle of the year. Because we don't know exactly what
Server Manager will look like, we evaluated HawkNet Inc.'s NetTune Pro, a
utility bundled with BrightWorks.
   NetTune can monitor nearly all of NetWare's configureable settings. It
also can determine if current settings are causing problems and can suggest
a solution, which it can institute automatically. However, NetTune doesn't
provide any network traffic statistics like Frye's or Intel's products do.

Norton Network Series
   The Norton Network Series does not offer any server-monitoring features
as we define them, which really hurt its final score. If Symantec Corp.
adds some server-monitoring capabilities, the Norton Network Series,
already an excellent all-around package, might surpass even Intel's LANDesk
suite.

PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER

   Three of the product lines we looked at--Seagate Enterprise Management
Software's Seagate Frye Utilities for Networks, McAfee Associates Inc.'s
Saber LAN Workstation, and Symantec Corp.'s Norton Network Series--are
loosely integrated sets of modules with a common management console.
Applications are loaded from the console as needed by the administrator.
Although these products started as standalone tools, their developers have
made impressive strides toward tying them together. The module approach
works well because you can add management tools as your network grows.
   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite 2.01, on the other hand, is a
tightly integrated one-stop package. Communications between the
asset-management and network-monitoring portions are excellent, for
instance. LANDesk would have easily won this portion of the comparison if
its software-inventory and -metering functions had been linked.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Seagate's modular approach made installation a little tiring; we
couldn't help but wonder if there were a better way after loading the ninth
or 10th separate piece. We hope a CD-ROM installation will be available
soon. After installation, however, we had very few complaints. All the
programs detected the presence of previously installed modules and plugged
themselves in to the shared management console. Also, all of the modules
have some data-sharing capabilities. For example, the inventory module, LAN
Directory, shares its asset database with the software-distribution
module.
   Most of the modules can also make use of the scheduling capability of
network-alert tools. We were also able to examine user connections logged
in to the server and then launch the inventory program to access more
detailed information.
   Seagate has done a pretty good job of integrating its software. The next
big hurdle for the company will be tying together software from all the
rest of its recent acquisitions.

LANDesk
   As previously mentioned, LANDesk is a tightly integrated package. The
new version includes a centralized Alert Management System that can receive
alerts from the other LANDesk modules. Also, if an alert is generated, a
predefined task can be run in response. LANDesk has a terrific report
generator that all of the management tools can directly send information
to. On the downside, the software-metering module can't import information
from the inventory database, a glaring shortcoming, and something we'd like
to see remedied in the future.

Saber LAN Workstation
   Given the recent structural changes at McAfee, it's difficult to speak
definitively about the integration of the company's product line.
Communications between SiteExpress and SiteMeter were adequate, but other
integration, specifically between SiteExpress and the desktop-menuing
portion of Saber LAN Workstation (SLW), could have been better. Of course,
these products are in transition and promise to be much more integrated in
the future (see ``What Will All That Dealing Mean?'' above).

Norton Network Series
   The latest version of Norton Administrator for Networks (NAN) has added
some centralized features that make it very easy to gather information. NAN
uses a primary/secondary hierarchy in which the primary level consists of
servers and the secondary level consists of associated servers and
workstations. NAN's Site Manager receives information from the secondary
sites and makes sure that the master databases on the primary servers are
updated. These databases can include inventory, distribution, and metering
data.
   A centralized database lets an administrator at a primary server access
information from across the network. This data can be exported to the
report generator or to an ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)-compliant
application such as a document manager.
   Although NAN offers strong integration, there are gaps in other products
in the Norton Network Series. Some, for instance, will install themselves
into the common console but can't share databases. In particular, we'd like
to see better integration between the backup and inventory programs.

administrators customize the inventory database among many fields.

HOW DO THEY DIFFER?

   Although there are similarities in the feature sets of these
network-management products, each has important capabilities that don't fit
precisely into the five criteria we've used to analyze them. Some companies
include unique features to differentiate their offerings from the crowd;
others have strengths in related product classes that can add value to
their basic management tools. In a comparison with such a broad focus as
network management, we decided to include a miscellaneous category for just
such extras, although we could not test all of the products mentioned
here.

Seagate Frye Utilities
   Seagate offers a number of valuable extras, including the Node Tracker
and the Alert Interface Manager for NMS (NetWare Management System). Node
Tracker can monitor workstation statistics such as IPX components and
network shell version number.
   Node mapping, however, is its most important feature. Not to be confused
with network-mapping utilities, such as Microsystems Engineering Co.'s
SysDraw, which create a graphical representation of the devices on your
network, node mapping collects information on attached workstations as the
machines log in. Because Node Tracker can share this information with LAN
Directory, you could pull up a detailed hardware inventory for a
workstation broadcasting bad packets, for instance. This would make
replacing an ailing NIC much easier. Node Tracker can also share data with
NMS.
   The add-on Alert Interface Manager for NMS increases NMS' capability to
send alerts via pager, E-mail, or Novell Inc. NetWare console message when
NMS generates an alarm or event.

LANDesk
   In addition to its strong core functions, LANDesk includes several
miscellaneous goodies, such as a limited version of Virus Protect, Intel
Corp.'s anti-virus software. The LANDesk packet-analyzer software is
another extra. With it, an administrator can set up filters to monitor data
flow across the wire. In addition to simple packet decodes, LANDesk has
filters that can monitor application traffic. This will let you track a
specific program's impact on your network performance, rooting out the
users and applications that are bandwidth hogs. LANDesk can also monitor
SNMP devices and snap in to some major network-management consoles such as
Novell ManageWise, Hewlett-Packard Co. HP OpenView, and Digital Equipment
Corp. ManageWorks.

Saber LAN Workstation
   McAfee Associates Inc.'s Saber LAN Workstation has an obvious bonus--the
anti-virus software that made the company famous. The server edition
supports NetWare and Microsoft Windows NT, and the desktop version supports
DOS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT. McAfee
also offers a remote-control package called NetRemote. The product handles
the basics well but is not serious competition for Symantec Corp.'s Norton
pcANYWHERE or Microcom Corp.'s Carbon Copy. We successfully used NetRemote
to dial in to a machine and perform minor tasks such as retrieving E-mail.
   With its acquisition of Saber LAN Workstation, McAfee has also gained a
great set of tools for desktop and menu management, capabilities that far
exceed typical software-distribution capabilities. For instance, the
package provides excellent control of .INI, AUTOEXEC.BAT, and CONFIG.SYS
files. However, be prepared to spend some time with the manuals if you want
to use the menu-management features.

Norton Network Series
   Other utilities in the Norton Network Series include pcANYWHERE,
AntiVirus for NetWare, Utilities Administrator, Desktop Administrator, and
Enterprise Backup. All of these products integrate with the Norton
Administrator for Networks console.
   We like pcANYWHERE, the leading remote-control program, so much that we
gave version 2.0 our Best of Times award last spring (see ``pcANYWHERE
Leads Remote-Software Race,'' April 24, 1995, Page 109). Easy integration
with Norton Administrator for Networks is the icing on the cake.
   AntiVirus for NetWare is an NLM-based product that scans for viruses on
your NetWare server. Utilities Administrator adds new life to the venerable
Norton Utilities collection, including the capability to run the utilities
from a centralized console. Desktop Administrator is similar to the
desktop-control portion of Saber LAN Workstation, and we especially liked
that not all users need be under its control. Finally, the powerful Norton
Enterprise Backup offers a many-to-many backup solution.

solution that we encountered. There are a number of scheduling options, and
jobs can be pushed or pulled out to workstations.

SEAGATE FRYE: UTILITIES FOR NETWORKS

   Seagate Frye Utilities can be installed as a series of individual
products or as modules in a loosely integrated suite, but they are
expensive when purchased separately. The utilities are easy to install, and
most of the modules use a DOS interface, although Seagate is working on
Microsoft Windows 95 versions of the software. The package offers a wide
range of server- and desktop-management functions but lacks anti-virus and
backup utilities. We hope these holes will be filled by Seagate, which
recently acquired the Frye Utilities. In fact, watch for Seagate to release
an end-to-end network-management solution in 1996 composed of Seagate Frye
Utilities, backup utilities from Arcada Software Inc. and Palindrome Corp.,
and Unix-management utilities that Seagate recently acquired.

SABER LAN WORKSTATION 5.5

   Saber LAN Workstation 5.5 is the first in a series of products resulting
from McAfee Associates Inc.'s purchase of Saber Software. This package
combines the asset-management and license-metering capabilities of McAfee's
SiteExpress 3.0 and SiteMeter 5.1 with the desktop-configuration and
-menuing capabilities of SLW 5.0. It also complements McAfee's BrightWorks,
which has strong server-monitoring features. SLW is aimed primarily at
NetWare networks and DOS and Windows workstations. Installation is tricky
in spots, but the products work well once they are loaded. We thought the
integration between utilities in SLW 5.5 needed some work, but we hope this
will be provided in early 1996 with the release of version 6.0. This
product is one to watch as McAfee begins in earnest to consolidate its
acquisitions.

NORTON NETWORK SERIES

   The main products in the NOS-independent Norton Network Series are
Norton Administrator for Networks 2.0, Norton Desktop Administrator 1.0,
Norton Enterprise Backup 1.0, and Norton pcANYWHERE 6.0. Taken together,
these products deliver strong asset-management, license-metering,
software-distribution, desktop-configuration, remote-control, and backup
capabilities. We especially liked NAN's new enterprise capabilities and
protocol independence, which make it suitable for almost any kind of
network. If Symantec Corp. would just add server-monitoring capabilities to
the mix, the Norton Network Series would be top dog among
network-administration tools.

LANDESK MANAGEMENT SUITE 2.01

   Intel Corp.'s LANDesk Management Suite 2.01 delivers great functionality
in a tightly integrated package. It won the comparison and just missed
receiving our Best of Times award. In addition to standard
asset-management, software-distribution, and monitoring capabilities,
LANDesk offers SNMP support and low-level packet tracing, features not
found in other products. Installation was easier compared with previous
versions of LANDesk. Also, although this version works only on NetWare
servers, it now supports NDS. A Windows NT version is available, but it
cannot share duties with the NetWare suite.

IF WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT, WHY AREN'T WE DEAD YET?

By:
Tere' Parnell

   After a long investigation, you've convinced yourself you need a
desktop-management system and have chosen the one that best meets your
needs. Now comes the really hard part--getting the money to buy it. You
know it will save time, freeing you and your staff to do support work that
now goes undone: reports that aren't run, equipment that isn't inventoried,
and software that isn't upgraded. More than likely, however, conserving
your time isn't a high priority for upper-level management. When you point
to all your neglected tasks, your manager may not understand their
importance. After all, you haven't been doing them, and things seem to be
OK.
   Indeed, one of the desktop-management packages we've reviewed may be
helpful, even vital, to your department--but only if you can get it into
your shop. Given their reluctance to spend money on anything that won't
show a tangible economic benefit, how do you convince the powers-that-be to
give you the money to buy one?
   The answer is deceptively simple: Put a price on it. Determine how much
the system really costs and how much it will really save, or earn, and then
figure out if the difference is worth it. You'll get a lot more attention
when you present a purchase request in terms of the money it can save your
company rather than convenience and ease of use. Telling your boss that a
management system will let you track inventory more easily is one thing;
pointing out that a more accurate inventory will save your company $25,000
a year is another.
   Of course, the nitty-gritty of determining these figures requires
technical expertise, business acumen, and creative thinking. Here are a few
pointers on how to translate benefits and costs into dollars and cents.

It's a Wonderful Life
   The first step to putting a price on the benefit of a management system,
or any technology for that matter, is to take an objective look at life
without the product--past, present, and future. Ask yourself what recent
projects the management system could have streamlined and use these
examples when dealing with management.
   Next, ask yourself what won't get done, or done well, in the future
without the management system and determine how that will affect your
business. For example, if you want to show how valuable software
distribution is, conduct a survey to find out how much time people spend
converting documents and macros between two versions of a word processor
because you haven't had a chance to upgrade everyone's copy.
   As another example, assume that you administer a 2,500-node network and
hope to use the management system to create an accurate inventory of
desktop computer equipment. First, spot check your records, then select a
few dozen entries at random (about a 1 percent sampling rate) and check
their accuracy. Do your current inventory records correctly describe your
desktop systems? Suppose in this example that you find inaccurate
information for four desktop systems, about a 17 percent error rate. The
first system was listed as being in service but was actually broken beyond
repair; the second was listed as being in its third year of service when it
was really in its sixth year; the third was missing a CD-ROM drive your
inventory claimed it had; and the fourth had 8MB more RAM than recorded.
   Your friendly accounting department can help you determine what such an
error rate means in terms of money. An inaccurate inventory of fixed assets
affects depreciation, casualty and theft losses, insurance coverage and
claims, and property tax. In our example, two computers should have been
taken off your books completely, and two computers had the wrong valuation.
In addition, the company may be eligible for an insurance reimbursement for
the missing CD-ROM player.

Doomsayer
   Now that you have a feel for the costs of not having a
desktop-management system, take a moment to play Cassandra. Conjure up the
worst-case scenario that could result from continuing to do without a
management system. In our example, the inaccurate inventory could have
resulted in a massive overpayment of property tax, perhaps $25,000. A hard
number like that is powerful ammunition in your dealings with those who
sign the checks.
   If you're looking for a more extreme example, consider the relatively
new issue of software-license management. Perform an audit of your
department's software usage (the Software Publishers Association provides
utilities for this at URL http://www.spa.org/piracy/download.html). Suppose
you find that your company regularly has 200 copies of a certain word
processor in use, but you only have 150 licenses. The worst-case scenario
might be a visit from the SPA, with federal marshals in tow. Calculate the
cost of settling with the SPA: the full list price for each of the 50
illegal copies and 50 new legal licenses. When you present visions like
these to your managers, you'll definitely have their attention.

Consider the Alternative
   At some point in your pitch, it's a good idea to concede that a complete
management system is not the only way to administer your network. To have a
persuasive argument, you must acknowledge the alternatives, prove that you
have considered them, and then reveal their inadequacies--if you can.
   Alternatives to managing inventory could be to pay overtime or to hire
an additional employee. Naturally, either option costs money. Include
salary, benefits, annual raises, recruiting costs, and turnover in your
calculations. Then estimate the accuracy of that person's work and make
adjustments. Human error is inevitable, and it is expensive. In our earlier
example, hiring someone to manage inventory manually might cost $30,000 per
year but only reduce the error rate to 6 percent; you could still be
overpaying property tax by about $9,000. That translates to a total cost of
$39,000 per year.
   If your primary concern is software distribution, consider the cost of
writing and maintaining your own utilities to manage these chores. Also,
the only real alternative to a license-management program is manual counts.
Again, this means overtime or additional personnel--and a large margin of
error.

The Price Is Right
   Now it's time to put a price on the desktop-management system you want
to buy. Be honest with yourself when calculating these costs. As you know,
the cost is much more than the purchase price. How will the system affect
client and server resources? Will additional hardware be required? Will you
have to purchase annual support contracts? How will implementing the system
affect staffing? Overtime? Training? Don't forget that many of these
packages aren't seamlessly integrated; you may have to spend some time
cobbling together the best combination of tools.
   After you evaluate the costs of the management system, you must assess
its benefits. This is probably where you started, imagining the
improvements such a system would bring to the way you work. But when you're
making your pitch, you'll have to have something more concrete than fuzzy
images of a no-hands network. How will it benefit the company? As mentioned
earlier, making your life easier won't be enough to satisfy the budget
committee. A product that cuts personnel costs or solves a significant
operational or customer-service problem is going to get the budget
dollars.
   In our inventory example, if the total cost of implementing the
management system is $50,000 or less, the system will pay for itself in two
years in property-tax savings alone. After that, the system will be putting
$25,000 back in your company's coffers each year.
   Now that you've gathered your facts, found the costs and shortcomings in
your solution, addressed the holes in your logic, and built a case based on
economic need and common sense, it's time to prepare your presentation.
Start by telling your audience how much the desktop-management system will
save the company. Then give an example of a past project that would have
been done more cost effectively if the system had been in place. Present
the worst-case scenario if the system isn't purchased, and conclude with a
step-by-step explanation of the analysis you used to arrive at these
conclusions. And in case your argument sparks enthusiasm, it's a good idea
to have a detailed implementation plan ready.

You Can't Always Get What You Want
   Your analysis will produce a sound, justifiable, and possibly
unassailable case for purchasing a management system--or a reasonable
explanation of why the purchase isn't feasible. In either case, you win.
Understanding why a purchase doesn't make business sense will build your
credibility with management as much as knowing why it does.
   Just as important, you (and they) will be aware of the types of systems
and pricing that will make sense. If your analysis shows that purchasing a
management system isn't a sound business move, don't give up. Calculate a
price at which the system would be a good buy, then present that figure to
your vendor; be fair--vendors have to make money, too. Even if there isn't
room for negotiation, your vendor will have information for the
management-system developer. Perhaps their system is overpriced for their
target market.
   This exercise will also give you a broad perspective on how your network
fits into your organization. It encourages constant, close communication
with other departments and an understanding of how they use the network and
information about it. This perspective will make you a better network
manager and serve you well throughout your career.

Put a Price on It
   Your boss doesn't want to hear how much easier a network-management
suite will make your job. It's all about the bottom line, and you'll need
to be well-prepared before heading into budget battle. These five steps
will help you attach specific figures to the costs and benefits of a
management package--and get the purchase approved.

Dwell in the Past
   Make a list of projects that could have been streamlined with the proper
tools: Upgrades that could have been rolled out faster, for example. Don't
forget to include IS projects, such as capacity planning or server
optimization, that have been put off for lack of time.

Find the Holes
   Check your current inventory records against a random sample of about 1
percent of your network devices. Document any inconsistencies and have the
accounting department assess the costs of the inaccurate inventory, such as
tax overpayments and neglected insurance claims. Also check for
software-license compliance with one of the utilities provided by the
Software Publishers Association.

It Could Be Worse
   Sketch a worst-case scenario for your boss. Describe what would happen
if your organization was caught illegally using software, for example.

Consider the Alternatives
   Balance your purchase request by calculating the costs of alternatives
to a management suite. Put a dollar value on the expense of adding staff or
paying overtime, for instance.

The Best Policy
   Be honest with your boss--and yourself. Don't gloss over the hidden
outlay associated with the tools you want to buy. Include the costs of
hardware and software upgrades or support contracts. Finally, don't forget
the time it will take you to get up to speed with the tools.
