COURTING FAVOR: S&LS GIVEN NARROW ODDS ON SUPERVISORY GOODWILL

Oral arguments held on supervisory goodwill Feb. 10
revealed a bitterly divided, 11-member court likely to decide for or
against the thrift industry by a margin as thin as a single vote.
     Industry lawyers were buoyed by the receptiveness of many
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit judges to its
arguments and by concession of key points by the government. But too many
judges still appear to be leaning toward the governments camp to predict an
industry win in the battle over whether Uncle Sam owes thriftsboth living
and deadfor supervisory goodwill promises made during the debacle.
     Between 40 and 50 supervisory goodwill cases have already
been filed and a victory in this lead case could encourage more to step
forward. The number of cases could rise above 100 and claims could add up
to $1 billion.
     Its too close to call, said Daniel J. Goldberg, an attorney
with Housley Goldberg & Kantarian in Washington. Goldberg predicted a 6-5
or 7-4 decision in a ruling that could take a year.
     Edward H. Sisson, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter, a
Washington firm representing several supervisory goodwill cases, said he
was encouraged by how the court received the arguments, giving a slight
edge to thrifts.
     Sisson said that government arguments, such as that
supervisory goodwill agreements were not contracts and the so-called
sovereign acts doctrine, were revealed as red herrings.
     Under sovereign acts doctrine, the government can breach
contracts without obligation so long as it acts to benefit the general
welfare.
     Sisson and other observers were surprised that the
governments attorney, Douglas Letter, conceded under grilling from Judge
Pauline Newman that the goodwill agreements did constitute contracts.
Newman dissented in a pro-government decision by a three-member panel of
the same court in May 1993.
     If we agree with the court of federal claims that these are
contracts, Newman said, then the govern-ments position on sovereign rights
doesnt apply.
     Goldberg said he was also surprised that Letter appeared to
concede the regulatory capital credit issue to thrifts. This could be
significant, Goldberg said, since the counsel for Glendale, Jerry Stouck of
Spriggs & Hollingsworth, and for Statesman, Charles J. Cooper of Shaw,
Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, pursued somewhat different strategies.
     Statesmans claim is widely seen to be stronger than
Glendales and Goldberg said it was possible, though less likely, that
Statesman would prevail but not Glendale. But both have valid contracts, he
hastened to add.
     The oral arguments were punctuated by interruptions from
argumentative judges, who asked for clarifications or interjected sarcastic
barbs. Several judges seemed intolerant of the governments attempt to walk
away from a contract and from responsibility for any attendant damages.
     Letter repeatedly invoked an interpretation of the Supreme
Court ruling in Powen vs. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security
Entrapment, 477 U.S. 441, a 1986 case suggesting that the government has a
right to break a contract.
     At one point Judge S. Jay Plager cut in, telling him, I
want you to remember something from first year [law school] contracts
class.
     I had a terrible first year contracts professor, Letter
said. I learned almost nothing.
     Plager instructed Letter that nobody disputes that the
government can break a contract. But when a contract is broken damages must
be paid. Plager then said that thrifts never would have taken on millions
of dollars in liability by taking over insolvent institutions without
goodwill accounting promises from the government. Nor would regulators have
tried to resolve one failing thrift by dragging down another, said Plager,
referring to the knock-out impact of broken goodwill promises.
     I have arguments for all of that, Letter said.
     Obviously something you learned in contracts, Plager said.
     Or in my opinions, joked Chief Judge Helen Nies, who wrote
the majority opinion in the earlier pro-government decision.
     Minutes later, Letter tried to flatter Plager by saying, I
wish I had had you as my first year contracts professor.
     Me too, we wouldnt be here, the judge retorted.
     In the course of his argument, Nies pressed Stouck to show
her where in Glendales agreement did the government specifically agree to a
40-year goodwill amortization period and promise that there would be no
change in policy, the so-called double promise.
     Stouck said these details were spelled out in a letter to
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board by Glendales accountant in a letter he
said was integrated into the contract.

INTERSTATE BRANCHING BILL: IT HAS LEGS

With interstate branching legislation appearing to have its
best shot in almost a decade in passing Congress this year, industry
lawyers and lobbyists are scrambling to reshape a measure cynics had given
little chance of winning congressional approval this yearif ever.
     It has legs, one legislative lobbyist for a bank trade
group in Washington said. I never thought I would ever see it passed in my
lifetime, nevertheless my career, he said with  little sarcasm.
     The linchpin of the political viability of the legislation
is language that bars branching across state lines without acquisitiona big
carrot to community banks  because it offers  a potential windfall if they
want to sell out.
     An amendment to the legislation offering incentives to
institutions seeking to branch interstate to do so by acquiring troubled or
marginally capitalized institutions is among options being proposed by some
members of Congress, industry officials and regulators. No such requirement
is contained in the initial legislation that passed the financial
institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee Feb. 3 by a 29-0
vote. Ironically, the bill was passed before it was officially introduced.
But markup by the full banking committee could come before the end of
February.
     Another potential change would be to allow states to opt
out of Douglas amendment repeal, an amendment that will be sought by the
Independent Bankers Association of America. That group believes that the
legislation passed Feb. 3 gives the back of its hand to 14 states that have
not chosen to allow holding companies outside regional compacts to acquire
banks in their state.
     The bill passed by the House panel permits full nationwide
interstate bank holding company acquisitions one year after enactment and
national bank interstate branching by acquisition three years after
enactment. The bill allows states to opt out entirely from interstate
branching within three years after enactment of branching legislation. The
bill also allows bank holding companies operating in more than one state to
consolidate those subsidiaries into one bank 18 months after enactment.
     But  securities analysts and industry lobbyists believe
that the IBAAs concerns about allowing states to opt out of repeal of the
Douglas amendment is a mere face-saving move aimed at disguising the fact
the IBAA was caught off guard by Sen. Christopher J. Dodds, D-Conn.,
announcement and the new-found momentum behind the bill that Dodds decision
created.
     These officials also said that the only bank of note to
benefit from a state opting out of repeal of the Douglas amendment would be
Barnett Bank of Jacksonville,  a $38 billion-asset institution that
dominates the Florida market but is weak outside the state. One analyst in
New York speculated that two potential acquirers Barnett would like to hold
off are BankAmerica in California and Chemical Bank of New York.
     Steve Verdier, senior legislative counsel for the IBAA,
confirmed that the IBAA was surprised at Dodds announcement and the new-
found potential for the bill to pass. I think you could write that about
anyone in Washington connected with banking legislation, he said. No one
outside of Mark Leggett, the Washington lobbyist for NationsBank, gave
interstate branching more than an outside chance of passage this year.
     No small part of its new-found momentum is the statement
Feb. 3 by  Dodd announcing that he would not seek to bog the legislation
down by adding an amendment that hamstrings the ability of banks of all
sizes to grow their insurance sales business.

MULDOON DOES $1 BILLION IN CONVERSIONS IN 1993

Insiders arent the only ones benefiting from sweet mutual
conversion deals. Muldoon, Murphy & Faucette of Washington did the legal
billing on 15 mutual to stock flips in 1993 worth a total of $1.03 billion.
     While Silver, Freedman & Taff handled six more flip deals
than Muldoon, its rival handled bigger flips that issued far more stock.
Offerings associated with Muldoon averaged $68.5 million per flip. Silver
flips averaged $42.2 million.
     We came out on top because we have a lot of very
experienced people who work in securities and almost everybody has
government experience, said Joseph A. Muldoon Jr. He said the firm thrives
because it takes good care of its clients.
     The top underwriting, legal and appraisal firms dominated
the biggest of the 109 thrifts that converted from mutual to stock form
last year, raising $2.1 billion in gross proceeds, according to the data of
SNL Securities.
     The king of the conversion hill is Adams Cohen Securities,
the underwriting firm on Long Island. It had a piece of flip deals worth
$1.1 billion, or more than half of the total 1993 gross. The dozen flip
deals associated with Adams Cohen  averaged $94.4 million in gross
proceeds.
     Kaplan Associates of Washington led the appraiser group;
deals associated with this firm came to $1.05 billion, almost twice as much
as its next closest competitor, RP Financial Inc. Kaplan flips also had the
biggest gross per appraiser, averaging $75.3 million.
     The lead firms in these groups handled the doozy deals of
1993. When the Coral Gables Federal Savings & Loan Association flipped
early last year, it was the largest  since a few big flips in the mid-
1980s, according to Robert Adams, managing director of Adams Cohen. The
Coral Gables deal was eclipsed at the end of the year by Astoria Federal
Savings Bank in Lake Success, N.Y., only to be eclipsed earlier this year
by the mother of all flips, Green Point Savings Bank with about $6 billion
in assets.
     Muldoon and Adams did both the Astoria and Green Point
deals. Appraising for Astoria was done by Kaplan; RP Financial of
Arlington, Va., the second largest flip appraiser, handled Green Point.
     Close scrutiny of mutual to stock flips by regulators and
members of Congress concerned about excessive insider benefits has these
firms uncertain about what 1994 will hold.
     As to 1994, I would say were very cautious, Adams said. We
dont know where the congressional hearings and legislation [on mutual
flips] will go. He said the firm is keeping an eye to the windward and
diversifying. Were substantially expanding our sales trading activity and
other research work, he said.
     Muldoon predicted a clampdown on merger-conversions, but he
was cautiously optimistic that conversions will continue.

CREDIT UNIONS ARE HEDGING THEIR BETS

The National Credit Union Administration has the authority
to allow AT&T Family Credit Union in North Carolina to serve additional
employee groups, the credit union and Credit Union National Association
claim in a motion made in federal district court in Washington. However,
given the possibility that banks could win the case, the two defendants
also say that even if the banks win, relief should only be prospective.
     AT&T Family and CUNAs brief, filed as a motion for summary
judgment in First National Bank and Trust Co., et al vs. NCUA, No. 90-2948,
is a crucial component of a lawsuit that could have broad legal, political
and competitive implications for both the credit union and banking
industries.
     The American Bankers Association filed the suit on behalf
of First National Bank and Trust, arguing that the Federal Credit Union Act
common bond criteria bars credit unions from expanding their field of
membership beyond their primary service group, that is employees of AT&T in
North Carolina.
     In summing up the banking industrys case, AT&T Family
Credit Union and CUNA put it best:
     The relief sought in plaintiffs complaint includes a
declaration that all amendments to Family Federals charter that were
requested after Nov. 14, 1989 are null and void. Such a declaration would
divest Family Federal of approximately 95 employee groups. These groups
have 34,000 members30.3% of the total membership of the credit union. This
would have a catastrophic effect on Family Federal and its members.
     Besides its argument that NCUAs action was proper and
Family Federals charter is lawful and valid, the Family Federal-CUNA brief
hedges its bets by saying that even if the banks are right, giving banks
what they want would impose harm on the credit union of great magnitude,
while the competitive harm to the plaintiffs that would result from
prospective relief only is negligible.
     The brief added, This requires the court either to rule
that the banks are not entitled to retroactive relief or, at the very
least, to hold an evidentiary hearing to evaluate the relative harms and
other equitable factors such as waiver and estoppel.
     Banks are seeking divestiture because they believe that
credit unions have become unfair competitors because they are not taxed and
yet can offer the same services.

D&OS FACE EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

Giving another kick to one of its favorite political
footballs, Congress has moved to extend the statute of limitations for
civil actions against insiders at failed thrifts.
     Sen. Alfonse M. DAmato, R-N.Y., pushed for the extension as
part of his efforts to keep pressure on the Clinton administration in
regard to White-watergate, the controversy surrounding the role of the
president and his wife in an Arkansas real estate project that was funded
by a savings and loan that later collapsed.
     DAmato offered an amendment Feb. 9 to a supplemental
appropriations bill that allows the Resolution Trust Corp. to bring civil
suits for fraud and gross negligence until Dec. 31, 1995. The Senate
approved the amendment the same day by a vote of 95-0, and on Feb. 11 the
House of Representatives voted 390-1 to instruct their conferees to retain
the amendment.
     This means that those who are potentially liable to the
taxpayers cant hide behind the calendar or a legal technicality, the
ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee said. Congress will not
tolerate gross fraud or negligence at the taxpayers expenseno matter who
the culprits are.
     DAmato was joined in offering the amendment by Sens. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
     DAmato said he pushed for the extension for fear that the
statute of limitations would run out by the end of February for cases
involving the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the institution connected
to the Whitewater resort development in Arkansas.
     He cited the administrations repeated failure to provide
any specific information regarding the expiration of the civil statute of
limitations in the Madison/Whitewater controversy.
     Under current law, the statue of limitations for fraud and
gross negligence is five years. DAmatos amendment, certain to pass because
it was attached to a supplemental appropriations bill, extends the statute
of limitations in cases involving failed S&Ls to the same date that the RTC
goes out of business.
     Now that the RTC will have additional time, we must be
concerned that it will use it to conduct a thorough investigation and then
recover some of the billions of dollars taxpayers have poured into the
savings and loan bailout.

DAVID PAUL GUILTY ON SECURITIES CHARGES

Andrew Wheat
In a surprise move David L. Paulwho became a symbol of the
S&L era as the defunct head of the former CenTrust Bankpleaded guilty Feb.
10 to remaining charges in a 100-count indictment.
     Miami-based CenTrust failed in early 1990 at an estimated
taxpayer cost of $1.5 billion. The indictment came two years later and a
jury was selected last October for the first batch of counts that charged
that Paul had diverted bank funds to pay for the work on his mansion and
had obstructed justice. The jury found Paul guilty of many of those
charges.
     The second batch of charges to which Paul just plead guilty
cover racketeering allegations that Paul and his associates misled
regulators and purchasers of CenTrust subordinated debentures about the
underwriting of CenTrust junk bond investments.
     A 1991 FDIC suit against junk bond king Michael Milken
argued that directors of several thrifts, such as Paul, Charles Keating and
Thomas Spiegel, allowed Milken to draw on their funds to support prices and
prevent defaults in his multibillion house of cards. Each of these persons
intended to share in the plunder of their respective institutions and to
obtain other benefits the Milken Group provided to those who purchased
large quantities of Drexel-underwritten junk bonds, the suit said.
     An additional charge in the second batch of Paul charges
was that CenTrust parked a piece of the offering with Bank of Credit and
Commerce International parties to make it appear that it was more heavily
subscribed than it was. Further charges allege that CenTrust transactions
with Charles Keatings Lincoln Savings and Loan contained material
information that was not disclosed to auditors.
     Sentencing is scheduled for April 1, April Fools Day.
There will also be Rico forfeiture proceeding March 21.
     I have a hard timeeven for internal purposesestimating what
kind of sentence he might be faced with, said Allan Sullivan, the assistant
U.S. attorney handling the case. It all is governed by sentencing
guidelines. Its all calculated based on fraud losses, and aggravating or
mitigating factors.
     This marks the conclusion of a successful prosecution
against Paul resulting in his prosecution on Rico charges, Sullivan said.
     In an interview with The Thrift Regulator in October (Oct.
4, page 3) Pauls attorney, Stephen Neal of the Chicago office of Kirkland &
Ellis, said there was no question the bank had paid for work on Pauls
house. But he dismissed the second set of chargesto which his client has
now pleaded guiltyas nonsense put into the indictment solely to soil Pauls
name through guilt by association with Keating and BCCI.
     Neal could not be reached for an updated comment.

PROMPT ACTION ON SUPERFUND LAW SOUGHT

It is doubtful that the banking industry will be successful
in trying to use a negative court decision on the ability of a government
agency to exempt lenders from hazardous waste cleanup suits brought by
private parties as a lever to force Congress to act quickly on a law which
provides that protection. That will mean that for the time being,
persuading judges to read the lender liability exemption in the current
Superfund law broadly is the best way for lenders to reduce their potential
liability for cleanup of hazardous waste.
     One of the reasons prompt action on the legislation, the
Superfund Reau-thorization Law, H.R. 3800 and S. 1834, is unlikely is that
Congress, even under the most optimistic of scenarios, will have little
time to deal with it this year. Second, the misery-loves-company groups
that brought the court suit against the Environmental Protection Agencys
1992 regulation are unlikely to cave in quickly to pressure from the
administration and members of Congress, even though these groups are
acutely aware of the potential economic impact of leaving lenders out to
dry for the damage caused by borrowers to the environment.
     The two groups are state and local governments and the
chemical industry, both with a big stake in having someone with deep
pockets share the blame for cleanup of hazardous waste. The suit is Kelley
vs. EPA. Frank J. Kelley is the attorney general of Michigan. The Chemical
Manufacturers Association was the co-plaintiff in the case.
     The bill does what a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the D.C. Circuit says the EPA doesnt have the authority to do unilaterally,
establish strict limits on when lenders are liable for hazardous waste
cleanup. But in its Feb. 4 decision, the court held that Congress must
grant EPA the authority to limit lender liability. Otherwise, courts will
determine the extent of lender liability based on the current Superfund
law, the court said. The EPA promulgated the rule in response to the Fleet
Factors decision in the 11th U.S. Circuit in 1990, which imposed liability
on lenders based on the theory that the mere capacity to influence a
borrowers decisionmaking was sufficient to make the lender potentially
liable. It in effect called into question the secured lender exemption in
the original Superfund statute.
     Elliott P. Laws, assistant administrator for the Office of
Solid Waste and Emergency Response at the EPA, testified before a House
panel Feb. 10 that the provisions in the reauthori-zation law regarding
lenders and trustees has assumed a greater level of importance.
     Although the government has not yet determined whether to
seek a rehearing by the full court in the case, the administrations
proposal would confirm EPAs authority to administer the statute in a fair
and effective manner, Laws said. An unnecessary imposition of liability on
lenders and trustees ... would have a chilling effect on the provision of
working capital to otherwise credit-worthy borrowers, or to provide funds
for the purchase of environmentally distressed property. Clear liability
standards for lenders and trustees are necessary elements of the
administrations plan to rehabilitate urban brownfields and to bring
distressed property back into the stream of commerce.
     Besides strictly limiting lender liability, the proposed
legislation would overhaul the manner in which shares of responsibility for
cleanup of hazardous waste would be allocated and provide for expedited
settlements. Laws summed it up this way: The administration intends to
increase fairness and reduce transaction costswith the expectation that
most parties will settle their liability to the U.S. and that more money
will be spent on cleanups, rather than lawyers.
     Under the proposed law an early, expeditious and obligatory
allocation process would be created. Each liable partys share of response
costs would be allocated by a neutral, third-party allocator. The proposed
process is intended to reduce, if not virtually eliminate, the expensive
and time-consuming process of litigating these issues in federal district
court, Laws said. The plan offers substantial incentives to parties who
choose to settle their liability, and disincentives to parties who choose
to litigate following the allocation.
     The American Bankers Association acted strongly against the
court decision and called for prompt action on the legislation. The ABA
said it would seek a rehearing before the full court on the rulingit has
been certified as an intervenorbut industry lawyers believe that is a
holding action aimed at persuading Congress to move quickly on the bill.
The only thing that could yield a rehearing is the still-to-be published
dissent of Chief Judge Abner Mikva to the courts ruling.  ABA and the
government could  seek review from the full court if Mikvas dissent is
strong enough, in the eyes of  ABA and the government, to put enough doubt
in the minds of other members as to warrant rehearing.

ILLINOIS GOVERNOR MAY REVIVE PROPOSAL FOR CHICAGO BEARS' INDOOR STADIUM

By Aaron Baar
CHICAGO

     Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar may resurrect a plan to build an
indoor stadium for the Chicago Bears professional football team if a
proposal to renovate the team's current home, Soldier Field, is indeed
dead.
    "We plan to touch base with both the Bears and city hall to determine
the status of the renovation proposal," said Edgar spokesman Eric Robinson.
"If the governor is convinced the proposal is dead, he's prepared to
explore other avenues to keep the Bears in Chicago."
    One avenue favored by the governor is the possibility of building an
indoor, multi-use facility in the Chicago area that has become known as
"McDome," Robinson said.
    In the summer of 1995, state officials hinted that a domed stadium
could be built with bonds issued by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition
Authority. Although the authority has used most of its $937 million of bond
authorization, state officials had said it might be possible to issue
stadium bonds by refinancing existing debt, a plan that still may be
favored by Edgar.
    "The governor believes that a multipurpose facility could be built
without raising taxes," he said. Robinson would not give details about how
that might be done.
    In October, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley unveiled a $156 million plan
to renovate Soldier Field, the Bears' current home. The proposal calls for
the Chicago Park District to issue $100 million of taxable revenue bonds,
backed by annual club seat fees, revenues from permanent seat licenses,
concession fees, and a contribution from the team. The park district would
also issue the remaining $56 million of bonds payable with property tax or
other district revenues.
    Team officials have deemed the Soldier Field proposal unacceptable and
have reportedly declared negotiations with the city dead. However, Edgar
wanted to be assured of that demise before reviving the McDome possibility,
Robinson said.
    "In the environment we work in, things are never dead until they're
dead," he said. "We want to verify that from both sides (before moving
forward)."
    Meanwhile, a group of Indiana business leaders are continuing their
push to build a new, $312 million stadium for the Bears in Gary, Ind., to
be financed with taxable bonds issued by the group. About 60% of the bonds
would be repaid with various stadium-related private sources. The remaining
40% would be repaid from revenues from a proposed 0.5% economic development
income tax to be levied in the county.

BOND VOLUME CAP, IN TROUBLE AGAIN, NEEDS REPAIR

By Joan Pryde
WASHINGTON

  - Every once in a while, something happens that puts the
private-activity bond volume cap - and its problems - in the spotlight, and
gives municipal bond proponents a chance to remind Congress the cap needs
fixing.
    The current problem stems from the federal government's partial
shutdown, which includes the Census Bureau, the agency responsible for
publishing the figures states use each year to compute the amounts they are
allowed to allocate to bond issuers.
    Under normal circumstances, Census would have released that report last
week, so that officials could begin this year knowing exactly how much they
have to work with. But because Census workers are on furlough, states will
have to wait awhile before they know what their 1996 cap amounts are going
to be.
    But the problem is even worse than that: If past experience is a guide,
states may not be able to use those population numbers when they eventually
come out.
    Back in 1990 Census issued the wrong figures during the last week of
December, and corrected itself with a new report in January. The Treasury
Department ruled that neither report conformed to the letter of the law,
and told states they had to go back and use their 1990 volume cap amounts
for 1991.
    If history repeats itself, states in 1996 will be stuck with year-old
volume caps again, and the largest states, which have growing populations
and huge demand for private-activity bond authority, will be hurt the most.
    One improvement over last time is that issuers probably will not have
to wait six months before the issue is resolved. When the 1991 snafu
occurred, the Treasury did not issue a ruling until July, leaving states in
the dark for the first half of the year - the period in which they
typically allocate most of their volume cap authority.
    The Treasury apparently learned its lesson from that debacle and has
been routinely issuing a revenue procedure a few weeks after the beginning
of each year, confirming that the numbers in the previous December's Census
report are the correct ones to use. Last week Treasury officials declined
comment on this latest mess, and it will be interesting to see how they
resolve the problem and whether they do so quickly.
    But the difficulties caused by the delayed Census report illustrate an
even deeper problem facing those who must live under the confines of the
cap: its inequity.
    Under the volume cap law, states are permitted each year to allocate
the greater of $50 per capita or $150 million in private-activity bond
authority. In 1995 that left 21 states at the $150 million level, and many
of those with more bond authority than they knew what to do with.
    But most of the larger states, which are stuck with $50 per capita, are
chafing under the cap's restrictions. They, of course, are the ones who
stand to be hurt if states are forced to revert to their 1995 allotments -
thus, not accounting for any growth in population - in 1996.
    There are other problems with the volume cap that affect all states.
Chief among them is the fact that the cap is not indexed for inflation, so
while in dollar terms the cap has remained constant, in reality it has
dropped over the last several years.
    In 1993 the Public Securities Association reported that inflation had
eroded the cap to the point where it was really $41.25 per capita, not $50,
and $120.8 million, not $150 million.
    Despite the problems that persist, legislation to ease the volume cap
has never caught fire in Congress. Rep. Bill Coyne, D-Pa., in 1993
introduced a broad bill to ease bond curbs, which included a provision that
would have indexed the cap for inflation. But Congress never acted on that
bill.
    Former Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, offered a proposal in 1993 designed to
help alleviate the cap's inequities. Grandy's proposal would have allowed
states with an overabundance of cap authority to shift the authority to
states that had used up their cap in a given year. But Congress took no
action on his measure, either.
    And so problems with the volume cap continue. If the population-report
mess creates enough difficulties for the states, 1996 may finally be the
year that Congress is forced to take a hard look at the volume cap law and
what can be done to improve it.

TRENDS IN THE REGION: LEASE REVENUES BUOY SACRAMENTO'S SKYLINE

By Joe Bel Bruno

    In sharp contrast to California's stagnant construction industry,
building projects rising in Sacramento have created a mini-boom in the
capital city.
    The skyline in downtown Sacramento has been reshaped to include more
high-rise buildings, many of them used by federal, local, and state
government. Money used to reinvent the city's downtown isn't coming from
private dollars, but instead from lease revenue bonds and other forms of
public finance.
    There are currently two large buildings being constructed and financed
through lease revenue bonds: the massive new federal office and court
building, and a new addition to the Sacramento Convention Center complex,
operated by the city. And what will be Sacramento's sixth major state-owned
building to go up in less than three years - an 850,000-square-foot office
building that will house the California Environmental Protection Agency -
is already in the planning stages.
    Critics complain that the state relies too heavily on expensive
financing in order to avoid getting voter approval for general obligation
bonds, which can be sold at a lower interest rate. Financing construction
projects with lease revenue bonds can cost the issuer up to twice as much
in interest as other forms of financing.
    "Using lease revenue bonds for construction is a fairly standard
practice," said Jerry Beavers of the California Legislative Analysts
Office. "We're putting out so much in interest that in the end, after the
bonds have been paid off, it costs almost double what it actually cost to
put up the building."
    Lease revenue bonds are paid off - typically over 20 years - from funds
formerly used to pay for leased buildings. Supporting the use of lease
revenue bonds is Gov. Pete Wilson, who contends that they are a good use of
taxpayers' money.
    However, some officials note that as the current upswing in
construction shows, the state is nibbling away at escaping its lease
obligations. Currently the state leases 7.2 million square feet of office
space around Sacramento, while it owns 5.1 million.
    "We've used lease revenue bonds for a long time to help finance
construction costs both (in Sacramento) and elsewhere," said Craig
Reynolds, chief of staff for state Sen. Lucy Killea, I-San Diego. "However,
there has been some talk in committee with the proposal of new construction
projects to take a closer look at the financing. This will likely happen."
    In general, state government is a major employer in Sacramento, hiring
62,600 at the seasonal peak, excluding college and university employees.
California employs 195,700 people statewide.
    Construction projects awaiting legislative approval include two massive
low-rise buildings in the city's suburbs and a cluster of new high-rise
buildings on state-owned property south and east of the capitol.
    One of the state buildings considered to be among the most extravagant
is owned by the California Public Employees' Retirement System. It is
designed with six terraced levels that are enclosed by outside walls and
concealed behind jasmine shrubbery that extends around the building for two
blocks. Offices open out to the man-made garden setting.
    However, because of its private funding, the building has received
little criticism. The $78 million cost was paid by using seven days' worth
of the investment returns on the organization's $94 billion portfolio.
Unlike other state agencies, CalPERS receives no tax-generated money.
    "I think the public would rather have the state build some of these
buildings using other, more cheaper ways ... or no public money at all,"
Beavers said. "There has been so much growth in the past few years, that
now we are realizing it is time to put a plan together that will manage it
better."
    Legislators are expected to soon devise a plan to organize and manage
the buildings, as well as develop a plan to regulate growth around
Sacramento.

MONEY MARKET FUNDS: YEAR-END UPSURGE IN TAX-FREE FUND YIELDS IS
TYPICAL, PLAYERS SAY

By Elizabeth Roy

    Tax-free money market fund yields shot up last week - but market
participants said the surge was typical year-end behavior.
    Meanwhile, the Dec. 22 downgrades by Standard & Poor's Corp. of four
Japanese banks that provide letters of credit for money market fund
securities has not affected trading, the participants said.
    They said the market had already priced in the downgrades.
    Standard & Poor's downgraded Mitsubishi Bank to A-plus from AA-minus,
Sanwa Bank to A from AA-minus, and the Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank to A from A-plus.
    On Thursday the rating agency also downgraded Fuji Bank, to A-minus
from A-plus. All five banks were placed on CreditWatch in August.
    Money market yields rise at year-end for two main reasons.
    First, demand wanes as retail investors withdraw funds either to cover
holiday or other expenses, or to avoid paying intangibles taxes in states
such as Florida and North Carolina. Those states tax investors based on
their holdings on the last day of the year.
    Institutional investors also retreat from money market funds in the
final weeks of the year, players said, either to make tax payments on Dec.
15, or to trim the number of investments they have to print on their year-
end balance sheets.
    At the same time, remarketing agents also want to enter the new year
with clean balance sheets. As a result, they offer money market funds high
yields on daily and weekly floaters in an effort to clear them from their
books.
    "We're obviously seeing a year-end spike, due to a lot of money that's
been leaving the arena," said Bradford Owensby, municipal securities
analyst for the $1.3 billion Nations Tax-Exempt Fund and the $110 million
Nations Municipal Reserve Fund.
    The investment adviser for the funds, a wholly owned subsidiary of
NationsBank of North Carolina, as of yesterday became known as TradeStreet
Investment Associates Inc.
    Referring to the high yields being offered on money market instruments,
Owensby said: "Dealers don't want inventory, so they've been jacking up
their rates."
    The high yields are aimed at corporate "crossover" buyers in particular
- those that can invest in either taxable or tax-free products, he added.
    Andrea White, assistant vice president in municipal trading at Harris
Trust and Savings Bank, agreed.
    "Yields have been going up fairly substantially," said White, whose
firm runs a $400 million tax-free money market fund and a $250 million
common trust fund.
    In the week leading up to last Wednesday, yields on weekly floaters
rose 45 basis points, and those on daily floaters were up 100 basis points,
she said.
    Also on Wednesday, White said, weekly floaters were yielding in the
4.95% to 5.10% range, compared to returns of 3.70% on tax-free commercial
paper maturing in February.
    After Jan. 1, however, short-term yields should drop down to about 2%
and stay there for at least a couple of weeks as cash flows back into money
market funds, she added.
    Only on July 1 do investors receive as much money in the form of coupon
payments and bonds maturing as they do on Jan. 1, White noted.
    The Harris money market funds have lost $15 million to $20 million in
recent weeks, but the managers expect to have to cope with $50 million of
inflows starting today, White said.
    Jim Hannan, vice president at First National Bank of Maryland and
manager of the $88 million ARK Funds Tax-Free Money Market Portfolio, said
some weekly floaters have been resetting at yields as high as 5.25% - a
taxable-equivalent yield of 8%.
    "The first week in January, that'll come down to 3.5%," he said.
    In the meantime, Hannan said, a money market fund yielding 4.25%, as
his was on Wednesday, offers a taxable-equivalent yield of 6.55% - 95 basis
points over the 5.60% that the typical taxable fund is offering crossover
buyers.
    Even so, Hannan's fund saw the assets of its institutional class drop
to $71 million from $80 million at the beginning of December, he said,
adding that he expects the money to return this month.

BROKER PROFILE: MUNI INVESTORS SHOULD AVOID FUNDS, BROKER SAYS

By Jon Birger

    Mutual funds offer far more advantages for equity investors than for
municipal bond investors, according to Bill Glassner, an independent broker
in Cedar Knolls, N.J., affiliated with Royal Alliance Associates Inc.
    With an equity fund, "a manager really adds value" compared to what a
broker can do, said Glassner, who has about 400 clients with accounts
totaling $150 million. "I don't have the time to research individual
companies on my own and give them the diversification they need."
    Municipal bond funds also offer diversification and expert research.
However, in Glassner's opinion, municipal funds' inherent interest rate
risk outweighs their advantages.
    For fixed-income investors, Glassner recommends only products with "a
finite life," principally bonds but also unit investment trusts, he said.
    When Glassner has clients who come to him with existing holdings in
bond funds, "I tell them, 'If you didn't like the fluctuations of 1994 -
not knowing where you stood with a fund - here's another approach: you can
buy the individual bond and no matter what happens with the ups and downs
of the market, you're going to get your money back.'
    "The individual client understands that even if everything goes wrong
like it did in 1994, they have a guaranteed value on a certain date," he
said. With a fund, there is no specific date when investors are guaranteed
full return of principal.
    While a patient fund investor should eventually recoup his full
investment - either through higher yields or appreciating shares -  "it's
harder for the unsophisticated client to visualize that," Glassner said.
    One of the few scenarios in which Glassner does recommend bond funds is
for investors interested in the high-yield sector of the municipal market.
    "I only use funds for things that I can't efficiently buy on my own,"
he said. "On the (high-yield) muni side, I use a fund that has the
resources and the people to research the small deals - the unrated deals -
and to diversify in a portfolio in order to make it safer."
    Glassner's favorite high-yield fund is the Van Kampen Merritt Tax Free
High Income Fund.
    About 40% of Glassner's accounts is invested in municipals - the
remainder divided about equally between equities and taxable mortgage-
backed securities.
    A self-described bargain hunter in the equity market, Glassner takes
few such risks when buying individual municipal bonds.
    Municipal bond investors "are basically looking for safety," he said.
"I go out of my way to be real safe."
    While Glassner said he understands why many yield-hungry institutional
portfolio managers prefer A or triple-B rated bonds, he does not recommend
this strategy for retail buyers.
    Individual investors who buy municipals want peace of mind, he said.
    "And especially with these low yields (and narrow credit quality
spreads), you're picking up so little extra by taking the uninsured bond,"
he said.
    About 70% of Glassner's clients are New Jersey residents. He generally
advises these investors to buy Garden State bonds in order to take
advantage of the in-state tax advantage.
    Interest earned on New Jersey bonds is exempt from the state income
tax, which is 6.58% for individuals in the top tax bracket.
    "I'm not too concerned about the New Jersey economy," Glassner said of
his clients' high exposure in the state. "But I will buy a state like Texas
if I see enough yield to cover the New Jersey tax."
    Some of Glassner's best-selling New Jersey issuers include the state of
New Jersey itself, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, and the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
    He and his clients also like northern New Jersey municipalities such as
Essex County, Parsippany, and West Orange Township Board of Education.
    "Investors are generally a little more comfortable if they know the
town," he said.
    Glassner is a big fan of zero-coupon bonds, particularly for investors
with a specific time horizon.
    "I use the zeros a lot," he said. "I have a lot of people who just
don't care about the income and they love buying a bond at 25 cents on the
dollar or 50 cents if it's shorter.
    "And I also find higher yields there because the marketplace doesn't
really like (zero-coupon bonds). In general they want the bonds with the
cash flow."
    Zero-coupon bonds issued by Camden County Municipal Utility District
have been among his top sellers, according to Glassner.
    Because Camden is one of New Jersey's most economically depressed
areas, these bonds "don't trade real well, so we end up with a good yield,"
he said. "They're insured, and we're going to hold them" to maturity.
    For sophisticated investors willing to take on a little risk, Glassner
recommends housing bonds.
    "Some people view the fact that there can be an unpredictable,
extraordinary redemption as a negative," he said. "I view that as a
positive."
    Investors are compensated for the call risk with above-market yields,
he explained.
    "You can sometimes get a real high coupon at a very small premium with
a housing bond," Glassner said. "I usually view a three- or six-month
break-even period as fair, but I've got to find a client who knows there's
a little risk of losing the premium a day after he buys it."
    Glassner's clients generally buy bonds in the four- to 12-year maturity
range - "though I do have some clients who will go out 30 years as part of
a laddered portfolio.
    "In general, people are looking for 5%" yield, he continued. "Five
percent seems to be the psychological barrier right now."
    Investors seem to have adjusted to long-term yields in the 5% to 5.5%
range, according to Glassner.
    "The area where I get the most resistance is in the shorter end, where
they're taking 4% or 4.25% for a maturity that they don't think is that
short - four to eight years," he said. "A lot of clients would rather leave
the money in cash."
    As for the flat tax, Glassner said neither he nor his clients are
particularly concerned.
    "Nobody's really talking about it - it hasn't come up at all (in
conversations with clients) during the second half of the year," he said.
    Glassner does not believe a flat tax will pass. And even if it did -
thereby reducing municipals' resale value - investors who hold their bonds
to maturity would not be affected, he said.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER PROFILE: CONSERVATIVE MANAGING CAN REAP REWARDS

By Sarah Stirland

     A top performance can be achieved even with a conservative strategy,
according to Ronald H. Schwartz, portfolio manager of STI Capital
Management's $150 million STI Classic Investment Grade Tax-Exempt Bond
Fund.
    Schwartz's portfolio has consistently landed among the top five
performing intermediate funds over last three years.
    But he said he achieves his results incrementally. "Our philosophy is
that we don't try to hit a home run," he said.
    "We don't feel like we can forecast interest rates far out into the
future accurately for a long time period, so we will have our short-term
bias based on our fundamental and technical analysis - we're not going to
make major bets by any means," he said.
    In addition to managing the intermediate bond fund, Schwartz oversees a
total of $1.4 billion in municipals in a Florida fund and two common trust
funds.
    But it is the intermediate bond fund that has regularly appeared in the
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. top-five performer rankings this year.
    Schwartz's fund recorded a one-year total return to the end of the
third quarter of 11.31%, ranking first out of 111 intermediate funds.
    In 1994, Lipper named the portfolio top performer in its class.
    Nothing Out of the Ordinary
    Despite this achievement, Schwartz describes his investment strategy as
doing nothing particularly out of the ordinary.
    Schwartz has kept the average maturity of the fund relatively short,
currently at seven and a half years, with an average duration of five
years.
    That positioning is in keeping with his philosophy of not making big
interest rate bets, he said.
    "If we're bullish on the market we'll extend the average maturity to
eight years, but we're not going to say: 'We know interest rates are going
to go lower, let's change this average maturity from seven and a half years
to 15 years,' " he said.
    Instead, Schwartz said that he will extend or contract his maturities
slightly from his neutral level of seven and a half years, according to his
rate forecast.
    "It's the unknowns that really move this market and you can't predict
those," he added.
    Instead, Schwartz uses yield curve analysis to find value and to
achieve his goal of the highest total return possible.
    "We constantly look at the current yield curve market and look at where
on the yield curve would be best to invest," he said.
    Currently, Schwartz is buying in the intermediate area, where he thinks
the value is.
    In this 15- to 20-year sector, he said, investors can find yields
almost as high as those on 30-year bonds with less risk.
    "When you go out 10 more years to the 30 years, all you pick up is 10
basis points," he said.
    Risk-Reward Ratio
    "We don't feel that risk-reward ratio is to your benefit, so let's take
less risk by going into the 20-year area and all we give up is maybe five
to 10 basis points - that's worthwhile, to us," he explained.
    "You're basically getting 98% of the 30-year bond with the 20-year
bond, so you're taking less risk or volatility while earning 98% of the 30-
year bond," he added.
    In addition to using to using yield curve analysis, he gauges value by
comparing municipals to Treasury securities, he said.
    The intermediate area also currently looks attractive using this
measure, he said.
    At the moment Schwartz is pursuing a barbell strategy.
    In addition to extending his maturity out to about eight years at the
beginning of 1995 when he was optimistic about the market, he has been
buying prerefunded bonds at the short end of the curve.
    "They've been yielding 78% to 80% of Treasuries - that's a very
attractive ratio for the shorter end and for something that is the most
secure bond in the market," he said.
    Schwartz's barbell approach involves buying securities in the one- to
six-year area and in the 15- to 20-year area.
    "We feel like that's the area of the curve that has the best return
potential in this kind of environment," he said.
    Schwartz said that although there is nothing unusual about his
strategy, he manages to find value because the STI fund is a national one
and can also, like many other national portfolios, take advantage of the
supply and demand inequities that crop up in the market at different times
of the year, he said.
    This ability to pick and choose between the different states gives him
an edge over state-specific funds, he said.
    Tracking Prices
    Schwartz said that he also makes the most of market inefficiencies by
keeping records of the price levels at which different bonds trade.
    "We do very extensive historic relationship spreads of how bonds should
trade against each other," he said.
    "For example, how should a general obligation bond trade versus a
revenue bond? How should a specialty-state bond trade versus a non-
specialty-state bond? How should a premium bond trade versus a discount
bond," he said.
    Schwartz buys and trades according to the aberrations he sees in these
historic relationships, he said.
    Currently, he is taking advantage of the oversupply of bonds and then
waiting for the New Year to roll in when a lot of bonds mature, are called
or make their coupon payments.
    He estimates that more than $40 billion of cash will flood the market
in January - bringing demand, which he believes will create a good selling
climate.
    As part of his strategy of managing by making small but progressive
changes to his portfolio, Schwartz will trade bonds even if they only give
him a slight advantage, he said.
    "If Floridas are trading expensive and Washington bonds are trading
cheap, then I will do that trade and earn a quarter and give that return to
investors," he said.
    Feeling Optimistic
    At the moment, Schwartz has extended his portfolio because he has
started to feel optimistic about the market again, after worrying, earlier
this year, that the rally had run its course this year.
    In addition, he has been buying intermediate bonds because they are
looking attractive again at the moment.
    "In the 15-year area, we have seen yields as expensive as 85%, as cheap
as 88.3% and it's currently at 88.2%, so you see it's at one of the
cheapest areas versus Treasuries for the last three months, and over the
past year, it's been as cheap as 89.4%," he said.
    Schwartz said he does not like to take credit risk either.
    "We've seen too many investors reaching for yield and buying credits
that are not adequately compensating them for the risk," he said.
    Areas he avoids are housing bonds and utility bonds, he said.
    Schwartz's avoidance of housing bonds fits with his philosophy that
total return is the best measure of performance rather than income.
    He believes that portfolios that rely on income are not as worthwhile
as funds that rely on total return because total return measures the total
value of the portfolio - not just the income, which could be boosted by
sacrificing capital.
    Housing bonds in particular give investors high coupon payments but
their value often amortizes as the securities age, not to mention they miss
out on the chance to benefit from rising prices.
    "A housing bond is going to give you a lot of income, but in a bull
market, those bonds are not going to appreciate very much at all because
they are going to be called and the investor is not going to see that in
the total return number," he said.
    "In a year like this past year, if you just had housing bonds, you
could never have a 13% return," he added.
    He points to the Securities and Exchange Commission's 1993 ruling that
funds must compare their performance with an index in their prospectuses as
an example of how important achieving a high total return is.
    Schwartz added that he believes total return is the best measure of a
fund's performance despite the fact that it ignores investors' tax brackets
and any capital gains tax liability that may be created.
    Despite his bias toward total return, Schwartz believes that funds that
emphasize current income will still flourish.
    "I think that current income funds are going to be around and will do
well.

SOUTHWEST BOND-WATCH



California
    Six months after former Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. - known as
the state's leading political powerbroker - takes over the San Francisco
mayor's office, a new city charter will make him even more powerful.
    The 90-page charter was approved by voters in the city's November
primary and gives the mayor authority over parts of local government that
were once off limits to politicians.
    The expanded duties include management of all bond-funded and capital
projects, including a $200 million voter-approved renovation of city hall.
That function is now handled by an autonomous chief administrative officer
appointed by the Board of Supervisors.
    Brown will also have the power to play a stronger role in forming San
Francisco's $2.8 billion annual budget.
    "This should eliminate some of the chaos and nonperformance of city
government," Brown said in a press statement. "More things get done if
there is one person you can absolutely rely on."
    Brown was elected mayor Dec. 12 after serving in the Legislature for
more than a quarter century, including 14 years as Assembly speaker.

    Oregon
    In its first major financing as an independent corporation, the Oregon
Health Sciences University late last month announced it will sell $211.8
million of revenue bonds, both to fund a number of projects and to refund
old debt.
    About $110 million of the proceeds are slated to replace patient areas
in Doernbecher Children's Hospital, and expand its adult and pediatric
critical-care facilities.
    Another $20 million will be used to update laboratories and catch up on
deferred maintenance of the teaching hospital's instructional and research
facilities. And $59 million will be used to refund prior issues.

    Wyoming
    The Internal Revenue Service has approved a program that uses state
funds to back general obligation bonds issued by local school districts,
allowing them to borrow with higher credit ratings, according to a
statement released by Cheyenne law firm Rothegerber, Appel, Powers, &
Johnson.
    "This ruling will allow the state to go forward with the School Bond
Guarantee Program for public education in the state," state auditor Dave
Ferrari said in the prepared statement. Ferrari helped draft the 1994
legislation that established the program.
    The ruling - issued in a private letter from the IRS - grants Wyoming
the approval needed to continue the program.
    "The ruling was essential in order for the program to operate as
intended," said Gregory Johnson, an attorney with the firm, which was
counsel to the state in seeking approval.
    Under the program, part of the $800 million Common School Account in
the Permanent Land Fund can be used to guarantee payment of principal and
interest on school-district issued GO bonds.
    IRS approval was sought to ensure the tax exempt status of the state-
backed local school bonds, officials said.

NEW TREASURERS: KENTUCKY'S JOHN HAMILTON STRESSES A HANDS-ON STYLE

By David Kaplan

    Two of John Kennedy Hamilton's foremost goals as he takes the office of
Kentucky treasurer this week are to adopt a more hands-on approach to
managing the state's $2.7 billion short-term cash fund and to develop a
state-run local government investment pool.
    Hamilton describes himself as a conservative businessman but a
Democrat. "With a name like 'John Kennedy,' how could I be anything else?"
he said. He also noted that at 32, he's Kentucky's youngest treasurer this
century.
    Despite the fact that Hamilton completed only one year toward his
bachelor's degree at Lexington Community College, he is credited with
"turning a failing (transportation) business around and increasing gross
revenue by $350,000."
    The company, United Transportation Inc. of Lexington, was where
Hamilton honed his managerial skills as president from 1983 - the year he
left college - to August 1995.
    Hamilton, a political neophyte, plans on exploring the possibility of
expanding the treasurer's investment activities - perhaps by adding
management of an LGIP to the office's responsibilities.
    "We're going to work more closely with Kentucky's finance secretary and
the revenue cabinet compared to the last treasurer," Hamilton said. "Those
two agencies play an essential role in the state's investment programs.
There needs to be an active and independent participant involved."
    When pressed for details, Hamilton said he is interested in expanding
the treasurer's presence in investment policy decisions, but not
necessarily his authority.
    Hamilton succeeds another Democrat, Frances Jones Mills, who served
three separate terms as Kentucky's treasurer, the first beginning in 1976.
    "Ms. Mills often didn't attend the meetings of the State Investment
Commission," he said. "She would often send a surrogate. That will not
happen with me. But as far as any changes in investment policies, I will
have to learn more about the process before proposing anything."
    Under state law, the treasurer serves as vice chairman of the State
Investment Commission, which meets quarterly and essentially acts as an
oversight board.
    The day-to-day operation of the cash fund is conducted by the Office of
Financial Management and Economic Analysis.
    "Historically, the Investment Commission approves policies and
procedures and the staff of my office implements their decisions," said Don
Mullis, executive director of the financial management office.
    There is currently at least one LGIP in the state, but that is operated
by the Kentucky Municipal League and the Kentucky Association of Counties,
Mullis noted.
    Although the state is permitted to establish an investment pool, one
has never been authorized, Mullis said.
    "If such a pool were begun, it would in all likelihood start with the
Investment Commission and be managed and administered by this office,"
Mullis added.
    Kentucky's cash fund is doing fairly well, Hamilton said, pointing to
the revenue surplus of several million dollars. He said he hopes to enhance
the surplus by examining ways to boost returns for the state's cash fund.
    "For me the biggest challenge ahead is restoring the sense of integrity
of this office," Hamilton said. "So maintaining a strong presence on the
Investment Commission will be a good step in that direction."

NONPROFIT IOWA HEALTH SYSTEMS TO MERGE

CHICAGO

    Two not-for-profit health systems in Iowa have signed a
preliminary agreement to merge, leaving unclear the status of $220 million
of outstanding debt.
    Officials of the Iowa Health System last week approved a memorandum of
understanding to merge with St. Luke's Health System. The memorandum is
good until March 1; Scott Eldridge, chief financial officer of St. Luke's,
said he expects the final agreement to be reached late next month.
    St. Luke's now has about $70 million of outstanding tax-exempt debt,
Eldridge said. All of the health system's bonds have been sold with
insurance, and therefore carry a triple-A rating, he added.
    The Iowa Health System has about $150 million of outstanding tax-exempt
revenue debt, according to chief financial officer William Miller. He said
the debt is rated A-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp. and A1 by Moody's
Investors Service.
    "I can't really say what will happen to the debt in the merged
organization because it hasn't been decided yet," said Eldridge.
    "We're sorting out those options now," echoed Miller. "One thing we
know for sure is that there certainly won't be a refinancing."
    Eldridge suggested that the two groups may become jointly obligated for
the combined $220 million of debt now outstanding.
    "It looks like ultimately, we will (both) be fully responsible for all
the debt of the merged organization, instead of carrying individual debt
for each operating unit," he added.
    Eldridge said Sioux City-based St. Luke's decided to merge with Des
Moines-based Iowa Health System primarily to capture a bigger share of
statewide managed-care health contracts.
    "Both systems are strong, and they'll be getting stronger through the
merger," said Eldridge. "We view it as a way to attract more (primary care)
physicians into our systems."

SCHOOLS' NEEDS ARE FERTILE GROUND

By Kieran Beer

    There was a time when immigrant children from all over the world got
their first taste of the American dream at the local public school.
    Public schools constructed in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s were safe,
clean, well-lit places. Some of them were even elegant structures,
expressions of the nation's faith in public education and the opportunity
for personal advancement.
    Times certainly have changed. The structures built decades ago, which
served to school other generations, are in decay, and there seems to be
little public will to restore them or to build new schools.
    That certainly is the conclusion of the page one story that ran in the
New York Times the day after Christmas. The story cited hard numbers from
the Government Accounting Office that $112 billion is needed to renovate
old schools and build new ones. Despite that need, states, municipalities,
and school districts are spending less than ever on schools'
infrastructure.
    The Times account also offered anecdotal evidence of our neglect of
schools that sound like accounts of life in the third world: a collapsed
ceiling in Montgomery County, Ala., that could have injured children; a
leaky roof and condemned gymnasium in a New York City school; and termite
infestation in New Orleans.
    Like any crisis, the state of the infrastructure of America's public
schools has myriad causes. Among these are overcrowding caused by a new
wave of immigrants - particularly in places like Texas, Florida,
California, and New York - and the fact that baby boomers have produced
their own boomlet of school-age children. But no confluence of problems
excuses our society's indifference to children and to the dark future such
indifference will create.
    All of this provides muni bankers with an opportunity to be the good
guys, despite all the heat they have taken during the debate about a flat
tax. A number of flat tax proponents have characterized muni bankers -
referring to them as Wall Street bankers to emphasize their distance from
Main Street - as an ignoble lot who, in league with government bureaucrats,
help fund boondoggles and profit at the expense of the taxpayer. Well,
building and repairing schools is not a boondoggle - it is a noble
endeavor.
    But to be the good guys, the municipal bond community will need to
continue to reinvent itself. Even as a number of more nimble firms are
looking at project finance and other alternative methods of finance, the
municipal bond community should be exploring both traditional and new ways
to build new schools and repair existing ones.
    Alternative methods of finance are necessary given the anti-tax, anti-
spend political climate. Brokering a private-public partnership between the
information technology vendors and the states to upgrade schools is one
place to start.
    Another reason creative methods of finance will be needed for education
infrastructure is that education itself needs to undergo revolutionary
change. Even as we try to figure out ways to give kids good one-on-one
learning experiences with teachers, it is important to apply the revolution
in information technology to education. (Hence, the importance of the
information technology companies.)
    There is no reason that a state's best teachers - or even the country's
- should not be accessible electronically to thousands of children
regardless of the school districts they live in, one member of the
municipal bond community observed. "Schools ought to look more like the
Sony Movie Megaplex than Adlai Stevenson (Intermediate High School)," said
an investment banker.
    There are many obstacles - including the need to work out the tension
between local and regional control of schools. But a vision that returns to
making school structures express our faith in education and the future is
worth fighting for.

NEWS AND TRENDS: SOUTH CAROLINA TREASURY VOLUNTEERS EARN HAPPY RETURNS
OVER HOLIDAYS

By Richard Richtmyer

    While most public employees in South Carolina were doing their last-
minute holiday shopping on Dec. 23, Treasurer Richard A. Eckstrom and
several Treasury staffers were busy with some shopping of their own -
hunting for bargains in the capital markets.
    And on Dec. 26, while the malls were jammed with people waiting in line
to make their holiday shopping returns, the state Treasury was looking for
higher returns on South Carolina's surplus funds.
    Although both days were official state holidays, the treasurer and some
staff members volunteered their time - while investment banks and the
Federal Reserve were open - in an effort to boost the returns on state
funds that otherwise would have remained dormant, according to John
Pownall, deputy treasurer in charge of investments.
    In all, the state Treasury managed to pick up about $11,300 in extra
income on $152 million in idle funds over the holidays, Pownall said. The
total returns were about $93,700, while they would have been about $82,400
had the funds been allowed to remain dormant, earning about 4.8%, he
said.
    The state picked up the extra income by investing in five-day
repurchase agreements with state banks, Pownall said.
    Eckstrom and Pownall, along with Treasury staff members Faye Nealy,
Leanne Register, and Chuck Sanders, participated in the volunteer effort,
which was the second time the group had volunteered on holidays. The first
was on Nov. 24, the Friday after Thanksgiving.
    During that holiday, though, the extra earnings were less - about
$3,000 extra on a total investment of $43 million, Pownall said.
    The idea for the volunteer program came from long-time treasury staffer
Ken Cliatt, Pownall said.
    "As soon as we took office, (Cliatt) sent me an e-mail message telling
me that he had been suggesting this for some time," Pownall said. "He
thought there was some low-hanging fruit here that we could take advantage
of. And we thought that this was just too good an idea to pass up - it's
just common sense, basic investing."
    Although the extra earnings are not earmarked for charities because of
statutory restrictions, the benefits will be passed on to the people of the
state, who can in turn pass them on to the state's needy, Pownall said.
    "(Giving the money to charity) is a great idea, but unfortunately it's
something that the law wouldn't allow us to do," Pownall said.
    "But we think that to the extent that the taxpayers have a little extra
money in their pockets, maybe they can put it to use in charities or other
causes," he continued.
    "It may be a Christmas present to the taxpayers."

WHAT'S SELLING: COLORADO PAPER RATES COMING BACK TO EARTH AFTER BUSY
DECEMBERBY SARAH STIRLAND


    Colorado paper is currently trading at rates that are less
stratospheric than usual, according to Richard O'Connor, a municipal trader
in Kirkpatrick Pettis' Denver office.
    "Sometimes Colorado paper gets levels out for the bid that you can't
believe," he said.
    Last Wednesday, "Colorado paper got a number that you would consider a
strong general-market number. It wasn't trading as though there were no
Colorado paper around."
    O'Connor attributes this change to the lack of market participants at
this time of year and November's flood of issuance in the state.
    Normally, Colorado municipal bonds trade at above-market levels because
Amendment 1 has made in-state paper scarce. The amendment mandates that all
new bond issuance must be voter-approved.
    In early December, retail investors in Colorado were gobbling up
prerefunded bonds with a vengeance.
    "There was a huge appetite for prerefunds - you couldn't find bonds.
There was so much retail appetite because a lot of money came due Dec. 1,"
he said. "You could easily sell a $1 million block of prerefunded bonds."
    Many retail investors, who tend to be older retirees, have a preference
for these types of Treasury-backed securities or for other triple-A rated
names because of previous bad experiences with higher yielding credits,
O'Connor said.
    "When you have your older investors who have been burned in the past on
lesser credits, they don't care what it is so long as it's Moody's
(Investors Service) and (Standard & Poor's Corp.) triple-A," he said.
    To get his hands on prerefunded Colorado bonds, O'Connor contacted
mutual funds that owned the securities and offered them high prices, he
said.
    "You pay them what would appear at the time a fairly stellar number for
bonds - they couldn't necessarily turn you down and you turn around and
flip (the bonds) in a phone call," he said.

CALIFORNIA QUAKE AUTHORITY SLATES BOND SALE

LOS ANGELES

    The newly formed California Earthquake Authority has
slated a syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Co. to underwrite a $1.5 billion
revenue bond sale later this year, part of the $10.5 billion in funds the
new agency needs.
    Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Bear Stearns & Co. are also among the major
firms in the syndicate, according to the announcement from insurance
commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.
    In addition to the bond sale, other funding sources for the authority's
plan to pay homeowner earthquake damage claims includes $1 billion in cash
contributions from insurance companies, and another $3 billion in funds
promised by insurance companies if necessary to pay claims.
    The plan also includes $2 billion from reinsurers, $1 billion assessed
from earthquake insurance policy holders, and $2 billion from additional
assessments on insurers, Quackenbush spokesman Richard Wiebe said.
    Quackenbush, elected in November 1994, returned last month from a two-
week global jaunt aimed at seeking reinsurance for the new authority.
    Gov. Pete Wilson in October signed into a law a bill appropriating
$500,000 to investigate the viability of an earthquake insurance authority
and laying much of the groundwork needed for its start-up.
    Quackenbush and Wilson proposed the authority's creation last summer in
the wake of an exodus of homeowner's insurance carriers after massive
damage claims stemming from the January 1994 Northridge earthquake near Los
Angeles.

PROBE OF EL PASO COUNTY, COLO., FUND BROADENS TO EXAMINE TREASURER

By Darrell Preston
DALLAS

    An investigation into the El Paso County, Colo. pension fund
has widened to include treasurer Sharon Shipley.
    El Paso County district attorney John Suthers' office confirmed last
week that Shipley is now being included in an investigation centering on
former pension fund manager Mike Witty.
    Witty resigned from the pension board in 1994 after the county
discovered there was no bidding process when he was awarded consulting
contracts to oversee the $80 million fund's real estate investments,
according to county officials.
    However, the inclusion of Shipley in the inquiry is not expected to
have any immediate impact on the treasurer's office or county finances or
operations, said Ken Kile, deputy county treasurer.
    "I don't believe it's gotten to the point where it will have much
effect," said Kile.
    Shipley, who is still on the job, did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
    Suthers' investigation began after the county learned of a secret,
unauthorized bank account that Witty allegedly set up in the fund's name in
1993. Since then, two audits have been launched, including one by the
accounting firm Arthur Andersen, which county commissioners approved in
early December.
    But last week Suthers announced that his investigation had grown to
include charges that Shipley and pension fund board member Carl Hatton
borrowed thousands of dollars from Witty while he was awarded consulting
work.
    Hatton resigned from the board after Suthers' announcement Dec. 26, but
Shipley, who served as chairwoman of the pension fund until Dec. 20,
remains on the board. The new chairman is Dan May, a deputy district
attorney who has been on the board since 1994.
    Hatton and Witty could not be reached by press time.
    An audit county commissioners released Dec. 18 found that while Witty
controlled county pension funds, they were invested heavily in real estate.
The report by Aurora, Colo.-based Comiskey & Co. found that the fund's
concentration in real estate increased to 34% from zero between 1992 and
1994.
    An earlier audit in May 1994 noted that besides his $55,000 salary to
manage the fund, Witty earned more than $500,000 in 1993 and 1994 under his
contract with the fund as a private consultant to oversee the fund's real
estate investments.

WHAT TO DO WITH A CALIFORNIA BUDGET SURPLUS

LOS ANGELES

    When California Journal - a Sacramento-based political
monthly magazine - recently asked a number of state budget observers about
a hypothetical surplus of $1 billion, it got responses ranging from doubt
that such a positive number could ever occur to calls for tax cuts.
    Stephen Zimmermann, Western region managing director for Standard &
Poor's Corp. in San Francisco, said in the Journal's January issue that
California's first priority must be to pass a true balanced budget - one
that doesn't require crossover borrowing from one fiscal year to another.
He also suggested a reasonable reserve of at least several percent of the
budget.
    "As for further bonded debt, we'd like to see a real capital needs plan
that prioritizes expenditures funded by bonds," Zimmermann told the state's
leading political journal.
    "California's current debt service is now about 5% of the budget," he
added. "That's considered moderate, so increasing it is not particularly a
problem, as long as the capital expenditures are orderly and planned."
    Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association,
suggested that a surplus ought to retire bond debt to improve the state's
bond ratings.
    The anti-tax activist also told the Journal that some taxes should be
trimmed, and suggested that the state's massive surplus under former Gov.
Ronald Reagan in 1974 led to pressure that brought about tax and bonding
limits under Proposition 13.

MOODY'S SEES NEXT HUD BILL HAVING 'FAR-REACHING' IMPACT ON BONDS

By Joan Pryde
WASHINGTON

    Moody's Investors Service says provisions in the still-
unresolved HUD appropriations bill for fiscal 1996 set the stage for major
changes in bond-related federal housing programs next year when lawmakers
draft legislation reauthorizing those programs.
    "While the housing appropriations bill did not contain substantial
changes to Section 8 or FHA insurance, it would appear to indicate that the
final outcome of the Capitol Hill debate on housing programs may have more
far-reaching implications for bonds backed by such federal housing
assistance, as well as for bondholder security," Moody's said in a recent
report.
    Congress passed the funding bill for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and agencies within HUD such as the Federal Housing
Administration, in late November. President Clinton vetoed the measure on
Dec. 18, because he disagreed with funding levels of other agencies in the
bill not related to HUD. Congress is expected to try to fashion a new bill
more to his liking.
    Among the HUD provisions in the vetoed bill important to the municipal
market, one would have given HUD temporary authority to renew expiring
subsidy contracts under the Section 8 rent subsidy program. The provision
is designed to keep alive revenue streams for bond-financed multifamily
housing projects under the program while Congress in 1996 comes up with a
plan for revamping the Section 8 program.
    Although Moody's said the provision is helpful to keep those projects
going, the bill does not provide for subsidy increases during the next
year, which could cause problems.
    "Extending contracts at current contract rents for one year would keep
subsidy levels constant," the ratings agency said in a report titled
Moody's Monitors Rating Implications of HUD Debate. "To the extent,
however, that expenses increase while subsidy levels remain constant, this
may signal the beginning of new financial stresses for these projects,
subject to the economics of individual projects."
    The Clinton administration and Congress want to overhaul the Section 8
program because the federal government cannot afford to renew the thousands
of subsidy contracts set to expire in the next several years. The
administration has proposed transforming the subsidies - which now are paid
to project owners - into certificates issued directly to tenants.
    For projects also backed by FHA insurance, the administration has
proposed requiring owners to "mark to market" - that is, adjust their
contract rents to market levels and restructure their underlying debt. In
the event that the lower rent could not support a given mortgage, the loan
would go into default, and a claim would be made against the FHA insurance
fund.
    The appropriations bill just vetoed by Clinton included a provision
that would have permitted HUD to begin testing its mark-to-market plan on
15,000 units of multifamily housing out of a total of about 800,000 that
receive Section 8 subsidies.
    Moody's said that trial would be instructive, because the big question
about mark-to-market is whether the FHA can handle a big influx of
insurance claims that is sure to result if the program is fully
implemented.
    "While the ratings on these bonds are based on the FHA insurance, a
question remains as to the ability of FHA to process and pay claims in a
timely fashion," especially if implementation of mark-to-market sharply
increased the number of claims that the housing agency was having to
process, Moody's said.
    If that were to happen, "Moody's view on these bonds could be
affected," the ratings agency said.
    Moody's said it has requested information from state housing finance
agencies regarding their multifamily portfolios "to better gauge the impact
of potential changes to the programs."
    "In the course of our ongoing surveillance efforts, we are maintaining
a dialogue with the agencies regarding the ways in which they are preparing
for potential changes which could affect their Section 8 portfolios,"
Moody's said.

CHANCES DWINDLE FOR REFORM OF THE GLASS-STEAGALL ACT

By Martha M. Canan

    The prospects for overhauling the Glass-Steagall Act have dimmed
considerably since last year because commercial banking and insurance
interests cannot resolve a dispute over bank insurance powers.
    As a result, the issue of whether banks should have authority to
underwrite municipal revenue bonds is being held hostage to the insurance
dispute, which threatens to derail House banking reform legislation this
year, lobbyists say.
    If Congress does not act on Glass-Steagall this year, the Federal
Reserve Board is expected to come under increasing pressure to expand bank
securities powers, including the ability to underwrite revenue bonds,
through regulatory action.
    The effort to reform the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibits
mixing commercial and investment banking, gained momentum last spring when
the House Banking and Commerce committees passed a bill that would allow
banks and securities firms to affiliate through holding companies.
    The legislation would give banks new power to underwrite revenue bonds,
in addition to existing authority to directly underwrite less lucrative
general obligation bonds. However, banks would be required to engage in
such new activity only through separately capitalized holding-company
affiliates. An earlier version of the bill would have allowed banks to
directly underwrite revenue bonds, but the current language omits that
authority.
    The dispute between the commercial banking and insurance industries
involves a provision in a related regulatory relief bill that would halt
for at least five years any regulatory effort by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency to expand bank insurance powers. A related
issue is whether to allow banks under federal law to affiliate with
insurance companies.
    Insurance interests strongly oppose letting commercial banks into their
business, while commercial banking interests view insurance activities as
essential to their ability to compete with other financial services
providers in a technologically advanced global marketplace.
    The insurance dispute has prevented the House leadership from bringing
the Glass-Steagall bill to the floor, because lawmakers do not want to
choose between the two influential industries, which contribute heavily to
political campaigns. House leaders have long planned to combine the Glass-
Steagall and regulatory relief measures into one package for a floor vote.
    Months-long negotiations between banking and insurance industry
representatives and House leaders and staff - including Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., Rules Committee chairman Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and
Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa - have made little progress
towards crafting a compromise.
    In a recent letter to Thomas Labrecque, chairman and chief executive
officer of Chase Manhattan Corp. and member of the Bankers Roundtable,
Leach expressed his frustration with what he views as the intransigence of
banks that oppose any change in the U.S. comptroller's powers on bank
insurance, sources said.
    The letter, which the Banking Committee and the Roundtable refused to
release, prompted speculation that Leach may be ready to suspend or
terminate the talks, although some lobbyists said they could not imagine
Leach pulling the plug after all the effort he has put into passage of the
bill.
    A subsequent press release issued by the American Council of Life
Insurance last Thursday reinforced the pressure Leach appears to be putting
on the banks. The council "noted with regret the failure of negotiations
this year regarding insurance provisions contained in (the reform bill)."
The statement said ACLI officials "expressed frustration with the 'delaying
tactics' employed by banking representatives to reach a workable
compromise."
    The council, which represents 600 insurance companies, charged the
banking interests with being "inflexible," while saying that insurance
companies have made "significant concessions."
    But Alfred Pollard, senior director at the Roundtable, said the
statement reflects "the complexity and difficulty" of the numerous
insurance issues under discussion. "There has been no effort to delay on
our part," he said.
    At this point, "it's ... looking pretty bleak" for passage of a Glass-
Steagall bill in this Congress, said James McLaughlin, director of agency
relations for the American Bankers Association. "Most people ... think it
is already dead, but there is always a slim possibility, at least for the
first few months of the year," that the House will pass a bill in time for
the Senate to act, he said.
    Even if the House passes a bill, any debate in the Senate promises to
be contentious, as would be efforts to reconcile differing House and Senate
versions of the measure, McLaughlin and other lobbyists said.
    Legislation sponsored by Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., would allow affiliations not only between commercial banks
and securities firms, but also insurance companies and industrial
companies. This approach raises major policy issues, such as whether to
allow companies like General Motors into the banking and brokerage
businesses, McLaughlin said.
    D'Amato has said he will not act on his legislation until the House
takes action, a Senate Banking Committee spokesman said.
    D'Amato has made clear he does not want to repeat what occurred during
previous sessions of Congress, when the Senate three times passed a Glass-
Steagall reform bill, only to have it die in the House, lobbyists said.
However, election-year politics mean that Senate action cannot be ruled
out, even if the House fails to act, because senators may want to placate
financial services constituents who want reform, lobbyists said.
    House Banking Committee spokesman Dave Runkel maintained that the House
Glass-Steagall bill "is not dead" and that committee staff, led by Joseph
Seidel, are continuing to broker meetings with banking and insurance
industry representatives to reach a compromise.
    While the main sticking point is over insurance, the rest of the bill
affecting the ability of banks and securities firms to enter each other's
business "is pretty much intact," Runkel said.
    Wall Street and regional securities firms have differing interests and
concerns about letting commercial banks into their business, with regional
firms more opposed to competition from banks. The Securities Industry
Association has said it supports legislation that would put securities
firms on equal footing with banks and not subject the firms to more
burdensome banking regulation.
    The securities association has been supportive of banking interests on
the insurance dispute, because securities firms that want to enter
commercial banking do not want to be forced to divest insurance-related
businesses.
    But the securities group opposes letting banks directly underwrite
revenue bonds and other securities, and the association was a major force
in getting Leach to change the bill to require banks to engage in such
activity through separately capitalized units.
    But the requirement would discourage many of the couple of hundred
banks that now underwrite GO bonds from setting up separate units to sell
revenue bonds because of higher associated costs, McLaughlin said. Among
other things, the banks would have to set up firewalls between the
affiliate and the parent and other units, which would mean separate boards,
separate sales, no joint marketing, and other mechanisms aimed at
protecting federally insured deposits from the risks of investment banking.
    Roughly 30 banks now have affiliates engaged in so-called non-eligible
securities activities, such as revenue bond underwriting, under Section 20
of the Glass-Steagall Act. The Fed allows creation of such affiliates that
meet strict revenue limit, firewall, and other requirements.
    If Congress does not act this year, the Fed is expected to come under
pressure to ease these requirements for Section 20 affiliates, thus paving
the way for expanded bank securities activities. But the Fed probably would
act only in small incremental steps, and many banks still would be
discouraged from setting up Section 20 units because of costs, banking
lobbyists say.
    Fed regulations now limit revenues that can be derived from Section 20
securities activities to 10% of gross revenues. The Fed could "easily"
raise this cap to 25%, "if not higher," said Melanie Fein, a banking
attorney with Arnold & Porter.
    However, Gingrich said in a recent letter to Leach that he has no
intention of contacting the Fed to encourage such action. "I prefer passing
the Glass-Steagall bill in as close a consensus position as possible so
that Congress will ultimately make the policy determinations on these
important issues, and not regulators," he said.
    The Dec. 13 letter came as a follow-up to a meeting earlier in the
month among Gingrich, Leach, congressional staff, and representatives of
J.P. Morgan & Co., Banc One, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, and Bank
of America. Gingrich said the banking representatives appeared to have
misunderstood his answer to a question about Fed activity in this area.
    Meanwhile, a "pivotal event" for banks this year that could change the
whole face of the Glass-Steagall debate promises to be a U.S. Supreme Court
decision, which is expected by the end of June in Barnett Bank v. Tom
Gallagher, Insurance Commissioner, Fein said.
    The case, which is set for oral argument on Jan. 16, asks whether
national banks with branches in towns of less than 5,000 people have the
right to sell insurance in small towns, even if a state law prohibits any
such activity. The National Bank Act prohibits national banks from
underwriting insurance but contains a key exemption allowing such activity
in towns of up to 5,000.
    More than a dozen states have "anti-affiliation" laws like the Florida
law at issue in the case. These laws prohibit commercial banks from
encroaching on the business of insurance agents.
    If the high court rules that state law "trumps federal law in this
area, then banks would not be able to use the town of 5,000 exemption to
sell insurance," Fein said. "That would mean that banks would need to push
harder in Congress to gain legislative authority to sell insurance," she
said.
    If the court rules that the federal law preempts local law, banks would
have even less need than they do now for Glass-Steagall reform legislation,
Fein said. Much will depend on the decision, which could be limited in its
impact depending on how narrow it is, she said.

LOUISIANA GOVERNOR-ELECT: VOTERS NEED A VOICE ON GAMING

By Christopher McEntee
ATLANTA

     Louisiana Governor-elect Mike Foster says voters should
decide whether they want gambling, and plans to call a special session for
mid-March to get lawmakers' support for a referendum.
    A referendum would either uphold or throw out video poker, riverboat
gambling, and the New Orleans land-based casino that the state Legislature
made legal in a 1992 act.
    Foster, who takes office Jan. 8, feels that gambling was "rammed down
the people's throat" without a referendum, said Marsanne Golsby, Foster's
press secretary. Moreover, public opinion has soured on gambling because of
federal probes of several state lawmakers' connections with the gaming
industry and poor revenue growth from gaming.
    Rather than allowing separate votes for each form of gaming, Foster
will request an "all-or-nothing" vote, Golsby said.
    Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, Louisiana will have
gambling for the foreseeable future. The state has existing contracts or
licenses with a number of operators that would not be affected by the vote,
Golsby said. Gambling would have to be phased out as licenses and contracts
expire.
    In the some cases, such as video poker, the state grants a one-year
license annually, so these machines could be shut down almost immediately
if voters reject gaming. But the state's 12 riverboats would stick around
longer because they were given five-year contracts that start to run out in
1998.
    But New Orleans voters could have to wait until Harrah's Jazz Co.'s 30-
year contract runs out before they see a land-based casino leave their
city. That is unless that contract was broken when Harrah's Jazz, the
partnership developing the casino, filed for voluntary bankruptcy
protection on Nov. 22.
    Foster and his aides are working closely with Harrah's Jazz, Golsby
said, to figure out what the company intends to do about its finances and
its plans to build what they claimed would be the world's largest casino.
The partnership has until mid-March to present a reorganization plan in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
    But Golsby said Foster is reluctant to comment about Harrah's plans,
other than saying the state will review its proposals when it comes to
revenue-sharing agreements.
    For its part, Harrah's Jazz says it wants to push ahead with casino
building, yet Louisiana must cut red tape associated with the project and
allow it to reduce capital and fixed costs in its operating contract.
    Harrah's Entertainment vice president Colin V. Reed said last month
three changes must be made to its contract before a casino can be
"successful in a market that has substantially less" demand for gambling
than first imagined.
    First, the casino would scale back the number of slot machines and
games. Secondly, Harrah's Jazz would ask its bondholders to become equity
partners in the operation while it attempts to secure more cash.
    Lastly, Harrah's Jazz said the state must be more "flexible" about
receiving the $100 million minimum annual tax Harrah's Jazz is committed to
paying. The tax is the single largest fixed cost in the project.
    Reed suggested that the state should take $125 million, which has
already been paid, and use that money as an advance on the tax until the
permanent casino is in business. He claimed that the deferral of taxes
would be acceptable under state law because the casino would not be able to
make its minimum payments otherwise.
    Under their plan, the state expected to receive the greater of 18.5% of
gaming revenues or a $100 million flat tax from its sole New Orleans
casino, operated by Harrah's Jazz. To date, the state has received only $13
million from a temporary casino set up in advance of the permanent Harrah's
facility.
    State budget officials estimate that riverboats and video poker will
generate about $375 million in tax revenue throughout Louisiana in fiscal
1996.
    If they intend to repeal gaming laws, state lawmakers must approve a
constitutional amendment by a two-thirds vote and ask that voters take up
the issue. If legislators approve an amendment in mid-March, it could go
before the public 45 days later at the earliest, or be placed on the ballot
in November.

ENDING WITH A BANG, 1995 VOLUME SURPASSES EXPECTATIONS

By Yong Lim

    Suprising market observers, December was the fifth straight month in
which municipal bond issuance beat 1994 levels, according to figures
compiled from Securities Data Co.
    However, 1994 still stays slightly ahead of 1995 for overall long-term
new-issue volume.
    State and local governments sold 818 issues totaling $16.76 billion in
December, up a strong 65% from the $10.16 billion marketed in December
1994. This follows June and November of 1995, with $18.4 billion and $17.99
billion, respectively, as the third biggest month of new-issue volume.
    In 1995, bond sales totaled $156.22 billion, 5% below the $164.5
billion sold in 1994.
    Refunding issues rose a staggering 273% in December, to $3.86 billion
from $1.04 billion in December 1994, while issues that combined new-money
and refunding bonds rose nearly twelve-fold in December, to $1.69 billion
from $131 million.
    New-money issuance ended 1995 at $111.15 billion, 3% below 1994's
figure of $114.31 billion. Refundings for the year were $32.94 billion,
down 15% from $38.91 billion, while combined issues totaled $12.13 billion,
up 8% from $11.28 billion.
    Transportation, education, and housing were the only specific purposes
to show increases in bond sales from 1994. Transportation issues were up a
solid 13% in 1995, to $16.78 billion from $14.82 billion. Education issues
had a small 8% increase to $32.06 billion from $29.6 billion in 1994.
Housing increased a slight 2% to $16.16 billion from $15.86 billion in
1994.
    Public facilities, which covers libraries, stadiums, and fire stations,
suffered the greatest percentage drop from 1994, falling a hefty 32% to
$5.68 billion from $8.37 billion. The largest category, general purpose,
posted a 5% decline in 1995, to $39.37 billion from $41.57 billion.
Declines in other purpose categories ranged from a scant 4% dip for
utilities to a large 28% decline for environmental facilities.
    New issues subject to the alternative minimum tax for individuals
remained slightly above 1994 levels, rising 7%, to $17.95 billion from
$16.86 billion. Taxable municipal bond sales posted a 13% rise, to $9.53
billion from $8.45 billion.
    Bonds sold through negotiation rose a meek 0.3% in 1995, to $112.63

CASH FLOWS BACK INTO MUTUAL FUNDS, BUT NOT EVERYONE GETS A SHARE

By Elizabeth Roy

    Cash flows into both national and single-state mutual funds edged into
positive territory in November, reaching $274.8 million and partly undoing
October's $509.4 million in losses, according to figures from the
Investment Company Institute.
    The gains were modest, however, and several mutual fund companies said
they had not seen their share. They blamed the growing appeal of retirement
investing, the stock market's stellar performance, and the delayed federal
budget for investors' lack of interest.
    According to the ICI, national funds saw inflows of $190.4 million in
November, compared to October's outflows of $284.2 million. With reinvested
dividends the figures were inflows of $528.9 million and $55.6 million,
respectively.
    State funds gained $84.4 million in November, compared to losses of
$225.5 million the previous month. With reinvested dividends, there were
inflows of $349.2 million and $40.3 million, respectively.
    Municipal money market funds also posted inflows in November, as in
October. Excluding reinvested dividends, the funds added $12.5 billion in
November, compared to $13.1 billion the previous month. Including
dividends, both months recorded $15.3 billion inflows.
    In its monthly report, Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. said
it sold just $300,000 net of all firms' tax-advantaged bond funds in
November, down from $35.6 million in October, with reinvested dividends
included.
    A drop in sales from $136.8 million in October to $104.5 million in
November accounted for the bulk of the shift, according to Schwab spokesman
Tom Taggart.
    At least part of the drop is seasonal, Taggart said.
    "Toward the end of the year, a lot of people tend to reshuffle their
portfolios," he said.
    In addition, Taggart said, the stock market's excellent performance has
led many investors to shift cash from bonds to equities in anticipation of
another great year for stocks.
    The growth of retirement investing has further sidelined municipals,
since those tax-deferred assets do not flow into tax-exempt funds, Taggart
said.
    Fidelity Management & Research Co. experienced net sales of $14 million
in November, including reinvested dividends, according to spokeswoman Teri
Kilduff.
    But as of Dec. 21, Fidelity's tax-free funds had experienced net
redemptions of $41 million - a development Kilduff blamed on investor
anxiety over the delayed federal budget.
    At Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., spokeswoman Marilyn Morrison said:
"Municipal bonds continue to be pretty stagnant."
    The largest outflows have come from the firm's national long-term fund,
while its intermediate fund has seen the lightest redemptions, Morrison
said.
    The firm attributes that pattern to investor perception that long-term
funds will suffer most in the event of major tax reform, she added.
    By contrast, USAA Investment Management Co. benefited from the net
sales trend identified by the ICI. Company president Michael Roth said the
firm's tax-free funds saw inflows of $41 million in November. Roth said
investors were attracted by the high yields reached by municipals due to
the market's rally and fear of tax reform.
    Smith Barney Inc. has also seen its share of gains, said executive vice
president Jessica Bibliowicz. December has emerged as the strongest month
of 1995 for its tax-free funds, which also posted gains in November, she
said.
    Investor confidence in portfolio manager Joe Deane is largely
responsible, according to Bibliowicz.
    "Being the number-one ranked fund doesn't hurt," she said.

CALIFORNIA DEBATES WHETHER TO LINK SCHOOL FUNDING TO BUILDING PRISONS

By Antonio A. Prado
LOS ANGELES

    Top California GOP lawmakers said they hope partisan
politics don't get in the way as they reconvene today in hopes of passing a
resolution by next Monday to place a $3 billion state school general
obligation bond issue on the March 26 primary election ballot.
    Last year's legislative session ended in September with Republicans and
Democrats deadlocked over GOP insistence that school bonds be linked to a
prison bond initiative.
    That stalemate must be broken within the next few days, or the measures
will have to wait until November for the next opportunity to appear on a
statewide ballot, according to California Secretary of State Bill Jones.
    However, the same stumbling blocks that tripped up the bill in
September are still in place. While both sides agree on the need for school
construction funding, a Republican bill to be introduced today by
Assemblyman Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, nonetheless includes a $1.9
billion GO bond measure for new prison construction.
    "We have a need for school construction, and a need for prison
construction, and Republicans will propose a bill in the early part of the
session to do both," Brulte said in a press statement.
    The Democratic school bond proposal does not include the prison bond
provisions. Both measures require two-thirds majority approval in the
Assembly and state Senate for passage.
    "The Republican approach is still to hold the schools hostage to
building prisons," said Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Los Angeles, who last
month succeeded San Francisco Mayor-elect Willie L. Brown Jr. as the lower
house's top Democrat.
    "The Democratic view is (that) we need to build public schools to
reduce class size," Katz said. "And after we deal with schools, then we'll
deal with prisons."
    Aides to Brulte and Katz would not speculate on whether either side
would budge and allow a compromise.
    When the Legislature reconvenes today, the raucous Assembly will return
to a divided house and probable battles over its leadership.
    With Brown's departure on Dec. 14 following his election as San
Francisco mayor, the Assembly was left with 41 Republicans, 37 Democrats,
one Reform Party member, and one vacancy.
    The GOP will probably try to install Orange County assemblyman and
party leader Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, into the speakership, ousting
Brian Setencich, R-Fresno. Republicans are wary of Setencich because he was
elected in an overwhelmingly Democratic vote.
    And while the more docile state Senate has 21 Democrats holding a
simple majority control - with 16 Republicans, two independents, and one
vacancy - Brulte's bond bill probably won't gain the 27 votes needed to
pass even that less partisan body.
    Senate president pro tempore Bill Lockyer, D-Hayward, said he opposes
any linkage of school bonds to prisons, adding through an aide that his
party caucus wants to curb what he called the "reckless spending" that has
made California's prisons among the most expensive in the nation.
    Meanwhile, education groups are urging lawmakers to cast politics aside
and place school GO bonds on the March ballot.
    The state Department of Finance has estimated that California's school
capital project needs at least $7 billion to refurbish aging facilities and
build new schools to handle statewide enrollments estimated at 140,000 new
students annually.
    "If California's financial situation were more dire, I could understand
my colleagues' concerns," said longtime Assemblywoman Dede Alpert, D-La
Jolla, chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, and among those
opposed to linking school and prison bonds. "But our classrooms are the
most overcrowded in the nation."
    She added that while California's debt levels are up, they are moderate
compared to some states.

N.Y.C. ECONOMIC AGENCY POSTS ANOTHER BANNER YEAR

By Christina Pretto

     Increased business confidence in the local economy helped to make 1995
another record year for the bonding arm of the New York City Economic
Development Corp.
    In one fell swoop last year, the city's Industrial Development Agency
used up its entire annual allotment of private-activity bond volume - $120
million - to help finance a recycling plant on Staten Island for Pratt
Industries, an Australian company.
    That deal and others, including some scheduled to close this week,
brings the agency's total issuance for the year to more than $864 million,
just $7 million less than 1994's $871 million. Going forward, development
agency officials expect 1996 issuance levels to resemble those in 1995.
    The agency is able to exceed its annual allotment of private-activity
bonds by using allocations built up in previous years and by applying for
extra capacity from state private-activity reserves.
    In 1995, the agency completed 39 transactions that ranged in size from
$253 million to $1.3 million. In 1994, the agency completed 24
transactions.
    The numbers run in sharp contrast to issuance levels between 1987 and
1993. The most bonds issued in the period was $417 million of debt in 1991.
A more typical year was 1987, when the agency issued about $44 million of
debt.
    Corporation officials attribute the increase largely to a greater
confidence in the economy on the part of small businesses and nonprofits,
which has made the businesses more willing to take on long-term debt.
Better marketing of the agency's programs has also increased demand, they
said.
    Indeed, corporation president Charles Millard said he would like more
businesses and nonprofits - especially smaller ones - to take advantage of
the Development Agency's ability to issue tax-exempt bonds to raise
capital. Such financing is viewed by city officials as an investment tool
to revive the city's weak economy.
    The Industrial Development Agency is a subsidiary of the Economic
Development Corp., a public-benefit, quasi-governmental entity that is
charged with improving the city's business climate.
    The Development Agency - among other programs - issues revenue bonds
for both businesses and nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations needing funds for
capital investment.
    Both the corporation and the Development Agency have been at the
forefront of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to retain and attract
business - and thus jobs and tax revenues, crucial to a city that in the
last five years has lost more than 400,000 jobs while battling to close
chronic multibillion-dollar budget gaps.
    The issue for Pratt Industries is a key transaction in Giuliani's
agenda to bring in new business. The agency plans to sell another $150
million of debt for Pratt in 1996.
    The agency also recently sold about $253 million of bonds to finance a
co-generation plant for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a transaction that was
begun nearly four years ago. Together, the two projects are expected to
generate more than 800 jobs.
    But the agency is not focused solely on large deals - quite the
opposite. The lion's share of its issues over the past two years have been
less than $10 million, and have targeted smaller businesses and nonprofits,
such as a $1.3 million issue for the Dance Theater Workshop, a Manhattan
dance group.
    "I want more not-for-profits and small businesses to know we're
available," Millard said in a telephone interview. "If they can get access
to capital, then they can have an opportunity to grow."
    Many of the smaller issues are unrated and privately placed with funds
that are familiar with agency programs and need to diversify their
portfolios with small blocks of debt that are still triple- or double-tax-
exempt. The bonds are rarely traded and instead are held to maturity.
    To facilitate many of the agency's debt transactions, the corporation
must first acquire a title interest in a client's property. Such
acquisition creates a public interest in the business and legally justifies
the issuance of tax-exempt bonds.
    Issuance is also subject to allocation of New York State's allotment of
private-activity bond capacity. Of the state's $900 million annual private-
activity capacity, the city's Development Agency receives $120 million a
year.
    The agency may also apply for reserve allocation, which the state sets
aside every year, totaling $300 million. Both state and local agencies may
draw from the reserve on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the
state Economic Development Department, headed by Charles Gargano.

S&P SAYS UPGRADE FOR N.Y. WILL COME WITH BUDGET BALANCE

By Christina Pretto

    Standard & Poor's Corp. last week said New York State is in line for an
upgrade to A from A-minus if Republican Gov. George Pataki succeeds in
pushing through plans to cut spending and impose structural balance for the
fiscal 1997 budget.
    However, the rating agency warned that an upgrade to above the A-level
is years away because the state has yet to demonstrate a commitment to
fiscal responsibility over an extended period.
    Market reaction to the statement was virtually nil, as holiday doldrums
kept trading activity low, several traders said.
    "New York paper is pretty stretched as it is," one trader said. "I
think everybody is into a holiday mode."
    Nonetheless, market participants have been grumbling over the past few
months that the state - the lowest rated in the country by Standard &
Poor's - is due for an upgrade as it embarks on a path of tax cuts coupled
with spending reductions.
    The upgrade to A - if it happens - will occur in or around March.
Richard Marino, a director at Standard & Poor's, said in an interview last
week that the positive outlook on the rating would be removed at around
that time.
    "We're going to make a determination as to whether the rating is A or
A-minus in March," Marino said. "At that point we'll take the positive
outlook off the rating and replace it with a stable outlook."
    An upgrade to A will hinge on the state's enacting a structurally
balanced budget that reduces general-fund spending, like that currently
being proposed by Pataki, Marino said.
    Whether that happens, however, is subject to significant risk,
including legislative opposition to cuts in social service spending and
uncertainty surrounding changes in federal funding for entitlement
programs, Marino added.
    Moody's Investors Service already rates New York State's general
obligation bonds A.
    Overall, Standard & Poor's praised Pataki's proposed $63.3 billion all-
funds budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 - particularly the
administration's effort to introduce the plan a month ahead of schedule.
    "This was an extremely difficult task given the uncertainty surrounding
the federal budget," the rating agency said in a statement.
    The plan also calls for reducing state general-fund spending for the
second straight year, moving budgeting to a cash basis, and balancing tax
cuts with cuts in spending, particularly in Medicaid.
    Separate but related budget initiatives include a proposal by Pataki
that both the executive and legislative branches agree on one set of
revenue estimates for budget deliberations, which rating analysts said
would be a step in the right direction.
    "Any serious movement ... to this method of revenue forecasting would
be viewed positively," Standard & Poor's said.
    Currently, the two parties constantly haggle over revenue estimates,
which are often revised upward simply to accommodate an unwillingness to
reduce spending. As a result, deficits are exacerbated, credit analysts
said.
    The governor has also proposed constitutional amendments to require:
the Legislature to enact a balanced budget; the governor to propose the
executive budget by Dec. 1; and the enactment of an austerity budget when
the budget is passed late, rather than the use of emergency appropriations.
    "While these initiatives are very long-term in nature ... if carried
through, (they) could position New York to have a credit rating more in
line with other states in the country," the rating agency said.
    But the state must do a few other things to garner an above-A rating,
Marino said, suggesting an elimination - or significant drawdown - of the
state's $4 billion accumulated deficit, and years of on-time budget
enactments.
    "An above-A level wouldn't happen before the end of the century,"
Marino said. "We're looking for long-term actions."
    But some market observers argue that the Pataki administration's
willingness to fight for spending reductions and tax cuts deserves
significant recognition from the rating agencies.
    "It's ridiculous. We're below West Virginia and Louisiana," said one
analyst. "Come on."

AS FEDERAL AID GAP SQUEEZES N.J., STATE SELLS TRANS EARLY

By David Kaplan

     The impasse over fiscal 1996 federal appropriations bills has forced
New Jersey to accelerate short-term debt issuance as delays in federal
payments for Medicaid and other programs cause cash-flow problems.
    While a number of states have the resources to make up for the overdue
aid from Washington, a prolonged stalemate between Congress and the
president could put other states in the same fix as New Jersey, said Hyman
C. Grossman, a managing director for Standard & Poor's Corp.
    With no agreements on appropriations for federal departments governing
Medicaid, Medicare, welfare, or job training - the most significant
programs sending money to the states - many states have been spending their
own funds on those programs since the federal fiscal year began Oct. 1.
    Yesterday, New Jersey completed the second - and final, according to
state Treasury officials - installment of a $505 million short-term cash-
flow borrowing authorization by issuing a $250 million commercial paper tax
and revenue anticipation note.
    The issue was rated A1-plus by Standard & Poor's and Prime-1 by Moody's
Investors Service. A line of credit from Union Bank of Switzerland ensured
adequate liquidity for the commercial paper program, and helped secure the
high ratings, rating agency analysts said.
    On Dec. 5, New Jersey issued $200 million in commercial paper Trans as
a result of the cash-flow pressure caused by delay in aid from Washington,
state officials said.
    A spokeswoman for the state treasurer said that while the state is
permitted to borrow $505 million, the $450 million in commercial paper
Trans should cover for the absence of federal assistance.
    Of the programs that receive federal aid, New Jersey's Human Services
Department faces the greatest potential for disruption, Grossman noted.
Most of the proceeds from the commercial paper will go to human services.
    "Different states are handling effects of the budget impasse in
different ways," Grossman said. "Most states are handling the cash-flow
problems internally. They can move money around - apparently with less
difficulty than New Jersey. But some states have legal restrictions on the
ability to borrow internally."
    Florida is one state that has been able to successfully transfer money
within its borders to cover the delayed federal aid, Grossman said.
    "In effect, what Florida has done is advance money to service providers
that ordinarily would have been paid from federal money," Grossman said.
"When and if the federal budget gets straightened out, federal money will
flow down to Tallahassee and then the state will reimburse from whence they
borrowed."
    New Jersey doesn't have constraints that prevent borrowing internally,
Grossman said. But state officials probably concluded that it was less
costly to issue debt than to shift money around internally, he said.
    "When you borrow internally, you have to pay a taxable rate," Grossman
said. "It's cheaper to go out and issue tax-exempt commercial paper."
    The commercial paper Trans should cover the state's liquidity for at
least six weeks, said David Alter, an assistant vice president with
Moody's.
    "It should be said that the state has adequate reserves to maintain the
difference from that shortfall," Alter added. "The month-ending balance for
January is sufficient even without the cash-flow borrowing. It's to
preserve proper liquidity, because at some point in January, the state
would normally experience a low point anyway. This borrowing is a little
more than usual, but they expected to do it anyway."
    At this point in time, both Grossman and Alter said that no other
states have accelerated their issuance as a result of the federal
government shutdown. But they do expect other states to follow suit if the
impasse lasts through January.
    On Dec. 22, Congress passed a continuing spending resolution that will
expire midnight Jan. 3. The programs operating under that resolution are
Aid to Families With Dependent Children, veterans benefits, and the budget
for the District of Colombia.
    "Of course, this is America and this thing will get resolved at some
point and by the time February rolls around, cash-flow estimates show a
large bump up in revenues," Alter said. "So while the situation is
difficult for New Jersey, it is by no means desperate."

GOLDMAN BACK AT TOP OF THE HEAP; ISSUANCE HEALTHIER THAN EXPECTED

By Yong Lim

    Goldman, Sachs & Co. won the top municipal underwriting spot in 1995,
knocking Merrill Lynch & Co. out of the number one senior manager position,
according to figures compiled from Securities Data Co.'s database.
    Merrill, top lead manager in 1993 and 1994, dropped to second position
for that category but took the top honor among co-managers.
    The figures also show long-term bond sales totaled $156.22 billion in
1995, helped by a strong close to the year. The figure was higher than most
market observers had expected but still 5% below the $164.5 billion sold in
1994, according to Securities Data.
    In December, state and local governments sold 818 issues totaling
$16.76 billion, up a strong 65% from the $10.16 billion marketed in
December 1994, Securities Data said. Private placements are included in all
volume figures but not the underwriting rankings. (See article on page 3.)
    Last year Goldman Sachs lead managed 307 issues, totaling $19.83
billion. That accounted for 12.8% of the $154.94 billion of long-term bonds
sold through negotiated and competitive underwriting during the period.
    Merrill Lynch lead managed $17 billion in 1995, followed by Smith
Barney Inc. with $12.98 billion, PaineWebber Inc. with $12.71 billion, and
Lehman Brothers with $9.83 billion.
    Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have been in a dogfight for the top of
the municipal underwriting rankings since 1987. Merrill, which last won the
crown in 1994, has won five out of the last nine years. But Goldman easily
prevailed in 1995, not only taking first place for the year as a whole but
also grabbing each quarter's top honors.
    In co-manager rankings, where each manager in an issue is given credit
for the full par value of the sale, Merrill Lynch led in long-term bond
sales, with 779 issues totaling $45.9 billion, followed closely by Smith
Barney with $44.88 billion.
    After them came Goldman Sachs with $44.57 billion, PaineWebber with
$41.63 billion, and Lehman Brothers with $35.61 billion. Merrill last won
the co-manager rankings in 1989. PaineWebber has dominated from 1990 to
1994 as top co-manager in municipal underwriting.
    By a large margin, New York City was the leading issuer of long-term
bonds in 1995, with 14 issues totaling $5.42 billion. It was the biggest
seller of debt from 1991 to 1993, but was eclipsed by the state of
California 1994.
    The New York State Dormitory Authority was second in 1995 with $1.79
billion of long-term bonds sold, followed by the New Jersey Transportation
Trust Fund Authority with $1.59 billion.
    Connecticut followed with $1.56 billion, and the Foothill/Eastern
Transportation Corridor, Calif., with $1.51 billion.
    California fell from first in 1994 to ninth place with $1.25 billion.
    Except for the second quarter, where Foothill/Eastern was the top
issuer, New York City led every quarter in 1995.
    Securities Data's long-term bond rankings are based on issues with
final maturities of 13 months or longer, while short-term rankings are
based on issues maturing in under 13 months. Municipal forward sales are
included, but private placements, remarketings, and taxable debt issued
directly by private nonprofit organizations are excluded. The rankings are
subject to revision.

SAYING GOODBYE TO 1995, PLAYERS HOPE FOR QUICK PRIMARY PICKUP

By Michael Stanton

    After a week of solid gains despite light post-holiday volume,
municipal market players say they are looking forward to a rise in activity
this week to validate prices' climb.
    Last week's almost dormant primary market is expected to be replaced by
a more active new-issue sector starting tomorrow, but although the calendar
is heavier, several underwriters noted that many of the deals planned for
this week are refundings whose ultimate timing will rely on the market's
performance.
    Leading that list is an insured $155 million electric system revenue
refunding issue for Sikeston, Mo., that is scheduled to be priced in the
negotiated sector by lead manager A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.
    An underwriter at the firm said the deal - originally planned for late
December before the market deteriorated under the weight of a supply surge
- has returned to the calendar for next week, but could be delayed again.
    "We put it on the calendar, but the market's going to have to tell us
when it's going to be priced," the underwriter said.
    Other significant deals on the negotiated calendar for this week
include an $89.3 million general obligation public improvement refunding
bond issue for Richmond that is set to be priced by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
    Meanwhile, Smith Barney Inc., as senior manager, plans to price a $66.4
million sales tax revenue refunding issue for the Riverside County, Calif.,
Transportation Commission. The deal is set to be insured by Financial
Guaranty Insurance Co.
    In other negotiated action, Goldman Sachs will return to the market as
senior manager for a $65 million hospital revenue refunding issue for
Integris Health Systems in Oklahoma. The deal is set to be sold with
insurance from AMBAC Indemnity Corp.
    The competitive sector, meanwhile, will gear up for a $127 million
refunding from Clark County, Nev., on Thursday, while a long-awaited $183.9
million Florida Board of Education refunding remains on 24-hour notice.
    In Thursday's secondary market activity, traders said municipal prices
were unchanged to up #1/4 of a point in light trading, with what demand
there was coming from other dealers, while major buy-side participants
moved into a "holiday mode" ahead of Friday's early close and the long
weekend for New Year's Day.
    Although traders uniformly cautioned that the week's gains were based
on very thin trading activity, most said the slow primary market supply and
light forward calendar, lent the market a firm tone going into the new
year.
    "The primary's not going to be dead like it was this week, but it's
still going to be relatively quiet, so from the supply side of things, I
think we still have a good tone," another trader said.
    The Bond Buyer's 30-day visible supply of new issues expected to come
to market within the next month totaled $2.29 billion Thursday, up $141.4
million from Wednesday. That comprised $1.06 billion of competitive issues,
up $141.4 million, and $1.23 billion of negotiated issues, which was
unchanged.
    Standard & Poor's Blue List of dealer inventories fell $119.9 million,
to $1.44 billion.
    With the impasse over the federal budget causing a suspension in data
releases from the Commerce Department and Bureau of Labor Statistics,
fixed-income players were forced to turn to several privately compiled
sources for insight into the economy's health.
    Although data on the number of initial unemployment claims for the week
of Dec. 18 was delayed, the Conference Board reported that its index of
help-wanted advertising volume fell four points to 127 in November, which
is considered to reflect a drop in the supply of jobs and a slowing
economy.
    The signs of economic weakness helped government market traders sustain
their week-long rally, pushing the 30-year Treasury bond through the 6%
psychological barrier, where it stayed for the remainder of the session.
Late Thursday, the long bond was quoted up #12/32, to yield 5.98%.
    But both the Treasury and municipal markets' attention remained focused
on Washington, with players voicing hopes that the stress of the government
shutdown, along with the rapidly approaching presidential primary season,
would lead to a quick agreement between White House and congressional
leaders to balance the budget.
    The debt futures markets moved up in line with the cash markets'
bearish tone, although the municipal futures contract continued to
underperform the Treasury contract. The March municipal contract closed up
#9/32 Thursday, to 120#23/32.
    But the MOB spread widened again, and was calculated at negative 13
Thursday, compared with negative nine Wednesday.

MUNI BRIEFS

First-time buyers of municipal bonds are quick to pick up on the
apparent contradiction of double-A-rated bonds yielding less than
supposedly more secure triple-A insured bonds, according to Robert W.
Chamberlin, senior vice president and chief municipal analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
     While Chamberlin and other analysts agreed there is no simple
explanation, they all said supply and demand is a major factor behind the
difference, typically four to eight basis points.
     "In pure economic terms, a lot of anything tends to cheapen the
price -- even with something that (in theory) should be high-priced,''
Chamberlin explained. "That clearly is what is happening with triple-A
rated bonds.''
According to the Public Securities Association, almost 45% of
new municipal issues came to market with insurance in 1995.-- Jon Birger

Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., is working on separate legislative
proposals that would dramatically change municipal market disclosure and
make it harder for municipalities to file for bankruptcy.
     The legislation, which is still being drafted but could be
introduced during the next few weeks or months, stems from a hearing on
Orange County that was held last July by the House Banking Committee's
capital markets subcommittee that Baker chairs, an aide and other sources
said this week.
     Baker had said after those hearings that he planned to introduce
legislation to improve municipal disclosure and to make it more difficult
for local governments to file for bankruptcy.
     It is not yet clear what support Baker would have for the
legislation from congressional committees that have jurisdiction over these
issues or from municipal market groups.
     But the Public Securities Association and Government Finance
Officers Association plan to consider the draft disclosure bill at meetings
later this month, officials with those groups said. --  Lynn Stevens Hume

Environmental and transportation bills important to
infrastructure finance are expected to see a lot of congressional activity
this year -- but not necessarily passage.
     Lobbyists and analysts give flow control and drinking water
bills better chances for final action than reauthorization of the Clean
Water Act. On transportation, the House is expected to take more initiative
than the Senate in laying the groundwork for next year's debate on
reauthorizing a major 1991 highway law.
     Analysts Debra Coy and Gregg Orrill of Washington Analysis,
which is part of the investment banking arm of the HSBC Group, said in a
recent report that drinking water and flow control bills, along with
Superfund legislation, "continue to be our best bets for completed
environmental legislation by mid-1996.''-- Martha M. Canan

Potential changes in federal funding will move to the front
burner as the number one item affecting state credit ratings in 1996,
according to a report from Moody's Investors Service released earlier this
year.
     Health care and welfare are the areas in which state credit
quality is most vulnerable, the rating agency said, emphasizing the
widespread reliance of states on federal support -- and voter pressure for
lower taxes.
     But Moody's said ratings changes this year do not have to be all
one-way.-- Peter List

The National Association of Bond Lawyers is calling on federal
regulators to withdraw the long-pending private-activity bond rules, offer
a new set of proposed regulations for comment, and move quickly to make
them final.
     Although a number of issuer groups have suggested re-proposing
the private-activity bond rules, this is the first time the bond lawyers
association has called for a newly proposed set of regulations since the
rules were first published in December 1994.
For a number of reasons, "including the significance of this
regulatory project and its widespread impact on state and local
governments, we believe that re-proposing the proposed regulations with
modifications and amendments would be the most prudent way to proceed with
this project,'' NABL said in a letter released earlier this month.-- Joan
Pryde

Rep. Christopher Cox is working with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to draft legislation that would simplify municipal disclosure
and make it more like corporate disclosure without repealing the Tower
Amendment to the securities laws.
     The draft legislation may also propose setting federal
requirements for municipal financial reporting, accounting, and auditing.
     "The idea would be to avoid any conflict with Tower and to avoid
the imposition of any new costs'' or burdens on issuers and other market
participants, Cox, a Republican from Orange County, said in an interview
Jan. 5.
     Cox said he hopes to have a draft bill ready within 30 days to
discuss with state and local groups, the Public Securities Association, and
other municipal market participants.
     "I intend to work closely with the commission and with
interested market participants for an extended period before introducing
the legislation,'' he said.-- Lynn Stevens Hume

The Bond Buyer.

LOS ANGELES PLANS TO SELL ONTARIO AIRPORT BONDS IN APRIL

The City of Los Angeles Department of Airports will sell
between $90 million and $150 million in revenue bonds this spring to pay
for a new terminal complex at Ontario International Airport in Southern
California's Inland Empire.
     The financing team is already in place. The financial
advisers are Lazard Freres & Co., Charles A. Bell Securities Corp., and
Marilyn L. Garcia. The agency was working with Lazard Freres' Los Angeles
office before it closed. The firm's relationship with the city continues
from its New York office. O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles is bond counsel.
     The Ontario bond issue, tentatively scheduled for April,
will be for about $90 million if the department builds only two terminals
in the new complex and leaves space for a third structure to be built
later.
     But the city also sought construction bids for building all
three terminal buildings to see if it could get an attractive price, given
the current weakness in the state's construction industry. Construction
bids are due Jan. 26.
     If all three buildings are constructed at this time, the
project's cost will be $343 million, with bonds financing $150 million of
the project, said Kathy Van Ness, deputy management analyst for the
department.
     "We've been having some protracted discussions on the
structure of the bond issue," Van Ness said. The agency is discussing how
to finance the project using airport revenues, passenger facility fees and
federal grants.
     Last year, the department refinanced revenue bonds tied to
Los Angeles International Airport so it could remove covenants that
prohibited the use of airport revenues for non-airport uses and restricted
the transfer of airport revenues to the city's general fund. In addition to
LAX and Ontario, the department also runs the city's Burbank Airport and
Palmdale Airport.
     In last summer's bond sale, the department included
insurance at the bidder's option that was provided by FGIC. It's uncertain
whether the agency will offer enhancement on the Ontario issue, Van Ness
said.
     Ontario handles 6 million passengers a year in its fast-
growing service area that includes five million residents and covers San
Bernardino and Riverside counties, and portions of northern Orange County
and eastern Los Angeles County. By comparison, 50 million passengers travel
through LAX annually.
     Ontario airport's lower profile among investors will be a
challenge for the agency. Van Ness said she is considering offering an
optional tour of the airport and region to the ratings agencies.
     Passenger traffic at the airport, located about 35 miles
east of Los Angeles, has increased steadily for the past decade.
     In 1975, 1.29 million people used the airport. In 1993, 6.2
million travelers used the airport and 353,000 tons of air freight were
shipped from the facility. The new terminal complex will provide capacity
for 12 million passengers.

MWD HOPES A BOND RALLY WILL PERMIT REFINANCING

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
spent much of last week watching interest rates, waiting for the
opportunity to sell a $200 million refunding issue.
     "We need to get down to record low interest rates to do
this deal," said Bert Becker, chief financial officer for the MWD. As
California Public Finance was going to press Jan. 10, Becker said interest
rates were about "20 basis points away from our target."
     "There's still some optimism from several economists and
brokerage firms that there's still some hope for a rally," he said from his
Los Angeles office.
     Becker, who described the market-sensitive bond sale as a
"day-to-day, week-to-week" situation, said he's hopeful the deal will be
completed this month.
     Smith Barney Inc. is the underwriter. O'Melveny & Myers and
Robinson & Pearman are co-bond counsel. Hawkins, Delafield & Wood is
disclosure counsel and Fulbright & Jaworski is underwriter counsel. O'Brien
Partners Inc. is serving as financial adviser.
     Bond proceeds will be used for both advanced and current
refundings.
     The refunding will include a 1991 offering that helped pay for
work on the district's Eastside reservoir project and Jensen treatment
plant.
     The district is paying an average interest rate of 5.6% on
its outstanding debt of $2.1 billion.

POLLUTION AUTHORITY SELLS $11.2 MILLION ISSUE FOR RECYCLING

The California Pollution Control Financing Authority sold
$11.2 million in revenue bonds to build recycling facilities in Contra
Costa County.
     Bond proceeds from the Dec. 7 sale will allow Contra Costa
Waste Service Inc. to convert an existing building into a materials
recovery and transfer facility and build a processing facility in
Pittsburg. The project, which will process 1,500 tons of solid waster per
day, is expected to create 17 jobs.

BANKAMERICA OPENS ATLANTA OFFICE

BA Securities Inc. opened a public finance office in
Atlanta Jan. 2 to work on muncipal securities and corporate-related
transactions in the tax-exempt market. The new office is the third public
finance unit that BankAmerica has opened in the last two years outside of
California. In October 1993, the company opened an office in Dallas, and
another in Chicago in May 1995.
     The office is headed by J. David Hospodar, an Atlanta
resident who has worked for Goldman, Sachs & Co. and CS First Boston. The
bank is likely to gradually add staff in Atlanta.
     "We're looking for additional people -- and it's a buyer's
market right now -- so I'm taking my time," said Anthony J. Taddey, senior
managing director.
     The firm also has public finance offices in San Francisco,
Los Angeles, and in Seattle through the banking company's Seafirst
subsidiary.

MERRILL LYNCH MOST ACTIVE UNDERWRITER IN 1995

After a tumultuous year in public finance in which several
firms left the business and the aftershocks of Orange County's bankruptcy
were felt nationally, many look forward to a brighter year ahead.
     Merrill Lynch & Co. topped the list of lead underwriters in
California for full-year 1995 despite its ties to Orange County. Merrill
Lynch worked on 40 bond issues in California totaling $3.3 billion, giving
the firm a 16.5% share of the market. Issuers the firm worked with last
year included the State of California, the San Diego County Regional
Transportation Commission, San Bernardino County, Los Angeles County, and
the City of Long Beach.
     "We hope to see more issuance at the state level" this
year, said H. Cody Press III, managing director and manager at Merrill
Lynch in Los Angeles.
     Other players also see increased activity this year.
     "I see volume about 10% higher than last year nationally,
and maybe a little higher in California because our recovery is underway,"
said Anthony J. Taddey, senior managing director at BA Securities Inc. He
also anticipates a very strong note season in California this summer.
     Michael P. George, managing director at J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. in San Francisco,  said he expects "clients will continue
to be very judicious about bond issuance."
     "There will be more strategic financing and less clean,
plain-vanilla financings," he said, adding that issuers will be under even
greater pressure to do more with fewer dollars.
     Merrill Lynch was followed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. as the
most active underwriter in California last year. Goldman worked on 27 deals
totaling $2.3 billion for an 11.4% market share.
     PaineWebber Inc. followed with a 10.6% share of the market.
The firm worked on 43 issues totaling $2.1 billion in principal amount.
     Smith Barney Inc. was the fourth most active underwriter,
handling 44 issues totaling $1.8 billion in principal amount. Smith Barney
held 8.9% of the California market.
     Rounding out the top five was Morgan Stanley & Co., which
handled 10 issues totaling $1.6 billion. The firm captured 8.1% of the
market. Morgan Stanley's 1995 major clients included the City of San Diego
and the San Jose/Santa Clara Clean Water Financing Authority.
     Among bond counsel, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in San
Francisco captured the top spot in both California and nationally.
     "While Orrick has been ranked number one for seven of the
last eight years, holding that position for 1995 is particularly gratifying
in light of the nearly 50% reduction in dollar amount of debt issued by the
State of California," said Roger Davis, chairman of Orrick's public finance
department. Davis also anticipates the state will be a more active issuer
this year.
     Orrick served on 215 issues with a principal amount of $8.3
billion, giving the firm a 41.4% market share. Following Orrick was Jones
Hall Hill & White; Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & Rauth; Pamela S. Jue P.C.;
and O'Melveny & Myers.
     The most active financial adviser last year was Public
Financial Management Inc., which worked on 30 issues in California with a
principal amount of $2.9 billion, giving the firm almost 15% of the
California market. Following Public Financial were Public Resources
Advisory Group, O'Brien Partners Inc., Seidler-Fitzgerald Public Finance,
and Kelling , Northcross & Nobriga Inc.

SNOWFALL IN EAST BOOSTS BAROMETER

In an unusual week in which the Blizzard of '96 hindered market
activity, the California Debt Barometer's yield jumped seven basis points
to 5.74%.
     Among the larger deals underway in California last week was the
tentative sale of $200 million in revenue bonds from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California. The district was waiting for lower
interest rates to complete the transaction, which is being handled by Smith
Barney Inc. (See story on Page 1.)
     An $85 million revenue bond issue from the California Health
Facilities Finance Authority, originally planned for last week, was
rescheduled for this week. PaineWebber Inc. is handling the transaction.
     Elsewhere in the market, bond fund managers remained generally
bullish and continued to favor discount and noncallable bonds, Cadmus Hicks
wrote in his weekly market report for John Nuveen & Co.
     As the barometer data were gathered, the Bond Buyer's 30-day
visible supply of new issues expected to come to market within the next
month stood at $4.74 billion.

MENLO PARK ISSUE ENJOYED RIGHT TIMING

The importance of timing a bond sale was apparent in this
month's sale of Menlo Park Community Development Authority's $32.3 million
tax allocation refunding bonds.
     The deal was among the first out of the gate this year,
coming to market on the morning of Jan. 2.
     "We priced it first thing Tuesday morning, right after the
holiday," said Richard G. Kiss, a managing director at Piper Jaffray Inc.
in San Francisco.
     Trading got off to a quiet start that day, but by midday
activity picked up.
     "We did exactly the right thing because I don't think we
could have achieved those levels" later in the week, Kiss said, adding that
the final decision to price Tuesday morning was made at a 6:30 a.m.
conference call that day.
     Cadmus Hicks at John Nuveen & Co. in Irvine also noted that
"the deals priced earlier in the week did extremely well."
     Menlo Park wanted to achieve $1 million in present-value
savings through the refinancing of bonds originally issued in 1988 and
1992. The Silicon Valley community achieved that objective by realizing
$1.04 million in present-value savings, Kiss said.
     Menlo Park originally planned to sell the bonds in the
second week of December, but the market moved away. Wishing to avoid
pricing the bonds during the slow holiday period of late December, the city
decided to wait until this month to sell the bonds.
     The original bond proceeds paid for improvements in housing
projects, a senior citizen center, and other capital improvements in the
redevelopment area in the city's Belle Haven neighborhood, said Uma
Chokkalingam, Menlo Park's finance director.

SF SHOPS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown announced in his inaugural
address Jan. 8 that he is considering financing $150 million in affordable
housing.
      Details were sketchy on how the bond financing would be
structured. In his speech, Brown suggested that some of the money would be
raised through a tax-increment bond issue.
      Word has it that San Francisco's new mayor is considering a
$100 million general obligation bond issue and a $50 million tax-increment
issue, tied to the city's Golden Gateway Project Area.
      Brown also noted in his inaugural address that the city
must invest in its infrastructure, with or without state and federal
dollars.
      Brown's reference to infrastructure is another sign that
public finance issues will get more attention from the general public this
year as San Francisco and other California cities try to meet public
service demands with increasingly scarce dollars and debt capacity.

LAWMAKERS KICK OFF NEW YEAR WITH BIG BOND MEASURES

The California Assembly elected a new speaker and agreed to
place a $3 billion school bond measure on the March ballot when it
reconvened Jan. 3.
     The Assembly elected Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, to be
the body's fourth speaker in the last 12 months after ousting Brian
Setencich, R-Fresno, who held the position with primarily Democratic
support.
     The school bond measure received a vote of 68-to-6 in favor
of placing it on the March ballot. The proposal died in the final hours of
the 1995 session when Republican lawmakers linked their support of school
bonds to Democratic support for prison bonds.
     The $3 billion bond measure for the March ballot would
provide more than $2 billion for school rehabilitation and construction and
$900 million for improvements to state college and university campuses.
     The outcome of the election is somewhat uncertain,
especially given voters' current mood to limit government spending and to
keep tax dollars at the local level, instead of sending them to Sacramento
and Washington.
     At the forefront of the effort to persuade voters to
approve the school bond measure will be the California State PTA.
     "There are a lot of people who are concerned about
government debt, and it's not a concern to be taken lightly," Betty DeFea,
director of legislation for the PTA, acknowledged. "It's like personal and
corporate debt, however. You have to realize what it is you're going into
debt for and then assess whether it's worth the financial risk."
     "Schools and children are worth that up-front investment,"
she said. "It's wise not to put ourselves in bonded indebtedness for
everything we want, but some things we need."
     Education was also a priority reflected in Gov. Pete
Wilson's proposed $61.5 billion budget, which was announced Jan. 10. Wilson
proposed spending more money on schools, canceling fee increases at
colleges and universities, and providing a tax cut for almost every
California resident.
     The governor is asking Californians to approve $7.8 billion
in bond measures to help pay for new schools, prisons, juvenile jails and
the replacement or seismic retrofitting of state roads and bridges.
     State Treasurer Matt Fong and Finance Director Russ Gould
will be going to New York later this month to discuss the state's financial
plans, among other matters.
     "While infrastructure needs require $7.8 billion in
additional debt, those bonds will be issued by my office in a prudent
manner, balancing the necessities with our ability to pay for them," Fong
said.
     "Californians may be in a better position to take on more
bonded debt because our economic outlook remains positive," he said. "For
the fifth year in a row, revenues exceed general fund expenditures,
demonstrating that government spends within its means."
     "The investment community does recognize our state's
improving performance. Often our bonds trade at the double A rate, rather
than at the single A rating," the treasurer said.

TECHNOLOGY PROLIFERATION OF 1980s TO SHAPE CARD
MARKET IN 1990s

     With the credit card industry now in what has been termed
"the third decade of card growth," a new agenda of challenges
awaits it.  The coming of the 1990s reinforces the rapid pace at
which change occurred over the past 10 years and how competitive
the current marketplace has become.
     The advances made in electronic processing capabilities in
the 1980s have set the stage for what are expected to be even
more innovative and flexible payment systems ahead.  "As we build
those, there will be the ability to offer a variety of payment
mechanisms--whether they be proprietary credit or proprietary
debit or just various other forms of credit programs," Larry
Myatt, vice president of marketing and product development at
Sears Payment Systems Inc., told CARD NEWS.
     Despite an electronic environment better able to affect
change, by way of providing more options to retailers and
consumers in a shorter period of time, there is still the need to
fine-tune and clarify card product strategies.
     The proliferation of products in the 1980s was designed to
fit various  customer segments, card enhancements, warranty
programs, airline discounts and frequent flier programs.
     But some of what happened has resulted in major internal
divisions.
     "We see every element of the business polarized," Alex Hart,
president of MasterCard International, said about bank cards.
     The industry is divided between issuers and acquirers, a
split seen as possibly eroding future cooperative efforts,
according to an examination of card polarization and consol-
idation, prepared by Edgar, Dunn & Conover Inc., the San
Francisco-based management consulting firm.
     An increasing portion of the industry is concentrated among
fewer participants in both the issuing and acquiring segments.
Consolidation on the acquiring side has resulted in
the entry of third-party processors with little or no interest in
the issuing side of the business.  Moreover, the proposition that
banking can retain control of the retail payment system in the
upcoming years is very much open to debate.  The largest bank
card processor today by a substantial margin is not a bank but
First Data Resources, a subsidiary--most troubling of all to bank
card issuers--of American Express.

      The top 10 issuers of bank cards in the late 1990s probably
will not be banks, noted David Poe, a principal with Edgar, Dunn
& Conover.  Of the top 10 acquirers at present, 4 of the
processors on the acquiring side of the merchant business account
for some 45% of the volume in dollars, he said.
     In addition, processors have developed innovations aimed at
certain market  segments, such as electronic draft capture (EDC)
and low-cost authorization.
     Non-bank competitors such as American Express and Sears,
Roebuck & Co. are gaining control of more point-of-sale (POS)
terminals, as several banks have given up the merchant side of
the business.
     The card system is opening up to yet more competition.
Namely, Ford Motor Co., General Electric (GE) Credit, Household
Bank of Chicago, General Motors, and--potentially posing the
greatest threat of all--American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
(AT&T).
     The acquiring business is consolidating because of the
inability of many banks to remain competitive in the merchant
marketplace.  "Rather than sell their portfolios to their banking
competitors, most banks have chosen to sell to non-banks," stated
Charles Russell, CEO of Visa U.S.A.
     One recent exception to that trend was the acquisition by
Citicorp--one of the largest card processors--of the merchant
card business of FCC National Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of
First Chicago Corp.  But many industry analysts think the
merchant business will remain within banking only in rare
instances such as this.
     Sears Payment Systems recently announced it will process the
$60 million private-label card portfolio of Lochmere Inc., a
retailer In Woburn, Mass.

  Invading others' turfs

     Deregulation in the 1980s provided the card industry
tremendous freedom with regard to pricing flexibility.  The
decade saw the emergence of annual and  other fees, competitive
pricing, and much pressure on interest rates and annual fees from
new entrants into the marketplace.
     During the period, there were also the first signs of
saturation, slow growth, and lower response rates to mailings.
The merger and acquisition mania also began with Chemical Bank's
acquisition of Continental's card portfolio.   Bank cards began
trying to increase their share of the lucrative travel and
entertainment (T&E) market long dominated by American Express,
which made its own entree into the large, mainstream retail
markets.
     Another development of the 1980s, the issuing of securities
backed by credit card receivables, now accounts for billions of
dollars of securitized assets in this country.
     Citicorp, which has securitized close to $8 billion in card
receivables,  now is offering $750 million in bonds in its
largest overseas issue to date backed by receivables generated in
the United States.  Sears also is considering the distribution
outside the country of its own card outstandings.   In the
present market, the name of the game is differentiation.  "Our
prime directive is to tailor products and services to meet the
specific consumer's needs," Russell said.
     Segmentation became a buzzword in the 1980s as it pertained
to gold, affinity, business and student cards.  There was a new
focus on customer service by the card industry and a growth in
national solicitations, spelling the end of only regional and
statewide marketing.
     Bank cards now face increasing competition from all sides.
In already trying to accommodate the demands of individual market
segments, bank cards are accepted for payment in supermarkets,
fast-food restaurants, movie theaters, parking lots, toll booths,
and the health-care industry.  Part of the emphasis here is on
speed in the card authorization and purchase process.
     When Sears introduced its Discover card in early 1986, the
growth of consumer credit was at its peak, noted Carl Steidtmann,
vice president for senior management and chief economist at
Management Horizons, a division of Price Waterhouse.
     In the realm of differentiated offerings, Discover is
selling a cashback feature that no other bank or non-bank card
has.

  Potential new products

     But we may be entering a period when a similar opportunity
exists for the introduction of new products.  The reason is that
the burst of activity in the early 1990s probably will be the
last peak of credit growth in the 1990s, Steidtmann pointed out.
     Others contend that new product introduction remains
increasingly diffi-cult.  "We're not in the same cooperative
relationship that we all used to be in when everything was done
within the banking community," said Poe.
     In this decade, many observers say, it will be necessary to
better understand the data reflecting what is taking place within
the customer base that bank cards now have.  Financial
institutions will need information even more to manage the risk
of credit cards, noted Donald Auriemma, president of Auriemma
Consulting Group in Garden City, N.Y.
     The 1990s will see, for the first time in a decade and a
half, a rising savings rate, Steidtmann said.  This will happen
primarily for reasons related to demographics.
     The savers currently are people between ages 45 and 60.  The
savings rate did not decline due to tax law changes, individual
retirement accounts (IRAs), or even societal greed, Steidtmann
said.  The real reason was demographics because in the 1980s the
number of people in the key savings sector went down.  In the
previous decade, the growth of installment credit was
unprecedented, driven largely by the demographics of the time and
a fairly stable economic environment.  While the economy at
present is robust, the 1990s has been projected as an era in
which unemployment and the demand for credit will fall.
     With low unemployment, people from a lower socioeconomic
level will enter the mainstream of the economy, resulting in an
increased penetration of cards.  Aside from more savings, there
will be more looking for ways to reduce one's own credit
exposure, Steidtmann said.  "What previously had gone into debt
payment and into the creation of debt will now go into savings,"
he added.      Demographics, to the extent they indicate a
turning against the credit culture, pose an unpromising picture
for credit in the 1990s.  The growth of
income also will have an effect on credit in the new decade.
There will be average rates of growth in income but a significant
change in the distribution of income.
     The demand for credit will decline, not relatively but in
absolute terms.  Households will not have the same demand for
credit as has been the case.
     The issue of market share will become critical to third-
party, bank, and proprietary cards.  The 1990s should see a
reduced demand for proprietary cards with the trend toward
reducing credit.

Squeeze on small issuers

     Market share will be the essential component in any AT&T
credit card product that enters the market.  The share and card
base that AT&T could draw on, in terms of its calling card
population, represents a huge potential marketing advantage.  If
the telecommunications giant offers a cobranded Visa card, for
example, it will most likely be at the expense of the cards that
cardholders already have.
     In the 1980s, the growth of private-label credit cards was
not nearly as great as that of bank cards.  There has been a move
within the large sector of retailers to come back to private-
label cards because of the enhanced marketing  capabilities
provided to them, such as target promotions and more information
about the consumers who buy in their stores.
     "Our perspective is that private-label credit cards or
proprietary credit cards, merchants' own programs, probably will
not grow in terms of total numbers of accounts, as far as the
bank card market will grow in the next few years," observed Larry
Myatt of Sears Payment Systems.

  Third-party bank cards

     However, he thinks there is good growth prospect for those
third-party processors--like Sears Payment--in devising private
label programs for merchants, as retailers look at the costs
associated with operating their own programs.  Therefore, a shift
from in-house to third-party operated programs is expected.
     Those who maintain their own credit card system in-house now
will look to third-party processors for other ways of maintaining
that capability because of the costs of new systems and
equipment.  There is expected to be more movement  toward third-
party processors maintaining the retailer card base than any
changes in or out of the private label business.
     If strategic alliances can be formed between both credit
offerers and retailers, the opportunity may be created for third-
party offerings to develop  in the arena of bank card credit.
This is probably the one component of the industry that will
experience growth in the 1990s, due to its ability to offer many
of the benefits of a proprietary card at the cost of a bank card,
according to Steidtmann.
     Such alliances will have to be based on joint marketing, on
providing information through the channel of distribution, the
quality of service, the ability to bring customers to a retailer
who would not go there otherwise, and on a much less expensive
economic model.
     This outcome is not likely to come about unless the view of
credit and retail executives toward credit moves from competition
and confrontation to one of cooperation, Myatt added.
     In terms of other payment mechanisms, many observers see an
enormous untapped market for debit cards at the point of sale--in
the form of proprietary debit, automated clearing house (ACH)
debit or direct debit.
     ACH debit is expected to be a very active means of payment
in the 1990s, Myatt said.  Part of its implementation was delayed
over the controversy in-volving Entree, the national POS debit
mark that MasterCard and Visa had been jointly developing.
     An antitrust lawsuit filed last summer by the attorneys
general in New York and in 12 states has stalled that program
indefinitely, if not permanently.
     ACH debit has been touted as a national debit card operated
through a bank card-like mechanism, as Entree was proposed to be.
In addition, American Express or Discover could offer this
product with their own cards.
     The other ACH vehicle is private-label debit, in which the
retailer itself--California's Vons Supermarket is one example--is
the card issuer.  In the 1980s, the financial and retail sectors
were hesitant about whether banks would take the lead in debit
cards or if that drive would be spearheaded by individual
retailers.
     It makes sense from a consumer standpoint to be able to have
a debit card that can be used at a variety of retail
establishments, Myatt told us.
     "Frankly, we have a lot of concerns about ACH-driven
products unless they are bank controlled and bank driven," said
MasterCard's Hart.
     The origin of a proprietary debit environment is akin to
private-label credit cards in that the objective is the
generation of additional sales volume and added customer
convenience.   Proponents see private-label debit making sense in
supermarkets where a lot of checks are now written, and at
gasoline stations where there already exist examples of
proprietary debit cards.

  New decade's trends

     Some of the trends in the 1990s will no doubt be
continuations of existing  developments.  Insiders stress that
the card industry must know the true net costs when features are
added to cards or efforts are made to attract different customer
segments.  Additionally, the industry will require better product
and customer profitability information, and it is looking toward
the development of systems that allow making those kinds of
determinations.
     Further segmentation of card products needs to be in terms
of segregating  between convenience users and revolvers.
Questions to be addressed include  whether to increase spending
allowed on a credit limit, and permitting the use of a card on a
monthly basis as a charge card--with a line of credit still the
foundation for an account.
     The 1990s are certain to bring a substantial increase in
non-bank card competition.  JCB, Japan's largest bank-issued
credit card, is seeking to be-come a major world player and to
increase its merchant network outside Japan.
     The card already is moving to overtake Diners Club.  JCB can
offer the card electronically, can come in and negotiate with a
relatively few processors and reach a large percentage of retail
establishments.
     One new product likely to emerge in the future is a coin
replacement card, or possibly a pre-paid card, for handling small
transactions.
     From all indications, there is strong interest in the United
States in chip technology and, specifically, in the integrated
circuit chip capabilities of smart cards.  Unlike in Japan and
Europe, the cards have no proximity to their source in the United
States, and have been more difficult to implement. Smart cards
offer potentially many variables and, for that reason, U.S. banks
are less inclined to agree on the direction in which to proceed,
noted Kevin Wilby, vice president of the retail transaction
division at Business Modeling Techniques Inc. (BMT) in Rochester,
N.Y.  On top of that, the first demand in this country would be
for the institution of smart card standards--which poses a much
more difficult task than the magnetic stripe that reflects a
standard format, he said.
     Consolidation and internationalization in the industry is
expected to continue, with more pressure to process transactions
inexpensively.  Besides controlling operating expenses, many
officials see a need for behavioral scoring at the point of sale
to minimize the number of declines in the system.  The
enhancement of this intelligence at the point of sale will be a
factor in controlling credit losses.
     Aside from network and communications enhancements to
support this new level of intelligence in database management,
the focus will continue on making investments in systems and on
the maximizing of efficiencies.

NEW YORK STATE LAW BARS MERCHANTS FROM
REQUIRING ADDRESSES ON CARD SALES SLIPS

     A new law that took effect last week in New York state,
reportedly the first of its kind in the nation, prohibits
merchants from requiring customers to put their address or
telephone number on sales slips when making purchases by credit
card.
     This controversial practice--along with that of recording
credit card numbers on personal checks when a purchase is made by
check--has been sharply criticized by consumer advocates, who
have maintained that merchants are exposing customers to
potential fraud and are violating their personal privacy (CN,
Oct. 30, 1989, p. 1).
     The state law will "address the unauthorized dissemination
of personal information," said Daniel Feldman, a state
assemblyman who sponsored the bill.  He also introduced
legislation last year that mandated carbonless credit card forms
in New York.
     While both the Visa and MasterCard associations appeared
uneasy over con-sumers being made to write their card number, its
expiration date and a phone number on checks, they have focused
more attention on ending the requirement by  merchants that a
cardholder's phone number be written on a credit card sales draft
in order to complete a card transaction.
     The Bankcard Holders of America (BHA), a Herndon, Va.-based
consumer education group, has urged the 2 bankcard associations
and the National Retail Merchants Association (NRMA), among
others, to clarify and enforce policies to bar the current check-
cashing policies of merchants.
     Visa and MasterCard spokesmen have said the associations
have a limited ability to take action in response to these check
acceptance procedures.  The bank card industry has rules in place
to protect itself against liability for the use of a credit card
to pay for returned checks.
     A number of merchants in the state were convincing customers
that their address and phone number were necessary to make credit
card purchases, Feldman  said, when the information actually was
being used to compile mailing lists.    One exception to the law
is that merchants who do not have the capability to verify a
customer's card electronically may still ask for a customer's
address or phone number.  The penalty for violations of the law
is $250.

CHASE TO ACQUIRE CARD PORTFOLIOS WITH COMBINED
OUTSTANDINGS OF $660 MILLION

     The Chase Manhattan Bank (USA), the Delaware affiliate of
Chase Manhattan Bank, will acquire the credit card portfolio of
Bank of Boston Corp. and its affiliate, Bank of Boston
Connecticut.  In addition, Chase has acquired the majority of the
credit card portfolio of Investors Savings Bank of Richmond, Va.
     The combined outstandings of the MasterCard and Visa
portfolios represent  $660 million.  The Bank of Boston portfolio
has $625 million in outstandings, and the outstanding balances of
Investors portfolio are approximately $35 million.
     Last year, Chase also purchased the portfolios of Michigan
National Bank, Meritor Financial Group of Philadelphia, and
Leader Federal Savings Bank in Memphis, Tenn.
     Bank of Boston, in a move similar to the response of other
New England institutions to the region's slumping real estate
market, said it would write off about $300 million in loans for
the final quarter of 1989 and set aside about $280 million for
other possible losses.  But the company predicted it would break
even in the fourth quarter and earn a $145 million profit for
1989, due in part to its decision to sell its credit card
business, which has 675,000 cardholders.
     Bank officials said the card business, while profitable,
would drain financial resources that the bank would rather put
toward marketing other consumer products such as home equity,
residential mortgages and education loans.
     The Investors portfolio includes approximately 40,000
MasterCard and Visa accounts.  The institution also has entered
into an agent bank agreement with Chase under which it will
continue to offer credit cards bearing the Investors name and
logo to its customers throughout Virginia.  In the future, the
accounts of Investors' existing card customers will be serviced
by Chase with no disruption in service.

*New Jersey Transit Corp., a commuter bus and
rail system, will allow commuters to use credit
cards to pay for tickets starting in the fall.  The
system already accepts Visa, MasterCard, and Dis-
cover cards at a number of agent sites and ticket
vending machines.  This project, which is being developed at
Nynex Information Solutions Group, will allow commuters at a
later point to have their accounts  debited for ticket purchases.
Nynex is linking all credit card ticketing operations, permitting
New Jersey Transit to cut costs by negotiating the lowest prices
from suppliers of credit authorization and settlement services.
New Jersey Transit is now discussing joint ticketing with the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the umbrella organization
for several New York-area mass transit operations.  The New York
City Transit Authority, the Metro North and the Long Island
Railroad commuter trains plan to offer ticket payment options
that would automatically debit bank accounts.

     *Telephone calls made by credit card at the 2 Philadelphia

     *Telephone calls made by credit card at the 2 Philadelphia
area airports will be among the options provided by MCI Mid-
Atlantic under a new major contract for public pay phone service.
     The 3-year, $10.5 million agreement, between the city of
Philadelphia and MCI Mid-Atlantic, will provide long-distance
service to pay phone customers at Philadelphia International and
Northeast Philadelphia Airports.  MCI will provide "0" plus
services to customers making collect, third-party, person-to-
person and credit card calls at any of the 550 pay phones at both
airports.  This development is part of the implementation of
equal access at public pay phones that was decreed by court order
for non-AT&T carriers.  The order, in a 1988 decision by U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene, covers calls made on cards as well
as other operator-assisted calls.  The national pay phone market
is estimated to be worth $2 billion a year.  "Pay phone premise
owners and managers--particularly high-volume users such as
municipalities, airports, hotels and such--can receive
substantial benefits through MCI now that the pay phone market is
a matter of choice," said George Taylor, president of MCI's Mid-
Atlantic Division which covers customers in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and the
District of Columbia.

AIR TRAVEL CARD ADDING INTERNATIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR WORLDWIDE
PHONE CALL CHARGES

     Air Travel Card and Executive TeleCard Ltd.
have announced an agreement to permit cardholders to  charge
international telephone calls on their Air Travel Card account.
This makes Air Travel Card and its licensee cards, "AirPlus" in
Europe and "Passage"  in the Far East, the first corporate travel
card to offer a worldwide telephone  charge system to its
members.
     Designed as a card product for executive travelers wanting
to make direct dial or operator-assisted international calls, Air
Travel Card enables members to have easy access to more than 60
countries where the system is in operation.  The services
provided by the Switzerland-based Executive TeleCard allow
telephone users to charge calls between countries outside the
United States.
     This umbrella agreement invites each of Air Travel Card's 30
issuing airlines to enter into separate contracts with Executive
TeleCard in the upcoming months.  A number of the issuing
airlines already have expressed an interest in this optional
service for their customers.
     "We are proud to offer this one-of-a-kind telephone charge
system and look forward to featuring it as one of Air Travel
Card's unique customer benefits,"  said Charles Fischer,
executive secretary for Air Travel Card.

  Card eliminates phoning obstacles

     The Executive TeleCard System, which can be accessed from
both private and public telephones worldwide, eliminates the many
problems often posed by language barriers, confusing instructions
and coin-operated pay phones, ex-plained Robert Roach, president
of Executive TeleCard.  It also avoids the surcharges that are
customarily applied by hotels.
     "The Air Travel Card customer is a perfect match to
Executive TeleCard's product line," Roach said.  "We are
enthusiastic about this agreement and look forward to providing
this added service to the more than 1.5 million users of
the Air Travel Card."
     Established in 1936 as a charge card--known then as
Universal Air Travel Card Plan--Air Travel Card is used by more
than 50% of the Fortune 500 companies.  It is sponsored by
members of the Air Transport Association of America and the
International Air Transport Association.
     The card is administered by the Air Travel Card Board of
Management currently composed of representatives from American
Airlines, Eastern Airlines,  Trans World Airlines, United
Airlines, British Airways, Lufthansa and Japan Airlines.  The
card is accepted by more than 200 affiliated airlines worldwide.
     The "AirPlus" card is issued by 9 European airlines, and
"Passage" is issued by Japan Airlines.  Both cards have other
usage beyond air travel.  (Air Travel Card, 1709 New York Ave.
NW, Washington, DC 20006, 202/626-4224.)

-RETAILERS MAY LEVY CREDIT CARD USERS

CARD SYSTEMS- RETAILERS MAY LEVY CREDIT CARD USERS
(C) 1994 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Netherlands: Following a move by the Dutch  Ministry
of Economic Affairs, Dutch retailers now have the
option of levying a surcharge on credit card
purchases or offering a discount to customers using
cash or other rival forms of payment. The ministry
said that the lifting of the ban on discrimination by
retailers between forms of payment, would affect
American Express, Eurocard, VSB International, part
of Dutch-Belgian Fortis and Diners Club Benelux.
Dutch shopkeepers currently pay around a five percent
commission to credit card companies.

The idea is to is to stimulate customers to use
cheaper forms of payment such as cash transactions
and automatic transfers.

The Netherlands' small businesses' federation, KNOV,
and consumer association, Consumentenbond, anticipate
that retailers will be able to curtail use of credit
cards through publicity campaigns and by refusing
this form of payment.  The hope is that credit card
issuers will reduce rates since credit cards will now
have to compete more openly with other payment
methods.

There are around three million credit card users in
the Netherlands(10 percent of the population)
accounting for DFl 6bn in turnover and 30 million
transactions a year. Retailers pay around DFl 300m a
year in commissions.

It is interesting to note that similar moves which
were brought into force in the UK some years ago have
had little impact and few retailers seem to have
taken up the option of charging for card transactions
or offering discounts for cash.

CARD SYSTEMS- SPECIAL SCREEN PHONES FOR HOME BANKING
TRIAL
(C) 1994 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

USA: Visa International, Crestar Bank and US Order
have signed an agreement to pilot screen phone
technology for home banking, shopping, and
information services. The program began this month
and will run approximately one year.  About 400
Crestar customers from the greater Washington, D.C.,
metropolitan area who hold a Crestar Premier
MoneyCard (a Visa check card) will participate.
Users will require a special telephone with a display
screen and magnetic stripe card reader. To use the
system, a card is first swiped through the reader and
the user enters a PIN to gain access to the system.
Consumers participating in the test will use leased
US Order ScanFones containing specialized bill
payment software.  The software supports bill
payment, reads the Crestar/Visa card information,
encrypts the PIN, and transmits the bill pay session
to US Order for processing.  VisaNet is used to
obtain PIN verification from Crestar Bank, as well as
to route the payment request to Crestar for
authorization on the payment date specified by the
consumer. Finally, US Order sends the consumer's
payment directly to the biller, using the US Order
BankPlus host bill processing system.

EBT'S NATIONAL QUEST:  Negotiations are under way to create the first

EBT'S NATIONAL QUEST:  Negotiations are under way to create the first
national electronic benefits transfer network.  The electronic benefits
council of the National Automated Clearing House Association is negotiating
with the board of directors of the Quest shared regional EFT network to use
the Quest logo as a national mark for EBT cards, CardFax has learned.  The
council will use the mark to let benefit recipients know where they can use
their cards.  The council, which was formed last year to create a national set
of EBT operating rules, adopted a set of standards in principle last month
(CardFax 12/19).  "If you start from scratch, there's a lot of paperwork and
forms you must fill out in developing a logo.  We can avoid that by buying an
existing logo," Helena Sims, senior director of the council, tells CardFax.
The council hopes to complete the negotiations within several weeks, Sims
says.  The logo would be purchased with funds collected from member dues.
Terms of the deal, including what the council will pay to use the Quest logo,
were not revealed.



The Kentucky-based Quest EFT network dissolved in July 1995 after its member
institutions migrated to the Delaware-based MAC regional EFT network.  The
network-which exists in name only-is owned by Transaction Services Co.  Equity
owners of Transaction Services include Transfinancial Bank, PNC Bank of
Kentucky, National City Bank of Kentucky, Owensboro National Bank, Bank of
Louisville, Bank One Kentucky and Bank One Lexington.  "We don't want the
Quest mark to be used in a bank-owned ATM environment, but we may consider
using the mark on EBT cards," Al Metzler, Bank One Kentucky senior vice
president and chairman of the Quest board, tells CardFax.

PROFIT PICTURE:  Competition and higher funding costs pulled credit card

PROFIT PICTURE:  Competition and higher funding costs pulled credit card
profits down in 1995, Robert K.  Hammer, chairman of R.K.  Hammer Investment
Bankers, estimates.  Hammer says general-purpose cards had a 3.60% pre-tax
return on assets and a 2.16% after-tax return last year, down 30 basis points
(0.3 percentage points) from 1994's returns.  Balance-transfer competition
coupled with a 40-basis-point increase in the average cost of funds to 6.1%,
caused the profit decline.  Estimates are based on interviews with card
issuers, processors and analysts.

INQUIRING FINES:  In February, First Fidelity Bancorp will begin to charge
consumers 75 cents for balance inquiries made with tellers and 50 cents for
inquiries made through its toll-free number if their accounts fall below
minimum-balance requirements, CardFax has learned.  Customers still will
receive two free teller inquiries and two free remote inquiries every month.
The fees are an attempt to migrate excess branch inquiries to ATMs.  First
Fidelity has 715 ATMs.

WARNING SIGNS:  Nearly 17% of disposable income now goes to pay mortgage

WARNING SIGNS:  Nearly 17% of disposable income now goes to pay mortgage and
consumer debt, including credit cards, reports Alison Emmerich, associate
director at Standard & Poor's Corp., which rates credit card-backed
securities.  That level is approaching the earlier high of about 18% in 1989.
"It's certainly not up to its peak, but it is moving up, and that's a cause
for concern," Emmerich tells CardFax.

RATE REFORM:  The MAC regional electronic funds transfer network has narrowed
the gap in interchange rates within the 30-state network.  Depending on each
market, interchange on a cash withdrawal will vary from 32 cents to 38 cents,
compared to the previous rate of 30 cents to 40 cents.  The ultimate goal is
to have a single rate throughout the network, Phillip Valvardi, network
director, tells CardFax.

STAND TO GAIN:  Executives with card issuers gained more than their
counterparts at card-support companies (CardFax 12/26), but a trend toward
option-based and at-risk bonuses obscures the actual compensation some execs
stand to realize.  Capital One Financial Corp.  Chairman and CEO Richard D.
Fairbank and President and Chief Operating Officer Nigel W.  Morris could
together garner $52 million if the company's stock hits $50 a share.  Options
granted to First Data Corp.  Chairman Henry C.  Duques had a net gain of more
than $8.4 million in less than six months.

ROOM FOR GROWTH:  Two-thirds of major credit card issuers believe economic

in 1996 than mergers or acquisitions, reports a survey of 50 issuers by
executive search firm Allard Associates.  Of those surveyed, approximately 33%
anticipate modest growth in 1996, 58% expect moderate growth, and 9%
anticipate explosive growth.

SOBRIETY:  While the credit card business has been robust in the past three

SOBRIETY:  While the credit card business has been robust in the past three
years, some card executives predict the party will soon take on a somber tone,
prompted partly by intense competition that has resulted in declining response
rates to solicitations.  "We think 1996 will be another difficult year because
the card has become a commodity," says James J.  Ahearn, president of
Boatmen's Credit Card Bank.  While Ahearn predicts receivables could grow as
much as 20% industry wide, he says much of that increase may come from
convenience users who don't pay interest.

GOOD, BAD AND UGLY:  A survey by First Manhattan Consulting Group reports
that the typical bank makes money on 30% of its customers, breaks even on 20%,
and loses money on the remaining 50%.  The survey also shows only 2% of
consumers never visit a branch.  "Very few consumers are really self-service
oriented," says Seamus McMahon, First Manhattan's managing vice president, who
adds that the results show the importance of banks freeing up resources from
unprofitable channels to focus on retaining their most desirable customers.

CHIPS ON DEMAND:  Smart cards won't be an everyday item in the U.S.  until at
least 1998, James J.  Farrell III, advertising manager for Motorola Inc.'s
CSIC Microcontroller division, tells CardFax.  Farrell says he expects smart
card trial programs to be launched in 1996, followed by rollouts in 1997.
Motorola, the world's leading supplier of microchips for smart cards, will be
able to produce 10 million microchips per week by 2000, he says.  Motorola is
doubling the size of its smart card factory in East Kilbride, Scotland, to
meet demand and is laying the groundwork for similar factories in Britain and
the U.S.

SALES PITCH:  A key selling point of commercial on-line networks for credit

SALES PITCH:  A key selling point of commercial on-line networks for credit
card issuers is that on-line networks are marketing themselves aggressively to
consumers.  America Online, for example, has launched a television advertising
campaign.  "No one is selling the Internet; users must decide for themselves
to log onto it," explains Tim Kemp, manager of emerging technology for First
Chicago Corp.  "On-line networks have their own sales force."  As the
popularity of on-line networks increases, issuers are likely to establish a
presence on more than one network, card experts say.

a net increase in interchange to surpass rebate costs," Topper explains.

EXCLUSIVE:  AMEX TESTS SMART CARD

AMERICAN EXPRESS is testing a multiple application chip-based card in
its New York City headquarters, sources have told CI.

The pilot, which began in late December, has processed the first
chip-based credit card transactions in the US. Unlike the card
associations, which are pushing stored-value applications, American
Express has installed T&E (green or gold card), Optima and corporate
accounts on one card. Future applications might include electronic
purse and loyalty programmes, according to a source familiar with the
programme.

The microprocessor chip cards are produced by Solaic, a division of
French-based Group Sligos, and smart card terminals will be provided by
US manufacturer VeriFone and French producer Dassault Electronique.

During the pilot, about 30 to 100 cards are being tested by employees.
At the point of sale, a consumer inserts his/her card into a reader/pin
pad, enters a personal code and selects to which account the purchase
will be billed. American Express' back office has already certified the
VeriFone Omni460 base terminal and the SC450 smart card peripheral.

The card is accepted at the company cafeteria but the test will be
expanded to include other sites within the World Financial Center, a
source said. A table-service restaurant at headquarters will also test
portable terminals manufactured by Dassault.

American Express confirmed that since before Christmas, it has been
operating a small employee test of a multi-application smart credit and
charge card. Fewer than 50 cards were involved, she said, emphasising
that it was not a significant event in the opinion of the company.

American Express has taken a leadership position within the Smart Card
Forum, a US-based multi-industry group set up to advocate the
development of smart card systems. Robert Wesley, who is head of
international smart card business development at Amex, is a member of
the Forum's executive board and head of the travel and entertainment
subcommittee.

Internally, smart cards comprise one section of an advanced payments
group which also oversees ExpressNet, an on-line service which appears
on America Online, a private online computer network.

Another key Amex executive, David Boyles, is head of the prepaid card
subcommittee in addition to leading information technology efforts at
the company's Utah-based Stored Value division, formerly known as the
Travelers Cheque group.

In addition, Boyles' group has internally posted several job openings
for the Salt Lake City site, suggesting the division is preparing for
additional work and that smart card efforts may be consolidated in
Utah. The Stored Value group oversees travellers cheques, Amex Special
Teams, which install purse card systems on college campuses, and Amex
Telecom, which is getting into the prepaid phone card business.

In related news, American Express has secured the co-operation of
MasterCard for terminal interoperability. At a CardTech/SecureTech
regional trade show in San Jose, California, officials from American
Express and MasterCard processed smart card transactions using their
respective cards on a common terminal.

American Express has been eager to be included in the payment system
specification work carried on by Europay International, MasterCard
International and Visa International. The demonstration paves the way
for all bank and Amex smart cards to be processed on one terminal,
satisfying a key demand of the merchant community.

ASIA-PACIFIC:  PYNE RESIGNS AS VISA HEAD

IN A SHOCK announcement, Visa International has revealed that its
president for the Asia-Pacific region, Lindsay Pyne, has resigned.

It is understood that Pyne will leave Visa some time in June. He will
stay on in his current position until the appointment of the new
president for the Asia-Pacific region.

While Visa has said Pyne is leaving "to pursue other business
interests", industry sources have said there have been rumours
circulating for two to three weeks that he had been approached by a
recruitment firm representing an international insurance organisation
operating in the region.

Pyne's resignation comes after having spent just two years at Visa
Asia-Pacific. He was earlier involved in spearheading a major
reorganisation of the Bank of New Zealand. Observers said the
resignation of Visa's most senior executive in Asia could not have come
at a worse time, as MasterCard is perceived to be gaining market share.

Also, sceptics said that for Pyne to leave when Visa is still in the
development stages of a number of important initiatives should concern
members over the long-term direction of the card association. One
source said: "It is a shame to come at a time when members are looking
for stability from the association. There is no continuity with people
resigning, we are not able to follow through with initiatives we are
planning with Visa."

Other member institutions were surprised at the news. Many had not
expected the resignation One banker commented:"They have been going
through a lot of turbulence over the past year. There has been a spate
of senior executive turnover."

PHILIPPINES TARGETED FOR CARD GROWTH

TWO PLAYERS have entered the Philippine cards market in the last year,
confirming predictions that the market is ripe for expansion.

According to the president of the Credit Card Association of the
Philippines, Dennis Legaspi, the country now has a total of 12 players
and the market has grown by 60 percent to 70 percent in the last 12
months to reach 1.5 million cards in force.

In terms of billings, growth in the past year was estimated to be in
the order of 30 percent to 40 percent. Observers are predicting that
growth rates will continue in the 50 percent range in 1996.

LandBank Visa card

One of the new players in the market, LandBank of the Philippines,
recently introduced its first credit card, the LandBank Visa card on
November 13.

To make the card more accessible to prospective cardholders, the income
requirement for the card is P120,000 ($4,600), as compared to the
industry standard of P200,000. Explaining the rationale behind this
strategy, Felicitas Mozo-Dimaano who heads LandBank's card business,
said that there is a large well of "cardable people" who can be tapped.

The LandBank Visa card entitles cardholders to savings on utility bills
when they use the card. In terms of settlement of their outstanding
accounts, special payment features allow cardholders to opt for
payments for costly items worth over P2,000 to be made in three-monthly
increments, up to 24 months.

In addition, a payment scheme known as Lite Payment Option, allows
cardholders to make partial payment of their account of at least 10
percent of their monthly purchases and cash advances. Cardholders can
also withdraw up to P20,000 a day from the bank's ATMs and ATMs from
the Megalink-run network.

PVB Visa card

The Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB), one of the Philippines' newest
banks, has also entered the credit card issuing business. An agreement
with Equitable Credit Card Network, an affiliate of Equitable Banking,
has allowed the bank to issue a Visa card by using the former's card
processing capabilities in its card issuing business.

PVB, a private commercial bank owned by 500,000 World War Two veterans,
started operations in August 1992. It issues the Classic and the
Veteran Gold Card, catering to both the middle and upscale markets.

Existing players

As competition increases, some of the more established players are
looking to consolidate their positions by introducing new products or
enhancing existing ones. Bank of the Philippine Islands, one of the top
five issuers, is to roll out the BPI MasterCard later this month.

As for its standard Burgundy card, this will receive a revamp and will
be relaunched to carry a longer repayment period, and a lower minimum
payment of 5 percent of monthly balances. In addition, the bank will
continue to run its successful"Frequent User, Sure Winner" bonus
point/incentive programme until mid-1996.

Citibank, which has 300,000 cards in issue, is banking on its enhanced
customer service to keep its top position in the market. The bank,
which claimed to have achieved a 91 percent score in terms of overall
satisfaction of its customers, has recently introduced the 24-hour
Citicard Banking Center which offers a wide range of banking and credit
card transactions.

Meanwhile, the Far East Bank and Trust Company introduced a new
instalment plan for holders of the FarEastCard. The low interest plan
offers cardholders an instalment limit equivalent to three times their
regular credit limit, up to a maximum of P150,000. In addition, the
bank will waive interest on the first instalment payment.

SINGAPORE BILLINGS HIT ALL-TIME HIGH

DESPITE THE fact that Singapore's retail sector is still in the
doldrums, MasterCard International has just released statistics showing
that billings on MasterCard-branded credit cards during the 1995
pre-Christmas season rose 14 percent from the same period in 1994,
reaching an all-time high of S$34.25 million ($24 million).

The MasterCard-sponsored survey shows transaction figures in all retail
sectors from December 10 through December 23. Statistics also indicated
that mail-order purchases registered a corresponding increase, but at a
faster pace of 82.7 percent, reaching S$409,000.

The international card association said that its analysis of a number
of sectors, including travel and entertainment, retail and services
which comprised health care, education, etc, showed that card spending
on all sectors experienced year-on-year growth in 1995.

The fastest growth was recorded by the service sector which grew by 31
percent, growing from S$3 million in 1994 to S$3.9 million in 1995.
Trailing behind were the travel and entertainment and retail sectors
which grew by 13 percent and 12 percent respectively.

Overall T&E spending in 1994 was S$9.3 million, which jumped to S$10
million in 1995. The retail sector grew from S$17.3 million in 1994 to
S$19.4 million in 1995.

A breakdown of the retail and services sectors showed that growth was
helped by increases in hardware purchases and spending on education
which expanded dramatically by 127 percent and 190 percent
respectively.

GERMANY:  BAHNCARD MISSES TARGET

A SURVEY conducted by German business newspaper Handelsblatt suggests
that Germany's largest co-branding deal between Citibank and Deutsche
Bahn has failed to reach its targets. According to the survey, only 20
percent of the 3 million Bahncard holders have opted for the payment
function which has been on offer since last July.

It is three years since Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national railways
operator, introduced the Bahncard, which costs DM220 ($153) and offers
half-price travel for a year.

The product quickly attracted a customer base of more than 3 million
and so impressed the banks that they competed vigorously to provide a
payment function: Citibank was finally selected as the Bahn's
co-branding partner and agreed to offer either a Visa or an Electron
chip at no additional charge.

Citibank acknowledged from the start of the marketing campaign last
July that the deal would be profitable only if cross-selling activities
were successful. Since revolving credit is scarcely used, and there is
no annual fee for the card, Citibank had no prospects of generating
adequate revenue from the card itself.

The bank estimated that 50 percent of existing Bahncard holders would
opt for either Electron or Visa functions and that 1.5 million to 2
million new customers would be won. But Handelsblatt's survey indicates
that the past six months have fallen far short of those goals.

Citibank is refusing to comment on the Handelsblatt survey and also
declines to produce its own figures on the "improved" Bahncard, arguing
that the marketing campaign got off to a slow start. Deutsche Bahn
commented that the marketing figures could not be analysed properly
until the product had been on the market for 12 months.

The marketing campaign hit problems from the start. Citibank signed the
deal with Deutsche Bahn on the assumption that all cards would
automatically carry either the Electron or the Visa function. But after
protests from consumer groups, Citibank said the payment option would
be provided only if customers expressly asked for them.

GERMANY:  GZS SIGNS DEAL WITH VISA

THE TRADITIONAL division between Visa and the German banking community
has ended. Visa has been awarded processing rights to Gesellschaft fur
Zahlungssysteme (GZS), the Eurocard/MasterCard processing centre in
Germany.

In return, processing houses in the Visa camp, such as B+S
Kartenservice may process Eurocard/MasterCard payments, although this
was previously the sole preserve of the GZS.

The deal is regarded as a triumph for the GZS, which recognised some
time ago that it would in future have to compete with its member banks
and their affiliates for card processing work. The bank-owned
organisation responded by investing in new processing systems - and
applying for a Visa processing licence.

Traditionally, most German banks issued Eurocard/MasterCard cards only,
while Visa issuers such as BfG Bank and Berliner Bank were very much
the exception. But now a number of institutions are offering both
Eurocard/MasterCard and Visa. For the processing houses, this is a
chance to win the processing contracts for both Visa and
Eurocard/MasterCard, but also carries the risk of losing existing
business.

The Visa deal is effectively an admission by the GZS that it is now
competing with its own member banks for processing contracts and can no
longer afford to exist on Eurocard/MasterCard business alone.

In recent months most large banking groups have established some sort
of processing capability and, as a result, some savings banks
(Sparkassen) are reported to have cancelled their processing agreements
with GZS altogether.

But the GZS believes the capability to process both Visa and Eurocard
payments will be crucial in future."Dual processing capability will be
a benchmark for measuring the success or failure of card processing
houses," a statement said.

SOUTH AFRICA:  CLICKS ROLLS OUT FIRST NATIONAL LOYALTY CARD

SOUTH AFRICA'S health and beauty store, Clicks, plans to extend use of
its loyalty Clubcard from the Western Cape to the Northern Province at
the end of March. It then plans to take it to national roll-out in July
to be available in all 160 of its stores.

According to Ingrid Bosman, direct marketing manager for the Clicks
Clubcard, the card is "South Africa's first true loyalty card". Before
the launch, Click's management researched the success of direct loyalty
cards in the UK, France, Spain and the US.

Since August 31 1995, 200,000 cards have been given free to customers
and it is expected that this figure will rise to 400,000-600,000 later
this year.

"Customers can't use the card for payments, it's purely for collecting
points," Bosman said. One point is given for every R5 ($1.40) spent
with a minimum of a R10 spend. After three months, if the customer has
collected 50 points, then discounts may be given from 5 percent off
cosmetics and jewellery to 2 percent off all other purchases.

"The discounts are the direct benefit to customers after three months,"
Bosman said. Other advantages include cardholders receiving the Clicks
Christmas catalogue before general release, information on special
sales and promotions and new product launches.

South African retailer Dions had a similar loyalty store card a few
years ago but this was discontinued."In South Africa there are a lot of
private label credit cards and some of them are incurring debt, so we
didn't want this problem. We want to use the card as a marketing tool
and not be bogged down with maintenance," Bosman said.

Interested customers can fill out their enrolment forms in-store where
they are given a card number for immediate use. The card is then put
through the cashier's till when paying for purchases and the card
number is linked to that sale. The card supplier to Clicks is BN Card
Technologies of Johannesburg.

TURKEY THIRD COUNTRY TO OFFER SIGNIA

TURKEY HAS become the third country in Europe after the UK and
Switzerland to offer Europay's exclusive Signia card. It will initially
be offered to selected customers of Garanti Bank and Yapi Kredi with
three other Turkish banks coming on stream later this year.

According to Derya Goknar, Europay's operations manager for East
Europe, "as time passed it became more difficult to differentiate
between Gold and Classic cardholders. So we thought we would recreate
the distinction with the Signia card. We believe that in the next three
years, 3,000 Signia cards will be issued."

Europay already has 400,000 MasterCard cards in Turkey of which 55,000
are Gold cards. It also has 2 million Cirrus/Maestro cards issued by
its 22 member banks.

"Signia is not just a card product but is being positioned as a private
banking product," Mehmet Sezgin, Europay's regional business manager
for Turkey, told CI. He added that about five Turkish banks are
actively researching ways to offer private banking to their selected
clients. "Signia is the first product offered by those banks wanting to
get into private banking and as such is the first product of its kind
on the Turkish market," Sezgin said.

A minimum credit limit of $50,000 is required in order to become a
cardholder and each application must be approved by the bank's board of
directors.

"Our market research in the last year-and-a-half gave a positive
outcome. Yes, there is a market for the Signia card. The packaging
around Gold cards has not been successful and this has been eroding the
higher market segment for Visa and MasterCard," Sezgin added. He
maintained that Eurocard/MasterCard cards have a transaction value 35
percent higher than on Visa cards.

It is expected that the annual fee will be set at $500 with an interest
rate of 16 percent monthly. Inflation in Turkey is currently running at
higher than 100 percent.

TARGA'S EARLY SUCCESS IN ITALY

TARGA, THE co-branded Fiat card issued by Instituto San Paolo di Torino
is surpassing targets, according to preliminary results. The
Eurocard-branded card is said to be generating three times as many
sales as other credit cards.

The card was launched in March 1995 and allows cardholders to
accumulate points which can be redeemed against the purchase of a Fiat
car or other services, such as Lufthansa flights.

Roberto Culasso, product manager responsible for the Targa card at San
Paolo di Torino, said: "The product was the idea of Europay and was
inspired by the General Motors card. It has proved highly suited to the
Italian market.

"The average annual expenditure on the Targa card was running at L2.5
million ($1,500) and L3 million. At the end of last year, we estimated
that average spending on the Targa card was L7 million to L8 million.
The definitive figure will not be available until March this year, but
I would not be surprised if it was higher than our current estimates,"
Culasso said.

Meanwhile, the number of Targa cards in issue passed the 100,000 mark
and additional partners are expected to join the points scheme,
bringing the figure to about ten.

Europay International pointed to the success of the card to illustrate
the wisdom of its decision to work with the Italian banks."Targa
typifies Europay's approach in Italy, where we are to committed to
working closely with the banks. We feel this is more effective than
merely promoting our brand," said Gaetano Carboni, senior area manager
in Southern Europe for Europay.

Recent figures from Europay show that the Italian market is finally
showing signs of growth. Transaction volume for credit and debit cards
in the Europay stable increased by 21 percent in 1995, while the number
of payments went up by 31 percent.

The number of Europay products increased by 15 percent last year, with
the number of debit cards rising to 3.6 million and credit cards going
to 754,000.

Visa, however, continues to dominate the market, with 4.7 million debit
and credit cards in circulation and transaction volume of $7 billion.

FRANCE:  CARTE BLEUE REDESIGNS CARD

THE NATIONAL Carte Bleue card is to take on a new look, giving the bank
logo more prominence. Its logo is to appear as it does on the
International Carte Bleue Visa card (at the bottom, on the right, just
above the hologram).

The new design is an integral part of the Groupement Carte Bleue
strategy designed to relaunch the Carte Bleue brand in synergy with the
print advertising campaign launched last autumn in national magazines
(See CI 142).

The redesigning of the domestic-only Carte Bleue card appears as one of
the major plans in support of the Groupement Carte Bleue's press
advertising campaign in the national magazines, said the company. In
fact, the overall design of the cards belonging to the Carte Bleue
range has to follow a certain logic and be coherent with the clearly
defined brand policy, it added.

In addition to the appearance of the Carte Bleue logo on the front of
the card and to the increased amount of space available for bank
branding, the other components of the changed design are as follows:

- the horizontal hologram in the middle of the card is to become a
square hologram in the right-hand column, as on international cards,
with the original design: this new hologram will appear on all French
bank cards designed for domestic use;

- the CB logo, symbol of interoperability and of acceptance among
French retailers, will occupy the space at the top, on the right, above
the hologram.

Jean-Marc Bornet, chief executive of Groupement Carte Bleue, told CI:
"This change in the visual aspect of the Carte Bleue Nationale (a
product already in use among nearly 5 million customers), is part of
the Groupement's long-term policy of concentrating the range of cards
on the Carte Bleue brand, which is greatly appreciated by French
people.

"This focusing on Carte Bleue as well as the greatly increased
co-operation with Visa are the two poles of a policy designed to
improve the Carte Bleue members' profits through the increase in the
value of their products".

HOUSEHOLD, WAGONLIT CO-BRAND

HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL is to co-brand corporate T&E cards with Carlson
Wagonlit Travel, the second-largest travel agency in the world, in a
partnership that targets a market dominated by American Express.

Household Bank is well known as the seventh-largest bank card issuer
and a leader in co-branding, such as the GM and Pacific Bell card
programmes. It has also become one of the leading issuers of MasterCard
corporate cards in the US with 127,000 cards.

The Illinois-based finance company initiated corporate card programmes
for its co-branding partners, including General Motors and two of its
subsidiaries, Electronic Data Services and Hughes Corporation.
Household also issues cards for Ameritech, Palomar Products, and for
itself.

As part of the exclusive partnership, Carlson will market its cards to
multinational corporations based in the US starting this quarter, to
European countries in the second quarter and in Asia and elsewhere in
1997. Household Limited, a credit card bank in the UK, gives the
company a foothold in Europe. Carlson Wagonlit operates the Carlson
Travel Network, AT Mays in the UK and Viajes Ecuador in Spain.

The Household deal is also a victory at the expense of First Bank
Systems, which was Carlson's co-brand partner from 1993. That
relationship ended in December. First Bank remains the leader among
bank T&E card issuers with 575,000 commercial cards and 250,000
purchasing cards branded by Visa. American Express, however, dominates
the commercial T&E market with more than 7 million cards.

Carlson Wagonlit, which is based in Minneapolis and Paris reported $12
billion in sales last year with 4,000 locations in 125 countries. The
agency will contribute its extensive corporate client list and its
travel service.

A Household spokesman said the companies had created a fully integrated
reporting package that goes beyond turnkey software provided by
MasterCard.

Co-branded corporate cards are a rarity, since T&E cards do not earn
interest income from revolvers and so do not generate the same profit
dynamics as consumer credit cards.

Wells Fargo Bank and Cincinnati-based Star Bank last year introduced
commercial cards with travel rewards built in, but neither involved a
leading player such as Carlson.

UNITED STATES:  CITI TESTS UNBRANDED CARD

CITIBANK, THE world's largest bank card issuer, has broken with
tradition by launching a non-Citibank-branded card, under the banner of
"CBSD". This stands for Citibank South Dakota, one of the New York City
money centre's issuing banks.

Citibank has solicited customers with an unbranded Visa gold card that
makes no mention of the bank, with the exception of some fine print
among the terms and conditions.   The offer represents a major shift in
strategy for a bank that has heavily promoted its name for years. But a
bank spokeswoman denied that Citibank was changing its long-term
strategy of promoting the bank brand.

"It's not a strategy but rather a test to reaffirm how important the
brand is. We do things like this to gauge customer reactions," she
said. The bank regards the test as being no different than offering
different combinations of fee, service and interest rates to different
customers.

In 1986, Citibank purchased the Choice card programme which featured a
rate lower than the standard Citibank Visa card but without any extra
benefits. It was offered to customers with exceptional credit records
in the era shortly before the upsurge in competition.

The CBSD card offered a 4.9 percent teaser rate for six months, no
annual fee and up to $15,000 credit limit. The rate increased to 5.4
percent above prime.

In recent months, Citibank has invested more heavily in its cards
business, which began growing in the latter half of 1995 after several
years of stagnation. It has also been promoting its name in new ways,
dropping its familiar Citibank Visa advertisements in favour of the
bank name alone.

MARINE MIDLAND EXPANDS ADVANTAGE PROGRAMME

IN AN EFFORT to keep its most profitable customers, Marine Midland Bank
has launched a rewards programme, called MarineAdvantage.

Midland Marine, a Buffalo, New York-based subsidiary of HSBC Holdings,
introduced the loyalty programme this month. It plans to solicit the
remainder of its portfolio by offering the same value-added rewards
programme for a fee.

The result is a seven-tier rewards scheme whereby cardholders can
redeem points accumulated through charge activity. The programme, which
features rewards offered by retail, travel and dining partners, mirrors
one offered by its UK-based parent Midland Bank.

Peter Davidson, executive vice president and head of consumer banking
at Marine Midland said it is essential to retain lucrative customers
already on the books. "The approach we take in customer management is
one of determining who our most profitable customers are and
determining what it is that attracts those people," he said.

Marine Midland divides its portfolio into four categories of revenue
generation: highly profitable; moderately profitable; marginally
profitable, or those which cover variable costs; and the unprofitable,
which do not cover fixed or variable costs.

Davidson said Marine Midland is looking to "put a wall up" around its
core customers. "In most cases, 20 percent of the portfolio generates
100 percent of the profits," he said. Those accounts that are marginal
or unprofitable should be charged fees or higher rates to either make
them more profitable or encourage the customers to close their account.

Because of the fierce competition in the market, it may be very costly
to replace one good customer. "If you have a highly profitable
customer, that customer may generate upwards of $300, $400 or $500 a
year for the bank. To lose one of those, you might need ten average
customers. If you could spend on an existing account what you would on
a new account, then that is well worth your while."

The MarineAdvantage programme also addresses the attrition of
value-conscious customers, those who have been lured away by co-branded
schemes. "We already addressed the needs of price conscious and service
conscious customers," he said.

Marine Midland consumer research found cardholders preferred fun or
out-of-the-ordinary rewards, and rewards that are attainable sooner
rather than later. This self-branded programme is administered by
Maritz of Missouri, a third party that developed card-based employee
incentive programmes.

Davidson also said Marine Midland will test ways of getting rid of
unprofitable customers in the second quarter of this year. "One
approach is to price them, to the point where they accept the terms or
leave - a $50, $75 or $100 fee," he said.

All of this suggests that Marine Midland, too, hopes to tap into the
booming credit card business. The bank is just starting to make a dent
in the marketplace, growing its loans by $300 million last year to $1.8
billion in receivables, placing it among the 30 largest US portfolios.
"We see cards as a very profitable product, when managed properly, and
we feel it is still a growth business, what with the new uses that are
coming about."

Still, Davidson acknowledged several danger signs that have emerged at
the end of 1995: a dip in consumer confidence and a slight rise in
personal bankruptcies and charge-off rates."It may be time to be a
little cautious and concentrate on finding the best customers that are
out there in the marketplace, given signs that the economy perhaps is
softening a little bit. I don't think there are any disasters out there
yet, but it's a good time to be prudent."

CITIBANK FORD CARD REACHES 4.4 MILLION TARGET

CITIBANK'S FORD credit card programme, usually in the shadow of its
more successful rival issued by Household Bank/General Motors, is
finally coming into its own.

According to annual surveys conducted by Brittain Associates, a
marketing consultancy based in Atlanta, Ford's rebate and marketing
partner strategies are having the desired effect, with the number of
cards reaching 4.4 million, an increase of 350,000 accounts since 1994.

Both Texaco petrol and Hertz Rental Car sales have enjoyed increased
sales as a result of Ford Citibank cardholders seeking to build up
rebate points faster.

The study is good news to card issuers, since it shows that allied
marketing partners do benefit from their association with card
programmes while at the same time they add value to the programme. "By
all appearances, it's a win-win-win situation for Ford, Citibank and
their marketing partners," said Bruce Brittain, president of the
consultancy.

"We have seen a net 7 percent growth in the number of accounts in the
past 12 months and evidence that their revolvers are carrying larger
balances. These are healthy signs for the portfolio," Brittain said.

In a separate survey, Brittain also noted that American Express' Optima
True Grace has grown 45 percent since April or an additional 500,000
accounts. The study suggested that American Express is reaching a
younger, less affluent segment than its traditional business.

Meanwhile, the quietly successful General Electric Rewards card may
have declined as much as 20 percent in the same six month period.
Brittain says that once again, changes to the card's rebate schemes
trigger cardholder behaviour. In this case, rebates were remitted as an
annual cheque starting July 1995, rather than coupons to be used with
marketing partners. If a programme change is to blame, Brittain
explained, then he expects the portfolio numbers to rebound in the
coming months.

Petrol rebate cards continue to perform well. Chemical Bank's Shell Oil
card enjoyed a 15 percent increase in accounts in the last nine months.
Virtually all of the accounts are new to Chemical's portfolio (soon to
be called Chase Manhattan) and two-thirds were already Shell
proprietary customers who were converted.

According to the survey, the GE Exxon card has only attracted 250,000
cards in its first year, a quarter of the size of the Shell programme
after the same duration. Brittain found that Exxon, unlike Shell, did
not market the card to its entire proprietary portfolio.

SPONSORSHIPS YIELD RICH HARVEST

Credit card companies have joined brewers and cigarette makers as some
of the most active sponsors of sporting and entertainment events in the
world. Joseph A Giannone reports

WITH ADVERTISING and other marketing channels growing increasingly
cluttered, credit card issuers and organisations are seeking to
increase their profile through sponsorship of major events. Sporting
events are being selected to market cards and the brands as well as tap
into some of the enthusiasm fans have for their sports.

Exclusivity does not come cheap, however. According to IEG Sponsorship
Report, a newsletter covering the sponsorship trade, Visa International
spent between $30 million and $35 million on sponsorship rights on the
National Football League, the Elton John tour and some destination
deals.

MasterCard is spending $10 million to $15 million towards the soccer
World Cup in 1998, the National Hockey League and several golf
competitions. MasterCard and its members spent a combined $75 million
in relation to World Cup 1994.

Card sponsorships took off in 1984 when American Express was a leading
sponsor to the Olympics, according to Jim Andrews of IEG, a consultancy
specialising in sponsorships. But in 1988 Visa took over lead
sponsorship and has subsequently generated great success by exploiting
its exclusive sponsorship rights.

Sponsorship activity grew heated this year, as the two associations and
American Express each landed one among three major sports leagues. In
April 1995, Visa announced its deal with the National Football League
with an estimated value of $50 million over five years. Visa this
summer created tie-ins as the official card of Triple Crown horse
racing.

American Express in May signed on with the National Basketball League,
paying $30 million for three years. It also signed a sponsorship deal
with the Dallas Cowboys football club to be the official card of Texas
Stadium, though Visa has rights bestowed by the league.

The most recent industry deal was scored by MasterCard in December with
a four-year, $2 million exclusive deal with the National Hockey League.
MasterCard is touting its gold cards at several title golf tournaments,
such as the PGA Grand Slam and the Colonial.

Likewise, the NHL hockey and NASCAR automobile racing circuit will be
used to promote standard cards. Three more golf title sponsorships are
pending, a MasterCard spokeswoman said.

Visa and MasterCard continued their worldwide sponsorship commitments.
Visa paid $40 million for the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.

MasterCard seized on World Cup soccer as a global marketing platform.
It paid $10 million to sponsor the 1998 championships in France,
according to IEG. A four-year package of associated sponsorships
leading up to the games is worth $40 million.

Credit card groups are not alone in seizing on sponsorship as a new way
of doing business, according to Jim Andrews, an IEG vice president.
Sponsorship spending will top $5.4 billion in the US next year, 15
percent more than the $4.7 billion projected to be spent in 1995.

Sponsorships have become popular as a rallying point for everything a
company does. For MasterCard and Visa, the World Cup and Olympics have
formed the cornerstone promotions used by members as well as the
associations.

"In sponsorships, it's not just what you have, it's what you do with
it," said Mava Heffler, MasterCard senior vice president in charge of
sponsorships. MasterCard, she said, has expanded its soccer sponsorship
to include a broadcast television soccer report and markets the brand
as host of smaller events leading up to the World Cup championships.

"The current level of activity can be traced to the Olympics, in terms
of what it has done for sponsors in a number of ways. Companies have
found that whenever they ran promotions to make donations to the teams,
their usage went up," Andrews said.

The big winner in all of this, though, may be Delaware-based MBNA
America, the second-largest bank card issuer in the US and king of
affinity credit cards. At the same time as Visa secured the NFL spot,
MBNA was chosen as the issuer for 30 professional football franchises.
Likewise, MBNA has been tapped by MasterCard to issue cards for all 26
hockey teams.

ADVANTA LOOKS AT GLOBAL EXPANSION

Advanta Corporation, one of the fastest growing credit card issuers in
the US, is getting serious about reproducing its success in other
countries. Joseph A Giannone reports

ADVANTA IS joining the swelling ranks of US non-bank credit card
issuers that are expanding beyond national boundaries. Last year,
Advanta formed a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland to issue
cards in the UK. And that, according to Advanta International head Jim
Allhusen, is just the beginning.

"International business will be a key part of corporate expansion and
it will be a major part of our strategy. We plan to be opportunistic
when we find markets that are inefficient or stagnant," Allhusen said.

Within the US, the limited-purpose credit card issuer based near
Philadelphia has jumped into the elite top 20 while it continues to
outperform the industry. Advanta managed $11.9 billion in assets at the
end of the third quarter, making it the 13th-largest issuer in the US.
In the first nine months of 1995, the company added 1 million new
accounts for a total of more than 4 million.

The company, which has its roots in making loans to educators in
Pennsylvania, has recruited several industry luminaries with
international credentials. Most notably, former MasterCard
International chief executive Alex "Pete" Hart joined in 1994 and was
subsequently named CEO of the company.

Hart has since lured two association colleagues to join him: Arthur
Kranzley, formerly head of MasterCard's worldwide debit business, who
came on board in the autumn.

Earlier this month, the company hired Hung-Fu "Hank" Chiang, who left
his post as general manager of MasterCard China. Chiang also had worked
with Hart at First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles.

Chiang, an American of Chinese descent, will report to James Allhusen,
an executive vice president in charge of Advanta International, a
newly-formed group. Allhusen, who ran consumer banking and cards for
Standard Chartered Bank, came on board last year. His career includes
stints in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

Allhusen noted that Hart, Chiang and he all have expertise and contacts
in Asian markets. He said people were now in place to develop an Asian
strategy. When asked if a China strategy were in place at Advanta,
Allhusen replied, "No, not yet."

But company executives speak openly of plans for global expansion by
way of joint ventures with indigenous partners in certain high-growth
markets. Unlike Citibank, MBNA or Household International, which have
set up issuing banks in target markets, Advanta will seek to create
ventures with like-minded banks as it did with Royal Bank of Scotland
last year.

"We believe Advanta has skills within the company which have made it
very successful in the US. We see opportunities in foreign markets to
use those same skills to our advantage. My job is to find out which
skills are most transportable across borders and to find partners we
could work with in those markets," said Allhusen, naming RBS as an
example.

Royal Bank, he said, "is just as committed to the success of the
proposition, has a strong image, a strong brand and an infrastructure
to support a cards operation. What we bring is a number of skills that
have not yet been developed in the UK market."

In recent months, Advanta has been more aggressive in seeking
publicity, another sign that the company seeks recognition as a leading
cards player.

Allhusen said the increase is coincidental, since the company recently
has had much to proclaim. Advanta has a motive in trying to earn the
favour of Wall Street to boost its share price, a tactic recently
employed by First USA. News of international expansion could help
rectify a depressed price-earnings ratio of 12.5, which according to
Allhusen is"lower than it ought to be."

Along with the other pure plays, Advanta's Class A stock took a plunge
at the end of December, dropping to $38 per share from an October high
of $49.

According to analysts pure play companies such as Advanta, which derive
almost 100 percent of their revenues from credit cards, have suffered
from recent reports that make gloomy predictions for the future. In the
last few quarters, charge offs and personal delinquency rates have
crept upward on average, though individually Advanta's loss experience
has been better than the industry as a whole.

RAYMOND JAMES MOVES INTO TRADITIONAL BANKING FIRST: HERE COME THE
BROKER-DEALERS

In the financial equivalent of "man bites dog," Raymond
James Financial Inc. has underway a major thrust into traditional banking
services via its wholly owned bank, Raymond James Bank. The St. Petersburg-
based financial conglomerate will offer in February FDIC-insured products
like checking and savings accounts. And, in a few months the bank will
market home equity lines of credit, and, possibly, residential mortgages.
     If all goes well, the securities dealer's bank might become
the nation's largest virtual bank. Theresa Schefstad, the president and CEO
of Raymond James Bank, promises to reach her market "telephonically and
electronically. Our objective is to provide consolidated financial services
so all (customers') financial services can be received from our firm," she
said.
     The bank's initial target market will be the securities
company's hefty customer base of some 300,000 clients.
     "We'll be able to offer our clients several product
choices. We have the FDIC option, our credit interest program (sweep
account) option, and the third is our Heritage mutual funds," Schefstad
explained. The Heritage funds are Raymond James' proprietary mutual funds.
     The company will continue its tradition of not providing
additional incentive to brokers selling top proprietary products.
"Compensation is consistent for all three product options," Schefstad said.
This compensation practice appears to have worked to the detriment of the
Heritage fund family, where growth of the individual funds has fallen
behind other brokerage house proprietary funds, despite the company's
nationwide branch network.
     Schefstad said that James is the only broker/dealer to
wholly own a full-service bank. Unlike other nonbanking companies, which
must resort to the "nonbank bank" strategy to get into the banking
business, James purchased the bank branches with a total deposit base of
$12 million from the Resolution Trust Co. In May, 1994 the company
chartered the Raymond James Bank FSB, which has a capability to operate in
all 50 states.
     The bank ended 1995 with approximately $162 million in
assets and $136 million in deposits.
     Over the past 20 months, Schefstad, the bank staff has been
wrestling with regulatory approvals, developing disclosure policies and
integrating the bank's systems into the Raymond James computer network.
     "Because of who owns us, we've had to obtain regulatory
approval for everything we've done. For example, when we developed our
consolidated statement, we received approval (beforehand) of our disclosure
policy and separation of accounts," Schefstad said.
     The bank will maintain a physical branch office near its
headquarters in Florida. Schefstad envisions the remainder of the bank's
efforts taking place electronically, particularly through the nationwide
automated teller machine networks. Of course, deposit-taking via the ATM
has yet to gain wide acceptance, but Schefstad said the firm's brokerage
clients are sophisticated enough to understand and use direct-deposit
options available through the automated clearing house system.--John J.

SECOND PUERTO RICAN DEAL CAPS DECEMBER CALENDAR

Eying the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of Puerto Rico
became the second bank from the island to issue subordinated debt in
December.
     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100
million offering of 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basis
points over Treasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. The
notes, which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language,
enabling a public-style execution of the offering without registration at
the Securities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resulted
from S&P rating the issue just below investment grade, said Annie Astor,
chief financial officer.
     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low rates
in December, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank to
issue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's first
independent bond offering.
     Jefferies & Co. captured the leading underwriting position
on the deal because of  its relationship with the bank, and Smith Barney
Inc. acted as co-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15
insurance companies.
     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part by
the bank's phenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has had
an average return on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since the
bank's initial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciated
in value by 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billion
asset bank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter last
year.
     The deal for First Bank follows a first-time subordinated
offering by another Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in the
month. BanPonce Corp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in
10-year subordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125
million. That deal, which priced at 105 basis points over comparable
Treasurys, was underwritten entirely by CS First Boston (see CFO Alert
12/11/95, P.5)

SUSQUEHANNA ADDING DEBT TO EQUITY TO FUND ACQUISITION

Seeking to fund its expansion efforts, Susquehanna
Bancshares Inc. recently issued shares of common stock and is prepping an
offering of senior notes that is expected to hit the market at the end of
January.
     "We're in the process of acquiring a thrift in Maryland for
$63 million, and we don't have that cash on hand," said J. Stanley Mull,
vice president of the Treasury at Susquehanna. The acquisition of Fairfax
Corp., located in Baltimore, follows the thrift acquisitions last April of
Atlantic Federal Savings Bank and Reisters Town Federal Savings Bank.
     Including the greenshoe option, a total of 1.495 million
shares were issued at $26.50 per share, or $25.31 after underwriting fees,
for proceeds of $37.8 million, Mull said. Oppenheimer & Co. led the
offering, followed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. and Legg Mason Wood
Walker Inc.
     Susquehanna chose Oppenheimer as lead on the deal because
of advisory services the investment bank had provided in the past, Mull
said, noting that Keefe, Bruyette added a strong, bank-market name to the
deal, and Legg Mason provided strong distribution in the Maryland area,
where many of the bonds were sold. Around two-thirds of the offering was
sold at the retail level, and the rest to institutional investors.
     Susquehanna anticipates approaching the debt market later
in January to offer up to $35 million in senior debt, the proceeds of which
will also be devoted to the acquisition, Mull said. He noted that a
maturity for the notes had yet to be determined. Oppenheimer and Keefe
Bruyette will underwrite the offering.
     Susquehanna Bancshares Inc., which has $3 billion in assets
in both Pennsylvania and Maryland, operates six commercial banks. It
recently formed a subsidiary, Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. South, to act as
the holding company for the thrift assets.

BANK BONDS ON TOP: ONE AWESOME YEAR

Returns on bonds issued by banking institutions climbed to
remarkable heights in 1995 -- relatively speaking. Whether they can sustain
last year's pace, however, is another story.
     Aggregate total returns reached 21.85%, topped by single-A
rated banks, which found a return of 22.11%. Although the total return for
corporates overall was higher at 22.24%, duration adjusted returns,
considered a more accurate measure, showed bank bonds besting virtually all
other corporate and government securities (see table on P. 2).
     Still, the heights to which bank returns climbed are
relative to their starting point at the beginning of the year.
     "Banks were cheaper going in, so there was a big upside,"
said Anne Robinson, a fixed income analyst at Bear Stearns. She added that
bank spreads widened considerably toward the end of 1994, largely due to
Federal Reserve interest rate hikes earlier in the year.
     Spreads on bank bonds are strongly correlated to interest
rates, due to the interest rate sensitivity of banks' businesses, which may
account for some widening of spreads in the third quarter 1995. At that
time, minor concerns of inflation were sparked. Shortly after, however,
positive inflation numbers were released, a number of large banks announced
mergers, and there was significant purchasing of U.S. Treasurys by the
Japanese central bank, which drove rates down. These factors all worked to
tighten spreads in the fourth quarter, actually doubling returns from the
previous quarter,  to nearly record levels. However, investors see little
room for improvement in the bank bond market, at least compared to other
corporate bonds.
     "Our view is that spreads are at fairly narrow levels, and
there's not much room for upside," said Mike O'Brien, a banking analyst at
Fidelity. He noted that while there has been some deterioration in banking
fundamentals, such as credit quality, those fundamentals are still very
strong. "An investor wouldn't be overweighting in the bank sector, but
probably wouldn't be getting out either. The sector may not perform as well
as before, but we don't think it will have problems."
     O'Brien further noted that consolidation in the industry,
which has been a driving factor behind the rally, appears to be winding
down somewhat, and that upside stemming from ratings upgrades has probably
leveled off.
     "The sector is balancing out at high single-A -- it's hard
to get excited about the sector," O'Brien said. He noted that Fidelity is
focusing on shorter-maturity debt  --  buying five-year paper rather than
20-year -- to guard against spreads potentially widening later in the year.
     Robinson generally agreed with O'Brien's prognosis of the
bank sector, noting that there is only a 30-basis point spread difference
between the best and weakest banks. That compares to a 45-basis point
difference at this time last year.
     "We don't see spreads tightening any further. But an
investor can still make money in banks if rates go down later in the year,"
she said.

POTENTIAL FUNDING DILEMMA: MIXED MESSAGES FROM FASB

Banks that left securities in the held-to-maturity category
of Financial Accounting Standard 115 during the recently provided transfer
window, with the intention of using those securities later to do repurchase
agreement transactions, may find that strategy closed to them if a proposed
standard from the Financial Accounting Standards Board is enacted in its
current form.
     The proposed standard was issued as an exposure draft
around the same time that FASB provided banks with a window to transfer
securities currently classified as held to maturity into the available-for-
sale category without a penalty. The window of opportunity in FAS 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, closed at
the end of 1995, after which such transfers are strictly prohibited. The
proposed treatment for longer-term repos likely influenced held-to-maturity
designations under FAS 115 during the restructuring window, and will
continue to do so.
     For example, a financial manager may have intended to use a
five-year bond classified in held to maturity as collateral in a repo
transaction next year. However, that may not be possible under the same
favorable terms if the proposed statement becomes an accounting standard,
and so the manager may have chosen to use one of the other two categories
instead.
     Banking institutions typically designate securities used
for longer-term repos into the held-to-maturity category,  where unrealized
gains and losses needn't be marked to market. However, the proposed
statement would require any repos with a maturity of three months or more
to be recorded as a sale, and hence marked to market. Banks would thereby
be limited to using repos with maturities of less than three months, which
are still liabilities under the proposed statement. The proposed sale
treatment for longer-term repos increases volatility in capital and would
suddenly have to appear in the income statement when the rule comes into
effect. The proposed transition date currently is Dec. 15, 1996.
     "This is a major concern for our industry," said Marti
Sworobuk at America's Community Bankers. "Smaller banks and thrifts depend
on repos for general banking operations. Many of our members believe that
the proposed standard would do away with repos beyond three months and
increase their costs by at least 30-40 basis points."
     These institutions can also turn to the Federal Home Loan
Bank system for advances, although that is a more expensive source of
funding. In addition, Sworobuk noted, the future of the FHLB as an easily
accessible and available funding source is uncertain given the current
political climate.
     FASB  has noted that the three-month maturity limit on
repos is a period that was arrived at arbitrarily, largely because the
Board believed that the vast majority of repo transactions held far shorter
maturities.
     "We've since learned that there are more transactions with
durations around three months than we thought," said Halsey Bullen, the
project manager at FASB. He noted that the Board generally attempts to
derive arbitrary thresholds where there is a low concentration of business
activity, in order to avoid dramatic differences in accounting requirements
for many similar transactions. FASB will likely reconsider the three-month
limit as it continues its deliberations.
     Following the comment deadline Jan. 22, FASB will hold a
public hearing toward the end of February. As of the middle of last week,
the accounting standard setter had received about 25 comments, most of
which were notifications to testify at the public hearing.
     America's Community Bankers was preparing last week a
letter to FASB in order to express the views of its constituents.  The
trade group recently surveyed members with assets of $1 billion or more for
their views on the proposed statement, and found that many banks believe
the standard would eliminate a source of cheap, long-term funding. A large
savings bank in Wisconsin noted that it intends to extend its use of repos
out to one or two years, and that the proposed change would negatively
influence its operations.
     "To make a long story short, they're all saying that they
would have to shorten maturities and go to a higher-cost-of-funding
source," Sworobuk said.

BUYBACKS DROP OFF IN '95 MERGER MANIA

The heady volume of stock repurchase programs announced by
banks slackened in 1995 from the previous year, while repurchase programs
announced by thrifts more than doubled in the same period, according to
Securities Data  Co.
     The volume of announced programs in 1995 fell 25% from the
year before to just over $20 billion, a drop that surprised analysts, who
noted possible reasons including frenetic merger activity and heady stock
values.
     Observers of the savings and loan industry attributed the
nearly 140% increase in the volume of stock repurchases announced by
thrifts to factors that have been affecting banks for some time, including
the need to use capital and control burgeoning earnings-per-share and
return-on-equity ratios.
     Perhaps the most important reason, they said, was to ward
off acquirers seeking assets on the cheap.
     Marni Pont, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc., said
that stock buybacks can prohibit banks from engaging in stock poolings, a
complication experienced by First Bank System in its efforts to acquire
First Interstate. She noted that banks may thus have decided to limit their
buybacks in favor of poolings, a strategy confirmed by the treasurer of a
regional bank whose institution recently chose to cut short its announced
buyback for that very reason.
     Another reason, Pont noted, was the rapidly rising values
of bank stocks, which, according to Keefe's KBI 50, provided an average
total return in 1995 of 60.02%.
     Yet despite a total return of 63% in 1995, AmSouth Bancorp.
decided to pursue a stock buyback last fall in order provide shares for its
employee benefit and stock plans.
     "You can generate a fairly good internal rate of return
(through a buyback) because the increase you achieve in EPS and ROE seems
to offset any cost that you incur through book value dilution," said List
Underwood, head of finance at the bank.

BANK GROUPS JOIN ARMS AGAINST FILING PENALTIES

Representatives of the nation's lending industries have
joined together to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for a plan they
believe will raise the penalties for failing to file, or filing
inaccurately, so-called "information returns," -- the infamous 1099s.
     These forms are used by lenders to report payments of
dividends, interest and interest accrued on accounts but not precisely
paid. For example, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit,
U.S. government securities or similar instruments.
     The Clinton administration proposal sprang out of the
budget stalemate that has persisted over the last several weeks. The
administration submitted a proposal to the Republican leadership in
Congress Dec. 7 as an alternative to Republican calls for deep cuts in the
federal budget. The proposal outlines increases in miscellaneous fees and
the closing of certain loopholes. Aimed more at stirring indigination than
winning congressional support, the proposal includes several other
provisions that the administration knew would be opposed by powerful
corporate interests. For example, it calls for federal banking regulators
to impose examination fees on state-chartered banks.
     The provision at issue appeared to be limited to payments
for services that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC. However, according to
a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin dated Jan. 2, the
lenders said that an explanation provided by the Joint Committee on
Taxation Dec. 15 indicated a provision with much broader scope.
     Those signing onto the letter include Credit Union National
Association, the American Bankers Association, the American Land Title
Association, America's Community Bankers, the Independent Bankers
Association of America, the Investment Company Institute, the National
Association of Realtors, the Public Securities Association and the
Securities Industry Association.
     The implication is that even if the proposal had merit, it
is unlikely to be supported in Congress--especially in an election year.
However, given that this is not a normal budget process, the groups are
joining together to marshall their muscle out of fear that in a late night
deal, the provision could be swept into a compromise--at great cost to
lenders of all stripes.
     The letter says the industries "strongly oppose" the
administration's plan.

CITICORP ISSUES FIRST SUB DEAL IN STORMY NEW YEAR

Finance officials overcame the snow drifts and icy roads
after last week's blizzard to complete the first subordinated transaction
of the new year.
     Citicorp issued $250 million in 10-year subordinated notes.
Rated A2/A, the paper priced at 62.5 basis points over comparable Treasurys
for a coupon of 6.375% at 99.672 to yield 6.42%. The issue carries a bullet
repayment.
     The deal was led by Salomon Brothers, followed by co-
managers Bear Stearns, Citicorp Securities, Goldman Sachs and Merrill
Lynch.
     The new year has been relatively quiet in the bank bond
market, despite talk the week before last of a stockpile of deals ready to
hit the market and take advantage of still relatively low rates. In fact,
investment bankers said that more offerings might have hit the market last
week had the storm arrived in lesser force. Interest rates also jumped
during the week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged on consecutive
days.
     Still, the Citicorp deal was said to have met with mild
resistance in the market, requiring a series of swaps to complete the deal
in a timely fashion once the issue began trading.
     Sources predicted a number of offerings approaching the
market this week and the next. Meridian Bancorp Inc., headquartered in
Reading, PA, was rumored to be preparing to hit the market shortly.

SEGMENT ACCOUNTING RULES NEAR ISSUE

Accounting standards-setters in the United States and
Canada plan to follow their global counterpart this week by issuing draft
rules governing when businesses must disclose financial information about
their regional operations and product lines.
     The North Americans' exposure drafts on what are usually
referred to as "segment reporting" or "disaggregated disclosures" are
slightly less onerous than the one released Dec. 20 by the London-based
International Accounting Standards Committee. While the IASC draft could
require disclosures based on certain parameters, the identical drafts to be
issued by America's Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants goes no further than to press for
companies to report segments based on how they break down their operations.
     This difference of opinion has been going for at least a
year, and officials from all three groups are expected to engage in more
haggling on the issue this summer. Comments on all three sets of proposals
will be due June 30.
     Once it becomes a standard, the segment reporting rule
promises to shed more light on how and where banks make their money. And
the rule became even more important last month when Deutsche Bank announced
it would start publishing its group results according to International
Accounting Standards. That will mark the end of the use of so-called hidden
reserves to smooth out balance sheets.
     Under the IASC's exposure draft, companies would provide at
least one breakdown of risks and returns based on business or geographical
lines. In most cases, the actual one used should be whatever way internal
financial reports are sent to the CEO, the IASC said.
     The North American approach also starts with the way a
business views itself, but unlike the IASC it stops there. "IASC ...
recognizes the fact that this information does not always reflect the
dominant source and nature of risks and returns," wrote Paul Pacter, IASC's
project manager. "In certain cases, therefore, information needs to be
modified for external reporting purposes."-- Craig Webb

Bank of Boston Bets on Securitization

   Hoping to resuscitate its real estate lending business, Bank of Boston
Corp. is radically altering its operations: From now on, it will only
originate commercial mortgages that can be securitized.
   In an exclusive arrangement, the nation's 16th-largest bank has engaged
Goldman, Sachs & Co. to structure and distribute mortgage-backed notes that
can be sold to several classes of investors.
   Bank of Boston's move is a departure from the traditional real estate
operations of banks, which have always been long-term holders of commercial
mortgages. It's performance is sure to be tracked by regional banks
nationwide, many of which are weighing similar plans.
   The strategic shift results from months of discussions between senior
officials at Bank of Boston and outside securitization experts, including
advisers from Kenneth Leventhal & Co. and the New York law firm of Weil,
Gotshal & Manges.
   In talks earlier this month with borrowers and other outsiders, Bank of
Boston management expressed a sense of urgency about shifting its approach
from "book and hold" to "originate and sell." According to a bank position
paper, failure to adopt a securitization strategy would jeopardize its
commercial mortgage franchise. Under such a scenario, the bank said it
would:
   * "Lose a large portion of our asset base in one to three years."
   * "Have no competitive term credit to attract new relationships."
   * "[See its] revenues decline due to the loss of higher spread credit."
   * "Not be in control of our balance sheet as we continue to acquire
banks."
   Like many other institutions, Bank of Boston has been a reluctant real
estate lender during the early part of this decade - in contrast to its
aggressive style in the 1980s. For the most part, it has been booking mini-
perms (three- to five-year loans) that carry strict covenants and recourse
provisions. With such onerous terms, the bank has been losing prospective
borrowers to its competitors, and the outlook has worsened with the
proliferation of Wall Street's commercial mortgage conduits.
   Now that real estate values are rebounding, the bank wants to offer
friendlier terms on loans that can be regularly packaged into commercial
MBS and rolled off its balance sheet.
   In July, Bank of Boston's 90 commercial mortgage originators will start
hawking the new product line. It features long-term (five- to 20-year)
loans without covenants or recourse provisions. The bank will write
$750,000 to $10 million loans. The credits will carry fixed and adjustable
rates, amortizing over 20 or 25 years.
   The goal: To re-establish Bank of Boston as a one-stop resource for
developers and other real estate owners in need of construction, mini-perm
or long-term financing. The new program is designed to finance shopping
centers (anchored and unanchored), apartment buildings,
industrial/warehouse facilities, office buildings and hotels.
   By securitizing these loans, Bank of Boston can continue to build real
estate relationships and generate fee income, while meeting management
concerns about its asset-liability mix, risk exposure and capital
requirements.
   How does the bank plan to profit from its securitization program? The
bulk of its earnings will come from the "positive arbitrage" that is left
over from a loan's interest rate after paying issuance expenses and the
required yield to MBS holders.
   The bank estimates it will charge borrowers 275 to 350 basis points over
the Treasury curve and be left with 50 to 70 bp of profit. That projection
is considered somewhat optimistic, given that lenders are being forced to
lower their loan prices in order to cope with mounting competition.
   On top of the loan spread, the bank will also collect an origination fee
equal to 1.5% to 2.25% of the total loan amount, plus a $16,500 application
charge.
   MBS investors can expect Goldman, Sachs to provide a fairly regular flow
of multi-class issues, each backed by at least 30 mortgages. A typical
issue will be made up of a triple-A rated senior tranche yielding 100 to
125 bp over Treasuries, a smaller single- or double-A tranche yielding 140
to 175 bp over, a double- or triple-B class yielding 300 to 600 bp over and
an unrated piece with spreads in the mid- to high-teens.
   Spokesman for Bank of Boston and Goldman, Sachs did not return calls for
comment.
   Bank of Boston is counting on the securitization program to
substantially boost its origination capacity from its current annual
commercial mortgage output of about $250 million. It's not known whether
the bank also plans to securitize part of its $3.5 billion in existing real
estate loans, which were not underwritten with MBS investors in mind.
Nearly half of its current portfolio is secured by New England properties,
with the rest scattered throughout the U.S.

S&P Tops Rivals in Ratings Volume

   Standard & Poor's Corp. was the most active rating agency in the
commercial MBS market in 1993, working on more than half of the year's
dollar volume, according to data compiled by Commercial Mortgage Alert.
   Of the $14.7 billion in transactions for which rating information was
gathered, S&P rated offerings valued at $7.6 billion.
   Fitch Investors Service Inc. and Duff & Phelps Corp. were neck-and-neck
for second place. Fitch rated issues valued at $6.75 billion, while D&P's
total was $6.70 billion. Moody's Investors Service Inc. came in last, with
$6.2 billion of rated deals.
   S&P also ranked first based on the number of deals rated, with 46,
followed by D&P (42), Fitch (36) and Moody's (28).
   The survey - the first ever to track rating-agency activity in the CMBS
market - also showed that Fitch's business grew by a whopping 63% last
year, from $4.1 billion in 1992. The number of deals it rated more than
tripled.
   Moody's was the only agency to see its volume fall, logging a 12%
decline, from $7.1 billion.
   Still, several executives at Wall Street firms expressed surprise that
the agency ended up so close to the pack. Moody's suffered several key
staff defections last year, which limited its ability to process
transactions. The firm estimates that it turned away a couple of billion
dollars of offerings that it otherwise would have rated.
   What's more, Moody's has taken a strict view on certain types of
commercial MBS. That strategy has rankled underwriters, opened up
opportunities for rival agencies and, ultimately, cost Moody's some market
share. But because of its stellar reputation among bondholders, Moody's
ended up rating most of the year's biggest deals.
   Investment bankers weigh a number of factors when selecting a rating
agency, but the requirements of investors tend to be the dominant factor.
MBS buyers often insist that transactions be rated by either S&P or Moody's
- the two most-established agencies. And for most deals, they want the
comfort of two ratings. This opens the door for the market upstarts, D&P
and Fitch.
   Another key factor is service: How quickly and smoothly a deal will be
rated, as well as the accessibility of analysts to investors. At the end of
last year, when deal volume picked up sharply, the agencies were swamped
with business. Moody's temporarily stopped accepting additional business in
September. S&P, which has a much bigger staff dedicated to commercial MBS,
was forced to do the same the following month.
   Things have calmed down somewhat since the beginning of the year, with
deals usually taking six to eight weeks to go through the rating process.
One Wall Street executive commented that all of the agencies still have
bottlenecks, but he - and several others - singled out Fitch for providing
particularly good service.
   Because the issuer's cost of funds is generally the overriding concern
in every deal, underwriters are known to shop for agencies that will
require the least subordination in order to attain the desired rating. An
increase in the level of subordination, or other credit enhancement
features, can lead to dramatically higher borrowing costs.
   The individual bias of each agency is also well known in the market.
Moody's, for example, is comfortable with multi-family and retail deals,
but is wary of offerings backed by debt on office buildings and hotels.
Fitch has led the way on deals collateralized by nonperforming assets, but
is especially strict on offerings with single borrowers.
   D&P has been regarded as the most lenient and least influential of the
agencies. But underwriters said that D&P has become tougher under the
direction of Joseph C. Franzetti, a respected analyst who was recruited
last September from S&P, where he ran the mortgage-backed securities group.
    At the other end of the scale is Moody's, which seems to pride itself
on being the toughest rater. Last fall, for example, it issued a widely
publicized warning to investors about a "marked deterioration in the credit
quality" of commercial mortgage issues.
   "We're much less concerned with market share than with assigning high-
quality ratings," said Tad Philipp, associate director of the agency's
structured finance group. "We're never going to have the market share of
some of the other rating agencies."
   Despite their frustrations with the agency, investment bankers would
love to see Moody's play a bigger role in the CMBS arena, because of its
powerful reputation in other segments of the bond market.
   For this reason, some are perplexed by the fact that Moody's has devoted
fewer resources to this market than its rivals. After losing some staffers
to Wall Street houses last year, Moody's at times found itself with as few
as four or five professionals in its commercial MBS area, down from its
full complement of seven. The agency is on the verge of filling two new
positions, but it is still out-manned by its rivals: S&P employs about 20
professionals, while D&P has 14 and Fitch has 13.
   Philipp said that Moody's is committed to the market and expects it to
grow. "But we don't feel the need to staff up to handle peak volumes."

How the Rankings Were Compiled

   Commercial Mortgage Alert used its new CMBS Database to calculate the
volume of business handled by each of the four rating agencies over the
last two years.
   The Database, which includes every transaction completed since the
market's inception, carries rating information for the vast majority of
deals in recent years. All told, there were 123 deals valued at $17.7
billion that closed in 1993. But of those, issues with a face amount of at
least $1.7 billion were not rated - $638.4 million in Fannie Mae deals and
$1.1 billion in private placements used to finance acquisitions by Goldman,
Sachs & Co.'s Whitehall Street Real Estate Fund.
   Of the remaining $16 billion in deals, rating information from at least
one agency was gathered for offerings totaling $14.7 billion.
   Because of confidentiality agreements, the rating agencies declined to
provide information about private placements, and in some cases this
information could not be learned independently. The agencies did provide
aggregate data. S&P, for example, said it rated 62 commercial MBS deals
last year totalling $8.2 billion. And Moody's said it rated a total of $7.2
billion in deals. However, the survey counted only ratings that could be
tied to specific transactions.
   Agencies were given full credit for the total principal amount of an MBS
issue, even if they rated only some classes in a deal.

What They Charge

   Commercial MBS underwriters say fees don't play much of a role in their
selection of a rating agency.
   The four agencies each charge about the same - and their compensation
pales in comparison to other issuance costs, such as legal fees. The rating
agencies are usually paid six to 10 basis points of the value of the rated
classes, or $60,000 to $100,000 for a $100 million transaction.
   However, the complexity of a deal is also factored in, as well as the
geographic diversity of the collateral. Those factors can push the fee to
20 basis points or more.
   Underwriters say that Fitch tends to charge more than its rivals, but
not materially so.

Freddie's Securitization Plan Fizzling

   If Freddie Mac heeds the advice of Lehman Brothers Inc., it will soon be
canceling its plans to securitize a $1 billion portfolio of performing
multi-family mortgages.
   Last week, Lehman, as financial adviser to Freddie, recommended against
the transaction - saying the issue did not make economic sense for the
agency. The purpose of the offering was to free up capital that Freddie
could recycle back into the mortgage market.
   Bear Stearns Cos., which would underwriting the offering, continues to
lobby hard in favor of the transaction.
   Considerable dissension has developed among senior executives at the
mortgage agency about whether to go forward with the offering. The
principals involved will air their differences at a pivotal meeting that is
scheduled for this Wednesday.
   Michael May, a Freddie vice president for structured transactions,
predicted a final decision would be made within two weeks.
   As envisioned, the transaction would have involved  Freddie selling
subordinate tranches and retaining the senior notes.

Multi-Family Paper Blows Out

   Strong investor demand enabled Natwest Markets to rapidly sell $50
million in fixed-rate securities backed by debt on apartment complexes
owned by Southwest Property Trust Inc., a Dallas REIT.
   The two-class offering, priced June 3, was oversubscribed, forcing
Natwest to scale back individual allotments in order to give all investors
a piece of the pie.
   The senior $50 million class, rated double-A, was priced at par to yield
7.824%, or 110 basis points over the seven-year Treasury. The offering also
included an interest-only strip, which was sold to an unnamed investor.
   The spread on the senior notes was 20 basis points tighter than the
spread on Southwest Property's similar $50 million transaction last
December - a time when many more deals were competing for investors'
attention. But for the REIT, which initiated the transactions to finance
the acquisition of multi-family properties, tighter spreads were small
consolation for the higher yield it must pay: 7.82% versus 6.54% in
December.
   Both transactions grew out of a $100 million line of credit that Natwest
Markets provided to Southwest Property last year.
   The REIT tapped half of the credit line in November to finance the
acquisition of six properties. The REIT paid back the bridge loan with the
proceeds of the first securitization, which was backed by new mortgages on
13 apartment complexes in Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona.
   Southwest Property drew down the rest of the credit line over the past
few months to finance other acquisitions. That bridge financing was paid
off with proceeds of the latest securitization, which was backed by new
mortgages on 12 garden-style properties in Texas, one in New Mexico and one
in Arizona.
   The offering carried attractive prepayment protections for bondholders.
If the REIT prepays the mortgages, it will have to pay bondholders the
difference between the coupon on the securities and the prevailing Treasury
rate. The yield-maintenance agreement is designed to protect investors
against declining interest rates by compensating them for having to re-
invest their funds at lower yields. Under these provisions, bondholders
usually receive the difference between the coupon and a rate equal to the
Treasury yield plus an additional spread. In the Southwest Property deal,
however, investors will receive the difference between their coupon and the
flat Treasury rate, making the potential compensation greater than normal.
   The class A notes mature in February 2001, but are extendable for two
years. If the notes are extended, their coupon rate, currently 7.72%, will
be increased to either 9.43% or 375 basis points over the seven-year
Treasury, whichever is higher at the time.
   The two Southwest Property transactions were the first commercial MBS
deals handled by Natwest Markets, the New York investment banking arm of
London-based National Westminster Bank PLC.

DLJ Conduit Targets Hotels

   The conduit operated by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and Equitable
Real Estate Investment Management Inc. is expanding into the hotel sector.
   The team, which already originates and securitizes multi-family and
retail credits, plans to extend up to $1 billion of hotel loans nationwide.
   Equitable believes that the time is right to get back into the
rebounding hotel sector, which it pulled out of five years ago. This time
around the company will employ more conservative underwriting standards.
For instance, it will base lending decisions on the properties' historic,
rather than projected, income.
   Under the program, Equitable will identify borrowers through its
national network of investment offices. The loans will be originated by
Column Financial Inc., an Atlanta-based joint venture between the conduit
partners. DLJ will then securitize the mortgages. Equitable Real Estate and
DLJ are subsidiaries of Equitable Companies Inc.
   The conduit will originate non-recourse loans with 10- to 20-year terms
for all types of lodging properties. Loans will range from $2 million to
about $25 million, with interest rates that are 325 to 450 basis points
over Treasuries, depending on the debt-service coverage. A 1.75 DSC ratio
would merit a 325 bp spread. But a 1.40 ratio - considered more likely for
hotel properties - would result in a 350 to 400 bp spread.

Greystone Hires Daiwa Pros

   Greystone & Co., an investment banking boutique, has started a
commercial MBS unit, staffing it with three veterans from the disbanded
mortgage operation of Daiwa Securities America Inc.
   The unit will originate and buy commercial and multi-family mortgages,
and may also form an alliance with another mortgage originator. Greystone
has applied to become a broker/dealer so it can underwrite securitizations.
   The former Daiwa officials, who were hired in the past few weeks, are
David Goodwin, Mark Jarrell and Thomas Lally. Goodwin will review the
underwriting of mortgages, while Jarrell will structure deals and get them
rated. Lally will trade commercial MBS. The three executives had similar
jobs at Daiwa, which shut down its 35-member mortgage unit at the end of
March.
   Greystone also hired two other former Daiwa pros, who will concentrate
on residential mortgage securities. Wayne King will trade complex single-
family derivatives, such as interest-only strips, while Michael Gough will
trade both residential and commercial MBS.
   Until now, Greystone has focused mostly on advising on the restructuring
of tax-exempt issues that have defaulted. It has also invested in FHA-
insured multi-family mortgages and Ginnie Mae MBS backed by multi-family
properties.
   In February, the seven-year-old company, which is solely owned by
Stephen Rosenberg, moved its headquarters to New York from Atlanta to take
better advantage of the capital markets. The hirings boosted Greystone's
staffing to 15.

Nomura Places Warehouse Paper

   Surprising its skeptics, Nomura Securities International Inc. last week
fetched the price it wanted for $122.5 million in securities backed by
mini-warehouses.
   When Nomura started shopping the double-A notes for Shurgard Storage
Centers Inc., a Seattle REIT, it discussed pricing them at a spread of 120
basis points over seven-year Treasuries. Some investors said the
transaction, backed by a collateral type still relatively new to
securitization, would never get done at spreads of less than 130 bp.
   But in the end, Nomura was able to slightly better its initial target,
pricing the single-class offering at 102% of par value for a 115 bp spread.
The offering was helped by its strong bondholder protections and the
scarcity of new issues in the market. Still, it took Nomura several weeks
to privately place the notes.
   The deal will allow Shurgard to refinance debt on 86 properties.

THE GRAPEVINE

   Andrew Stone's two former lieutenants at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
are working on freelance deals. Gregory Jacobs and Paul Nidenberg are
advising mobile-home park owners, who are former Daiwa clients, on how to
raise $100 million through a collateralized offering. The duo hooked up the
borrowers with Merrill Lynch & Co., which could float the issue next month.
Three other ex-customers of Daiwa are also talking to the securitization
specialists about a similar mobile-home park financing. Jacobs and
Nidenberg left Daiwa in March, when the mortgage unit was shut down.
                               *   *   *
   Ocwen Financial Corp. and Eichler Fayne & Associates have parted ways on
their multi-family conduit arrangement. Unspecified differences of opinion
led to the split, although sources described the parting as amicable.
Eichler originated some $400 million in mortgages in the past year for the
conduit. The San Francisco firm will continue to originate loans for Fannie
Mae as one of the agency's delegated underwriters/servicers. It may also
team up in a conduit with another funding source. For its part, Ocwen,
which is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., will now rely entirely on its
thrift subsidiary, Berkeley Federal Bank & Trust FSB, to originate
mortgages on apartment complexes.
                               *   *   *
   CS First Boston Group is on track to securitize about $1 billion of
FDIC's performing commercial mortgages within six weeks. The deal will be
the agency's first - and probably only - attempt at securitizing commercial
loans. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc. are co-managing the
offering. To maximize returns from the issue, the agency will provide a
partial guarantee on the issue's underlying collateral. The offering is
expected to involve $800 million to $1.25 billion of securities.
                               *   *   *
   Goldman, Sachs & Co. is arranging to swap $265 million in multi-family
mortgages for Fannie Mae securities. The deal is likely to be similar to
the transaction the Wall Street firm handled last December for the owner of
the Lincoln Towers co-op complex on Manhattan's West Side. In that deal,
GMAC Mortgage Corp. of Elkins, Pa., originated mortgages on eight buildings
in the complex. The mortgages were funded by Goldman and exchanged for
Fannie MBS. Goldman then packaged the securities in a $112.5 million
offering. The transaction fell under Fannie Mae's old swap program, in
which subordination was not required to protect the agency against defaults
on the underlying mortgages.
                               *   *   *
   Meanwhile, Fannie Mae is about two weeks away from finalizing its
guidelines for swap transactions by conduits. Look for the agency to be
tougher than expected on requirements for debt-service coverage. Agency
officials have decided to charge higher guarantee fees and demand more
subordination than originally planned for deals that are judged to have
border-line debt-service coverage.
                               *   *   *
   Smith Barney Inc.'s pending $130 million nursing-home deal will be
backed by debt on 44 properties owned by Integrated Health Services of Hunt
Valley, Md. The fixed-rate securities, rated by S&P and D&P, are expected
to come to market in four classes. The offering was originally planned for
this month, but Smith Barney pushed it back to July. Integrated's deal is
one of several that the investment bank has been working on for some time.

Debtor's Counsel Pleads Guilty to Bankruptcy Fraud

Bernard J. Berry, a California bankruptcy attorney, pleaded guilty on
Dec. 11 to two counts of bankruptcy fraud. According to U.S. Attorney
Nora M. Manella, Berry, in anticipation of filing a bankruptcy for his
client, transferred the client's business assets away from her business
knowing that the assets were collateral for an SBA loan. This action was
taken with intent of concealing the assets from representatives of the
SBA and the bankruptcy trustee.
"This is a particularly egregious case because it involves an attorney
who attempted to use his knowledge of bankruptcy proceedings to profit
at the expenses of the U.S. Government," said Steve Marica, assistant
inspector general for investigations at the SBA.
Berry is scheduled to be sentenced on March 8, 1995. He faces a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $500,000.

Melvin Belli Files Chapter 11

Melvin Belli is one of the most well-known lawyers in the country. His
fame was such in the '60s that he actually appeared on an episode of the
TV series "Star Trek," as "Gorgon," a creature who made the  children of
one planet visited by the starship "Enterprise" murder their own
parents.
As a lawyer, he brought personal injury lawsuits to the public
consciousness and was a role model for many law students.
Now his firm has filed Chapter 11 and Belli has hired San Francisco
bankruptcy lawyer Penn Butler to represent him.
"There are two culprits," Belli said. "One is Dow Chemical who went into
bankruptcy and reneged on the $4 billion they had set up to pay [tort
claimants]. I had put out $5 million to $10 million for doctor's
reports, etc. The bank was going to lend us $45 million based on the Dow
Chemical settlement."
But when Dow went into bankruptcy, that loan disappeared and Belli found
himself cash poor.
"The second [culprit] is the $15 million [I had to pay my wife] in the
divorce," Belli said.
Belli said the Chapter 11 is merely buying "the finest personal injury
firm in the country" some time until everyone can be paid off in full.
"I have $50 million to $75 million in big cases coming in," he said.
"The oil case in Alaska, the Marcos case, the implants -- they're all
coming in toward the end of this year and over into the next year. But
we had some current creditors who wouldn't wait. It was impossible to do
anything but go into a Chapter 11."
Belli is now an outspoken convert of the bankruptcy system.
"People don't realize what Chapter 11 really is for," he said. "I have
changed my former opinion of that. I didn't know the difference between
Chapter 11 and ordinary bankruptcy. [Now I say], thank God that we've
got Chapter 11."

Lenders Worry That Consumers Cannot Afford Increased Debt

For the first time in history, consumers owe more than $1 trillion on
their non-mortgage installment credit. The outstanding balance on their
credit cards is approaching $400 billion. The most recent statistics
from the Federal Reserve show that total outstanding consumer revolving
credit was 19 percent higher through the end of October 1995 than it was
at the end of October 1994. According to RAM Research's Bankcard
Barometer, credit card delinquency rates increased from 3.89 percent
during the first quarter of 1995 to 4.33 percent during the fourth
quarter of the year.
All these numbers have the people who lent the money more than a little
nervous that debtors will be unable to pay their bills.
"1996 will be a year when we see higher delinquency and loan losses as
the consumer becomes more overextended," predicted John Kirby, senior
vice president in charge of consumer lending for SouthTrust Bank of
Alabama, N.A., in Birmingham, Ala. "Credit cards have been highly
solicited during 1995, leading to a suspicion that a larger number of
customers will have more credit card debt than their income provides."
Kirby explained that this explosion in credit card availability was the
result of several new lenders entering the market. In order to establish
loan volumes these new lenders were very aggressive in the solicitation
of business and often offered very low rates. Lenders who did not lower
their underwriting standards or rates in response to this competition
lost business to the new lenders. Many of those customers who left were
better credit risks than those who stayed. As a result, all lenders have
an increased risk of loss on consumer loans regardless of whether they
extended credit to borrowers that they might have previously rejected.
W. Doug King, executive vice president of Wachovia Corp. in Winston-
Salem, N.C., agreed that consumers will have increased difficulty paying
their bills during 1996 and saw it as a continuation of a trend that
began during 1995.
"Over the past several years consumers have taken on a great deal of
debt. The strained ability to service indebtedness through income, which
is not growing at a rapid pace, makes it very difficult for consumers to
address unexpected expenses," King said. "In the household environment
of two incomes where one or both consumers have lost jobs due to
downsizing, consolidations, or mergers, many have had to take lower
paying jobs, or are still unemployed. This situation has, of course,
significantly impacted the debt repayment ability of those affected
consumers.
King also noted that increases in the prime rate, which went from 6
percent to 9 percent in less than a year, significantly impacted the
ability of consumers with adjustable rate mortgages to finance their
other installment debt.
The ease of filing for bankruptcy is another reason why King expects to
see higher consumer loan losses during 1996. "Filing is simple and
inexpensive, there is no longer a social stigma attached to bankruptcy,
and the judicial system, in many cases, appears to be encouraging the
'fresh start' concept of bankruptcy."
While these factors would be conditions causing loan losses at any time,
the lending practices of credit card issuers have created a fragile
economic environment for consumers.
"The credit card industry has flooded the market with a variety of
credit card offers, most with tempting teaser rates. These offers have
encouraged some consumers to accept higher credit availability than can
be serviced with their income. In addition, the teaser rates quickly
expire resulting in higher debt service obligations."
Credit card issuers offering incentives for credit card use have added
to the problem of consumers taking on more debt than they can handle.
While there is nothing inherently wrong with consumers using credit
cards that offer rewards, "many consumers are being shocked at how
quickly miscellaneous purchases can add up," King said. "For example, in
some cases consumers, who have purchased groceries with credit cards,
are finding that they do not have the ability to pay off those purchases
upon receipt of the credit card statement, and actually wind up paying
for those groceries over an extended period of time."
And King sees the trend of increased consumer loan losses resulting from
lowered credit standards continuing beyond 1996.
"From a realistic standpoint, due to 1996 budgetary and earnings
pressures, the possibility of some banks lowering credit standards to
maintain growth and earnings may exist. In the event some banks in the
industry did lower credit standards consumer delinquencies and losses
would clearly move to even higher levels."
So, are lowered standards for issuing credit cards going to bankrupt the
lenders along with the borrowers? Probably not.
"The good news is that credit card debt is but one segment of the
consumer debt," said William E. MacDonald III, the president and CEO of
National City Bank, Cleveland, in Cleveland, Ohio, and the chairman of
the Consumer Bankers Association.
"To fairly assess consumer debt you must also include loans from home
equity and personal and revolving credit lines. If you look at the debt
service burden from a macro perspective, including both mortgage and
installment loan payments, the debt level numbers are not as alarming,"
MacDonald said.

5th Circuit Judges May Prohibit Chapter 13 Plans Calling for Direct
Payment of Creditors

Bankruptcy judges may deny confirmation of Chapter 13 plans that call
for the debtor to make payments directly to creditors, the Fifth Circuit
ruled in William C. and Julie C. Reid v. Michael Gross (In the Matter of
William C. and Julie C. Reid), No. 95-40249 (December 11, 1995). The per
curiam decision was not released for publication.
"We write briefly today only to emphasize that In re Foster, 670 F.2d
478 (5th Cir. 1982), stands clearly for the principle that the
bankruptcy court has broad discretion in determining whether a debtor
may act as disbursing agent in place of the trustee, thereby avoiding
the Chapter 13 trustee's fees," the court said. "Although Foster
recognizes that the debtor should have flexibility in formulating
Chapter 13 plans . . . we find no error in the bankruptcy court's
rejection of the proposed, amended plan, which, in this instance,
included a modification of First Bank and Trust's original loan to the
debtors."

U.S. Trustees Respond to Chapter 13 Guideline Criticism

The December 21st issue of Consumer Bankruptcy News included an article
entitled "EOUST Hears from Tennessee Legislators." This article also
appeared in Bankruptcy Court Decisions News & Comment, where it included
a note that bankruptcy judges had also written to the Executive Office
for U.S. Trustees to express concern with the proposed revisions to the
Chapter 13 Trustees' Handbook and the proposed ethical guidelines. In
response to the BCD version of the article we heard from Linda Ekstrom
Stanley, the U.S. Trustee for Region 17 (E.D. and N.D. Cal. and D.
Nev.), the chair of the Standing Trustee Subcommittee and Ellen B.
Vergos, U.S. Trustee for Region 8 (Ky. and Tenn.).
"As United States Trustees, and as members of the subcommittee who
participated in the drafting of proposed Standards of Conduct for
Standing Trustees and proposed Handbook Revisions, we are particularly
concerned that Chapter 13 administration be ethical, efficient and
economical for all who come in contact with the system.  This is a goal
of all those in the U.S. Trustee Program who have been involved with
these proposals.
"We feel it necessary to correct some misconceptions circulating about
the proposed standards and handbook revisions.  Many of these
misunderstandings were contained in your recent article entitled
'Legislators/Judges Worry about EOUST's Proposed Rules.'
"Your article quoted a letter from four members of Tennessee's
congressional delegation who expressed a concern that 'these new
regulations would negatively impair the effectiveness of the trustees,
and result in major financial losses to the creditors . . .' We submit
that if one reads the proposed standards and handbook revisions, one
will see that this expressed concern is misplaced.
"The proposals are divided into two portions: the first establishes five
ethical standards; the second gives guidance in incurring expenses and
in determining what is reasonable and necessary.  The standards are
those which ought to guide the fiduciaries in the administration of an
important trust.  The standards are, in part, to address abuses.  For
example, there have been instances where standing trustees have hired
and paid substantial salaries to family members for little or no work.
There have been trustee family members who have received excessive
compensation with benefits packages far exceeding those available for
comparable positions in the public and private sectors. Other cases
involve self-dealing by trustees who have charged trust operations sums
far above market rates or for often unnecessary expenses. These are of
serious concern.  Every dollar spent on unnecessary expenses comes out
of the pockets of the debtors.
"The 21 U.S. Trustees in the country are charged by law with the duty to
supervise the Chapter 13 trustees in their respective regions. 28 U.S.C.
Section 586(b). While the U.S. Trustees have and will continue to deal
with abuses on a case-by-case basis, the U.S. Trustees will be aided in
their supervision by definitive standards of which the standing trustee
has received advance notice about expected conduct. Written standards
will protect against claims of arbitrary or disparate treatment and, in
part, are a response to standing trustees' requests for written
direction.
"The U.S. Trustee Program is also obligated by law to review and approve
the budgets of each trustee operation.  This duty arises from 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 586(a)(1) which expressly limits the use of percentage fees to pay
for compensation and the actual, necessary expenses of the trustee.
"It is up to the 21 U.S. Trustees to act as 'watchdogs' over expenses
and to approve only those which meet the actual and necessary test.  The
proposed handbook revisions are to serve as a guide for the regional
U.S. Trustees in determining whether an expense of the Chapter 13
trustee in their respective regions is actual and necessary.
"The proposed standards and handbook revisions are not being offered as
an attempt to 'federalize' Chapter 13 trustees' operations, as
characterized by the Tennessee congressional delegation whose letter was
quoted in your article.  Rather, they are to serve as standards for
those in the system which will remain largely unchanged.
"Another misconception in your article is that 'the bankruptcy bench
closely monitors the operations of the trustees. . .' While the
bankruptcy courts adjudicate the issues which come before it in Chapter
13, it is the U.S. Trustee who is charged by law with monitoring the
budget and office operations.
"When the standing trustee system is examined, it is clear why Congress
felt that supervision and oversight were necessary.  The standing
trustee is a statutory fiduciary whose rights and responsibilities are
defined by statute as well as by the terms of the confirmed plan.  The
trustee receives payments from the debtor and holds them in trust to
distribute according to the terms of the confirmed plan or as otherwise
provided by law or court order.  To fund the standing trustee operation,
the standing trustee receives a percentage of all moneys received under
plans.  These fees are held in trust to pay for the collective cost of
administering all chapter 13 plans.
"By virtue of appointment by the U.S. Trustee, the standing trustee is
assigned to his or her caseload. The standing trustee's compensation and
office overhead are funded by the moneys paid by debtors through the
Chapter 13 plans.  Eighty percent of the standing trustees in the
country are paid maximum compensation of $122,816 in addition to having
all their overhead paid. The overhead and compensation are paid cut of
the funds paid in by the debtors and not by the trustees.  The standing
trustee is not subject to the vagaries of the marketplace, but receives
his or her salary and overhead by virtue of the number of case filings
in the district.  Many of these trustee operations are quite large.  For
example, in the Western  District of Tennessee, the three standing
trustees disbursed over $100,000,000 in fiscal year 1995.  Each year
approximately $2 billion flows through the standing trustee operations.
Clearly, Congress intended that the use of these fiduciary funds be
supervised.
"Your article suggested that 'letters from bankruptcy judges . . . have
argued in favor of keeping the system as it is.'  The fact is that many
bankruptcy judges have written.  Some favor the proposals, some want to
keep the system as it is, and others favor some proposals and argue
against others.  The comments are across the board.
"Finally, your article, quoting from the congressional letter, cites as
an example of increased cost, that the regulations would require that
the West Tennessee trustees' operations to be split into two distinct
office requiring the purchase of new equipment and the hiring of new
staff. The actual proposals as written, do not require the splitting,
but would prohibit a co-trustee operation to enhance accountability of
the individual trustee.  There are other more cost effective methods by
which the same result could be accomplished.
"The writer of your article suggested that there is a lack of meaningful
dialogue between the U.S. Trustees and the standing trustees which could
'harm the system.' In fact there has been extensive dialogue.  Comments
and suggestions concerning the proposals have been sought and obtained
from standing trustees, judges, creditors and others in the system.
Many U.S. Trustees have held meetings with the standing trustees in
their respective regions to obtain comment and input.  This month the
subcommittee met directly with a cross section of standing trustees from
throughout the country. Many useful suggestions and comments have been
gathered from this process.  The dialogue is ongoing and will be
considered in revising the standards and guidelines early next year.
Additionally, all written comments will be reviewed by the members of
the Director's Advisory Board in the next few weeks.  The Board is
comprised of bankruptcy judges and United States Trustees.  The Board
will also hear oral presentations from some of the commentators,
including representatives of the NACTT.
"If your readers would like to receive a copy of the proposals, write
Linda E. Stanley, 250 Montgomery Street, Suite 910, San Francisco,
California 94104, telephone 415-705-3333; or Sandra S. Coleman,
Assistant Director, Executive Office for United States Trustees, Suite
742, 901 E Building, 901 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20530,
telephone 202-307-1399."

Farmer Must Repay Over $1 Million in Fraudulent Bankruptcy

District Judge Neal B. Biggers Jr. has ordered Lawyer Wheeler Sr., a
Mississippi delta farmer to repay more than $1.1 million to the
Department of Agriculture and the Bank of Webb as a result of his
conviction on an elaborate bankruptcy fraud scheme.
Wheeler borrowed about $1 million from the Farmers Home Administration
and nearly $150,000 from the Bank of Webb for "farming," according to
the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Mississippi. He then
declared bankruptcy and obtained a discharge of both of the above debts
by concealing approximately $800,000 in assets and income, the U.S.
Attorney said. The scheme was discovered by the Agriculture Department's
Inspector General.
In addition to repaying his loans, Wheeler must pay a $10,000 fine and
serve a sentence of two years and 10 months in prison without parole
followed by three years of supervised release.
At the sentencing, Judge Biggers told Wheeler that he would not show
leniency to an individual who had willfully committed his crimes and
refused to admit his wrongdoing.

Eleven New Bankruptcy Judgeships Requested

If you're interested in applying for a bankruptcy judgeship, your job
prospects are looking brighter. Because of the recent rise in bankruptcy
filings, Chief Judge Paul A. Magnuson (D. Minn.), chair of the Judicial
Conference's Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System,
recently requested 11 new bankruptcy judgeships.
"The bankruptcy courts have made great strides in the efficient
processing of cases," Judge Magnuson told the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. "Despite our quest
for efficiency...we need additional bankruptcy judges to provide for the
proper administration of the bankruptcy system now."
The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1995 (H.R. 2604), introduced in Nov. by
Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., would establish four permanent bankruptcy
judgeships in the Central District of California and one permanent
bankruptcy judgeship in the District of Maryland.
One temporary bankruptcy judgeship would be created in each of the
following districts: the Southern District of Florida, the Eastern
District of Michigan, the District of New Jersey, the Eastern District
of New York, the Northern District of New York, and the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania.
While there currently are 326 authorized bankruptcy judgeships, the
number of filings increased 8 percent during the first three quarters of
1995 compared to the first three quarters of 1994 -- a pattern that is
expected to continue.
"We are struggling with an overburdened system," Judge Magnuson told the
subcommittee. "We are not asking our bankruptcy judges to do more -- we
are requiring it. We will continue to seek ways to improve the
bankruptcy system's efficiency, but we critically need these 11
additional bankruptcy judgeships."
Also testifying in support of the legislation was Judge William E.
Anderson (Bankr. W.D. Va.), chair of the Legislative Committee of the
National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, and Chief Judge Paul Mannes
(Bankr. D. Md.).

Top 13 Things Attorneys Wish They Could Tell Judges

1. Be prepared. We thought that the reason attorneys were required to
write prehearing memoranda and clear, detailed moving papers was to
allow the judge to read them before trial.
2. Be open and flexible. Not every relief from stay case is the same.
3. Standardize your rules. Appearing in a new court should not be like a
game of Battleships where you spend all of your time worrying about the
hidden mines.
4. Don't take appeals so personally. You're not infallible.
5. Remember what it was like to be an attorney. You didn't always have
the perfect client or perfect case either.
6. Be humble -- even if you're perfect.
7. Be consistent. Consistency encourages settlements and eliminates
having to quote yourself as contrary authority.
8. Rule promptly. Even if you're wrong it keeps the case moving.
9. Don't publish so many opinions. West Publishing does not give a cash
award for most opinions published by a bankruptcy judge in one year.
10. Give everyone a chance to have his or her complete say -- unless the
case is being televised and will last longer than three months.
11. Be decisive. It's your job.
12. Be prompt -- or approve compensation for counsel waiting time.
13. Be willing to speak to bar associations and civic groups. Attorneys
and the public need to see that you have a mind and a heart.

Top 13 Things Judges Wish They Could Tell Attorneys

1. Be prepared. It works for the Scouts. It will work for you.
2. Be flexible. If a hearing takes an unexpected turn, don't keep going
straight ahead.
3. Be honest and candid. The attorney's license you save may be your
own.
4. Call and ask the judge's clerk about procedural issues if you are
unsure. It beats making dumb mistakes.
5. Don't ask for emergercy relief in every case. Your courthouse
nickname may become "Chicken Little."
6. Be humble -- even if you're perfect.
7. Know your client inside and out -- within professional limits of
course.
8. Be more organized. The judge needs all the help she can get.
9. Have a sense of humor. The law can be funny. The facts can be
hilarious.
10. Kill the court and opposing parties with courtesy and respect. If
you don't, the court may kill you.
11. Losing happens. Prepare yourself and your client for it.
12. Keep cross-examination short and to the point. Boring the judge is
rarely productive.
13. Know the law -- not just the facts before trial. Otherwise, you may
be proving up your opponent's case.

Do You Recognize Your Marketing Program?

By Sally J. Schmidt of Schmidt Marketing Inc. in Burnsville, Minn.
As I travel from law firm to law firm, I often am amazed at the
similarities in how marketing programs are organized or not organized.
In fact, some of the most common marketing structures are downright
dysfunctional.
Whether a firm makes its marketing decisions in one of the ways listed
below is sometimes related to how long the firm has been engaged in
marketing. In other cases, it is a result of the firm's culture and the
degree of individuality that it allows.
Since many of these structures actually can produce negative results,
poor use of resources, internal competition, ill-designed strategies and
potential conflicts, I would like to use a few borrowed clichis to point
out the characteristics of six faulty marketing programs, and the
problems they may create for you, your marketing director, or your firm.
Six Dysfunctional Marketing Programs
1. The Squeaky Wheel Marketing Program
Defining Characteristics: The lawyers who demand the marketing resources
get them.
Discussion: Without a marketing plan or firm-wide goals, decisions about
allocating marketing resources are made on the basis of demand. So it's
possible that the firm is spending money on lawyers who are ineffective
marketers, and activities that will not produce results.
Result: The firm is not working toward any common objectives, and
individual attorneys use firm resources to build their own practices and
potentially portable books of business.
2. The Flavor of the Month Marketing Program
Defining characteristics: Something more "sexy" or interesting always
comes along to capture the attention of the marketing effort.
Discussion: In these programs, the attention span of the marketing
director, marketing committee or marketing partner is relatively short,
and new ideas always receive immediate endorsement. One month it might
be a client survey, the next month a home page, and the next an image
advertising program, with no real commitment to any direction or
strategy.
Result: The firm engages in scattershot initiatives instead of building
a foundation and conducting the follow-up necessary to achieve real
marketing success.
3. The Monkey See, Monkey Do Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: The firm imitates the marketing efforts of its
competitors or other law firms in its market.
Discussion: I can't tell you the number of law firms that have decided
to undertake an activity because another firm is doing it. From hiring
marketing directors to writing newsletters, their strategies simply
reflect those that their competitors employ. My advice is, if another
firm has already cornered the market on an activity, your firm should do
something else; the innovator firm almost always receives the greatest
rewards.
Result: Since these firms do not take time to determine what they are
trying to accomplish (their objectives), and the best ways to achieve
these objectives, their marketing efforts are usually ineffective.
4. The Pass the Buck Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: Something or someone else is always holding
things up in marketing.
Discussion: I think lawyers in this type of marketing organization would
have a hard time selecting just one response to this multiple choice
question:
"I cannot do [whatever I was supposed to do] because:
a. The management committee never responded to my memo
b. The marketing director never set up a meeting
c. The brochure is hopelessly out of date
d. My contact never called me back."
Result: No one ever takes the initiative or implements marketing ideas.
5. The Grass Is Always Greener Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: Other law firms' clients are a lot more
attractive than the ones the firm already has.
Discussion: Usually the result of a poorly designed compensation system
proving too many incentives for origination or not enough for client
retention, this type of program encourages lawyers to pursue new
relationships, sometimes at the expense of existing ones. Taken to the
extreme, some lawyers refuse to work on matters for the client of a
colleague, or to introduce other lawyers into their own client
relationships.
Result: Lawyers are chasing new business while existing (hard-earned)
clients slip away.
6. The Every Man/Woman for Himself/Herself Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: Everyone in the firm gets equal time and
resources for marketing.
Discussion: Obviously, not every lawyer has the same skills or
opportunities with respect to marketing. While everyone should be
encouraged, not everyone warrants the same resources. The internal
competitiveness and lack of coordination usually found in this marketing
structure can be apparent even to prospects and clients, who may see
lawyers from the same firm call on them on consecutive days or notice a
lack of internal communication. Working together undoubtedly sees
greater marketing success.
Result: The lawyers are not taking advantage of their collective
contracts and ideas, and may even be pursuing conflicting opportunities.
Conclusion
There are some firms whose primary goal is just getting the lawyers to
undertake marketing activities -- any lawyers and any activities. And
the last thing a firm should do is construct what the lawyers perceive
to be barriers to marketing, such as processes, controls or approvals.
Still without a better system for making decisions about marketing
strategies and resources, many law firms will find their levels of
activity and expenses going up appreciably without corresponding
results.

DEPRECIATION PROPOSALS ALARM UK COMPANIES

UK STANDARD setters will face concerted opposition from the brewing and
hotel industries to proposed accounting changes which could slash 10
percent or more from the pre-tax profits of both sectors.

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) wants to impose a general
requirement for companies to depreciate the value of their properties.
Current rules enable them to avoid this on the grounds that the
properties are either increasing in value or being regularly maintained
or refurbished.

Shares in the brewing industry fell recently in anticipation of the
change, even though it would have no impact on a company's cash flow.

The proposals are contained in a new ASB discussion paper on
measurement of tangible assets, which the board expects to lead to a
new accounting standard. The paper argues that it is normally
"uneconomic" to provide a limitless extension to the life of a property
through maintenance or refurbishment.

The board also wants all companies to have their properties
independently revalued every five years. About 60 percent of companies
revalue operating properties. These values should also be kept up to
date, the board says.

"Under the present arrangements, companies that revalued their
properties in the late-1980s at the height of the property boom have
since been able to leave these valuations in their accounts unchanged,"
pointed out ASB chairman David Tweedie. One exception to the new rules
would be so-called "trophy" properties, assets of historical
significance which have an unlimited useful economic life and need not
be depreciated. This category might include stores such as Harrods,
prime site city hotels or 16th century coaching inns.

The possible impact of the proposals is shown in the table, supplied by
analysts UBS Global Research. Scenario 1 is conservative, assuming 25
percent residual asset value (being freehold land and remaining bricks
and mortar) and a 50-year depreciation charge. Scenario 2 is more
optimistic at 33 percent residual value, 100-year depreciation on
freeholds and 50 years on long leaseholds.

The board has recommended that investment properties should continue to
be excluded from depreciation (assumed in the table). UBS points out
that this will be particularly welcomed at certain companies such as
P&O and GUS, where investment properties form by far the greatest
proportion of their portfolio. However, the analysts also stress that
this exemption may eventually be lost under EU accounting plans.

Another bright spot for the companies, says UBS, is the paper's
apparent suggestion that an element of repairs and maintenance spend
may be capitalised and depreciated along with the asset.

The majority of this spend is currently written off immediately to P&L,
UBS points out. Therefore earnings benefits could come via deferral of
a part of the expense, potentially offsetting any additional
depreciation hit.

The proposals have been put out to consultation and a draft standard is
likely some time next year. According to an ASB spokesman, a final
standard is unlikely before 1998"at the earliest".

SHARE ACCOUNTING CRACKDOWN

NEW PROPOSALS aimed at tightening up accounting for employee share
ownership schemes have been published in the UK. The Accounting
Standards Board's Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) wants to see the real
value of shares - not merely their nominal amount - charged to the
profit and loss account.

The new proposals would apply to Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) as
well as more long-standing types of scheme. LTIPs, a new type of
executive share scheme which links rewards to performance, have become
popular since the Greenbury Committee on executive pay recommended they
should replace existing executive schemes last year.

Companies' use of LTIPs is an ongoing source of controversy. A recent
study by corporate governance analysts Pension Investment Research
Consultants found a host of top UK plcs were breaching good practice
guidelines on their use (see TA 5913).

Under the new proposals, adjustments would be made to the profit and
loss account charge to take account of such factors as: changes in the
probability of performance criteria being met; conditional awards
lapsing; or purchases of shares at different prices (either to hedge
the cost of conditional awards or meet the cost of final awards).

In cases where options are granted at a discount (ie the exercise price
is below the market value of the shares at the date of grant), the UITF
said, the discount should be recognised as an expense over the
appropriate period. One example is SAYE schemes, where the exercise
price is normally at a 20 percent discount.

Executive share options schemes are unlikely to be affected by the
proposals, as Greenbury recommended that executive share options should
never be issued at a discount.

The proposals have been sent to finance directors of listed companies
for comments.

A deadline of November 7 was set for responses.

SCOTS SEEK GUIDANCE ON PRELIMS

THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) has called
for new guidance on compiling preliminary results announcements, after
a survey found that companies currently publish a wide variety of
information. ICAS also wants the figures to be audited.

The institute analysed the prelims of 20 top 500 companies and compared
them with the information contained in the annual report. To its
surprise, the study revealed not all companies included a profit and
loss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement in prelims as a
matter of course.

Every company published a P&L but one omitted a balance sheet and four
failed to include a cash flow statement. Inclusion of the statement of
total recognised gains and losses (8), the reconciliation of movements
in shareholders funds (9), and the historical cost profit and loss
statement were found to be still more variable.

Analysis of narrative content showed that all but one company in each
case included a chairman's statement and financial highlights. But only
11 and 10 respectively published a financial review or chief
executive's statement.

ICAS has called on the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) to develop a
non-mandatory statement of best practice to improve consistency.

The Scots also argue that the market would be better served if the data
were audited.

"Using audited information would result in the preliminary announcement
being an extract of the annual report which provides a consistent level
of information across all companies," said Graeme Bissett, convener of
the institute's Accounting Standards Committee.

At present, Stock Exchange rules stipulate that prelim figures must
have been "agreed" with the auditors. Bissett claimed this requirement
had been"intepreted differently by different companies".

The ASB is expected to review the subject of prelims soon and ICAS's
comments are the latest contribution to an expanding debate.

The Big Six firm KPMG recently argued that prelims could be materially
curtailed if they were largely replaced by the immediate filing of
audited statutory results (see TA 5914).

GOVERNANCE POLICIES SHOWN TO BE UNRELATED TO PROFITS

A NEW STUDY has failed to identify any link between good corporate
governance and improved financial performance in the vast majority of
leading European companies. Only in the UK was a "slight correlation"
detected.

The finding comes in a survey of European corporate governance by
Deminor, a Brussels-based consultancy which advises minority
shareholders. The widespread absence of such a link, the company
speculates, suggests the relationship between corporate governance and
financial performance could only be proved "in the medium-term". Large
American pension funds have established a link on the basis of much
larger statistical data, the report points out. This explains why a
growing number of Anglo-Saxon and other institutional investors
"explicitly take corporate governance standards into account when
investing in European companies", Deminor adds.

Overall, the UK was furthest advanced in the field, ahead of (in order)
France, Germany and Belgium. Holland was placed last among the five
countries surveyed. A large majority of Dutch companies, the report
says, employs fiduciary mechanisms and structures unknown elsewhere
which produce "serious and significant distortions between ownership
and control".

Deminor analysed how shareholders were treated in main stock indices of
each country - FT-30 (UK), CAC-40 (France), DAX (Germany), AEX
(Holland) and BEL-20 (Belgium). Publicly available information from a
total of 140 companies was surveyed, including annual reports and
companies' bye-laws.

Scores were awarded against a range of criteria, such as use of board
committees and quality of information to shareholders. Final rankings
were then compared with financial performance based on EPS/Stock Price
ratio.

In addition to the rankings, three other main conclusions emerged. Some
corporate governance issues are neglected everywhere; countries differ
widely on certain criteria; and there remains much room for
improvement.

Few corporations provided information on directors' independence and
the internal working of the board. On director's remuneration and the
issue of board committees, however, a clear divergence emerged.

British companies complying with the Greenbury Code reveal much about
how they pay directors. But in most other countries, with the exception
of a few French companies, shareholders are given only an aggregate
amount of total remuneration. Other countries have also been slower
than the UK (and to a lesser extent France) to respond to the idea of
establishing specialised committees for tasks such as directors'
remuneration and selection.

The UK, Germany and Belgium were found to be the only countries that
largely adhere to the "one-share - one vote" principle. In France and
Holland, shareholders holding multiple voting rights are more common.

In most countries, Deminor says, voting at general meetings and filing
resolutions remain a problem. "Cumbersome" deposit requirements and
problematic proxy voting are identified as two areas where improvements
are needed. Companies incorporated in special forms (eg Societes en
Commandites par Actions in France, Stichting Administatiekantoor in the
Netherlands)"are often used to seal off management from shareholders",
the study alleges.

Despite the wide disparities in performance, Deminor believes across-
the-board reform is inevitable.

BACKING FOUND FOR DERIVATIVES STATUS QUO

NEW EVIDENCE has emerged which will lend useful ammunition to opponents
of a planned overhaul of derivative accounting rules in the United
States. A survey of 139 organisations which use derivatives has found a
high-level of consistency in their accounting for the four main types
of derivative instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options).

Over 90 percent of respondents match the accounting with the economics
of the transaction, by recognising the effects of the derivative
instrument at the same time as the hedged item. The survey, by KPMG
Peat Marwick, was released on October 11, the deadline date for
comments on derivatives accounting proposals issued in the summer by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board. FASB wants derivatives to be
carried on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value, a
suggestion which has sparked controversy (see TA 5911).

Overall, 96 percent of respondents require correlation between the
effects of the derivative and the hedged item, while 91 percent require
the derivative to be linked to specific assets or liabilities or
homogenous pools.

Some 99 percent of those surveyed reported that they require
derivatives instruments to be designated and documented as relating to
a particular risk management strategy in order to qualify for risk
management accounting.

The vast majority of organisations require a specific assessment of the
risks being managed for derivative instruments to qualify for special
treatment, though practice varied in the criteria used to define and
evaluate risk. Just 18 percent of respondents believed FASB's proposals
would be an improvement on present practice - though there was
recognition that modifications were needed.

"The survey results indicate the respondents utilise a similar
accounting framework," commented Ken Russell, a partner in KPMG Peat
Marwick's professional practice department."Guidance from the FASB is
needed to establish specific details of how the existing framework is
to be applied."

DIRECTORS' PAY RETREAT BY AUSTRALIAN UIG

THE AUSTRALIAN Urgent Issues Group (UIG) has shied away from the issue
of forcing companies to decide how much of a director's pay is linked
to performance.

After several meetings considering the issue, UIG said in a statement
that the subject should be addressed through a full review of
disclosure requirements - something UIG made clear is beyond its remit.

UIG plans to issue a checklist of items that should be included in
adding up the director's remuneration.

`BLACK HOLE' FEARS PROMPT MD&A PLEA

THE AUSTRALIAN Society of CPAs says Australian companies should be
required to include management discussion and analysis (MD&A)-style
statements in their annual reports.

Potential investors are "faced with a black hole" when it comes to
obtaining a meaningful assessment of Australian businesss performance
or prospects, claimed ASCPA national president Professor Scott
Henderson.

Little known in Australia, but employed extensively in the US and the
UK, MD&A-type reports require company directors to explain current
results and comment on future performance.

"A handful of companies in Australia provide MD&A narratives, chiefly
subsidiaries of US companies and those listed on overseas exchanges.
But there is a long way to go before the practice becomes a standard
feature of good corporate governance," Henderson added.

CADBURY COMPLIANCE CONTINUES TO CLIMB

COMPLIANCE WITH the Cadbury Code on corporate governance increased in
1995, according to a survey of 100 top UK-listed companies. The study,
by Coopers & Lybrand, found that compliance among FT 100 companies has
reached 97 percent.

The main area of non-compliance is the code's recommendation of
appointing at least three non-executives. Among smaller listed
companies, 27 percent failed to adhere to this principle.

Elsewhere, the survey comments on the recommendation that directors
should report on the effectiveness of their systems of internal
financial control. This has focused the attention of boards on this
subject in a way that has never happened before, it says. However,
descriptions of internal financial control were found to vary in length
and quality, with better companies giving tangible examples of steps
taken.

Unsurprisingly, few companies are willing to indicate where there may
be weaknesses. And only a "handful" gave opinions on the effectiveness
of internal control systems.

BITTER PILL FOR SUGAR ON PLAYERS' TRANSFERS

ONE OF English soccer's top club owners has urged the industry to write
off player values over the life of their contracts to reflect the
impact of a European Court ruling expected to decimate the money-
spinning transfer system.

Alan Sugar, who owns 40 percent of Tottenham Hotspur, made the plea as
he announced a one-off player write-down of #7.29 million ($11 million)
that has sharply cut the club's profits. Under the so-called Bosman
ruling, clubs can no longer demand a fee for out-of-contract players
seeking to move between clubs in the European Community (see CA 5913).
The adjustment reflects Tottenham's assessment of the diminution of
player values this may cause.

The move reduced the club's net assets from #37.4 million to #25.3
million.

Tottenham was the only club in England's top division to capitalise
player values in 1994/95. The write-down reflects its decision to begin
amortising to residual values of zero.

Newcastle United, which valued players at #10.9 million in its 1993/94
accounts, reacted to Bosman by taking players off the balance sheet
altogether.

CHARITY GOVERNANCE LAPSES DISCOVERED

UK CHARITIES urgently need to improve key aspects of their financial
management in the wake of the Cadbury report, new evidence suggests.

A study of the financial governance of 18 charities by Birmingham
Business School found that few have independent audit committees
consisting of non-executives. Those which do rarely exclude executive
trustees and often include paid executives.

The authors, professors Trevor Gambling and Rowan Jones, ask whether
all charities should have an audit committee. They suggest such a
committee could meet a minimum of twice a year with only the external
auditor and non-executive trustees in attendance.

The report, sponsored by the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales and the Charities Aid Foundation, raises a number of issues.

Not one of the charities surveyed had a coherent policy on the
accumulation and disposal of reserves. Large proportions or even
multiples of annual expenditure are being either "taken out of thin
air" or small surpluses are squirreled away "against a rainy day".

The report asks if charities should spend the whole of their income
every year, subject to making provision for long-term liabilities and
properly calculated future reserves.

New arrangements for financial reporting by charities in England and
Wales came into force this year. These include a statutory requirement
for the financial statements of unincorporated charities, as well as
charities constituted as companies, to be audited by registered
auditors.

The new arrangements also impose a duty on charities' auditors to
report certain matters which may be found in the course of their work
to the watchdog Charity Commission. In October, the Auditing Practices
Board issued new guidance on the audit of charities which takes the new
requirements into account.

DATA SHORTFALL HIGHLIGHTED FOR ANALYSIS OF DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVES DISCLOSURES by UK companies do not generate enough
information for analysts and fail to meet "best practice" guidelines
laid down by the Accounting Standards Board. So concludes a new survey
by Edinburgh accounts monitor, Company Reporting.

The study found that those companies which include derivatives in their
accounts do so at nominal value. "From this measure alone an analyst
would find it very hard to formulate an idea of value and risk," the
survey concludes.

The ASB published new proposals on the disclosure and measurement of
financial instruments in the summer (see TA 5912). They contain interim
recommendations designed to improve current practice until new
standards appear.

The ASB's long-term aim of current valuation was used by only 5 percent
of relevant companies analysed."It is clear that present practice is
some distance from the ASB's `best practice' specifically in terms of
current value and risk measurement," the report concludes.

LIFE INSURANCE STANDARDS ARE OVERHAULED

A NEW series of actuarial standards will help investors and analysts
compare the results of Australian life insurance companies.

The first standard, released in mid-October, will force life companies
to revamp the way they calculate profits and their obligations to
policy holders.

Actuarial Standard 1.01 on Valuation of Policy Liabilities, produced by
the Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board (LIASB), overlaps with a
draft accounting standard released by the Australian Accounting
Standards Board (AASB) in August. But AS 1.01 differs in certain
details, in particular on how to calculate profit margins from life
policies.

When the AASB released its own draft standard, ED 73, some of the
details on the calculations - known as "premium splitting" - had not
been finalised and are not expected to be finalised for another three
years.

LIASB chairman Peter Vinson said the differences between the actuarial
and the accounting standard were at the"third level of detail". The
LIASB approach was the result of almost a decade of discussions in
which he had been involved, he added.

Vinson hopes the AASB's approach will eventually dovetail with the
LIASB's. He believed it is still quite possible for both sides to
adjust their version of how profits should be treated so they ensure
they eventually agree.

There had not been sufficient time to ensure the two standards were
identical where they overlapped, he stressed, as the LIASB had been
required to produce a standard to take effect from December 31 this
year.

The new actuarial standard requires profits from a life policy to be
recognised over the duration of the policy - rather than be brought to
account when the policy is signed or be recognised in any other way the
life group chooses. Practices have hitherto varied widely.

Known as the Margin on Services (MoS) approach, the method ensures that
the life groups can only declare profits as they actually deliver the
associated services, and those services are paid for by client
premiums.

The actuarial standard also sets out the method for calculating how
much money the life company is required to pay out on a policy - its
obligations to the policy holder - and requires that liability to be
shown on the books.

Vinson said the new standard allowed the performances of life groups to
be compared for the first time. The new standardised approach to
financial reporting would assist the anticipated future public floats
of several major life companies and add another measure of
competitiveness within the industry, he added.

Actuarial standards have the status of law in the same way as
accounting standards and actuaries will soon have to deal with a
succession of them. AS 1.01 will soon be followed by standards dealing
with solvency and capital adequacy.

BUTTE SPARED GROUND-BREAKING COURT ACTION

AN ELEVENTH-HOUR climb-down by the directors of listed excavation group
Butte Mining has spared the company the dubious honour of being the
first to be sued by UK accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting
Review Panel (FRRP).

Butte has reluctantly agreed to make a revision to its accounts for the
year to June 1995, turning a profit of #339,000 ($530,000) into a loss
of #628,000.

Formed in 1990, the panel has never yet used its ultimate sanction of
court action to force companies into line with accounting rules. But it
appears to have come close on this occasion.

"In view of [the directors'] undertaking, the panel has refrained from
undertaking proceedings under section 245B of the Companies Act 1985,"
the panel said in a statement. Butte responded by saying it was "not in
the interests of the shareholders to pursue this matter any further".

The affair concerns accounting for shares in mining company Gem River
Corporation. A Butte spokesman said the company had received a
"considerable sum" in shares in return for organising an exploration
programme for Gem River in Montana and helping to float the company.

Some shares were sold immediately on the Alberta Stock Exchange, but 70
percent were "escrowed" and could not be traded immediately because the
programme's success could not be guaranteed.

Despite this, Butte realised the escrowed shares as profits in its 1995
accounts. The panel maintained that profit should only have been
included on the shareholding that had been realised at the time the
accounts were completed.

"We knew exactly what was there and believed profit realisation was
reasonably certain," the Butte spokesman said. He also complained it
had taken "some considerable time" for Butte to get a "clear opinion"
from the panel on what the treatment should be.

The revision has led to a downward adjustment in 1995 profits of
#967,000. The spokesman refused to speculate on whether the profit
would be realised in 1996. Butte Mining, which collapsed in 1991 and is
now a litigation vehicle only, is no stranger to controversy. A number
of the company's original directors were later charged with conspiracy
to defraud. And in June this year the High Court threw out a #110
million-law suit which Butte brought against the Big Six firm Ernst &
Young.

Butte claimed E&Y predecessor firm Arthur Young had given negligent
advice when it was reporting accountant on Butte's 1987 flotation and
in connection with the company's acquisition of North Butte Mining in
1988. The company had unsuccessfully tried to pursue the case earlier
in the US state of Montana. But the suit was dismissed in 1995 when the
Montana District Court determined it had no jurisdiction to hear the
case.

Butte resurrected the claim in the UK in the form of a counterclaim to
an E&Y writ for unpaid fees. As well as claiming #110 million which the
company claimed its shareholders had lost as a result of the firm's
negligence, the company's new management claimed an extra #110 million
in what Butte calculated was the interest accrued on the damages.
However, Mr Justice Lightman ruled it was not"just or appropriate" for
Butte to be allowed to resurrect the claim.

GERMAN GOVERNANCE SHAKE-UP SET FOR 1998

GERMANY HAS moved one step closer to the reform of corporate governance
with a set of proposed changes which may become law in 1998.

A parliamentary committee headed by the ministers of justice and
economics wants stricter controls on statutory audits and heavier
responsibilities for supervisory board members at German companies. The
proposals stop short of any radical change, however, and may well be
diluted before they are presented to parliament.

On statutory audits, the committee's report is a summary of ideas which
have already gained broad acceptance with German corporations and are
welcomed by the accounting profession.

In future, the statutory auditor of a German company will be appointed
by the supervisory board rather than the board of managing directors.
That means the auditor's independence need not be reconciled with
business interests.

"It doesn't make sense for the management under scrutiny to decide what
aspects of the business should be audited," said a source at the
justice ministry in Bonn.

In addition, every member of the supervisory board will have the right
to an advance copy of the auditor's report and the auditor will be
obliged by law to attend the supervisory board meeting on the year-end
accounts. Big Six firms in Germany say they already do both
voluntarily.

According to the justice ministry, the committee is also considering
ways to make the auditor's certificate more detailed and meaningful.

The stock phrases of unqualified approval still used by practically all
auditors, including the Big Six firms, include neither comment nor
analysis. But no detailed suggestions will be made until discussions
have taken place with accounting profession lobbyists.

Other reforms show that the committee's approach is essentially
conservative. An official petition against the supervisory board will
still have to be backed by 5 percent of voting capital, compared with
10 percent before. "We don't want the supervisory board to be
undermined by gratuitous petitions," is the view from the justice
ministry.

The committee has also refused to bow to public opinion by reducing the
maximum number of supervisory board positions any individual may hold.
"It's very difficult to set fixed limits," said the justice ministry
source."It depends on the person's intellectual powers. For some
people, even one board position would be too many."

Only one of the proposals is not already standard in countries with
reformed systems of corporate governance. This is that banks which hold
a shareholding of more than 5 percent in a listed company may no longer
exercise their custody clients' voting rights in that company as well.

Even institutional investors in Germany typically allow their custodian
bank to decide how to use their voting rights, often giving the banks
an additional voting strength of several percent. This additional
voting power makes the banks even more powerful, say critics of the
current system.

But the government is concerned about the implications. It does not
want shareholder representation at companies' annual meetings to
decline, but knows it is unrealistic to expect all investors to do
their own voting, even by post.

One solution suggested by the justice ministry is to give an individual
executive responsibility for avoiding any conflicts of interest between
the bank's voting rights and those of its customers. From the banks
comes a suggestion to set up independent voting companies to handle
voting for custody clients.

None of these changes will occur quickly. After lobbying, the draft law
is expected to go to Helmut Kohl's cabinet at the beginning of next
year and will reach parliament a year later -at the earliest.

ASB PRODUCES `GENUINE' CASH FLOW STANDARD

UK COMPANIES will soon become the first in the world to produce "pure"
cash flow statements.

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) has revised FRS 1, the cash flow
standard issued in 1991. Its aim is to improve communication of
information on liquidity, insolvency and financial adaptability.

The original FRS 1 brought the UK in line with international practice
by scrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour of
a cash flow statement. But its practical use convinced the board
further changes were needed.

Under the 1991 standard, the cash flow statement reported movements in
cash and cash equivalents (investments with maturities of up to three
months). But, because treasury management practices differ, the ASB
grew concerned that this may give rise to uncertainty about the
investments to be included as cash equivalents.

Under the revised version, only movements in actual cash (defined as
cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts) will be
shown as cash flows.

Proposals for reform of FRS 1 published last December in exposure draft
FRED 10 have survived with only minor refinements. Other main changes
include a new section providing expanded disclosures on the management
of liquid resources.

The orders and headings for cash flows have been changed to bring them
into line with those used in directors' commentaries (eg the operating
and financial review).

The cash flow statement has also been tied in more closely with the
balance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flow on the widely used
financial indicator, net debt.

Cash inflows and outflows may now be shown net in certain restricted
conditions, for example, if they relate to a constantly renewed short-
term facility or a commercial paper programme.

The revised FRS1 becomes mandatory on March 23 next year.

As The Corporate Accountant went to press, the International Accounting
Standards Committee published proposals on accounting for pensions and
employee benefits which are out of step with current UK practice.

Exposure draft E54 recommends valuations of future benefit obligations
at each balance-sheet date (not every three years as is standard in the
UK). The draft says these should reflect market conditions at the year
end, in contrast with the UK practice of using longer term actuarial
estimates.

ANDERSEN REJECTS BLAME FOR WICKES

Big Six star performer Arthur Andersen is adamant it could not have
done any more to thwart a multi-million accounting cover-up at UK DIY
retailer Wickes. Paul Rogerson reports

ARTHUR ANDERSEN is refusing to accept any blame for failing to spot
accounting errors which led audit client Wickes, the DIY chain, to
overstate profits by #51 million ($80 million).

The firm responded defiantly to a letter to shareholders, despatched by
the company on October 16, which claimed Andersen "should have reacted
more effectively" to "warning signals" of false accounting.

"We were the victims of every auditor's nightmare - a skilfully
executed, collusive fraud which deceived everybody," risk management
partner Chris Nunn said.

The incident has once again focused attention on how much
responsibility auditors should bear for detecting deliberate deception.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is
conducting a campaign to alert firms to the threat of fraud in an
environment where financial scandals are increasingly likely to trigger
"deep-pocket" negligence claims (see TA 5913).

In this case Andersen appears to have escaped a lawsuit. After
consulting with its lawyers Wickes has decided to take no action. But
the company has reserved the right to do so "in the event that further
matters emerge".

Wickes shares have been suspended on the London Stock Exchange since
June, when it was first announced problems had been found in the timing
of the recognition of profits from suppliers' rebate schemes.

The irregularities resulted from discrepancies between the supply
contracts reported to senior management and those actually negotiated
by buying staff.

Under arrangements which are common in the retail industry, Wickes and
its suppliers negotiated incentive arrangements under which the chain
would be rewarded for achieving target levels of sales of particular
products with either a discount or a rebate.

It also took up-front payments from suppliers for marketing costs or in
return for shelf-space, often tied to a pledge to achieve a certain
volume of sales.

The letter to shareholders, from new chairman Michael von Brentano,
follows an investigation into the company's accounts by Price
Waterhouse and lawyers Linklaters & Paines.

The probe has confirmed there was "serious mismanagement" in certain
Wickes operations. Problems were centred on the company's buying
department, where investigators found "deliberate misrepresentation" of
certain deals with suppliers.

The rebates and contributions which senior management required the
department to obtain ran into tens of millions of pounds. They amounted
to #13 million in 1993 and rose to #30 million in 1994 and #57 million
in 1995.

In many cases these sums were booked as profit in the year the deals
were signed rather than spread over the period of the supply
agreements, the investigation found.

In some instances the rebates booked to profit were not actually
receivable or Wickes was required to meet unrealistic volume targets.
Some deals were also found to be uncommercial.

As a result of the deception, the group's 1994 and 1995 accounts
included significant levels of rebates and contributions which had not
been earned. The necessary adjustments announced by von Brentano have
slashed Wickes's consolidated shareholders' funds by #51 million.

The probe found' that "ultimate responsibility" for the debacle must be
borne by former chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum. The
investigators found no evidence that he or any other directors were
aware of the deception.

But Sweetbaum and a number of other individuals agreed to repay
substantial sums in profit-linked bonuses. Wickes has agreed to take no
further action against them.

Andersen approved an accounting policy for supplier rebates and
contributions, but the "underlying substance of many deals did not
accord with it", the report said. Instances came to light in 1995 of
amounts being booked to profit earlier than was justified.

"The board believes that senior management and the auditors should have
reacted more effectively to these warning signals. These matters were
not brought to the attention of the Audit Committee, which was assured
by senior management and by Arthur Andersen that the rebates and the
contributions were shown properly in the group accounts."

Andersen is to resign as auditor when work on restating the 1995
accounts is finished but Nunn was adamant the firm could not reasonably
have been expected to do any more to uncover the deception. He pointed
to the letter's concession that "false or misleading documents produced
to the auditors misdescribed the nature of suppliers' payments and
concealed the true position. "Third party confirmations are the highest
quality verifications an auditor can receive," said Nunn.

If they are falsified, the auditor has little chance to discover what's
going on until the amounts become too big to conceal."

Under UK auditing standard SAS 110, auditors must plan and conduct
audit work to have a reasonable expectation of detecting a material
misstatement in the accounts caused by fraud.

"In 1995 the work that was done confirmed to the best of the evidence
available that there were no hidden agendas or conditionalities
attached to the supplier rebates," said Nunn.

"Even now, having focused on what we might have done differently, one
has to say the answer is `very little'. If every report points in a
certain direction it is difficult for auditors simply to say `you're
lying'. It will always be the case where one is fighting this kind of
thing, one cannot be 100 percent certain of detecting it."

It is reported that neither the UK's Serious Fraud Office nor the
Department of Trade and Industry is likely to take further action.
A"thorough review" of the group's controls and procedures is now under
way.

Disciplinary action has been taken against two ex-directors with
responsibility for the buying department and more is planned against
certain middle-ranking executives and junior employees.

NOT SUCH GREAT EXPECTATIONS

The Hampel committee on corporate governance is proceeding with
extreme caution. Paul Rogerson reports

IT WOULD be folly to expect anything too radical from the committee on
corporate governance led by Ronald Hampel. Or so it would seem, judging
by a recent speech by the ICI chairman to a conference attended by 100
senior figures from business, academia and the accounting profession.

Hampel rarely speculated on how his body might "carry the torch" handed
to it by the Cadbury and Greenbury bodies on corporate governance and
executive pay (respectively). Instead, he focused on what he viewed as
the damaging fall-out of the high profile lately attained by these
subjects in the UK. A "visitor from Mars" would believe that "a new
industry" had developed in corporate governance, said Hampel. It was
quite worrying, he said, that this had been attended "almost by
hysteria". In reviewing the landmark Cadbury code for listed companies,
his group seeks to provide an environment in which business can prosper
and grow, Hampel said.

"That is a fundamental behind all our deliberations. We must not
stifle, we must stimulate," he said. Responding to a question, Hampel
denied that the Cadbury code is stifling business. But the furore that
has grown up around corporate governance had "denigrated industry" he
alleged.

The Greenbury recommendations on executive pay were squarely in his
sights. "All the public debate has been about boardroom excesses and
99.9 percent of business has been dragged down with it. It needs to be
said all the time that business must prosper."

The Hampel committee has sponsored research into Cadbury and Greenbury.
However, Hampel said it would only have two sets of annual reports on
which to comment on the latter, so it would be "dangerous to be too
prescriptive".

The conference, at the London headquarters of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales on November 1, coincided
with the launch of a vast consultation exercise by Hampel. The
committee is seeking feedback from a wide range of bodies, including
some in Europe and North America, on different aspects of its remit.
The most important questions to which it is seeking answers are
paraphrased below. When responses have been assessed, Hampel aims to
issue a draft report in the middle of next year "to see if people think
our conclusions are appropriate". A final report will follow at the end
of 1997.

Given the political context of Hampel's deliberations, the subject of
corporate governance will continue to generate controversy. The
conference coincided with the publication of a report to the committee
by employer's body, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The
CBI explicitly rejects the concept favoured by the opposition Labour
Party that "stakeholders" such as employees, customers and suppliers
should be represented in boardrooms. The interest of shareholders
should continue to be paramount, it says, dismissing the idea these
interests could be accommodated in German-style two-tier boards.

Hampel may have set a laissez-faire tone for the conference, but it was
not adopted by every speaker. Anne Simpson, joint managing director of
governance consultancy Pension Investment Research Consultants, had "no
sympathy" for those who think companies are over-regulated.
Shareholders are beginning to turn up at AGMs "to ask questions and not
just eat the sandwiches", she said.

Simpson demanded an end to the rubber-stamping of management decisions
in votes and the end of discretionary voting. Increasing shareholder
activity has led some companies to try and rewrite the rules, she
added. They included British Aerospace, which moved to get rid of
the"crucial" shareholders vote on its annual report and accounts.
Ronald Hampel is a non-executive director of British Aerospace.

GERMANY:  DOUBLE BOOK-KEEPING FOR DAIMLER AS REGULATORS REFUSE US GAAP

GERMANY'S BIGGEST industrial company, Daimler-Benz, has failed to
persuade domestic accounting regulators that they should accept its US
GAAP accounts. The result is that Daimler will have to continue
publishing earnings calculated in accordance with Germany's commercial
code alongside its US GAAP results.

The Justice Ministry's decision has serious implications for Deutsche
Telekom, which will face the same double book-keeping difficulties as
Daimler next year when its shares are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.

Jurgen Funck, state secretary at the Justice Ministry, indicated early
in 1995 that a concession could be granted from the requirement to
publish group accounts that comply with German reporting standards
provided enough companies wanted to avail of it.

In recent weeks, however, the ministry indicated several times that
opponents of the reform had gained the upper hand. Now Herbert Biener,
head of accounting standards at the ministry, has made clear that the
proposed reform has been defeated."We're not going to make this change
just for the sake of two or three companies," he said.

First proposed in March 1995, the proposed concession would have
extricated Daimler-Benz from the double-accounting dilemma it has faced
since its shares were first listed in New York in 1993. Since then,
Daimler has been obliged to produce group accounts under both US GAAP
and the German commercial code and has come up with earnings figures
which are sometimes poles apart.

Led by Bayer and Schering, the opponents of reform were clearly
unwilling to assist Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Telekom in their quest
for foreign capital by agreeing that their US GAAP consolidated
accounts could be also acceptable for domestic regulatory purposes.
They believe that, rather than US GAAP, international accounting
standards (IASs) should become the benchmark for German companies
seeking to raise capital abroad.

While Biener believes that corporations and their accountants should
voluntarily adopt whatever reporting requirements are demanded by
overseas capital markets, he makes no bones about his preference for
IASs. Speaking at a recent accounting conference in Gottingen, Biener
repeatedly criticised Daimler's technique of double-accounting and the
fact that it can produce contradictory results.

IASC secretary-general Bryan Carsberg, who also spoke at the
conference, welcomed the Germans' support for IASs. But he acknowledged
the serious dilemma facing companies which will need a listing on the
New York Stock Exchange before IASs are endorsed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission - which will not happen until 1999 at the earliest.

Carsberg said that companies in that position would have no choice but
to produce US GAAP accounts, but he hoped that they would use options
most comparable with IAS so that it would be easy to change again to
IASs after 1999. Karel van Hulle, head of accounting at the European
Commission, said it is doubtful that companies would want to return to
IASs after adopting US GAAP standards, simply because of the upheaval
involved.

It remains to be seen how Daimler will respond, now that the company
faces the prospect of having to produce a US GAAP reconciliation for at
least the next four years.

UNITED KINGDOM:  ASB ANNOUNCES REVISION OF CASH FLOW STANDARD

THE UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) has announced proposals to
revise FRS 1, the standard it issued in September 1991 on cash flow
statements. The proposals are contained in exposure draft FRED 10 which
the standard-setter issued on December 7.

Although FRS 1 brought the UK into line with international practice by
scrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour of a
cash flow statement, ASB chairman David Tweedie acknowledged that the
time has come for more improvement.

"The cash flow statement introduced by FRS 1 itself broke new ground
and has proved both popular and valuable," Tweedie said. "We have now
gained sufficient experience in its practical use to be able to propose
significant improvements."

FRED 10's main features include a proposal to switch to a "pure" cash
flow statement, with the concept of cash equivalents being dropped. The
exposure draft also proposes that expanded disclosures be provided in a
new section dealing with the management of liquid resources. FRED 10
would change the order and headings for cash flow to bring them into
line with those used by directors in their commentaries on operations
and finances. It would also tie the cash flow statement more closely
into the balance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flows on the
widely-used financial indicator, net debt.

"Our aim has been to make the cash flow statement simpler to understand
and more descriptive of the way business is conducted," Tweedie said.
"The board believes that the changes represent a significant step
forward, and will be of real benefit to preparers and users of
accounts. Not least of the improvements is the move to pure cash flow
statements."

Comments of the new exposure draft should be sent to the ASB before
March 8.

SMALL COMPANIES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

Separately, a "draft" exposure draft was published in December on
proposals that would abolish the requirement to comply with the ASB's
standards for 90 percent of UK companies.

The proposed standard, Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller
Enterprises, was published by the Working Party on Big GAAP/Little GAAP
and would affect 900,000 companies.

A key feature of the proposed standard is that small companies should
have a special reporting code of their own which would be much shorter
and less complex than the existing body of accounting standards.

It would apply to all companies currently defined as small by company
law - broadly those with a turnover of less than #2.8 million ($4.3
million). The working party expects to be able to link the proposed
standard with auditing rules, allowing the audit report to use the
words"true and fair . . . as applicable to small companies".

If the proposals find support, the aim is to pass the paper to the ASB
which has the power to turn the draft into a standard after the usual
process of seeking comments on an exposure draft. Comments should be
returned to the working party by March 29.

UNITED STATES:  70% OF BANK SECURITIES MAY NOW BE RECLASSIFIED

A RECENT decision by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
was expected to produce a major shift in bank securities portfolios by
the end of 1995. As many as 70 percent of securities could be
reclassified as "available for sale" as bankers seek to maintain
funding flexibility under the new rule, which is an effort to give
investors a more accurate picture of a bank's worth.

In November, FASB decided to allow banks to move securities from "held
to maturity" to"available for sale" before the end of the year. The one-
time adjustments can be accomplished without forcing the institution to
revalue all of the securities in its held-to-maturity category.

The action already is having an effect. For instance, the First State
Bank of Texas in Denton will use the new rule to make a larger share of
its securities available for sale, probably at a 70-30 split compared
with the previous even split between the two accounts. The 70-30 split
is expected to become common among banks large and small by the end of
the year.

FASB is moving toward making banks mark more of their assets to market
values. FASB has also formally issued a draft of a proposed rule
eliminating some of the advantages of securitisations and long-term
repurchase agreements. Under the proposal, a securitised borrowing that
extends over 90 days will be treated as a purchase and sale (see
report, p8).

It is all part of a continual, incremental effort to put more of the
balance sheet under mark-to-market rules. Some analysts expect the
board to consider marking liabilities to market sometime next year.

ACCOUNTANTS GIVEN ULTIMATUM ON SELF-REGULATION

THE GERMAN Government has served notice on the country's auditors that
they must improve self-regulation to avoid having practice rules
imposed on the profession by law.

Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingen
in early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting policy at
the Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputy
chairman of the professional body of German accountants, the Institut
der Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).

Biener took issue with the profession's new quality standards,
introduced just a few days earlier (CAI 64). Even under the new rules,
he said, German accountants would still not be obliged to actively seek
out evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts.

"The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said.
"Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The law
allows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obliged
to argue things out with the company."

Biener also criticised the IdW for its delay in dealing with
shortcomings in the 1994 switch by Bayer, Schering and Heidelberger
Zements to international accounting standards. Gross countered that it
was not feasible for the IdW's main practice committee to intervene at
an earlier stage, but that the improvements it suggested would be
incorporated into the companies' 1995 accounts.

Biener acknowledged that Germany's leading accounting firms are world-
class, but expressed concern about the profession's rank- and-file
members. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise to
audits which are just average, rather they should allow accountants
with an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which is
up to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died out
because they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession has
grasped that message."

German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regain
public confidence. "Our audits have become suspect," Biener said.
"Sooner or later, German accounts will no longer be accepted by the
international community."

In turn, Biener himself is under pressure from the European Commission
to introduce an accounting regulatory regime along the lines of those
that exist in other EU member states. Addressing the Gottingen
conference, Karel van Hulle, the commission's head of accounting
policy, pointed out that most EU countries have already established
national standard-setting bodies that can further Europe's accounting
interests in the deliberations of the International Accounting
Standards Committee (IASC).

Biener argued that bodies whose agendas are dominated by accounting
interests are not in the best position for regulating the profession.
He said that since all accounting firms have their own commercial
interests, they may avoid making initiatives to change the status quo.
Biener, therefore, suggested that German, and in turn European
companies, set up a regulatory body modelled on the US Financial
Standards Accounting Board.

In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea."I
won't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] body
operates in a sensible fashion," he said. Gross of the IdW countered
that the main practice committee is already operating as a standard-
setter.

DAIMLER-BENZ'S US GAAP PIONEER FOUND DEAD

GERHARD LIENER, the man who revolutionised the German accounting world
by presiding over the publication of the first US GAAP accounts for a
German company, was found dead at his home near Munich in mid-December.
The former finance director of Daimler- Benz, who was 63, is believed
by police to have committed suicide.

Liener was regarded as a traitor by some elements of Germany's
financial establishment because he was instrumental in Daimler's
decision to switch to US GAAP accounts as a condition of listing its
shares in New York. This resulted in a confusing system of double
accounting, with the company's US GAAP results often differing
significantly from those calculated under German accounting
regulations.

Daimler's move is still resented by some of its corporate peers which
had hoped that by presenting a united front in negotiations with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) they could have won exemption
from the more rigorous requirements of US GAAP. Yet at the time of its
1993 Wall Street debut, Daimler had little choice; it needed access to
capital, and a New York listing - necessitating US GAAP accounts - was
the best way to raise it.

Liener was forced to resign from Daimler's management board in May 1995
and responded by blaming the former chief executive, Edzard Reuter, for
a policy of foolhardy expansion. Daimler-Benz is now in serious
financial difficulties and announced a loss of more than DM1 billion
($692 million) in the first half of 1995.

UNITED KINGDOM:  BINDER'S EX-PARTNERS ORDERED TO PAY RECORD SUM

FORMER PARTNERS in London-based accounting firm BDO Binder Hamlyn have
been stunned by a High Court ruling which holds them liable for
damages, interest and costs of #105 million ($166 million) arising from
the 1990 takeover of one of the firm's audit clients.

The damages of #65 million are believed to be the highest ever awarded
against a UK accounting firm and have added new urgency to auditors'
search for liability protection.

During the court case, counsel for Binder said the firm had insurance
cover of #71 million, leaving #34 million of the award to be met from
the partners' personal assets. With between 120 and 150 partners
believed to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000
per partner.

The suit related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADT
for Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million for
Britannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989, which were
audited by Binder.

Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profits
were #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assets
were less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT was
eventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit against
Binder in 1992.

The judge in the case found Binder had been negligent in its audit of
Britannia and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADT
because of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off on
the accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.

At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop was
asked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accounts
gave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishop
replied that he did.

Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted a
duty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,
verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for any
advice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which held
that auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties, regardless of
whether they are negligent.

Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it will
succeed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparo
principles apply," a spokesman said.

BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of the
firm merged with Arthur Andersen. Other Binder offices merged with Stoy
Hayward, the current BDO representative in the UK, while some of the
partners joined other accounting firms or went into industry. Binder
Hamlyn is still trying to determine exactly how many partners are
liable in the Britannia case.

BANK AUSTRIA SEEKS RECOMPENSE FROM PW LONDON

THE LONDON office of Price Waterhouse is being sued for damages of #146
million ($220 million) by Bank Austria over its role in advising on a
UK acquisition that turned sour.

The suit relates to the purchase by Austria's biggest bank of a 51
percent stake in Sovereign Leasing in 1990. The Manchester- based
company, which was owned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and Martin
Harrison, was mainly involved in leasing cars, property and computer
equipment.

Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its
1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45
million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.

Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a due
diligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate finance
advice in connection with the transaction.

In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:
"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations and
advice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceed
with the acquisition.

"It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisition
Sovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the way
it was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position been
revealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not have
proceeded with the acquisition."

In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions of
Sch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing, and in 1992 it forced
the resignations of three former OLB directors over the performance of
its UK operations.

Bank Austria also alleges error in a report by PW which stated that
Sovereign made a profit of #3.4 million in 1991, when according to the
bank it actually made a #1.4 million loss.

However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted a
real due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said the
firm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisition
took place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuation
at the time of the purchase.

"We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defend
them," Hainsworth said."If it is being alleged that we valued the
company at between #30 million and #40 million for the purposes of the
transaction in June 1990, then emphatically we deny it."

The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The case
could take two years to be heard.

UNITED KINGDOM:  AUDITORS TO SEEK OFFSHORE LIMITED LIABILITY

UK ACCOUNTING firms are set to follow the lead of their US counterparts
by setting themselves up as limited liability partnerships (LLPs). The
move is designed to protect their partners' personal assets in the
event of being successfully sued for negligence.

Unlike the US Big Six, which took advantage of legislation introduced
in the state of Delaware to become LLPs, UK accounting firms would have
to register their businesses offshore because UK law restricts limited
liability protection for partnerships.

Attention is focused on the Channel Island of Jersey whose Parliament
is considering whether to recognise LLP status. While a dependency of
the British Crown, Jersey does not form part of the UK and has a
measure of administrative independence, including its own legal and tax
system.

In a statement issued on December 11, Jersey's Parliamentary Finance
and Economics Committee said it would propose a bill to the island's
Parliament permitting the creation of LLPs. Price Waterhouse and Ernst
& Young have announced that they would register their UK practices
offshore in Jersey if the island chooses to recognise LLP status.

Under the proposed law, an LLP would remain liable for its debts, but
individual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligent
act would have their personal assets protected from debts arising from
that negligence.

Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner, and
all LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP
would be required to provide a #5 million ($7.7 million) financial
provision - a sort of bond - for judgments against the partnership. The
draft law will be debated in Jersey's Parliament, the States of Jersey,
during the first quarter of 1996. If approved, it will then go to the
Privy Council for sanctioning and is expected to be operative by year-
end.

"We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liability
partnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Y
senior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number of
clients and all of our partners has produced a very positive reaction."

The firms' partnership culture would continue within the UK and there
would be no change to their UK tax arrangements. The Jersey option is
claimed to be cheaper than incorporating as a limited liability
company, an option chosen by KPMG for parts of its UK audit practice in
1995 (CAI 62). A senior partner at one of the firms estimates the
saving could be as much as 10 percent of pre- tax profits, compared
with the cost of KPMG's chosen route.

Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the new law
in Jersey. Other professionals, including solicitors, architects and
surveyors, will be able to establish partnerships on the island.
Practices in other countries could also relocate to Jersey.

"At the moment, if you are found to be liable for negligence then you
are liable for everything, no matter what one's contribution to that
negligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.

All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales to get the UK Government to change the
principle of joint and several liability contained in the Companies Act
of 1985. "This can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things
take time, and time is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime,
the firms need a way to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.

Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law for
partnerships, which dates from 1907, as"not relevant to modern times".
Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary legislation
would be needed to change it, he said.

UNITED STATES:  SEC OFFICIAL URGES SPEEDY ACTION ON DERIVATIVES

MICHAEL SUTTON, chief accountant of the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is urging standard-setters to move more quickly to
resolve confusion over accounting for derivatives. Addressing a recent
conference in New York, Sutton said investors need help in
understanding the risks and complexities.

"Futures are accounted for differently than swaps. Swaps are accounted
for differently than foreign currency forwards. And foreign currency
forwards are accounted for differently than foreign currency options,"
he told the annual conference on current financial reporting issues
sponsored by the Financial Executives Institute.

Sutton indicated that businesses need a single, articulated set of
guidelines to use. "There's no guidance at all in many areas," he said,
adding that"the accounting literature for swaps is badly outdated". He
said the most recent guidance can be found only in a brief 60-word
consensus published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
more than ten years ago.

FASB is currently considering two other methods for accounting for
derivatives. One would require valuing derivatives at market and
charging value changes against income if the derivatives are actively
traded, or against equity if they are long-term holdings. The other
method would charge all changes in the values of derivatives against
income.

The SEC, meanwhile, is preparing a proposal that will mandate improved
disclosure about accounting policies, require quantified information
about market risk and make companies analyse and state their
derivatives strategies. Release of the document was expected before the
end of 1995 after receiving the approval of the SEC chairman.

Sutton said the new disclosure requirements would essentially codify
many existing practices. Most companies that report derivatives
exposure use one of three methods: value-at-risk; an interest rate
sensitivity analysis; or a table of raw data showing present and future
cash flows.

ACADEMICS CRITICISE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

TWO CANADIAN academics have told the federal government that many of
the traditional proposals aimed at improving corporate governance will
not work. They suggest alternative measures that run counter to recent
suggestions, including Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) recommendations
adopted in 1995.

Their report was commissioned by the federal government as background
for debate on the upcoming review of the Canada Business Corporations
Act, planned for 1997.

Ronald Daniels, dean of law at Toronto University, and Randall Morck, a
business professor at Alberta University, believe that issues such as
the size of boards of directors or the level of insider ownership of a
company are largely irrelevant.

The two professors say the government should neither encourage or
discourage insider ownership of companies because there is no evidence
that concentrated ownership leads to a poorer performance. They also
suggest that there is no point in separating the roles of chief
executive and chairman of the board and say governments should not try
to control the size of boards.

In contrast, the TSE has said that companies should not have large,
unwieldy boards, has called for the separation of the roles of chief
executive and chairman, and wants the board composed largely of outside
directors.

The professors would, however, like to see increased focus on what they
consider the root of one of the most important corporate governance
issues: non-arms'-length transactions between related companies, also
known as self-dealing. "This deals with the actual problem, not with
the symptoms of the problem," Morck said.

The professors recommend that all companies with a dominant shareholder
set up a special conduct committee of entirely independent outside
directors to review any proposed internal transactions.

While they do not see the need to change current laws requiring at
least two independent directors on every board, they want the
government to tighten the definition of independence. They point out
that many so-called outside directors are company lawyers, advertising
executives or senior managers of companies with close business
relationships. "Outside directors should be outsiders," Morck
said."They should have no relationship whatever with the company."

The professors also recommend that directors be paid only in stock or
stock options, because that would align their interests with those of
the shareholders. They also want directors to be held liable in class-
action suits by shareholders, but only after the government has clearly
defined the limits of that liability, which they say should not extend
beyond the change in value to a company measured by the value of the
decline in share price.

TWO TIE FOR `EXCELLENT' ANNUAL REPORTING AWARD

FOR THE first time in the 45-year history of the Financial Post annual
corporate reporting awards, two companies have tied for the top honour,
the Award of Excellence. The Bank of Montreal and manufacturer Nova
Corp were lauded for their "clear, effective" annual reports, described
by the judges as "shining and brilliant".

Awards are handed out in 13 categories, including various resource
groups, manufacturing, hi-tech, media, telecommunications, utilities,
merchandisers, financial institutions and conglomerates. As well, the
Post bestows annual environmental awards.

The tie seems to reflect the overall improvement in the quality of
annual reports, said Philip Creighton, co-ordinator of the judges who
represent the awards sponsors, the Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants, the Canadian Investor Relations Institute and the Toronto
Society of Financial Analysts.

"The field is getting better," Creighton said, adding that there is
still room for improvement. For example, in the hi-tech sector - a new
class this year - it was often difficult to tell what a particular
company was selling.

"I think it depends on how mature the industry is and how long it has
been worrying about these problems," Creighton said. "The basic
industries have made tremendous progress in being able to write about
their processes in a fashion that is understandable and in supplying
information. I can remember when all those industries were as bad as hi-
tech is now."

The Bank of Montreal was chosen as the winner in its category and for
the Award of Excellence because of its excellent separate financial
goals and measures section, which "provides insight into the bank's
performance . . . The only weakness noted is consistent with all the
bank reports reviewed - very limited revenue, cost and capital
segmentation information."

Nova Corp's report was praised as "a brilliant annual report loaded
with extensive disclosure and meaningful segmented information on all
operations".

The Award of Excellence in the environmental awards went to Northern
Telecom. "Not only has Nortel issued an interesting and informative
report, but it has distinguished itself from other companies through
continued efforts to improve the quality of its environmental
reporting," the judges said.

They particularly liked its"Lifecycle" approach, which looks at the
company's products from concept to consumption, and clearly describes
the potential impact those goods have on the environment. And the
judges were especially pleased with Nortel's decision to produce fewer
hard copies of the environmental report, making it available on the
company's World Wide Web site instead.

TORONTO PLANS HIGH PENALTIES FOR MISINFORMATION

A COMMITTEE of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) has proposed that
company directors, officers and advisers should each pay a minimum fine
of C$25,000 ($18,500) or 50 percent of their annual compensation if
they issue misleading information about their companies.

In an interim report released on December 7, the committee said
companies should be held accountable for the timeliness and accuracy of
their information. The committee was set up a year ago in response to
recommendations made by the TSE's corporate governance study.

"Although [Canadian] disclosure requirements are currently high, there
is enough non-compliance to cause concern," said Thomas Allen, a
corporate lawyer and chairman of the committee. "The remedies to
parties who are injured by lack of disclosure are clearly inadequate."

Allen said his committee's recommendations would give those suffering
losses as a result of inadequate or misleading disclosure reasonable
opportunities to recover those losses.

The committee also suggested that companies pay a minimum fine of C$1
million or 5 percent of their market capitalisation - whichever is
higher - for misinformation. As well, major shareholders would be
liable for unlimited sanctions if they knowingly influence company
officials to release inaccurate information.

Another recommendation was to broaden civil liability to include so-
called continuous disclosure documents, such as quarterly financial
reports and press releases. Currently, companies and directors are
liable only for incorrect information in a prospects or takeover
circular.

Moreover, investors would be able to seek damages from experts, such as
consultants, if their advice leads to misinformation. The liability
ceiling for experts would be the greater of C$1 million or three times
the annual fees they receive from the company.

"We think [the penalties] are enough to get corporate Canada's
attention but not so much that it risks dramatically injuring corporate
Canada," Allen said.

He acknowledged that the recommendations will force companies to spend
more money to ensure that corporate documents are accurate. "We think
that the cost, whatever it is, is more than offset by the benefit to
Canadian markets of the repute in which they will be held by virtue of
enhanced disclosure."

Although Edward Waitzer, chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission,
hailed the report as "an outstanding piece of work", one of the TSE
committee members thinks it does not go far enough. According to
Toronto lawyer Philip Anisman, C$25,000 "would not provide a level of
compensation for investors that would warrant a class, or even an
individual, action".

In a dissenting statement on the report, Anisman wrote:"It is also
questionable whether it would provide adequate deterrence. The ceiling
on directors' or officers' liability should be the greater of at least
C$100,000 or their total compensation during the year preceding the
disclosure violation."

Anisman also pointed out that the committee's recommendations contain
several loopholes that lessen the impact of the sanctions. For example,
they exclude professional advisers, such as accountants and lawyers,
from liability.

The public has until March to comment on the proposals.

AUDITORS' MEETING TO FOCUS ON INTERNET SECURITY

THE FLORIDA-based Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), a leader in
auditing technology and research, will give auditors a hands- on
opportunity to navigate the Internet at a February conference in St
Petersburg. The conference will also address the Internet's many
security issues and concerns.

"The Internet is an open system and wasn't designed to be secure," said
Jim Kates, the consultant in charge of conference activities. "People
using the system usually aren't thinking about whether the data they
are transmitting is confidential or sensitive or not," he said, adding
that there are few products on the market today that can help keep a
system secure.

Kates said this is especially problematic when the Internet is used for
electronic commerce. A system still needs to be devised for the sale of
securities and the transmission of confidential information that relies
on mutual integrity and mutual authentication of buyer and seller and
where the integrity of the data remains authentic, he said.

"There are some security products on the market, but they can be
illegally accessed," he said. "It's useless to perform a transaction if
at any point in time it can be intercepted and changed."

Kates said that, as for now, an auditor's best use of the Internet is
as a reference source or marketing tool. "An auditor completing an
environmental audit can find information on how to dispose of waste
more easily," he said. "Or a firm can search the net to find out how
its new product stacks up against potential competition.

"There's a bulletin board where auditors can discuss audit issues.
There are search utilities an accountant can use that will seek out
information for him, by using key words, like `bank securities fraud'."

IIA, like all major accounting bodies, has its own on-line base for
sending pictures and text to members and other interested parties.

FASB SEEKS STANDARDISATION

James R Peterson reports on FASB's efforts to develop accounting rules
for the booming market in financial assets

THE US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is close to
completing a major effort to standardise accounting for transfers of
financial assets. A preliminary draft of the proposal has been
available for comment since October, and the board is encouraging
participation at a hearing on the proposal scheduled for late February.

"The proposal breaks new ground in resolving long-standing questions
about whether transactions should be accounted for as secured
borrowings or as sales," said FASB project manager Halsey Bullen. "The
board wanted to develop an approach that would be responsive to
developments in the financial markets and have some consistency and
rigour to it," he told CAI.

"There are any number of financial assets traded in today's booming
financial markets," he said. "This proposal will enable people to find
sound answers to questions on how to account for new kinds of
transfers, such as securitisations, where you take a set of assets and
tailor them to an investor's desire for a certain predictability in
cashflows and control over risk."

The proposal covers transactions which until now were treated
separately in accounting, such as securitisations, sales of partial
interests, repurchase agreements, securities lending, loan syndications
and participations, sales of receivables with recourse, and servicing
of mortgages and other loans.

The document states that "the new standards would provide accounting
and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets
and extinguishments of financial assets." Those standards would be
based on consistent application of the accounting method known as the
"financial components approach", which has to do with the issue of
control, a word that is central to any understanding of the new
proposal.

If a company has surrendered control over the transferred assets, the
transaction would be considered a sale. Otherwise, it would be
accounted for as a secured borrowing.

A company would have to recognise all financial assets and servicing it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred after a transfer of
financial assets. It would also have to remove from the balance sheet
those assets it no longer controls and those liabilities that it has
satisfied.

In FASB's proposal, a lender has surrendered control only if all of the
following conditions are met:

* The transferred assets have been isolated from the lender beyond its
reach and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership.

* The lender obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred
assets.

* Any agreement to repurchase the assets can be satisfied by delivery
of assets that are readily obtainable.

* The transfer is not temporary.

The plan would require that liabilities entered into as part of a
transfer of financial assets initially be measured at fair value, if
practical. It would require servicing assets to be measured by
allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets sold and
retained interests based on their relative fair values on the transfer
date.

The FASB proposal also addresses the issue of loan impairment. After a
transfer, servicing assets and liabilities would be subsequently
measured by amortisation over the period of estimated net servicing
income, with impairment to be recognised if the carrying amount of
unamortised servicing assets at risk exceeds their fair value.

The proposal would allow elimination of a liability from the balance
sheet only if a debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its
obligation for the liability, or if a debtor is legally released from
primary obligation for the liability by the creditor or by the courts.

Bullen expects the proposal to spark some controversy. He said
companies that find they must report as a sale what they've been
reporting as borrowing will not like it because they may have to
recognise a loss.

The proposal could also dampen the use of "repos", or repurchase
agreements by banks. FASB wants to reclassify all repurchase agreements
more than three months long as sales. At present, repos, in which one
party sells securities to another and agrees to buy them back at a
specified price at a specified time, are treated as collateralised
loans.

Banks are currently able to classify repos as "held to maturity" and do
not have to mark them to market prices on a regular basis. If repos are
classified as sales, banks would have to mark the securities they sell
to market and account for any gains or losses.

Bullen, meanwhile, expects some heated discussion about FASB's plan to
eliminate the distinction between normal servicing and excess servicing
of mortgages. This change might allow an inefficient mortgage servicer
incurring costs exceeding receivables to account for the transaction in
the same way as a more efficient servicer.

While constructing its new approach, FASB looked closely at the
International Accounting Standards Committee's proposed international
account standard on Financial Instruments, which would permit
derecognition of financial assets and liabilities upon transfer of
"substantially" all underlying risks and rewards.

FASB found this standard insufficiently consistent because it is open
to varied interpretations.

When approved, the proposal will supersede a number of FASB standards,
including Statement 76, Extinguishment of Debt, and Statement 77,
Reporting by Transferor for Transfers of Receivables with Recourse.

It would also amend Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, to clarify that a security
may not be classified as held-to-maturity if it can be prepaid or
settled so that the holder of the security would not recover
substantially all of its investment.

OIL GIANTS HIT BY NEW FASB RULE

A new standard dealing with impairment of long-lived assets is set to
take its toll on the fourth-quarter earnings of US oil companies. James
R Peterson reports

SHAREHOLDERS WILL see their dividends from US oil and gas stocks
reduced as companies come to grips with a new standard, Accounting for
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, from the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB).

The move is unlikely to cause unusual concern, however, because the
effect on dividends will be temporary, affecting earnings in a single
quarter, and because the new accounting rule ultimately will allow
shareholders to better predict a company's future earnings.

Texaco is taking a fourth-quarter charge of $640 million, which
analysts say will swing the company's quarterly results into a loss.
Earlier this year, Burlington Resources, Ashland and Phillips Petroleum
respectively took $304 million, $90 million and $49 million in charges.
Besides Texaco, at least two other oil giants, Mobil and Chevron,
expect to take big charges related to the new FASB rule.

The new rule, Standard 121, was implemented so that investors could
better assess the true worth of a company's assets. The new rule calls
for all US companies to compare the future expected values of assets
against current book value. If the future values are less than book,
the company must write down the value of that asset.

Oil and gas companies are particularly affected by the rule change
because it is the first time they have had to assess each of their
producing fields on a case-by-case basis. Under a previous informal
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule, oil fields were
evaluated on a nationwide or worldwide basis. The SEC allowed the firms
to offset those fields that had a value less than book against others
with higher values.

"Aside from the SEC rule for the oil and gas industries, there was no
standard for impairment of fixed assets until FASB adopted the current
standard last spring," according to FASB project manager Carmen Bailey,
who said it is hard to predict which other industries are facing large
write-downs.

George Batavick, Texaco's assistant comptroller, emphasised that the
company's fourth-quarter write-down is a one-time-only, non- cash event
and that the assets in question are only technically impaired. "The
assets are producing positive earnings and positive cash flow," he
said. "But since the cash flow on an undiscounted basis would not
recover the investment that is on our books, the FASB rule necessitated
a write-down."

"Under the old SEC rule, we looked at our producing oil fields in the
aggregate," Batavick explained. "In the aggregate, we had high
investment fields being paired with low investment fields and the cash
flows exceeded the total investment. However, on a field-by-field
basis, the individual cashflows of particular high investment fields
were not recovered by the cashflows."

The write-down was based on Texaco's estimate of the current and future
value of each of its oil fields. "If you have acquired a property when
its price was high, and today's prices are lower, the carrying value of
the asset must be reduced to come into line with today's prices and
what we expect the value of the property will be in the future."

Batavick said the question of valuing assets becomes a problem when a
company acquires a large firm with highly valued assets. Key to
Texaco's write-down is its recent acquisition of Getty Oil Company.
"Investors ought to feel more secure," he said, "because the write-down
would otherwise have been reported as a depreciation expense in future
years."

The new rule establishes standards for "impairment of long- lived
assets, certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those
assets to be held and used", and also for"long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles to be disposed of".

The original scope of the FASB project was limited to accounting for
the impairment of long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles. The
board decided to include goodwill related to impaired assets after
deciding that long-lived assets could not be tested for impairment
without also considering the goodwill arising from the acquisition of
those assets.

The board also decided to include depreciation in the scope of its
project because it found that the choice of depreciation method and
estimates of useful life of an asset could have an impact on whether an
impairment exists. FASB suggests that an asset's depreciation method
should be reviewed periodically and changed if current estimates of the
asset's value differ significantly from previous estimates.

The history of Standard 121 extends to July 1980 when the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) urged FASB to provide more accounting
guidance for the impairment of fixed assets. No action was taken until
the mid-1980s when FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) took up the
issue. EITF members, noting a significant increase in the size and
frequency of write-downs of long-lived assets, suggested there was a
need for a single rule.

In 1989, a report by the Institute of Management Accountants revealed a
continuing steady increase in write-downs and called for more
authoritative guidance on accounting for impairment of long-lived
assets.

As a result of these recommendations, FASB added a project to its
agenda in 1988 and issued for comment a discussion memorandum,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable
Intangibles. The final exposure draft, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,
was issued last year and the new standard was adopted last March.

Standard 121 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December 15 1995. However, some firms, like Texaco,
have chosen early application of the rule.

A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH

Following publication of an extensive study of international accounting
practices, Gerry Acher, KPMG's head of audit and accounting in the UK,
traces the background to the IASC's new- found prominence

IT IS increasingly recognised that international accounting standards
are a force to be reckoned with - as demonstrated by the publication in
December of TRANSACC: Transnational Accounting - and the man who
ignores them risks being left by the wayside while others set the pace.

In essence, their importance arises because international standards are
needed and international accounting standards (IASs) fit the bill,
having been markedly improved in recent years.

When the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was
founded in 1973, part of the dream was that a single set of standards
would allow a company to raise finance anywhere in the world. That
dream has become a pressing need. Companies around the world grapple
with other people's standards in order to tap foreign capital markets.

In particular, entry to US capital markets is open only to those who
prepare their financial statements in accordance with US accounting
principles, or who reconcile their domestic financial statements to
these principles. There are a few exemptions from this for specific
areas of accounting.

What irks companies is not so much the differences in the rules
themselves as the fact that they are another country's rules; the firms
have had no input to the development of these rules, and there is a
little bit of national pride at work. For example, some European
countries feel particularly aggrieved when they are required to use US
GAAP.

With the world as its constituency, the IASC does not have this
problem. Almost everyone has reached this conclusion. The German
Government has let it be known that it will tolerate the use of IASs
for domestic purposes. The issue is also under consideration in France.
The European Commission has also softened its stance. There were early
mutterings of a Euro-ASB, but in the end, reason triumphed over bad
habit. The commission wants to work with the IASC and to allow European
companies to prepare their consolidated accounts under IASs.

Most significantly, however, capital market regulators across the
world, in the form of the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO), have reached a milestone agreement with the IASC.
IOSCO agrees that the current list of IASs contains a nucleus of
acceptable standards. Moreover, it will work with the IASC to try to
ensure that 15 new or revised IASs, to be issued by 1999, will also be
acceptable to IOSCO. If that can be achieved, IOSCO will endorse the
IASs for use in listings anywhere in the world. In theory this includes
New York, and the achievement of this is a prime goal of the exercise.
London already accepts IASs.

Improvement

That IASs have reached this position is a testament to their
improvement in recent years. At one time they were thought of as the
lowest common denominator. But during almost ten years in office, David
Cairns, former IASC secretary-general, steered the organisation through
a major revisions project, cutting out many of the optional treatments,
and bringing it to the top table among the standard-setters.

Cairns's successor, Sir Bryan Carsberg, who brings to his role
considerable authority and experience in the accounting and political
fields, now talks on equal terms with his counterparts at, for example,
the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and the American Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In the list of five bodies
collaborating on recent international studies on future events, hedging
and provisioning, you will find the IASC.

National standard-setters want international convergence as far as
possible, and not purely from a theoretical viewpoint; convergence has
strong practical attractions too.

First, there are obvious advantages in borrowing, or participating in,
others' research. Countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong take this
approach to its ultimate conclusion and base their accounting systems
directly on IASs.

And second, there are real benefits for preparers and users. It would
be a genuine convenience for international groups to have the same set
of accounting principles for local and group reporting. When companies
do cross-border mergers and acquisitions they become users of
accounting information. If the two parties spoke the same accounting
language it would be one less obstacle to deal-making. And it would be
good economics. The better everyone understands the information, the
better the resource-allocation decisions will be.

How are standard-setters pursuing this goal? They now look to the
IASC's work as the reference point. The UK's ASB does this. Most of its
proposals regard developments at the IASC. For example, the draft
Statement of Principles owes much to the IASC's Framework. In addition,
the appendices to FRS 4 and FRS 7 go to the trouble of explaining why
it was felt necessary to depart from IASs in those standards. But we do
not just respond to the IASC; with Sir David Tweedie newly appointed to
the IASC board, the UK's standard-setting body is strongly represented
in the process.

Principles

I am particularly pleased that principles rather than rules are the
basis of the international standards. We must fight to retain this
general approach, and not allow the standards to drift towards a cook-
book approach. The differences from our own standards are limited,
although sometimes significant.

For example, the IAS definition of a merger is very similar to the
UK's. And like FRS 6, merger accounting must be adopted if the
definition is met; acquisition accounting applies in other cases.
Acquisition accounting itself is very similar but, crucially, it would
accommodate the acquirer's intentions, such as reorganisations, in the
fair value exercise. The end product of this is goodwill. Here a major
difference crops up.

Under IAS 22, positive goodwill must be capitalised and amortised over
up to 20 years. Negative goodwill is used to reduce the values assigned
to the non-monetary acquired assets and any remaining amount treated as
deferred income, to be spread over up to 20 years. Alternatively, the
whole amount may be dealt with as deferred income.

The UK approach is largely to write off goodwill directly to reserves.
While this is under review, it seems likely that even if the UK
requires goodwill to be capitalised, the amortisation requirement will
differ significantly from that of IAS 22.

It is important to be aware of such differences and of the future
direction of the international standard-setters. If convergence of
standards - or at least an acceptable set of international standards -
is to be achieved, more interest in their development is necessary than
has been shown hitherto.

Staying with intangible assets for a moment, development costs are
another area of difference. Under IAS 9, if certain conditions are met,
then development costs must be capitalised (and subsequently
amortised). For those who think that the IASC takes its lead from the
US this is a salutary lesson; under US GAAP, development costs are
never capitalised.

Like the UK, IAS 16 permits fixed assets to be revalued. Unlike the UK,
it requires revaluations to be done on a class-by-class basis and to be
kept up to date. If such a requirement was in force in the UK then many
of the anomalies of its present mixed system would be alleviated.

Accounting for financial instruments - including derivatives - is a
problem for everyone. At present, the IASC has a standard covering
disclosure and presentation (IAS 32). No standard-setter yet has a
comprehensive measurement standard. The IASC aims to have one by June
1997. In the meantime, IAS 32 should keep preparers, auditors and users
occupied. Its disclosures of credit risk, fair values and hedges are
demanding and informative. Its presentation rules are innovative.

Freed from the constraints of a legal framework, the IASC is able to
require companies to report preference shares that contain an
obligation as debt. On top of that, hybrid instruments, such as
convertible debt, are to be split into debt and equity elements and
separately accounted for.

Some of the other differences from UK standards are as follows:

* Jointly-controlled entities may be proportionately consolidated;
jointly-controlled assets must be proportionately consolidated. (Only
unincorporated joint ventures may use this treatment in the UK).

* The cumulative exchange differences on the net investment in a
foreign entity are presented as a component of equity. They are
subsequently taken into the calculation of profit or loss on any
disposal of the foreign entity. There are no such requirements in the
UK.

* When translating the financial statements of a foreign entity, the
profit and loss account should be translated at the actual or average
rates. The UK also permits the closing rate to be used.

* The minority interest in a subsidiary may be based on the relevant
share of the pre-acquisition book values of the subsidiary, as opposed
to the fair value as mandated in the UK.

* The current portion of long-term debt may be excluded from current
liabilities where the company can and intends to refinance it on a long-
term basis. This is not generally possible under the UK's FRS 4.

* Only a major line of business could qualify as a discontinued
operation. The UK definition refers to a material effect on the nature
and focus of operations. Moreover, the discontinued operation's profit
on ordinary activities - that is, before extraordinary items and thus
after interest and tax - must be disclosed. Discontinued interest and
tax need not be disclosed in the UK.

* Extraordinary items are more possible. IAS 8 cites earthquakes and
expropriation of assets as examples. Such events would be within
ordinary activity under the UK's FRS 3.

As mentioned earlier, 15 new or revised standards are expected from the
IASC by 1999. In part these will fill gaps in the portfolio - for
example, at present there are no comprehensive standards on
presentation (i.e. the form of accounts) or on earnings per share. But
there are also some contentious issues in the pipeline. In addition to
a measurement standard for financial instruments, a revised standard on
deferred tax (due soon) and a new standard on intangibles (due in June
1996) are on the way. These last two present difficulties of
harmonisation.

Fundamental

The UK and the US use fundamentally different bases for both
recognition and measurement of deferred tax. The UK recognition basis
is the well known timing differences approach, whereas the US seeks to
recognise the tax that would arise on a realisation of all of the
assets and liabilities at their book values, known as the temporary
differences approach. The UK, increasingly the international odd-man-
out, provides only partially for timing differences; the US provides in
full for its temporary differences.

There is no synthesis of these two systems; whichever way the IASC's
judgment goes - and the indications are that they will find in favour
of the US bases - discord will be the result.

With intangibles, the issue is the extent to which they can be
separated from goodwill. In the UK, the current proposal would allow,
for example, an acquired brand to be separated out where its fair value
could be reliably measured. The IASC's proposal (E50) agrees in
principle. However, it does not regard a measurement based on
discounted future revenues - as is typically the case for brands - as
sufficiently distinct from the measurement of goodwill to merit
separate recognition.

The IASC has come a long way. In the field of accounting developments
it has moved, unnoticed by many, from the rearguard to the van. But the
campaign is not over yet. If the world is to move forward we must
achieve the goal of listing on a US exchange under IAS. This is what
the IASC is fighting for; it deserves our attention, co-operation and
support.

LONG TRIAL LIKELY FOR PW

One of the biggest-ever auditor lawsuits in Germany opened at the end
of November. But, as CAI reports, an early resolution of the  complex
issues involved seems unlikely

MORE THAN a year after a group of creditor banks announced a DM255
million ($180 million) lawsuit against Price Waterhouse over its audits
of two German companies brought to the brink of bankruptcy by alleged
fraud, the court case opened in Frankfurt at the end of November.

But after examining evidence and hearing preliminary arguments, the
judge quickly proposed an adjournment until after former executives of
the two companies, plus former PW partner Rolf Muscat, have been tried
on charges of criminal fraud.

The group trial is expected to begin in April and may last for several
years because the evidence is so complex. The prosecution hopes to
prove that the former executives of credit factoring company, Procedo,
and its biggest customer, sports-surface manufacturer Balsam, engaged
in fraudulent transactions that led to the collapse of both companies.
Muscat, who advised both companies, is accused of "deliberate
involvement" with the alleged frauds.

Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his case
against PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partners
acted with the intention to defraud, rather than just negligently. But
he is unwilling to delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to a
prolonged adjournment. After both sides had consulted with their
clients, the court planned to reconvene on December 19 to make a final
decision on the adjournment.

The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of "intentional misconduct"
in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approving
the accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added a
new claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval without
actually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.

The alleged fraud centres on Procedo's factoring transactions with
Balsam which led it to advance cash to the manufacturing company in
return for collecting its trade receivables. Prosecutors claim the
factored invoices were doctored to make Balsam's turnover look bigger
than it was. Balsam filed for bankruptcy in June 1994 after its top
management was arrested on suspicion of fraud, a move that precipitated
Procedo's petition for protection from its creditors. The biggest
casualties were the companies' bankers which claim to be owed DM2.3
billion.

PW's involvement stems from its audits of Balsam, which it undertook
jointly with a Dusseldorf-based subsidiary, FMP. Muscat, a partner in
both PW and FMP, audited Procedo in an individual capacity. He was
arrested in August 1994 on charges of fraud.

In an interview with CAI, PW's senior partner in Germany, Wolfgang
Krause, said his firm may have to be bailed out by PW's European firm
if the creditor banks are awarded the legal damages they are seeking.

Krause said PW Europe would "naturally" provide financial support since
the German practice has no funds to pay an out-of- court settlement,
let alone the full sum of DM255 million for which it is being sued. "We
don't have any possibility to build reserves," he said, citing the high
cost of personnel, information technology, training and liability
insurance in Germany.

That insurance, however, is unlikely to cover the millions PW could end
up paying as a result of the Balsam/Procedo lawsuit. In remarks about
the German accounting profession in general, Ulf Pohl, managing
director of Wirtschaftliche Versicherungsstellethe, the leading
provider of professional indemnity insurance cover for accountants in
Germany, said firms invariably take up "substantially less" than the
maximum cover of DM70 million that he offers.

Moreover, Pohl said German corporate law makes it impossible for
accountancy firms to insure against "intentional misconduct" by their
partners. In the Balsam/Procedo suit, PW and six of its partners are
accused of precisely that misdemeanour.

While the court action is now under way, PW still hopes it can reach
agreement out of court. "Our legal counsel is strongly urging us to see
the case through, but we don't want this business to go for another ten
years," Krause said.

Meanwhile, there is little evidence that PW has been damaged by the
unfavourable publicity generated by the lawsuit. Only six partners have
left or retired (including Muscat and Gerd Frielingsdorf, two of those
named in the suit), and fee income continues to rise.

Provisional figures for the year to the end of last June showed gross
revenues of DM253 million, up 5.4 percent from the previous year.
Revenues for 1995/96 are projected at DM275 million.

Those figures make PW the smallest of the Big Six in Germany, but
Krause explained that the firm's approach to the market differs from
that of its larger competitors. Its share of statutory audit work is
probably smaller than that of any other major German firm; instead it
focuses on audit-related projects such as due diligence, treasury
management, internal audit consulting and balance sheet planning for
companies which are not statutory audit clients.

Like PW firms in other markets, the German firm likes to regard all its
professionals as"consultants". Many assignments are awarded in
connection with mergers and acquisitions where PW's corporate finance
subsidiary has acted as a consultant. In fiscal 1995, audit work
accounted for 40 percent of fee income compared with 43 percent the
year before. At other Big Six firms in Germany, the figure is around 60
percent.

TRYING TO AGREE ON GLOBAL STANDARDS

Niall Brady reviews the financial reporting developments that hit the
headlines in 1995

IN THE tortured history of the search for a global accounting language,
1995 will be remembered as something of a watershed. After years of
dancing round the issue, the world's stock market regulators finally
came to an agreement with the International Accounting Standards
Committee (IASC) on a timetable for a set of core standards that would
be acceptable for cross-border listings and capital raising.

Having been dismissed for years as a well-intentioned but ineffectual
standard-setter, the IASC could not conceal its delight. Australian
Michael Sharpe, who took over the role of IASC chairman on July 1,
hailed the agreement with the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO) as an "historic moment".

"Companies should now feel confident that the IASC and IOSCO are fully
committed to developing IASs that will be acceptable everywhere in the
world and recognise the efficiencies that may be obtained from using
IASs," he said. "At the moment, companies using IAS standards can raise
capital on many global stock exchanges. Now they know that they will be
able to access all of them in the not-too-distant future. Not just
whole companies, but whole countries will now move to IAS rules."

Amid the jubilation, however, the huge task facing the IASC between now
and the end of the decade must not be underestimated. Included in the
15 standards that the IASC has agreed to issue or revise at IOSCO's
behest are some of accounting's most controversial issues, such as
financial instruments, intangible assets and leasing.

Even if the IASC manages to stick with its ambitious timetable, its new
and revised standards would still have to be endorsed by IOSCO's
technical committee before they can be recognised as acceptable for
cross-border listings in all capital markets. The final hurdle will be
getting the national securities regulators to recognise IASs in their
rule books.

The stance adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
which regulates entry to the world's biggest capital market, will be
especially important. Domestic US companies are determined that they
should not have to compete head-on for the same capital with foreign
registrants that are not subject to the full rigours of US GAAP.

Research unveiled in the spring of 1995 suggests, however, that the gap
between IASs and US GAAP may not be as wide as is generally thought.
According to Trevor Harris, the accounting professor at New York's
Columbia University, who undertook the study: "We found that at least
for firms utilising the IASC's revised International Accounting
Standards there are few instances, especially from an investor's
perspective as opposed to a technical accounting perspective, where the
companies' compliance with IASs would not meet US GAAP."

Harris also noted that endorsement of IASs would not necessarily weaken
the SEC's hand. "If the SEC believes a company is hurting investors by
obfuscating the information, despite apparent compliance with IASs,
then it can still impose its regulatory control if the company is
registered," he said.

With so much attention to keeping the Americans on side, some of the
IASC's other power brokers are concerned that their interests are being
pushed to one side. Those concerns have been heightened with the
realisation that political squabbles about the future direction of IASs
are being overtaken by events on the ground, as more multinational
companies switch to US GAAP in return for entry to the New York Stock
Exchange.

The hegemony of US GAAP led the European Commission, in particular, to
signal that it might intervene to halt the slide. Addressing a meeting
of European accountants at the end of 1994, John Mogg, the commission's
director general for the internal market and financial services, said:
"We must recognise that Europe cannot escape its own responsibility to
shape accounting standards. We cannot be merely reactive to the
solutions put forward by others."

Mogg's sentiments were amplified by Karel van Hulle, head of the
commission's accounting standards unit. After acknowledging the
shortcomings of the commission's existing accounting directives during
an address to the European Accounting Association in May, van Hulle
added: "We have to change our approach in the area of financial
reporting or the European input into the debate will diminish. I
disagree with those who argue that this is a good thing. Something has
to be done to prevent the directives becoming a burden on progress."

Such talk raised fears inside and outside Europe that Brussels was
preparing to go it alone in harmonising the accounting practices of the
EU's 15 member states. Those fears, however, were eventually put to
rest at IOSCO's annual conference in July, when Mario Monti, the
commissioner responsible for accounting policy, signalled that Brussels
would seek to work through the IASC as the best way to harmonise
accounting practices both within the EU's member states and with the
outside world.

"Agreement on IASs would enable us to enter negotiations with other
regions aimed at securing mutual recognition of public offer and
listing prospectuses based on these same IASs," Monti said. "We believe
companies should only be required to prepare one set of consolidated
accounts, and we plan to examine the possibility for European companies
with an international vocation to prepare their consolidated accounts
on the basis of IASs."

Brussels' embrace of IASs is also mirrored by a realisation among some
heavyweight EU member states that, rather than fretting from the
sidelines about the IASC's perceived Anglo-Saxon bias, it is better to
make their voices heard by playing a more active role in the
deliberations of the global standard-setter. Most European countries,
however, are hampered by the fact that they do not have strong standard-
setting bodies, such as the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) or
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the US, which could
fly their flags at the IASC.

France, for one, is set to remedy that situation with the announcement
by economy minister Jean Arthuis that he plans to set up a state body
with the power to issue binding pronouncements on financial reporting.
Addressing the 50th congress of the country's professional accountancy
body, the Ordre des Experts Comptables, Arthuis warned that France's
existing accounting regime, which is based on legislation rather than
private-sector standards, "is threatened with sclerosis".

A key feature of Arthuis's proposed Comite de la Reglementation
Comptable (CRC) is that its pronouncements would draw heavily on IASs.
That could remove a big obstacle facing capital-hungry European
companies: the need to prepare multiple, and often contradictory,
accounts to satisfy the needs of both domestic regulators and overseas
stock markets. "I would like to say that I find this ambiguous
situation unacceptable," Arthuis said. "It leads to questions about the
truthfulness of the accounts of large French companies and is
detrimental to their credibility."

The half-year results of Pechiney provided a prime example of what
Arthuis was referring to. In the run-up to its planned November
privatisation, the aluminium and packaging group switched to US GAAP
and reported a Fr658 million ($130 million) profit for the six months
to the end of June.

But France's stock market regulator, the Commission des Operations de
Bourse (COB), took exception to Pechiney's new accounting policies,
highlighting the fact that if it had stuck with local reporting
requirements it would have reported a small loss for the period. The
uncharacteristically public rebuke from the COB came at a bad time for
Pechiney, as its shares were already facing general indifference from
investors.

Pechiney's predicament is familiar to companies in neighbouring
Germany. Because its accounting traditions are so out of step with what
is demanded by international investors, Germany has been forced to
undertake a fundamental rethink of its approach to financial reporting.

A radical solution emerged from Bonn in the spring of 1995 when justice
ministry official Herbert Biener proposed that German companies with
global ambitions could be allowed to use IASs or US GAAP for their
consolidated financial statements and would only have to respect
domestic accounting requirements in individual company financial
statements.

Biener's proposals come at a time when another German company - this
time the state-owned telecommunications monopoly, Deutsche Telekom - is
preparing to follow the lead of Daimler-Benz and list its shares in New
York. Unless Biener's proposal finds its way onto the statute books by
early next year, however, Telekom will find itself in the same
predicament as Daimler: having to issue two different sets of group
results, one that complies with German accounting regulations, the
other with US GAAP.

For both companies, a crucial aspect of Biener's proposal is that US
GAAP would be an equally-acceptable alternative to IASs as a basis for
drafting consolidated accounts. Their interest lies in removing
obstacles to listing their shares in New York, and the SEC will not
accept accounts drawn up on the basis of IASs.

Such a radical solution, however, is causing unease in some quarters of
Germany's corporate establishment. Companies like Bayer and Hoechst
have never accepted what they see as Daimler's capitulation to the
excessive demands of the SEC in terms of disclosure. Instead, they
favour IASs (Bayer adopted IASs for its 1994 accounts; Hoechst planned
to do so for its 1995 financial statements) because, unlike the
formulation of US GAAP, Germany has an input into IASs and
representation on the board of the IASC.

Sharpe summed up their fears in an address to the Federation of Euro-
Asian Stock Exchanges at the beginning of October. "I believe that it
is unacceptable that a sovereign state de facto delegates to another
state the drawing up of their accounting standards," he said.
"Delegating to an international institution in which many sovereign
states have their say is one thing, whereas delegating to another state
is quite another."

Germany is also divided on the need for a national standard- setting
body along the lines of France's proposed CRC. According to Johannes
Maret, Arthur Andersen's senior partner in Frankfurt: "A standard-
setting body would be responsible for exacting greater influence in the
formulation of IASs and checking whether these were compatible with
German law."

On the other hand, Dietrich Dorner, outgoing president of the
professional body for German accountants, the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprufer, believes the need for a consensus approach in
standard-setting would weaken the standard of financial reporting in
Germany.

"I'm not optimistic that [a standard-setting body] would be any better
than what we have at the moment," he told CAI in November. "It would
pronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effect
would be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."

Whatever route German companies eventually take to make their accounts
more useful to international investors, it is clear that the existing
practice of making generous provisions for a wide variety of possible
liabilities and losses will have to be curbed. While billed as an
example of German accounting's conservative bent, over-generous
provisions are also a classic devise for smoothing earnings by
depressing profits in good years and bumping up the bottom lines when
times are bad.

The IASC took aim at that practice at the end of November with a
discussion paper which proposes that provisions for future operating
losses should be banned except where they result from contractual
commitments. A similar line was taken in separate documents issued by
standard-setters in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US, which had
worked with the IASC on the provisions issue.

Unveiling the UK discussion paper, ASB chairman David Tweedie said:
"Some will say the restriction on provisions is imprudent but we don't
want phoney liabilities . . . with forecast future losses we sometimes
get into psychoanalytic accounting; it's like trying to read your mind.
If you want to recognise [future losses] let's have a detailed plan
first. You can't smack in phoney liabilities because you intend to
reorganise."

Such thinking goes against the current trend in the British banking
industry, which took advantage of record profits in 1995 to bump up bad-
debt provisions. Such efforts to iron out the cyclical swings that
characterise bank earnings have the blessing of regulators. "It seems
to me preferable to recognise that expected losses, particularly if
they can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, have been incurred when
a loan is written rather than waiting until the loss materialises,"
according to Bank of England executive director Brian Quinn.

And awash with profits, the banks have been more than willing to heed
Quinn's advice. Barclays Bank introduced so-called default
provisioning, involving up-front provisions based on expected losses
over the life of a loan; Lloyds Bank opted for a once-off #120 million
($200 million) boost to its general provision for bad debts based on
fears that higher inflation would hasten another economic downturn and
a desire to avoid having to raise provisions sharply in the future.

Financial instruments are an accounting issue guaranteed to dictate the
pace for both banks and their large corporate clients for some time to
come. Following explosive growth in the use of derivatives in recent
years, calls for tighter regulation of the market have been matched by
greater urgency in the push to develop accounting standards that can
deal with the complexity of financial instruments.

Even before the dramatic collapse of Barings Bank in February, the IASC
had declared that its financial instruments project "remains the
board's single highest priority for 1995 and beyond". That culminated
in the May publication of IAS 32, which deals with disclosure and
presentation issues. The fact that the standard had been in the
pipeline for six years, and that measurement and disclosure of
financial instruments remain to be tackled, demonstrate the complex and
contentious nature of the issues involved.

"Both investors and lenders need to have a much better idea of whether
risky derivatives are being used," said IASC technical director Liesel
Knorr when the standard was unveiled. "The disclosures which we are now
asking for will make it much easier to assess the risks that companies
run when they use financial instruments such as derivatives."

Meanwhile, progress on the second phase of the financial instruments
project, dealing with recognition and measurement, continues slowly,
with the next milestone expected to be a discussion paper to be issued
by the end of 1996.

That perennial bugbear of the accounting industry - goodwill and
intangible assets - continued to grab the headlines in 1995. The year
kicked off with drugs company Wellcome using the UK's lenient goodwill
requirements as part of an unsuccessful challenge to a hostile takeover
bid from pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo. Wellcome charged that Glaxo's bid
could prejudice rival bidders from overseas because they would have to
amortise the ensuing goodwill against future profits, whereas Glaxo, as
a UK company, could choose to write-off the goodwill immediately
against reserves.

Australia's Pacific Dunlop also pointed to what it perceives as the
UK's unfair advantage in goodwill amortisation in a row with regulators
during 1995. With the Australian Accounting Standards Board expected to
issue an exposure draft by year's end that requires goodwill to be
amortised on a straight-line basis over 20 years, PacDun noted that
this is more onerous than the treatment permitted in the UK or in the
US and Canada, which allows goodwill to be written off over 40 years.

PacDun's concerns, however, could prove short-lived, at least as
regards the UK. In June, the ASB issued a working paper that proposes
the abolition of reserve accounting for goodwill. Tweedie outlined the
proposals as follows: "For companies wanting to take the
straightforward option, intangible assets and goodwill may be
capitalised and depreciated over a maximum of 20 years with only a
minimal annual recoverability review. On the other hand, for companies
wishing to show the critical value to their businesses of intangible
assets and goodwill, there will be no need to make an arbitrary
amortisation charge each year. Instead, continuing value can be
demonstrated by a review of future cash-flow forecasts."

That approach differs from exposure draft E50, issued by the IASC in
June, which rejected the ASB's view that some intangibles need never be
amortised. The eventual shape of a revised UK goodwill standard,
however, remains anyone's guess.

As part of a lengthy process to ensure broad-based support, the ASB
held its first-ever public hearing at the beginning of October at which
its goodwill proposals were put to the floor. With little consensus on
the specifics of the standard-setter's proposals - most disagreement
centred on the ASB's proposed impairment tests to determine if goodwill
should be subject to a once-off write down - a standard remains some
time away.

GROWTH IN CORPORATE IMAGING TOP STORY OF 1995

     Plan to offer image-based cash management applications this year
if corporate customers make up a significant part of your business.
     Interest in applications such as image archive and retrieval,
image positive pay and CD-ROM delivery will continue to skyrocket,
predicts David Medeiros, a consulting analyst with The Tower Group,
based in Wellesley, Mass.
     The coming year also could bring wider acceptance of the Internet
for transmitting sensitive data; the long-awaited introduction of
Rapid*EDI; less interest in electronic data interchange (EDI); and
more banks using electronic check presentment (ECP), say consultants
in assessing last year's trends. 

Banks Offer Image Processing

     "As soon as enough large banks have installed image-based cash
management, corporate banking customers will come to expect it.  If
your bank's not offering it, they'll find [a bank] that is," Medeiros
noted.
     Indeed, Chase Manhattan Bank of New York, Bank of Boston and
Chemical Banking Corp.'s New York-based Geoserve division came to
market in recent weeks offering check images on CD-ROM (CORP, Dec. 27,
p. 7).
     Chemical also announced plans last year to integrate imaging into
all phases of its check operations, including proof-of-deposit and
archiving.
     The technology allows firms to use search and retrieval software
to pull up a check image on a personal computer screen, as opposed to
finding the image on microfilm or pulling a paper check out of a
storage box, the banks say.  
     "Many [banks] anticipate that they will be able to resolve
telephone inquiries while the payee or customer is still on the
phone," added Mary Ann Hardy, an image product manager at Bank of
Boston.
     Similarly, many banks began offering image-enabled wholesale
lockbox processing last year, including Harris Bank, based in Chicago
(CORP, Dec. 27, p. 7).  
     The bank says the technology will streamline its operations and
provide customers with reduced storage needs and immediate access to
check and remittance images for faster accounts receivable-posting and
reconcilement.
     Using the lessons of history, here's a look at the major stories
of 1995 and how they'll relate to the decisions you'll be making this
year:     

     *  Best Marriage of Technologies:  Interbank check imaging.  By
combining check imaging and electronic check presentment (ECP), the
Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) developed a paperless
check clearing process to reduce check fraud and provide faster access
to funds (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 1).  Banks also will benefit from faster,
cheaper check clearing, FSTC says.
     Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio, Bank of Boston, Citibank
of New York and Chemical, exchanged digitized check images across
dissimilar systems as part of a pilot sponsored by FSTC.  "The
ultimate aim of interbank check imaging is check truncation," notes
one FSTC member. 
     The next steps for interbank check imaging involve adding
security features, anticipated industry standards, and remote storage
capabilities.

     *  Biggest Development in Electronic Commerce:  The multiple new
products promising hardware-based encryption and back-end support for
Internet commerce.
     "There has been a lot of hype about the potential for break-ins,
but now with recent [product] developments, the Internet is viable,"
explains Iang Jeon, senior analyst with Forrester Research,
headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.
     For example, the Templar Certification Program, introduced last
year by Premenos Technology Corp. of Concord, Calif., allows
electronic data interchange (EDI) vendors to incorporate Templar with
their translation software to offer secure Internet EDI.  Similarly,
the Internet Services Roadmap from Digital Equipment Corp., based in
Maynard, Mass., offers a set of secure Internet services for users and
service providers.
     Other companies that introduced new products last year for
sensitive data transmission over the Internet include RSA Data
Security and Netscape Communications Corp., both of Redwood City,
Calif., and Atalla Corp. in San Jose, Calif. (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 1).
     *  Most Talked About Product:  Rapid*EDI.  The low-cost financial
data interchange system was scheduled to pilot in July but hit a snag
when Sterling Software of Dallas pulled out of the project (CORP, May
31, p. 1). MCI Communications Corp. of Arlington, Va., then chose
CertiSoft Solutions of Englewood, Colo., to produce the software
(CORP, Oct. 18, p. 8). 
     The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) had
awarded MCI the contract for this project in 1994 to provide a cheap,
Windows-based EDI service in hopes of boosting financial EDI volumes
on the automated clearing house network (CORP, Dec. 14, p. 1). 
Regardless of the delay, NACHA believes it has achieved part of its
goal of encouraging the development of financial EDI:  There are now
at least five low-cost financial EDI packages on the market.

     *  Most Surprising Trend of 1995:  Only a handful of banks rushed
to take advantage of newly loosened interstate banking rules.  Since
October, bank holding companies have been allowed to unify multistate
operations on a single platform.  But "I don't see [many] banks doing
it," notes Connie Beck, executive vice president with NationsBank,
headquartered in Charlotte, N.C.  "We see it as one of our key
competitive advantages for [the next three years]."
     Indeed, banks have claimed for years that putting their corporate
products on a single platform would allow them to slash costs, reduce
errors and add new technologies more quickly.  But Cynthia Glassman,
managing director with Furash & Co. in Washington, D.C., speculates
that some large banks may be tied to the strategies they developed in
the era of restrictive geographic boundaries -- emphasizing local
service, granting local bank presidents autonomy to react to regional
conditions, and encouraging internal competition to push down costs.
      Glassman warns that this may not be a viable strategy in 1996. 
"Entrepreneurs like to deal with the president of the bank, and
they're not going to do that with a big, nationwide bank," she said.

     *  Sign of Things To Come:  The EBT Council held its inaugural
meeting in 1995 (CORP, Sept. 20, p. 1).  The group was organized by
NACHA to help facilitate the Federal EBT Task Force's plan for a
nationwide infrastructure that will enable EBT processors to handle
transactions across the country, allowing for the portability of
benefits.  The EBT Council also will take up the continuing
controversy over bidding procedures used to award EBT contracts.

     *  Biggest Bank Merger of the Year:  Chemical and Chase.  The $10
billion merger, due to be finalized this summer, will create a titan
in the fields of transaction processing and funds transfer services,
industry watchers predict.  
     The "new" Chase will have a strong international presence,
greater role in electronic funds transfer and more resources to
bankroll bold technological experiments.  In the New York area alone,
the combined banks will account for 35 percent to 40 percent of the
wholesale banking markets, estimated one analyst who asked not to be
identified (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 1).
     In addition, Yun Jae Chung, a banking analyst with NatWest
Securities Corp. in New York, says the banks generated about $1.9
billion in 1994 from their transactions processing businesses alone. 

     *  Most Daring Prediction for 1996:  EDI is dead.  "Not only have
EDI implementations flattened, they've trailed off," notes Mike
Alfonsi, who manages the treasury consulting practice at CoreStates
Bank, based in Philadelphia.  Alfonsi anticipates little growth in EDI
at the current price of implementation.  "We've a hit a wall with
cost," he claimed.
     Another consultant, who asked not to be named, added that EDI is
taking on another form.  Moving transaction data electronically is
available through procurement cards, lockbox imaging and E-mail, says
this consultant, who claims:  "Over the short run, no one is going to
make a lot of money on EDI." 
     Beck counters that "more and more companies have the systems in
place to really leverage EDI, some of them are increasingly making it
mandatory."

     *  Top Advice for 1996:  Get your feet wet with ECP if you
haven't already, recommends Steve Takahashi, group senior vice
president for ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc., in Chicago.  Takahashi
believes more banks will develop ECP systems this year and begin to
exchange items electronically to slash check fraud, boost
productivity, develop new return item products, and take advantage of
ECP-related discounts offered by some Federal Reserve banks.  
     "Many banks have developed ECP systems, but they haven't gone
live," he noted.  The problem is, most banks only are set up to send
but not receive ECP transmissions.  ABN-AMRO hopes to begin exchanging
ECP items early this year.  (Dave Medeiros, The Tower Group, 617/235-
5777; Steve Takahashi, ABN-AMRO Services Company, 312/904-7477; Bank

NACHA, EDIBANX DISCUSS LINK TO SPUR EDI IMPLEMENTATION  

     The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) and the
EDI Bank Alliance Network Exchange (EDIBANX) are considering ways to
tie the two networks together to facilitate more widespread use of
financial electronic data interchange (EDI).  
     "One of the problems with financial EDI right now is that not
enough people are doing it," observes Scott Lang, staff director for
NACHA's Bankers EDI Council.  Both groups hope that by interconnecting
the networks they'll be able to boost bank revenues and lower costs by
increasing financial EDI volume.   
     The Bankers EDI Council moved last October to create the EDI
Integration Task Force to formally take up the issue.  Comprised of
representatives from NACHA, EDIBANX, the Federal Reserve System, New
York Automated Clearing House (NYACH), VisaNet and the leading EDI-
capable banks, the task force was scheduled to hold its first meeting
as we were going to press, at the NACHA/Treasury Management
Association Financial EDI Conference in Nashville.  
     EDIBANX and NACHA representatives, however, have been meeting
informally since June.  The early NACHA model to emerge from those
talks has certain ACH operators acting as ambidextrous "gateways,"
able to handle both the native X12 format from the EDIBANX network and
NACHA's CTX.  These gateway operators would wrap an incoming EDIBANX
transmission in the CTX envelope for delivery on the ACH network, and
would similarly unwrap any outgoing transmission for delivery on the
EDIBANX network.  
     Establishing the technical infrastructure, value-added features
and protocols may prove the easiest issues of this partnership.  The
tougher call will be whether EDIBANX will retain its franchise.
     EDIBANX "wants the traffic to go one way.  If that's something
they insist upon we'll probably never get anywhere with these
discussions," says George Thomas, senior vice president with the
NYACH.  But EDIBANX will lose its exclusivity, and possibly its
members, if the network has to accept EDI transmissions originated on
the ACH system. 

EDI Implementation Moving Slower Than Expected

     The EDIBANX network, which is operated by the Chicago Clearing
House Association, went on-line in October 1994 but quickly lost
momentum due to the slow pace of EDI implementation.  By summer 1995,
EDIBANX and NACHA had begun informal talks to explore the possibility
of working together to boost corporate-to-corporate electronic
payments.  
     "I'm not sure I can put my finger on any one reason why it's
moving slowly," says Mark Stuparich, vice president of New York-based
Chase Manhattan Bank, which has put off its EDIBANX implementation due
to weak customer demand.  "The volume has not been growing as rapidly
on the EDIBANX network as we had hoped, and so the incentive for us to
move has not been as great," he explains.  
     One incentive that has failed to materialize is cheaper pricing. 
EDIBANX had assumed there would be sufficient network volume to
justify fixed prices. Chase, and other banks with large-scale
transactions, anticipated significant savings over CTX pricing which
varies depending on the addenda size.  But Stuparich says "the volumes
aren't there yet in the EDIBANX network, so it's probably not even
fair to try to make a comparison."
     "To the extent that implementation of the EDIBANX product is
slower than anybody expected, it's probably pretty much in line with
the slowness of the rest of corporate electronic trade payments, says
Richard Bort of Richard Bort & Assocs., a consulting firm in Sherman
Oaks, Calif.
     "I got involved in financial EDI in 1986 and from that time
through today, we've been saying:  'It's coming!  It's coming!'  But
the implementation of corporate electronic trade payments has been
much slower than anybody had ever thought it would be," he says. 
     NACHA's Lang suggests it has been difficult, if not impossible,
to achieve a critical mass of EDI trading partners because not enough
financial institutions are EDI-capable.  The Chicago Clearing House
thought it had the answer with EDIBANX, which got rid of the NACHA CTX
envelope to simplify the EDI format and provided a guide to EDI-
capable trading partners.  But companies have apparently not rushed to
take advantage of the value-added features.                 "You're
not going to get companies to switch banks just so they can get  
EDI," says NYACH's Thomas.  "What you have to do," he says, "is
something NACHA is doing with the Rapid*EDI program:  Provide a low-
cost vehicle to make virtually every financial institution EDI-
capable."
     The Rapid*EDI software is a scaled-down, turnkey package, which
enables small-to-medium-sized financial institutions to receive EDI.  
     Today EDI is a risky business on the ACH network as fewer than 10
percent of NACHA-member banks claim to be EDI-capable, says Chase's
Stuparich.  By contrast, EDIBANX provides a guarantee that the
receiving bank will be able to properly handle a transaction.  
     In addition, the EDIBANX network provides syntax editing,
validation and acknowledgements, all of which NACHA has been pushed by
members to provide.  
     "They both have something to gain by having a partnership," says
Stuparich.  "What NACHA has to gain is some of the enhanced
capabilities that were built into the EDIBANX network.  I think what
EDIBANX has to gain is rapid access to a large volume of
transactions." 

Is There Sufficient Demand for EDI?

     While the obvious synergies  prompted creation of the EDI
Integration Task Force, it remains an open question whether the two
networks together will generate any more EDI traffic than they've been
able to achieve separately.  
     Though less elegant than the native X12 format used on the
EDIBANX network, NACHA's CTX envelope provides the essential EDI
capability.  And even though the CTX is limited to 9,999 addenda
records, "that hasn't been a major stumbling block in the typical
accounts payable world," says Stuparich.
     "There are a number of reasons why EDI is difficult; financial
EDI is yet a little bit more difficult," says Bort, who suggests
corporate treasurers and chief financial officers are still not
convinced they need to bother with electronic trade payments.  It will
come, says Bort, if reengineering catches up with corporate
downsizing.
     "Companies that do it right reengineer.  They find better ways to
get from point A to point B," and that includes implementing
electronic corporate trade payments, says Bort.  But, he adds, "that's
not the way corporate America has done it.  They chop the people
first.  Then they haven't got enough people to figure out how do we do
this thing called 'EDI.'" 
     NACHA and EDIBANX have the people to figure it out, but are
having some trouble figuring out how to do it together.   (Richard

CHECKFREE, SERVANTIS COMBINE TO LEAD ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Checkfree Corporation gave electronic commerce a boost when the
Columbus, Ohio company agreed to acquire software developer Servantis
Systems Holdings Inc., says one analyst.  The deal makes "Checkfree a
more effective player, and whenever you have more than a couple of
players that are capable it pushes things more quickly," observes
David Weisman, senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester
Research.
     The acquisition of Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis provides the
third leg of the triad that Checkfree has been methodically
constructing, says Michael Sapienza, Checkfree vice president for
marketing.  That triad consists of electronic consumer-, business- and
banking-services.  But until recently, Checkfree was a little wobbly
on both the banking and the business legs.  

Checkfree Alliances Corral the Market

     In a matter of months, Checkfree has gone from a consumer bill
payment service to the dominant presence in electronic commerce,
according to one financial analyst who says, "nobody is even remotely
close to them." 
     Prior to acquiring Servantis, Checkfree's focus was electronic
bill payment and invoicing.  Missing from that strategy were front-
and back-office banking capabilities.  "You need to do all those
transactions between the bank and its customers.  Checkfree never had
a very good solution for that, which is part of the reason that
MasterCard moved on," says Weisman (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 8).
     For almost three years, Checkfree and MasterCard were connected
at the hip.  "We were their exclusive electronic banking and bill
payment service provider and they were our exclusive distribution
channel to financial institutions," explains Sapienza.  But neither
partner was satisfied with the arrangement.
     Since the expiration of the MasterCard deal a year ago, Checkfree
has been aggressively signing up partners.  Milwaukee-based Fiserv
Inc., Automatic Data Processing Inc. of Roseland, N.J., Plano, Texas-
based EDS and Cybercash of Reston, Va., have tightened Checkfree's
hold on electronic bill payments and invoicing.  
     "The amount of resources it takes to do hundreds of thousands or
millions of bill payments makes this an economies of scale game.  And
Checkfree has a lot pumping through it," says Forrester's Weisman, but
he adds the company was still missing a good home banking platform.
     With Servantis, Checkfree not only gets home banking and
corporate cash management products, it also gets MasterCard back.  The
card association aligned with Servantis earlier this year to
facilitate MasterCard's wholesale banking product, MasterBanking.
     "We view the Servantis ... banking transaction processing
business, and its software and mainframe hardware, as being a superior
technical solution to that at Checkfree," says A. Christian Frederick,
Mastercard's senior vice president of remote banking and strategic
planning.  "It is quite evident that Checkfree has validated that
[opinion with this purchase.]"
     How effective Checkfree will be in leveraging its purchase of
Servantis is still an open question.  "How to best integrate the two
companies is something that is not 100 percent figured out yet," says
Checkfree's Sapienza.  Who stays and who goes, for example, will be
decided over the next 30- to 60-days, says Sapienza.  
     Another concern is the role Servantis majority owner Welsh,
Carson, Anderson & Stowe will play at Checkfree.  Because the purchase
deal is being done with both stock and cash, the New York-based
venture capital fund will end up owning more than 20 percent of
Checkfree.  (A. Christian Frederick, MasterCard, 914/249-5525, Michael
Sapienza, Checkfree, 614/825-3026; David Weisman, Forrester Research,

NCR RETURNS WITH IMAGING SYSTEM.

     Dayton, Ohio-based NCR Corp.  introduced a client server-based
image system last week.  The NCR Scalable Image Item Processing
Solution (SIIPS) provides a cost-effective alternative to mainframe-
based imaging systems, according to the company.  NCR has SIIPS
production sites running at Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Wachovia Bank,
National City Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, and Frost National Bank of San
Antonio, Texas.  SIIPS supports image statements, CD-ROM image
delivery and image archive, as well as a proof of deposit.  The
scalable system is targeted at banks processing check volumes upwards
of 100,000 items a day.  AT&T Global Information Solutions changed its
name back to NCR on Jan. 10 as part of parent AT&T Corp.'s
reorganization into three publicly-traded companies. (Joe Horine, NCR,

HONOR, MAGIC LINE SHARE POS.

     Dearborn, Mich.-based Magic Line Inc. and Southeast Switch Inc.
of Maitland, Fla., have arranged a point-of-sale (POS) reciprocal
agreement in order to extend the service area of the regional
electronic funds transfer (EFT). Merchants in the Southeast that
currently accept HONOR automated teller machine (ATM) cards issued by
Southeast Switch will now also accept the Magic Line ATM card.  And
Magic Line merchants in the Midwest will now accept the HONOR card. 
The EFT networks have had an ATM sharing arrangement for almost ten
years.  The two systems together support more than 31 million ATM
cardholders.  (Betsey Storm, Southeast Switch, 407/875-7181; Darlene

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE PRODUCTS FREQUENT VENDOR RELEASES IN '95

     Electronic commerce and on-line security dominated new product
offerings in 1995 as vendors raced to cash in on growing demand from
banks and corporations for the developing technologies. 
     For instance, Sterling Software of Dallas, and VeriFone of
Redwood City, Calif., joined Visa International of San Francisco and
MasterCard of Purchase, N.Y., in releasing electronic commerce
products last year.  
     Sterling announced COMMERCE:Connection, a suite of products that
includes Windows-based electronic data interchange (EDI) and
translation software (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 8).  Visa and MasterCard
joined forces to support a single, secure specification for bank card
purchases on the Internet (CORP, July, 12, p. 4).  And VeriFone said
it was readying Virtual Terminal software that would replace a
retailer's "grey box" from VeriFone (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 6).  

     Other new product releases in 1995 included:

     *  More Choices for International Clients.  Cut-throat
competition in the states forced many vendors to expand their
marketing efforts overseas.  For instance, Citibank introduced a
European lockbox service that offers multi-currency, multi-country
collections from a centralized facility (CORP, Nov. 15, p. 4). 
Servantis Systems Inc. of Atlanta, installed Spanish language versions
of its PEP and Micro ACH (automated clearing house) applications in
Colombia (CORP, Sept. 20, p. 6).  Also, Chase Manhattan Bank of New
York, teamed with Eurogiro Network to provide Eurogiro customers in
Japan and Europe with cross-border U.S.-dollar checking and ACH
services (CORP, June 28, p. 8).

     *  Automated Wire Transfer Services.  PNC Bank Corp. of
Pittsburgh unveiled a service that allows companies to make payments
to trading partners by transmitting a single file detailing
disbursements and payment method (CORP, Oct. 18, p. 7).  The
Regulatory Assistance Center (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 8) and Western Union
Financial Services International (CORP, Nov. 1, p. 6) of Paramus,
N.J., also introduced enhanced wire transfer services.

     *  Electronic Banking Products.  Many vendors rolled out
electronic banking products in 1995 to tap into growing demand among
banks for the technology.  For instance, Servantis unveiled Bank
Street, a suite of products including Windows- and Macintosh-based
home banking software (CORP, Aug. 23, p. 7).  And US Order of Atlanta
introduced Electronic Merchant Center, which enables merchants to
present monthly bills to customers using the World Wide Web on the
Internet (CORP, Dec. 13, p. 7).  Sprint Corp. (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 5),
Union Bank of San Francisco (CORP, Nov. 1, p. 7), and Visa
Interactive, a subsidiary of Visa (CORP, Nov. 1, p. 7) also introduced
home banking products last year.

Trade Secrets vs. Freedom of Movement


People's willingness to change jobs for greener pastures is headhunters' stock
in trade, so the recent spread of non-compete and confidentiality agreements
for card professionals is cause for their concern.

"I can understand a non-compete agreement for senior executives, but it's
becoming more common for lower-level employees, and you didn't see that a few
years ago," observes Rita Raz, principal of Analytic Recruiting Inc.  "It is
even occurring with entry-level jobs, and that is pretty scary."

Providian Corp., Capital One, and AT&T Universal Card Services are the only
major issuers that have gone this route for positions below top portfolio
jobs, but recruiters worry the practice may spread.  "Providian is extremely
litigious, and they have sued a manager two years after he left, and a junior
person was threatened with a suit," says a recruiter who requests anonymity.
She frets those kinds of actions will have a "chilling" effect on job-changing
in the industry.

A Providian spokesperson won't comment on any legal actions taken by the
company, but adds, "We don't require non-compete agreements, and we never
have."  However, all employees are required to sign a confidentiality
agreement as a condition of employment.

Confidentiality and proprietary agreements usually are sufficient to protect a
company's interests, notes Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of human
resources at Capital One Financial Corp., but there are some extremely
sensitive areas such as modeling that rate special treatment.  "As competitive
pressure increases, non-compete contracts have the potential to become fairly
common," he says.  "Companies in trouble will make outrageous salary offers to
get trade secrets if they feel they need them for survival."

Card Executives' Platinum Paychecks


In the not-too-distant past, before the shareholder- rights movement began and
corporate directors found themselves staring down the barrel of
multi-million-dollar lawsuits over executive compensation, corporations had a
free hand to reward senior executives as the board saw fit, sometimes in spite
of company performance.  Shareholder militancy and Internal Revenue Service
rule changes have changed all that, and boards of directors go to great pains
to justify the pay they grant to upper management.  Bonuses and long-term
incentive payments are playing a bigger role than ever before, much to the
chagrin of executives at floundering companies.  But for the fortunate few in
America's growth industries, the rewards have never been greater, and few
industries in the 1990s can match the growth record of the credit card
business.

In the coming months, compensation committees will be reviewing 1995
performance and determining how to reward the officers who produced those
results.  If last year is any indication, that will mean hefty paychecks for
credit card executives, both those who manage portfolios and those in related
service companies.

Performance-based pay is resulting in a windfall, as proxy statements make
clear, with many of the industry's top executives clearing more in bonus pay
than base salary.  And bonuses tell only part of the story:  between
restricted stock grants, options, and assorted perks, card bosses find
themselves in a position that Jay Gatsby could appreciate.

And why not?  Industry growth continues apace, and the competition that occurs
at the account level carries over to the executive suite.  If corporations
want to keep dancing with the guy they brought in-and almost all of the top 20
card executives are men-they had better be willing to match or exceed what the
captains of their ships could command elsewhere.

The same reasoning is being applied at second and third levels of management,
and even below.  Pay for performance, skill-based pay, and related
compensation approaches are translating into fatter paychecks for more people.
By the same token, employees at under-performing firms are faced with static
base pay and a bonus cupboard that's fairly bare.

Meanwhile, democracy is coming to card shops in that more employees are
getting bonuses and stock options.  But that also means that many employees
now face new financial risks.

Compensation Pacesetters

To get a measure of the current state of the card industry's paychecks, Credit
Card Management reviewed 1995 proxy statements issued by more than 30 publicly
held card issuers, bank holding companies, and card-related service firms.

Those reports dramatize the increasing importance of bonuses based on
corporate performance.  Last year, a third of the card industry's top
executives received more money in bonuses than base pay; on average, bonuses
equaled 89% of salary.  Two years earlier, only 11% of those officers received
more in bonuses than salaries, and the average bonus was only 60% of base.
Those who successfully enhance shareholder value stand to reap substantial
rewards.

Executives from so-called pure-play card companies dominate the list, in part
because of the enormous growth experienced by firms such as MBNA Corp.  and
First USA Inc., but also because of the nature of proxy statements.  Only the
five highest-paid officers are presented in those reports, and very few credit
card executives number in those ranks at bank holding companies.  Citicorp's
Roberta Arena may direct a $35 billion asset, but unless one's title includes
the word "chairman" at Citi, an individual will not be in that group.  As
executive vice president of bank cards, Arena rates an honorable mention in
Citi's proxy, along with a score of other execs, but that only means her
salary and bonus were somewhere south of $1.7 million in 1994.

Multi-Tiered Rewards

Since taking over American Express Co.  in the wake of 1991's Optima debacle,
Harvey Golub has engineered a noteworthy turnaround at the
travel-and-entertainment card king, refocusing attention on the core business
while tripling net income over 1992's level.  A bonus that's 255% of base pay
vaults Golub to the top of the card pack in terms of 1994 income, and two of
his lieutenants join him on the list of the industry's 10 best-paid
executives.  In contrast, the failure of Golub's predecessor, James D.
Robinson III, to achieve financial objectives in 1992 cost him a substantial
part of his bonus and, ultimately, his job.

Salary and bonus alone ignore substantial additional pay, including long-term
incentive payouts to Golub of $1.8 million in 1994, vesting in restricted
stock grants, and stock options that have boosted his stake in AmEx to 227,162
shares with an option for 752,500 more.

Not far behind was Charles M.  Cawley, whose salary and bonus more than
doubled to $2 million.  Not coincidentally, corporate net income increased
$58.8 million to $266.6 million.  Cawley was rewarded with an additional
$1,025,000 in restricted stock.

Paychecks for card issuers are fatter than their vendor counterparts, with one
exception:  Pat Thomas, chairman of the recently-merged First Financial
Management Corp., stands head and shoulders above the field, with bonuses
accounting for the bulk of his $6.8 million package for 1994.  That's
significantly above the chairman of First Data Corp., the firm that acquired
FFMC, parent of National Bancard Corp.  (NaBanco), Telecheck, Nationwide
Credit, and other payment-industry companies.

Besides its richness, Thomas's deal with FFMC was an anachronism in an era
when the compensation committees of corporate boards set executive wage
packages.  Thomas enjoyed a personal-service contract that stipulated a bonus
of the lesser of 2.5% of corporate income before taxes or the market value of
94,500 shares, with a minimum bonus of $1.8 million.  He also received options
on 500,000 shares, participation in incentive plans, and various perks,
including payment of premiums on $5 million worth of life insurance and
personal use of the corporate jet, a $59,073 value in 1994.

FFMC had 1994 revenues of $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior year and
consistent with a 29% compounded growth record over the previous five years.

Bonuses at Risk

In contrast to Thomas's bonus, Henry C.  Duques, chairman of First Data,
technically received no bonus, but that's deceptive.  Duques's package
reflects a growing management trend toward risk-based rewards for managers.
Some corporations, including Household International, are requiring senior
executives to purchase stock, and others are granting all rewards in the form
of stock and other instruments whose value is determined by company
performance.

In Duques's case, a 1994 performance grant worth $3 million was granted.  Half
of that amount was in the form of options on 372,088 shares at $40.31; in
mid-1995, shares were trading at $63, a nifty $8.4 million gain if the option
was executed.  The other $1.5 million is dependent on First Data's return on
equity in 1995 and 1996.

A similar calculated gamble is being taken by Capital One Financial Corp.'s
top executives, Chief Executive Richard D.  Fairbank and President Nigel W.
Morris.  In September, the two agreed to forego cash bonuses and stock options
until the turn of the century in exchange for a one-time grant of 1.5 million
and 1 million shares, respectively, at $29.19 per share.  Half the option
vests only if the share price reaches $37.50; the balance vests in increments
up to $50.

Their potential $52 million windfall in five years comes at the cost of
generous bonuses in the past.  In 1994, when Capital One was spun off by
Signet Banking Corp., Fairbank netted $8.08 million and Morris $4.35 million
in cash and restricted stock.

Golden Handcuffs

Stock performance is a major factor in most executives' incentive plans.
Typically, a hypothetical investment of $100 in the corporation's stock is
compared over time to a similar investment in a peer group's stock or a
general index.  If target prices are exceeded, the pool of incentive pay goes
up accordingly; if objectives are not reached, some or all of the pool is in
jeopardy.

Earnings per share or net profits often determine to what extent executives'
incentive pool will be funded.  Often, disbursements are in the form of
restricted stock that vests in three to five years.  "It's more of a golden
handcuff than a lucrative element of the compensation package," says Donald M.
Cunningham, principal of Tulsa, Okla., recruitment firm BankSearch Inc.

A 25% gain in stock value in 1994 was sufficient cause for rejoicing by
marketer Ideon Group Inc.'s directors to boost bonuses beyond the maximums set
in 1993.  Maximum incentives of 30% to 120% of base pay had been set from the
manager to the chief-executive level, but the compensation committee was so
pleased with the organizing work for the cobranded PGA Tour Partners card that
it awarded bonuses of 160% of base, and 190% in the case of Chief Executive
Paul G.  Kahn.

Unfortunately for Ideon, the PGA card has not lived up to expectations, and
the firm has had a shaky 1995.  Top management shares the down-side risk,
which was not the case under former Chief Executive Steven J.  Halmos, who
resigned in late 1992, when the stock lost 13% of its value.  Halmos received
$2.65 million in salary and no bonus in 1991 and 1992, but that compensation
approach ended with a 1993 amendment to the federal tax code.  The amendment
restricts the deductibility of compensation over $1 million unless
pre-established performance goals are met.  That's why corporate boards now go
to considerable lengths to justify executive pay in proxy statements.

Top executives who derive all of their compensation from base salary are a
rarity, and the same is becoming true of lower-level managers.  Restricted
stock seldom is part of compensation at the second and third tiers, but stock
options and other perks are beginning to filter down.  Signing bonuses and
generous relocation packages are becoming more prevalent, recruiters report,
particularly for positions with highly valued skill sets.  BankSearch's
Cunningham cites the case of a collections supervisor who received perquisites
with little or no relation to the job.  "An auto came into play even though it
was apparent he was desk-bound," Cunningham recalls.

Comparative Pay Scales

With the vast majority of management jobs in the $50,000 to $150,000 range,
credit card recruiters focus their energies filling those posts.  Wide
disparities exist for comparable positions in different geographic areas and
between banks, but generally managers at the low end are garnering bonuses of
5% to 7% of base, vice presidents and assistant vice presidents typically fall
in the 10% to 15% range, and higher-level executives can realize up to 30% of
base in annual bonuses, recruiters say.

A risk analyst probably will enjoy slightly higher pay by working in a card
program as opposed to mortgage lending, auto loans, or some other area of a
bank, but the main distinction is demand.  While he predicts "tremendous
growth both in terms of the number of jobs and the compensation" for debit
card marketers in the next five years, headhunter George C.  Genel concedes
debit counterparts "are probably paid a little less" than their opposite
numbers in credit.

Even in customer service and collections, "credit card people tend to be paid
better than their retail-banking counterparts because they're recognized as
more crucial to the success of the card business," suggests John D.  Walp, who
recently left CoreStates to become director of compensation and human resource
systems at Advanta Corp.  "Customer-service staffers do double duty because
they also act as salespeople, whereas their counterparts in a branch may only
answer questions."  Collections on unsecured loans also are more sensitive
than an auto loan for which the bank has recourse, Walp adds.

Nonbanks and pure card issuers such as Advanta rate an edge in pay over their
bank counterparts, recruiters indicate.  GE Capital Corp.  is consistently
cited as a leader.  "They want the best people, and they live in an expensive
market (Connecticut)," explains New York recruiter Nancy Griffiths.

Marketers in Demand

With competition heated for new accounts, card marketing specialists are one
of the industry's hottest commodities, with top people almost finding
themselves in a bidding war for their services, Cunningham notes.  Salary
spikes in the 30% range have occurred over the last two years for
product-management and marketing jobs, he says.  One prospect he was wooing
was offered a 25% pay hike to $93,500 in a less-expensive market, but turned
it down, believing an even more attractive offer will soon come his way.

Recruiter Donald D.  Duggan of Westminster, Colo., says that prospect may be
right.  A marketing manager he recently recruited also received a 25% raise, a
$10,000 signing bonus, a guaranteed bonus of $10,000 the first year, and a
relocation package "that will put $4,000 to $5,000 extra in his pocket," says
Duggan.

"The business has gotten more sophisticated, and complexity has made the
second- and third-level managers more valuable," agrees recruiter Judy Collins
of Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest.  Ten years ago, she was placing
credit policy and risk managers in $45,000 jobs; today, the same positions
command $70,000 to $80,000.

Equity Positions

Signing bonuses are becoming quite common, according to Genel of Thousand
Oaks, Calif.  "Most companies will purchase the old home of a person who has
to relocate after 60 to 90 days, and perhaps pay the points and fees to close
on the new house," he adds.  "Bonus programs that used to top out at 10% now
are at 12% to 15%, and people are reaching those caps."

The biggest potential bonus is equity in the card portfolio itself.  Companies
like Capital One have a distinct advantage over banks in tendering that bonus
to the rank and file.  Once its initial public offer was complete and its fate
was no longer tied to Signet's, where poor performance in other business lines
could mitigate sterling card results, Capital One had the latitude to reward
risk-taking that boosts the bottom line in a way banks cannot, Dennis H.
Liberson, vice president of human resources, says.  It began last March by
unveiling a stock option plan called OneGrant that extends all the way down to
the mail room.

OneGrant entitles every full-time worker to buy up to 200 shares at the
then-current price of $19.31 per share.  Half the options vest after two years
and the balance in March 1998.  And while many option offers expire in three
to five years, Capital One employees have 10 years to exercise them.

OneGrant "whetted associates' appetite" for the employee stock-purchase plan
that came next, according to Liberson.  All staff members can now designate up
to a 15% payroll deduction for the purchase of Capital One stock at 15% below
the market price.  By year-end, participation had climbed to more than 800
employees, almost a quarter of the work force.

At one point last year, employees had realized paper profits of about $2,000
apiece on their options.  A subsequent price dip all but wiped out that gain.
Management recognizes the need to balance the goal of building an
entrepreneurial spirit with the demoralizing effect plummeting stock prices
can have, particularly on young staffers inexperienced in the ways of the
market.  "We knew a correction would come, but that long-term we could drive
stock appreciation," Liberson says.  That's why the company limited the amount
that employees could invest, even in the case of middle- and upper-level
managers.

Non-Financial Goals

A third program dubbed Entrepreneur Grant rolled out in September.  The 50 top
managers, excluding Morris and Fairbank, could swap up to 25% of their base
pay and bonuses over the next three years in exchange for stock options; 43
took advantage of the offer and eventually will own about 286,000 shares.

Participation was unanimous at the senior level, Liberson reports, though some
managers with less disposable income elected not to enroll (the program
included managers in the $50,000 to $60,000 range).  "A mandatory stock-option
approach would not work very well because it could create financial stress for
some associates," Liberson explains.  Likewise, granting restricted stock to
executives would not motivate them as much to drive up stock prices as an
option plan in which their own cash is at risk.

Bonuses can be paid to virtually every AT&T Universal Card Services Corp.
employee, though they have less to do with financial performance than how well
customer service is delivered.  "We can measure 100 different processes daily,
from telephone response time to the accuracy of invoices, and every
measurement has a defect standard," says Ira S.  Walter, UCS's director of
human resources development.  A bonus is paid quarterly based on the number of
days the standard was met; bonuses typically are in the 8% to 10% range for
customer-service operators.

Financial performance comes into play in management ranks, but even there
customer service impacts pocketbooks.  "Every single employee, including the
CEO, has an element of their bonus that depends on customer delight," says
Walter.  "What determines long-term success is customer loyalty, and we want
to engage everyone in that focus."

Bonuses of 30% for senior-level positions at AT&T are common, recruiters
indicate.  Walter declines to comment on specifics, but says, "we are willing
to pay significantly more than the competition if they earn it.  We
participate in salary surveys to determine compensation rates, so we know
we're competitive."

Downside of Risk

Although Advanta has several lines of business, three-quarters of revenues
derive from credit cards, so performance in that arena dictates overall
performance and share value.  Employees at every level are invited to take an
ownership position through a stock purchase plan and a 401-k plan that
includes Advanta stock as an investment option.  The stock purchase provides a
15% price discount and is limited to 15% of compensation.  "The trend
definitely is to be more inclusive in making bonuses an integral part of the
compensation package, so that pay has some risk involved, based on company
performance," Walp says.

Jack B.  Hofmann, Advanta vice president of human resources, willingly accepts
the risk of staff angst if the stock takes a bath.  "We're not the kind of
place that attracts people looking for security," he says.  "We generally
attract people who are willing to put their pay at risk.  That makes for a
more highly motivated work force."

The danger is that employees may end up sharing risks in market forces over
which they have no control.  A case in point is the collections area, where
consolidation is occurring at a rate significantly above that of card
issuance.  Smaller firms are ill-equipped to compete, and shareholder value is
plummeting for some.  A $100 investment in Payco American Corp.  in 1990 was
worth $59.14 at the end of 1994, and that drop is reflected in the pay of top
executives.

Top managers at Payco saw their bonuses slashed 10% last year, resulting in 4%
declines in total compensation for the two top executives.  Stock options
haven't been a factor in their packages since 1992.  And while there's
justification in holding a president and chairman accountable for a decline in
corporate profitability, the connection becomes more tenuous when people have
a limited impact on strategic success.

That may have been part of the thinking of Hatim A.  Tyabji, president and
chief executive of terminal maker VeriFone Inc., who asked his board to forgo
cash bonuses for himself and other executives after earnings and stock prices
dipped in 1993.

Though VeriFone's performance improved in 1994, Tyabji made the same request
last year.  Instead, he asked that cash bonuses be used for a cash and
time-off bonus program for all employees.  The board agreed and also granted
stock options to the executive officers.

VeriFone's balancing act is instructive for all corporations as incentive pay
continues to get pushed further down the line.  Everyone enjoys sharing the
rewards, but there's a limit to the amount of risk that can be imposed on the
rank and file.

Sweeter Deals for Entry-Level Workers


Compensation that reflects shareholder value is a given for occupants of the
executive suite, but the same philosophy is being extended all the way down to
entry-level service workers at some card shops.

Performance bonuses are most common in collections and recoveries, an area
where the cost-effectiveness of rewarding top performers is easily measured.
"It's easy to create incentives to make sure your top performers get the most
pay in that area, but it's more of a challenge to incent strict
customer-service jobs," says Kathy A.  O'Doherty, human resources manager for
First Chicago Corp.'s First Card operation.

Advanta Corp.'s Jack B.  Hofmann isn't so sure.  "There are all kinds of ways
to make call-center jobs fun while linking them to clearly defined outcomes,"
the vice president of human resources believes.  Trips and prizes, in addition
to cash, are all part of the incentive mix for hourly employees at Advanta.
"People are motivated by more than money," Hofmann says.  "They want to be
challenged and recognized."

Customer service and other hourly positions are pegged to the going wage rate
in a geographic market, not to any prevailing industry rate, points out Jo
Anne R.  Moeller, who oversees compensation for Banc One Corp.'s 50,000
employees.  But being competitive isn't enough when full-tilt expansion is on
the agenda, and that's the challenge faced by Capital One Financial Corp.,
which intends to add 1,000 entry-level jobs in the Richmond, Va., market alone
this year.

To increase the desirability of Capital One over other local firms, the
company is rolling out a benefits package that includes health insurance for
all associates working 20 hours or more per week, and three weeks vacation
after a year.  "We're competing for people in a very tight labor market,"
explains Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of human resources.

Thus, Capital One decided to reallocate resources to reward people more in the
earlier stages of their careers rather than on the basis of seniority and
position.  By slashing employee attrition and going to more of a managed
health-care approach, Liberson expects the new benefits package to end up
costing the same as the program it replaces.

Liberson also expects retention of longer-term employees to be aided by the
stock-option plan Capital One introduced in March.  Besides giving employees a
very real stake in the company's performance, that program is creating
stock-ticker watchers out of 20-something workers with no investment
experience.

The change is reflected in the types of questions top executives hear at
monthly "town meetings" for employees at various Capital One facilities.
"They're fielding fewer questions on mundane, trivial personnel stuff, and
more on the company's business strategy and stock price," reports Liberson.
"The climate is different."

Number-Crunchers Are a Hot Commodity


For young people interested in a career in credit cards, here's a word of
advise:  buy a calculator, get a pocket protector, and master the art of
mathematical model-building.  The credit card industry wants numbers people,
and it's bidding up the price for good ones.

"The competition this year for credit policy and risk specialists is tougher
than I've ever seen it," one frazzled card recruiter reports.

With one eye on rising delinquencies and the other on analysts' resumes,
portfolio managers are trying to hire the experts who can minimize losses and,
hopefully, boost profits.  Helping to make these skills white-hot is
competition for those experts from new quarters.  Long-distance telephone
companies and utilities are discovering a need for risk-management help, and
they are bidding for the services of the banking industry's stars in risk
scoring, credit policy, and modeling.

"Data is data, and if you can leverage it into a model that reduces losses or
increases profitability for an issuer, that can mean millions of dollars to a
company," says Rita Raz, principal of Analytic Recruiting Inc., a New York
firm specializing in placing people in analytical functions.  "An analyst with
one year's experience can pretty much move anywhere in the country."

Recruiter Judy Collins of Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest points to the
work of Fair, Isaac and Company and CCN-MDS in modeling for sparking the job
boom.  "The tools became available for this business, and that is creating the
demand for people with backgrounds in math, computer science, or some other
numbers-type of degree," she says.

On the other hand, people with general management backgrounds may find the
going rough in the coming years.  "It's a soft market for people-to-people
skills," Collins notes.

The Nine Lives of Dale Browning


You might say, card industry utility man D.  Dale Browning can't resist a
challenge.

When asked by friends to evaluate Golden, Colo.-based ProCard Inc., a
struggling procurement card company they were thinking about investing in,
Browning quickly accepted.  After weeks of review of the ProCard operation and
its strengths and weaknesses, Browning returned to his friends with a 30-page
report, a two-hour presentation, and the conviction that ProCard had
potential.  "The more I studied the company, the more I concluded that it has
a very, very good product," he says.  "But it had not been marketed properly
and not enough money had been put behind it."

So, when his friends asked Browning to invest in the 6-year-old privately held
company, "I thought about it for a week," Browning says.  "Then I said I
wouldn't make an investment unless I could manage the company.  They agreed."
Once again, the industry veteran found himself in the middle of an emerging
market:  the corporate purchasing card arena.

Indeed, it came as no surprise to friends and industry observers that Browning
jumped at the chance to pump new life into ProCard.  Browning has decades-long
experience in all facets of the card business, is familiar with procurement
card programs, and has a track record of operating successful card programs,
says Denny D.  Dumler, president of Visa Plus, Visa's on-line global
automated-teller-machine network.  Dumler worked closely with Browning for
nearly 25 years, first at Rocky Mountain Bankcard System and later at Plus.
"I can't think of anyone better equipped" to run ProCard, Dumler says.  "He's
a real giant in the industry."

A Pioneer

Browning's professional life has been one of breaking new ground, first in
bank cards-in 1969, he participated in the creation of BankAmericard, the
forerunner of Visa-and later in electronic banking and debit cards-he served
on a committee that designed the first off-line debit card, which evolved into
the Visa check card.

And Browning's accomplishments didn't stop there.  During his 25-year tenure
at Colorado National Bank, he made the Denver-based bank a force to be
reckoned with in both consumer credit cards and electronic banking.  In 1968,
he founded Rocky Mountain BankCard System, the card issuing subsidiary of
Colorado National Bank, and one of the largest bank card processors in the
western United States.  While there, he helped develop a card program for the
U.S.  government, a prototype for what is now known as a procurement card.

Browning followed that in 1982 with the creation of Plus System Inc., a
regional electronic banking network which later evolved into the first
national automated-teller network in the U.S.  And he served as president of
CNB and Rocky Mountain from 1986 until November 1993.  He continued as chief
executive of Plus until 1993 when Visa took over that company.

At that time, Browning became senior consultant to Visa International.  And
when offered the opportunity to take over ProCard, he couldn't refuse.  "The
more time I spent at (ProCard), the more intrigued I was with the software,"
he says.  "The software was quite flexible.  The enhancements they were
working on would greatly increase their ability to compete and handle
additional volume."  ProCard's PC-based software provides an integrated
purchasing card management system designed to reduce the administrative costs
of procurement card programs.

In addition, Browning says, "I was impressed with the people who worked
there."

To be sure, ProCard-which provides backroom support for banks offering
corporate card products and services-has a lot going for it.  An early entrant
in the corporate purchasing card arena, it serves four banks nationwide-First
National Bank of Chicago, National City Bank, NationsBank, and Cass Bank, the
nation's largest freight-payment provider.  In September, when Browning took
over as president and chief executive, some 420 corporations, including 100
Fortune 500 companies, used ProCard services.  During the first few months
under Browning, ProCard added about 120 new corporations and was in
discussions with about a dozen others.

Different Direction

But ProCard was a victim of its own success:  It had trouble keeping pace with
the demand for its services.  In early September, the company had a backlog of
80 corporate users waiting for software to link the ProCard system to their
general ledgers, Browning says.  And that slowed system growth in both volume
and number of customers.

Despite these problems, however, ProCard is the right product for the right
time, Browning says.  "The timing is right," he says.  "Within the last year,
there have been more banks committed to procurement or purchasing card
programs than in all the years prior.  It's going to be like a snowball going
downhill."  Indeed, the volume on ProCard cards alone is increasing by 20% a
month compared to a year ago, Browning adds.

But before ProCard can reach its potential, it needs to head in a different
direction, Browning says.  Under the strategy mapped out by ousted founder and
former chief executive Stanley Anderson, client banks had to conform to
ProCard's requirements.  For example, ProCard worked exclusively with
MasterCard International.  "This company is no different than other software
companies," Browning says.  "It should support all products irrespective of
how they're branded in the marketplace."  ProCard now works with both the Visa
and MasterCard associations.

Anderson says he planned to make ProCard brand neutral, but was initially
limited to MasterCard because ProCard was using software from Columbus,
Ga.-based processor Total System Services Inc.  that was compatible only with
MasterCard's system.

ProCard also used to work exclusively with a single processor-Total System,
another fundamental mistake in Browning's eyes.  "A company should be
responsive to the needs of the banks, not make the banks go with its
processors," he says.  ProCard is negotiating agreements that enable it to
link up with any processor.

What's more, ProCard formerly required clients to buy the entire procurement
card package, from software to training to client services, Browning says.
"We debundled all that," he says.  "A bank can select and choose what services
it wants to buy.  It doesn't have to buy the whole package."

The ProCard package enables banks and their corporate clients to review, edit,
audit, and reconcile bank card transactions on a daily basis and
electronically post the purchases to the companies' general ledger systems.

European Retreat

After assuming control of ProCard, Browning also shut down the company's
European office.  "In my view, we hadn't capitalized on the opportunities in
the U.S.  For this company to take on the responsibility (of the European
market) meant we'd have to expand at the expense of the U.S."  Ownership of
the European operation-Ireland-based ProCard Inc.  Ltd.-was awarded to
Anderson when he left the company in July.

But even this shift in underlying philosophy isn't enough to guarantee success
for ProCard.  In its rush to meet customer demands for specialized information
reporting, ProCard "spent quite a bit of money putting in fixes to systems"
rather than looking at what enhancements the program might need in the long
term, Browning says.  "Now we're reallocating resources on working on a
completely new system with all the enhancements," he says.

ProCard is expanding beyond transaction processing to providing value-enhanced
functions, for example, breaking out information for corporations required to
report on transactions with minority vendors.  Those enhancements are
scheduled for release in mid-1996.

Already, ProCard has corrected many of the problems resulting from its rapid
growth.  Since taking over at ProCard, Browning has funneled more resources to
upgrading software and hardware to cope with the expected growth in volume.
The new product system-expected to be in place by the middle of this
month-will handle four times the volume and do it in half the time, Browning
says.

And the company also has eliminated the 3 1/2 month backlog of some 90
corporate clients waiting to come up on the ProCard system by hiring 10
additional computer programmers.  "Now we have a backlog of 30 companies,
which is super.  That's as fast as we can do it," Browning says.  "The
turnaround from the time the corporation signs and the custom programming is
less than four weeks."

ProCard has also added new staff to go out to the corporate clients and train
their employees.  And the company is setting up a customer-service center that
will take calls directly from the banks' procurement card customers, rather
than having the corporate customers call the bank first.  "The bank won't have
to build its own infrastructure," Browning says.  "The bank tells us how they
want the calls handled.  And the (corporate) customer will think he's dealing
with the bank."

With all these changes, Browning says he believes ProCard will be able to
capture a large share of the procurement card market.  But he concedes that it
will take time to get ProCard back on track.  "In a couple of years, we'll get
the company going down the right path," he says.

If that happens, Browning will have yet another success story to add to his
list of accomplishments

Catch-Up Time At MasterCard


In an exploding U.S.  debit card market, the contest for bank card association
supremacy is turning into more of a rout than a race.  For while MasterCard
International and Visa U.S.A.  offer similar products and both have
implemented aggressive marketing strategies, Visa has solid control of the
off-line card market, and is processing millions more on-line point-of-sale
transactions monthly.  Now MasterCard, with new leaders at its debit helm, is
trying to pull something out of its hat that will cut into Visa's lead.

Through the first half of 1995, 5.8 million MasterMoney off-line cards had
been issued by 665 financial institutions, compared to 25.1 million Visa check
cards by 1,808 issuers.  MasterCard refuses to release transactions figures
for its Maestro on-line debit product, but analysts believe it is low.  Visa's
Interlink, meanwhile, is the largest on-line POS network, processing more than
15.8 million monthly transactions.

It's against this background of Visa dominance that Purchase, N.Y.-based
MasterCard is launching different marketing projects while simultaneously
adjusting to management changes.  Last summer it was announced that G.  Henry
Mundt III, president of MasterCard's Cirrus System Inc.  global automated
teller machine network, would become executive vice president of MasterCard's
Global Debit Services Group, replacing John O.  Smith who planned to retire at
year end.  Steven L.  Van Fleet is replacing Smith as general manager of
Maestro International.

And in October, Arthur Kranzley, who headed Maestro in the U.S.  since its
formation in 1993, left to become senior vice president for Horsham, Pa.-based
Advanta Corp., a non-bank financial-services provider and a major credit card
issuer that employs former MasterCard chief Alex W.  "Pete" Hart.  Kranzley's
replacement has not been named.

Hard Press

Though Mundt emphasizes that the personnel moves will not affect MasterCard's
strategies and that most of the MasterMoney and Maestro management teams are
unchanged, analysts still expect it to be years before MasterCard is able to
significantly reduce Visa's debit lead in the U.S.  Observers attribute
MasterCard's position to its previous debit strategy that emphasized Maestro's
international expansion, rather than MasterMoney's or Maestro's domestic
growth.  Most U.S.  card issuers give off-line cards marketing priority
because the products generate much larger interchange revenues ("The Debit
Card Balancing Act," December, 1995).

"When MasterCard was building up Maestro, Visa was putting the hard press on
the Visa check card," says D.  Mark Jackson, vice president of St.
Louis-based Boatmen's Bancshares, a leading MasterMoney issuer.  "After
MasterCard redirected it focus, Visa check card already had a huge lead.  And
once a bank is issuing cards, it is hard to get them to change brands."

Visa gained its off-line advantage in spite of MasterMoney's interchange fee
schedule that generates higher transaction revenues for issuers than does the
Visa check card.  On a $100 non-supermarket purchase, MasterMoney acquirers
pay card issuers between $1.31 and $1.69 for electronic transactions, compared
to $1.08 when a Visa check card is used.

Among the strategies used by Visa to expand Visa check card issuance are
market launches in specific cities that feature month-long advertising
campaigns utilizing such vehicles as newspapers and radio.

Assisting Issuers

With Visa dominating the off-line market, MasterCard finds itself working
harder to expand its presence.  The association is running television
commercials that explain how MasterMoney operates.  And MasterCard's 1996
focus will be to assist issuers in broadening their card bases, and triggering
more activity.  Initiatives will include regional and local advertising,
including direct mail.

"The bottom line is that Visa and MasterCard have good off-line debit products
and there is a still huge, uncommitted, market out there," Mundt says.  About
65% of financial institutions are not yet issuing off-line cards.

But while MasterMoney is gaining strength domestically, Maestro's strongest
impact has been overseas.  Though only about 13 million Maestro cards have
been issued in the U.S., 100 million cards are committed worldwide.  Maestro
is particularly strong in Latin America, where 5.5 million cards have been
issued in the last two years in such countries as Argentina, Chile, Ecuador,
Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela.

This strong international activity eventually will spread to the U.S., Maestro
executives believe.  Mundt projects Maestro's growth rate will exceed that of
Cirrus.  The ATM network, which had volume of just 60,000 transactions during
its first year in 1983, is expected to have processed more than 300 million
transactions in 1995.  Maestro has more than 55,000 merchant locations,
compared to more than 64,000 for Interlink.

Shifting Emphasis

To stimulate Maestro expansion in the U.S., MasterCard is shifting its
emphasis from issuers to signing merchant acquirers.  The association's goal
is to have the nation's top 50 credit card acquirers processing Maestro
transactions this year, up from 36 in 1995, and it is aggressively lobbying
independent sales organizations to sell Maestro to merchants.  Maestro also
teamed with terminal vendor VeriFone Inc.  in 1995 for a so-called Travel
Destination Program.  In that program, acquirers in key traveler locations
that sign merchants to accept Maestro receive such awards as VeriFone
terminals and personal-identification-number pads.

MasterCard expects 5,500 PIN pads and 400 terminals sets will be distributed
in the program.  Analysts estimate more than $200,000 worth of hardware will
be awarded.

Merchants also will receive price breaks on terminals as an incentive to
upgrade or trade in devices so they can support such products as debit cards
and smart cards, and electronic-purse and cardholder- loyalty programs.
Merchants and acquirers that move from paper-based systems to electronics also
will receive processing discounts.  Furthermore, Maestro is targeting
merchants that traditionally have shunned debit cards, including such chain
retailers as apparel and shoe stores, lower-cost hotels and motels, and
car-rental agencies.  MasterCard is launching a pilot with its St.
Louis-based BankMate shared regional network and Enterprise Rent-A-Car for
debit card acceptance in 20 Midwest locations.  "There is a huge market for
merchants where the customer has to pay in advance," says Carl Stefanelli,
Maestro vice president.

Momentum

By getting more merchants on board, Maestro is trying to ride an expansion
wave created in 1995 when San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank, a founding
member of Interlink, left the Visa-owned network for Maestro.  Wells is the
third-largest on-line card issuer as well as the third-largest debit acquiring
institution.  Factors that prompted the move included MasterCard's long-term
strategies, pricing, service levels, and partnerships.

"MasterCard is very focused on the on-line product, which is what Wells Fargo
needed for our customers," says Debra B.  Rossi, Wells Fargo senior vice
president, adding that the association doesn't short the MasterMoney card,
either.  "They don't rob Paul to pay Peter," she says.

Yet, even with its initiatives, Maestro still has a long road to travel before
it matches Interlink's activity.  When both networks went national in 1992,
Interlink already was the largest regional POS network in the United States,
with strong name recognition and activity on the West Coast.  Maestro started
from scratch.

"Maestro's problem is that it lacks the visibility of Interlink," says an
industry consultant familiar with MasterCard who insists on anonymity.  "It
will be more difficult for them to expand in the U.S.  than even for the
regional networks, which already have a solid market penetration."

But with its strong international presence and new domestic tactics,
MasterCard's debit movement could just be starting to hit stride.  "Our
strategy is the right strategy for a global basis," Mundt says.  "On-line,
PIN-based debit is where people want us to go."

Throwing Down The Gauntlet


The foreign invasion of the burgeoning point-of-sale market in the United
States is getting stronger with the entry of another international powerhouse.
Scotland-based De La Rue Fortronic, which controls a large chunk of the
European terminal market, has begun a North American operation in Hartland,
Wis., with a strategy of opening additional U.S.  offices and creating a
national sales force.

De La Rue is joining the stream of international vendors positioning for the
expansion of smart card programs.  While the company has shipped more than
400,000 terminals overseas and controls 45% of the United Kingdom market, 35%
of the German market, 60% of the Norwegian, and 70% of the POS terminal market
in the Netherlands, De La Rue's U.S.  presence is slight, with its terminals
just being used in small pilots.  But the company could soon become a North
American fixture.

More than 50% of De La Rue's revenues are projected to be generated from the
U.S.  within five years.  It expects to open offices on the East and West
Coasts, with a sales force situated throughout the continent.  "We're not a
flash in the pan," says Phillip Johnston, De La Rue Fortronic president.  "We
have the money and backing to make a big impact."

Laying a Foundation

De La Rue already has started laying the foundation for its North American
push.  Currently, it is the only supplier of devices for London-based Mondex's
electronic purse program, and Wells Fargo Bank is using De La Rue terminals
for its employee test of the Mondex system in Wells' San Francisco
headquarters ("Mondex Leaves the Station," October, 1995).  Guelph, Ontario,
will launch a city-wide Mondex pilot next year.  De La Rue also expects to
supply at least half the terminals for Visa's stored-value program that will
be launched in Atlanta in July in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics.
More than 5,000 merchant locations are expected to accept smart cards in the
Atlanta area.

Yet, in addition to smart card tests, De La Rue is moving into more mainstream
markets.  It is selling an unspecified number of its F95 POS devices and
software to Atlanta-based processor Nova Information Systems for deployment in
hotels and motels.  Nova recently combined its merchant bank card business
with First Union Corp.'s and First Fidelity Bancorporation's, creating the
nation's eighth-largest merchant-processing operation servicing more than
90,000 retailers.

Nova selected the De La Rue devices because the terminals have memory that is
several times greater than other vendors' devices that sell for a similar
price, says Joseph P.  Cohane, Nova vice president.  The enhanced capacity
will permit Nova to support a variety of applications on a single device, such
as frequent-user programs and check-guarantee services.

The processor also wants to support smart card programs, and De La Rue devices
are successfully operating in European chip card programs, such as Mondex in
England, Cohane says.

Starting from Scratch

But while De La Rue is the latest in a growing list of foreign-based vendors
pushing into the North American market, the company is following a
less-traveled path by starting its operation from scratch instead of
purchasing an established American company.

Before setting up shop in the U.S., De La Rue's terminals were distributed
domestically by Hartland-based Direct Data.  When Direct Data ceased
operations last September, De La Rue created its own U.S.  operation to have
stronger control over the sales and marketing of its devices.  Its Hartland
headquarters will handle sales and marketing, software development, product
management, distribution, and customer service.  Terminals will be
manufactured near De La Rue's Dunfermline, Scotland, world headquarters.

Even as De La Rue gets its house in order, executives say the company already
is well equipped to take market share away from the U.S.' two largest and
better-known terminal vendors, Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone Inc., and
Phoenix-based Hypercom Inc., in addition to other players that have increased
their marketing efforts in the last year, such as Minneapolis-based DataCard
and Redwood City-based Atalla.  The company has deep pockets, a strong product
line, and international success.  Its parent company, The De La Rue Group, had
operating revenues of $1.2 billion last year with a profit of $230.4 million.
De La Rue Fortronic generated $45 million in revenues.

The company also can leverage a 600-person service organization situated
across the U.S.  that currently services the The De La Rue Group's other
banking products, such as coin counters.  Johnston says De La Rue will
emphasize its full range of offerings to prospective customers, including
smart card applications; open architecture, which permits terminal users to
create their own software programs; and loyalty programs that can be tailored
to support individual retailers.  "We're the experts in smart card technology,
and if we didn't think we could gain major footing in the U.S., we wouldn't be
here," Johnston says.

Despite De La Rue's aggressive push into the U.S.  market, some of its more
established U.S.  competitors do not expect to change strategies to compete
with the upstart.  "I don't think (De La Rue) brings much to the party in
terms of technology," says Albert Irato, Hypercom president.  "It will have no
impact on us whatsoever."

The Line-Up

De La Rue's main products include the F95 terminal, which features 640
kilobytes of memory, an integrated printer, two-line display, and an optional
smart card reader.  Most terminals shipped over the last few years have only
32 or 64 kilobytes of memory.  Devices with greater memory can support more
complex and a greater number of applications, such as frequent-shopper and
smart card programs, in addition to standard debit and credit.  The terminal
sells for under $400.

The F105 product, which is being used in the Mondex program, features a
display which permits consumers to view the balance remaining on their
stored-value cards.  The device is priced at approximately $500.

In addition to supporting Mondex, which has 8,000 cardholders and 750
merchants participating in an electronic-purse program in Swindon, England, De
La Rue has supplied more than 2,000 F95 devices to Shell Oil Co.  that are
being used in a British customer-loyalty program.  De La Rue also will supply
terminals for Visa smart card pilots this year in Australia and Canada.

But while De La Rue is active internationally, its key aim is to import that
success to the U.S., and some analysts believe the company has the ability to
gain a domestic toehold.  "It will be an uphill battle for De La Rue, but they
have the resources and a good track record in Europe," says Jerome Svigals, a
Redwood City, Calif.-based smart card consultant.  "There is a big market and
De La Rue could very well be a successful contender."

Some More Elbow Grease, Please


Faced with fiercer competition than ever, credit card marketers returned to
the basics when they advertised their products in 1995.  The mind-numbing
onslaught in 1994 of ill-conceived television commercials featuring big-budget
special effects and print ads narrowly focused on price ("The Best of a Bad
Lot," December, 1994) were replaced by higher-quality work that deftly put
brand image first and product information second.

That's not to say card marketers have abandoned playing up key selling points,
such as interest rates and rebates, in their ads.  On the contrary, that
nuts-and-bolts technique flourishes in direct mail, where introductory
interest rates and other cardholder perks routinely appear on the front of
envelopes to draw consumers into the offer.

While the entries submitted for this year's Credit Card Management Card
Industry Marketing Awards earned higher marks from the marketing experts the
magazine assembled to judge them, the overall quality of the entries fell
short of winning the judges' highest praise.  Card marketers have plenty of
room for improvement, the judges say.

Judging the television commercials and print ads was Richard Kimmel, president
of Chicago-based Kimmel & Co.  J.  Randy Howell, vice president and senior art
director for Chicago-based DraftDirect Worldwide, judged the direct-mail
pieces.

The ads submitted in the print and television categories that failed to earn a
thumbs up were sunk by story lines irrelevant to selling credit cards,
non-distinctive brand positioning, and poor execution.  "Consumers simply
won't take time to unravel the message of a poorly constructed ad," Kimmel
argues.

At the same time, many of the direct-mail entries were weakened by verbose
copy and one-size-fits-all product positioning.  "There are really no rules
when it comes to the creative side, but successful direct marketers know their
target audience and don't make the package threatening or difficult to
understand," says Howell.

Given the shortcomings of this year's contestants, only four entries earned
recognition in the television and print categories, rather than the usual
five.  Nonetheless, our judges, both professional marketers, still found
several gems that clearly stated the brand image of the card and which were
supported by lucid copy points.

"Effective advertising takes a unique position in the marketplace," says
Kimmel.  "Unique positions can be successfully defended because they are
unlike those taken by competitors.  Consumers remember uniquely positioned
campaigns."

The surprise of this year's judging is that for the first time in the
seven-year history of the competition, neither American Express Co.,
MasterCard International, nor Visa U.S.A.  earned first-place honors in the
television category.  That distinction went to Citibank, which also netted top
honors in the print category.  Stern's, a division of Federated Department
Stores Inc., finished atop the heap in direct mail.  All observations are
based on our judges' comments.

Category:  Television Commercials

Television is one of the most power advertising mediums available because it
can use emotion and information to seize, define, and fortify a product's
position in the marketplace like no other medium, says Kimmel.  This year's
winning television ads do just that.  "Establishing a unique position is the
most important task of any ad campaign," says Kimmel.

First Place:  "Tuxedo,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.

After years of being a bridesmaid, Citibank finally gets to the awards altar
with this story of a T-shirt and jeans guy who doesn't spend a lot of money on
clothes, but who decides to go all out for his wedding day by purchasing a
tuxedo.  He pays for the tux with, you guessed it, his Citibank card.  Why
should viewers care?  Because Citibank was conscientious enough to call the
young man to make certain that the charge for an expensive tuxedo, an atypical
purchase for him, wasn't fraudulent.  It's the kind of service people don't
expect from a card issuer, but which makes the bridegroom very happy.

"This is the type of ad that takes a position in the market and builds a brand
image," says Kimmel.  "Citibank not only says it has a good product, it does a
wonderful job of telling people they give them something more than a credit
card-they serve the customer.  It's a well-executed commercial."

Second Place:  Toys 'R Us Visa,Bank of New York.  BBDO New York.

Ad agency BBDO uses clever camera angles and a play on words to bring a
fun-and-games perspective to a credit card that earns cardholders discounts on
toys based on their spending.  The slick-looking sports car the narrator is
sitting in as he informs prospective customers they can earn discounts toward
a new car when they buy a set of tires turns out to be an optical illusion.
The auto actually is a toy photographed to look like the real thing.  So, too,
is the boat hitched to the car, which the narrator says also can be bought at
a discounted price.

After dazzling viewers with this photographic hocus-pocus, the narrator
succinctly explains the card's benefits-discounts earned on Toys 'R Us
purchases for each transaction.  "The photographic sleight of hand is very
appropriate and doesn't divert viewer's attention from the sales message,"
says Kimmel.  "The benefits of the card are clearly spelled out.  It's a
charming piece of work."

Third Place:  "Vacation,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.

This story of a dad doing his job as a father is the follow-up to Citibank's
top-ranked "Tuxedo."  There's Dad talking about a recent family getaway.  One
day the wife informs him the family needs a vacation, the next day Dad is
packing everyone up for a road trip-it's his job.  Once on the road, the
family spends "a gazillion dollars" buying cheap souvenirs that will wind up
collecting dust in the closet.  Dad begrudgingly pays for it all because it's
his job.  Soon afterward, the family car breaks down.  Dad gripes and moans,
calls a tow truck and pays for the repairs-it's his job.  Dad's choice of
currency?  His Citibank card, which takes care of all his credit needs-that's
Citibank's job.

While this commercial effectively builds on the brand positioning in "Tuxedo,"
it could have more clearly explained the benefit of packing a Citi card when
mishaps occur, says Kimmel.  "You're guessing at the what the benefit is," he
explains.  "It's not clearly explained how Citibank solved the problem in a
way no other issuer can.  But it's still a good piece of work."

Fourth Place:  "Locked Out,"American Express.  Ogilvy & Mather.

Celebrities make effective product endorsers, because the sight of them
instantly grabs viewers' attention.  In this spot, comedian Jerry Seinfeld
engages in a ridiculous romp after locking himself out of his apartment while
preparing for a date.  Dressed only in a bathrobe and with just minutes before
his date arrives, Seinfeld, who just happens to have his AmEx card, dashes
across the street to buy a suit.  Emerging moments later in his dapper duds,
Seinfeld pulls together all the pieces he needs for a magical evening.  In
whirlwind fashion he tracks down a locksmith to open the door to his
apartment, purchases a bouquet of flowers and hires a quartet.  He even buys
an umbrella when an unexpected rain shower kicks up.  All the purchases are
made possible by his AmEx card.  His apartment door unlocked moments before
his date arrives, Jerry has enough time to ice the champagne for his big
night.  Too bad the door lock jammed, and he can't let his date in.

While this ad scores high marks for clearly telling viewers in a creative way
that having an AmEx card can get them out of tight situations when they have
no cash, Seinfeld's trials are too far-fetched to convincingly support that
idea, Kimmel argues.  This ad has the ingredients to have placed higher, but
in its current state it is not in the same league as the top three finishers.

Category:  Print Advertising

Critics who argue print advertisers need to shift their focus away from image
toward price may want to rethink their case.  Consumers don't respond to the
hard sell from print ads.  Instead, they expect print ads to tell a visual
story that establishes a brand image.  "You can't shout numbers at people when
they aren't listening," says Kimmel.  This year's print ad winners do nothing
of the sort.

First Place:  Citibank.  Lowe and Partners/SMS.

Citibank strikes gold again with this clever play on the old adage that people
can't judge a book by its cover.  Two photos, one of a menacing motorcycle
rider and the other of a nerdy looking fellow, are juxtapositioned to make a
strong point about the value of Citibank's photocard.  The headline next to
the biker's photo says, "This is you."  The photo next to the nerd says, "This
is the creep who stole your wallet."  The copy at the bottom of the ad
explains that a Citibank photocard provides cardholders with the security of
knowing that if their card is ever lost or stolen, con artists will have a
tough time using it.  "The ad gets to the point, explains the value of the
product, and does so with a sense a humor," says Kimmel.

Second Place:  F&M Bank, Winchester, Va.  Barber Martin & Associates,
Richmond, Va.

The strength of this ad is its headline, "The Credit Card For People Who
Thought They Couldn't Get One."  It quickly grabs the reader's attention and
draws him into the copy points, where the value of the product is clearly
explained.  A brief description of how a secured card works is also included.
Since the only graphic elements are a photograph of an F&M card and the bank's
logo, the art direction doesn't get in the the way of the message.  "This ad
is clear and distinctly positions the product," says Kimmel.  "The headline
addresses the target audience.  It's not the most charming or personable ad,
but it is effective."

Third Place:  The Associates National Bank.  Parrish Wickersham & Partners,
Dallas.

This ad targeted at the coveted college-student market uses flippant MTV-style
graphics and a pointed headline, "Are You Ready for the Real World?"  to grab
the reader's attention.  The centerpiece is a picture of the Earth, over which
several statements about the everyday financial problems facing college
students are pasted.  Smack dab in the middle, in bold type, is the headline.
Succinct copy explains why students can benefit from an Associates credit
card, which sets up the tag line, "Real Plastic for the Real World."

"This ad is irreverent enough to spark the curiosity of college students,"
says Kimmel.  "It is pointed and makes the product sound useful enough to meet
their needs."

Fourth Place:  Old Kent Bank.  Felder Communications Group, Grand Rapids,
Mich.

This ad hawking Old Kent's Card Miles program, through which cardholders can
earn discounts on airline tickets, gets right to the point.  Key selling
points are summarized in bullet fashion-free airline tickets for all U.S.
airlines can be earned with 20,000 Card Miles, and there are no blackout
periods restricting the use of the tickets.  Copy points that explain
cardholders earn Card Miles points for all transactions, even for everyday
purchases such as gas, groceries, or dry cleaning, rescue a headline that is
too pointed-"Turn groceries into free plane tickets."  A winning effort, but
plenty of room for improvement, says Kimmel.

Category:  Direct Mail

Direct mail is the medium for the hard-sell, because consumers expect to be
bombarded with special deals through the mail.  The key, however, is not to
create a piece that makes consumers feel unimportant by using transparent
flattery or pitching an offer that they may feel is unaffordable, which in
turn makes them feel inadequate.  "Effective pieces address who their
customers are and what they want," says DraftDirect's Howell.  "Know your
market."

First Place:  Stern's (a division of Federated Department Stores Inc.)
Heinrich Marketing.

What puts this piece above the competition is the simplicity of its message.
The oversized envelope displays part of a $20 bill in a window, which
immediately implies the offer brings savings.  To the left of the window is a
green border-the color of money-with the headline, "What You See Is What You
Get."  At the bottom of the envelope is a tag line, "Extra Cash the Next Time
You Shop."

Inside, the letter features a $20 coupon good toward Stern's charge card
purchases.  The letter clearly lays out the benefits of accepting Stern's
preapproved credit offer:  a $20 coupon, and an additional 20% off purchases
the first day the card is used.  A postscript at the bottom of the page lists
the location of the Stern's store nearest the prospect.  The back side of the
letter displays a map listing the addresses of the 27 Stern's stores in New
York and New Jersey.  "This offers implies real value without talking down to
the customer, and summarizes the key points," says Howell.  "There is no
guessing as to what the offer is about."

Second Place:  Bank of New York.  Gillespie Advertising Inc.

This entry for Bank of New York's Toys 'R Us Visa earns high marks for its use
of four-color printing and the continuity of its marketing message throughout
the entire package-"Turn everyday spending into free toys."  The message is
repeated on both sides of the envelope.  Inside, a four-color, tri-fold flier
featuring silhouettes of children playing and the Toys 'R Us logo explains how
cardholders earn a 3% rebate on Toys 'R Us purchases and a 1% rebate on all
other purchases.  The rebates are redeemable toward discounts on future
purchases at Toys 'R Us as well as Kids 'R Us clothing stores.

The flier also mentions a program to earn discounts on family vacations
through Toys 'R Us.  The letter features the added caveat of a $10 Toys 'R Us
coupon for accepting the preapproved offer.  "It's a gorgeous package," says
Howell.  "There is continuity to the message in all the elements, and the
offer gets right to the point."

Third Place:  REI/SeaFirst Bank.  Hunt Marketing Group.

Using a plain, brown envelope with forest-green lettering and brown paper for
the letter gives this piece an understated look that plays to the austerity of
its target audience-outdoorsmen.  The envelope succinctly highlights the key
features of the offer:  no-annual fee, a 9.9% introductory interest rate, a 1%
rebate on purchases, and preapproved credit.

Inside, the brown-toned flier talks about Jack, a customer who earns 1%
rebates for purchases charged to his REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.)  gold
MasterCard, in addition to the rebates he earns as a member of REI's dividend
program.  These perks enabled Jack to not only buy a new parka for his wife,
but for himself, which makes Jack a "very happy camper."  "The color of this
package is not atypical, which helps it overcome initial consumer resistance,"
praises Howell.  "It has a simple, responsible look that appeals to its
audience."

Fourth Place:  Marine Midland Bank.  Marketing Resources.

This piece for Marine Midland's Humane Society Visa earns high marks for its
unconventional envelope headline, "The Visa Card Most Preferred by Everyone
From Alligators to Zebras."  Supplementing the idea are pictures of the
aforementioned animals.  A teaser rate of 9.9% and preapproved credit also are
highlighted.  Additional selling points, such as emergency card replacement
and a 24-hour toll-free customer-service number, are bulleted.  Inside, a
tri-fold flier and letter explain the card's services, and how the Humane
Society benefits from the card's use.  "The package has a little fun with the
idea of helping protect animals, and plays with the idea of covering
everything from A to Z with its envelope message," observes Howell.

Fifth Place:  Humane Society/PNC Bank.  Marketing Resources.

Unlike television and print advertising, where brand image is more critical,
numbers can still make the biggest impression in direct mail.  The strength of
this entry is its envelope, across the top of which are emblazoned three
figures, 8.75%, $0 and $5,000.  The numbers are designated, respectively, as
the introductory interest rate, annual fee, and maximum credit limit for the
card being pitched.  Underneath these figures is the headline, "Sometimes the
numbers speak for themselves."  Inside, a tri-fold flier, featuring a
question-and-answer section, addresses pertinent information about the card.
The letter includes a chart comparing interest rate charges paid on higher
rate cards to those on the PNC card for the same balances.  "This is an
easy-to-read piece that telegraphs the sales message and gets people inside
the package," says Howell.  "The flier tackles marketing points about the card
that may have fallen through the cracks, but the numbers say it all."

Love Letters From Wall Street


Despite the continued growth of major credit card issuers, Wall Street is
keeping one ear cocked for the first sounds of retrenchment in the extremely
competitive card issuing market, which explains the lukewarm reception to some
of the issuers' stocks.  But the same apprehension doesn't apply to
transaction processors, who are emerging as favorites of the investment
community.  Analysts have awakened to the realization that no matter whose
card consumers decide to carry and whether or not they pay balances off every
month or heap on more revolving debt, processors stand to gain from electronic
payment's growing share of consumer spending.

Though some processors are heavily dependent on a few large customers, buy
recommendations far outweigh hold positions, and nobody is urging investors to
sell.  As a consequence, stock prices for these firms are posting some
impressive gains, and analysts are bullish about the long-term outlook for
card processors.

From Wall Street's perspective, these are computer-services firms, and in that
category they are stars.  Recurring revenues are part of the appeal:  whereas
a software firm starts off each quarter with zero revenues, processors can
count on a steady income stream from merchants locked into multi-year
contracts.  Those revenues will only go up, too, as plastic increases its 7%
share of consumer discretionary spending.  And processors are positioning
themselves as turn-key payment solutions, with check-verification and
guarantee services, debit card acceptance, and any other non-cash payment
option that surfaces, such as corporate purchasing cards and stored-value
cards.

The processing business has fundamental strengths that appeal to many
investors.  The consolidation that is occurring among processors means a
bigger slice of an expanding pie for those that remain.  New competitors face
huge barriers to entry, and the economies of scale keep getting better.

The 800-Pound Gorilla

That said, observers nonetheless are keeping an eye on firms such as AT&T Co.
and Microsoft Inc.  that might try to make a name for themselves in card
processing.  MCI Telecommunications Corp.  gained a stake in 1993 when it
bought BT North America's processing operation.  More recently it acquired SHL
Systemshouse Ltd., a Canadian systems integrator, says Patrick M.  Burton,
information processing analyst at Lehman Brothers.  Still, new entrants are
almost obliged to find a strategic partner to compete, and the business's high
capitalization costs primarily benefits leading processor First Data Corp., he
says.

Indeed, the arrival of processing's proverbial 800-pound gorilla didn't dampen
investors' enthusiasm.  In the wake of Hackensack, N.J.-based First Data's
purchase of First Financial Management Corp., analysts retained their upbeat
prognostications for the other players.  And why not?  The only processors
they expect to take it in the neck, at least in the short term, are merchant
banks such as First National Bank of Omaha and Bank of America that compete
with FDC in the merchant end of the business.

Analyst Steven S.  Birer of Hambrecht & Quist, San Francisco, has buy
recommendations for First Data and Riverwoods, Ill.-based SPS Transaction
Services Inc., noting the latter has been priced as an issuer since its
acquisition a year ago of electronic giant Tandy Corp.'s card portfolio, and
those price-earnings multiples typically are half the ratios of processors.

Value-Added Services

Meanwhile, FDC's versatility as both a merchant and cardholder processor has
captured investors' imaginations.  A wide range of value-added services can
now be promoted, including cash management and others that traditionally have
been the province of banks.  By virtue of its position as the largest merchant
and cardholder processor, FDC is in a position to offer services that other
acquirers have shied away from because of consumer privacy concerns, says
analyst Gregory M.  Gould of Goldman Sachs & Co.  For example, a deal could be
struck with a department store whereby cardholders invoiced by FDC would
receive on-the-spot discounts at those stores' cash registers, assuming FDC
drove them.

Since its spin-off in April 1992 from American Express Co., FDC has made five
significant purchases in the processing field:  NationalCard/NationalCheck
Processing Systems, TeleMoney Services, Envoy Corp.'s card business, Card
Establishment Services, and First Financial, parent of National Bancard Corp.
(NaBanco), the nation's largest merchant acquirer.  Between NaBanco, CES, and
its own in-house merchant-procession operation, "they must be approaching 30%
of the market," estimates Richard Robida, vice president and merchant
processing specialist with Speer and Associates.

For the time being, the situation at FDC is chaotic, with customers frustrated
and confused about which subsidiary is doing what, Robida says.  "For the most
part, the FDC/FFMC merger activities are happening behind-the-scene and our
clients' daily operation and service are not affected," a First Data
Spokesperson responds.  "Also, we're working hard to keep our clients,
employees, and shareholders informed about merger activities throughout the
transition."

But, once the latest merger is digested, banks that compete with FDC will face
a tough choice:  "Either they can become a low-cost provider and slug it out
for share, or adopt an exit strategy," he says.

Hambrecht & Quist's Birer altered his rating on National Data Corp.  to hold
after the FDC-First Financial merger was announced, reasoning that corporate
marriage "significantly changed the playing field."

Banker Exodus?

It's not just the analysts who have such opinions.  "The merger of First Data
and First Financial is going to create a significant amount of introspection
from the true bank card acquirers," suggests Richardson M.  Roberts, founder
and chairman of PMT Services Inc., who predicts many of them will conclude
card processing is divorced from their core business.  "This is more a
telecommunications business than a banking business.  It's not about making
loans, it's not just credit cards, it's a lot of other payment settlement."

If and when the major bank-owned merchant portfolios come into play, "I assure
you we'll be looking at them," says Roberts, who has been building a war chest
to make such a bid.

PMT, a Nashville-based independent sales organization that does business as
U.S.  Bankcard Center, received a warm reception last year when it became the
first ISO to make a public stock offering.  It priced at $8 a share in August
1994.  A second offering of 1.875 million shares in mid-September of 1995 sold
at $22.50 per share.  Six weeks later, the stock was hovering around $26.

Leveraged Growth

While allowing that quasi-processors like PMT inhabit a risky market niche
susceptible to high merchant turnover, analysts like their short-term
prospects.  Smith Barney rates PMT as a high-risk stock that will outperform
the market; Montgomery Securities rates it a solid buy.

Capital raised in its two stock sales gives PMT the ability to buy out more
competitors, something the firm has done 20 times in recent years.  The only
difference is, now it is able to buy bigger firms that cater to higher-volume
merchants than PMT traditionally has served.  That should give PMT more
leverage to drive down transaction costs while it improves service levels to
reduce merchant attrition.

Although most merchants are authorizing transactions electronically now, "a
third of them are still paper-based, so there is still great room for growth,"
Roberts says.  He estimates 800,000 to 1 million U.S.  merchants remain to be
converted.

With so many merchants likely to go electronic in the near future, Roberts
expects volume gains over and above the 15% to 20% annual transaction growth
forecast through the end of the century.  "At that point, credit cards will
only represent 17% of consumer payments," leaving room for considerable
growth, he points out.

Roberts was left with paper wealth of almost $18 million after selling
$675,000 worth of stock in September's offer.  He started the company in 1984
at age 26.  "Our success has convinced others that this is a great
opportunity," he says.

Uneasy Acquisition

Among the independent sales organizations eying a public stock sales, analysts
say, are Nova Information Systems Inc., which backed away from an initial
public offering last spring, and Gensar, which acquired the processing
operations of TransNet Inc.  three years ago.  Nova in November took over
First Union Corp.'s merchant portfolio, which had $2.8 billion in charge
volume in 1994, in return for First Union taking a 35% equity stake in the
processor.

One of the few processor sour notes in 1995 was sounded by retail card
specialist SPS Transaction Services, and that occurred through no fault of its
processing business.  Analysts fingered the recently acquired, $920 million
Tandy credit card portfolio for the blame.  That situation only fortified
investors' reservations about the card-issuing business:  even as the market
in general and the pure card issuers in particular continue to defy
predictions of a slowdown and post huge gains, issuing's inherent risk makes
them skittish.  The stock prices of issuers often take nose dives when reports
about higher delinquencies, chargeoffs, and bankruptcies come out-and such
reports may increase in the coming months.

By comparison, processors' predictable earnings are a safe haven for anyone
interested in investing in the card industry.  "SPS's stock had gone to $30,
but they had a little bit of a stumble with the Tandy portfolio and they
failed to hit their earnings projections," points out Burton of Lehman
Brothers.  "They need to regain their earnings momentum."  SPS had been
selling at about $26 a share in November, the same price it was at 12 months
earlier when it split two for one.

Among the current crop of publicly traded processors, Atlanta-based National
Data Corp.  is the only one that isn't drawing raves from Wall Street.
Montgomery Securities' Richard K.  Weingarten rates NDC a buy, but others in
the investment community are more reserved.  "It's not that there's a
particular problem," says Interstate Johnson Lane's Sandra Barker, who picked
up NDC two years ago and has rated it a hold ever since.  "It's more a
valuation comment than anything."  With the stock's price up about 40% in
1995, the P/E ratio is down to about 22 times 1996's projected earnings,
Goldman Sachs' Gould says.

NDC has slipped to a second-tier player in the front-end terminal driving
segment of the processing business, Speer's Robida says, with only Visa's
Merchant Bank Services and MasterCard's MAPP still able to challenge FDC for
supremacy.  Visa is aligning itself with Total System Services Inc.  as the
bankers' alternative to FDC.  NDC used to have a similar strategic alliance
with Total.  NDC also has been slow to move from a voice-authorization network
to an electronic authorizer, he adds, and that has hurt it, along with
business decisions in the past that alienated many bankers.

"That's absurd," responds a NDC spokesman, adding "the bulk" of NDC's
processing volume is electronic.  "You have to have some voice authorization
because your customers want it," he adds.

The richest processor stock is Columbus, Ga.-based Total, which trades at
about 50 times earnings.  Twelve years after its IPO, Total's parent, Synovus
Corp., still owns 81% of the stock.  Its high valuation makes Total the only
processor that Weingarten rates a hold.

Bullish Outlook

Weingarten forecasts 20% to 30% earnings growth for all of the half-dozen
processors he follows.  He characterizes the category as the new breed of
stock leaders, able to outperform the market year after year.  "Incentive
cards have helped processors gain tremendous share, but the real driver is
wider merchant acceptance," he says.  "When credit card growth slows, other
businesses like health care, stored-value cards, and electronic commerce will
start to feed in.  Twenty percent growth will continue for years."

Lehman's Burton is a little more restrained in his prognosis, but he too is
upbeat.  "The shift from cash and checks is continuing, and it could be
accelerating," he says.  He gives First Data and Check Free strong buy
recommendations, expects SPS to outperform the market, and rates St.  Paul,
Minn.-based Deluxe Corp.  (which acquired Financial Alliance Processing
Service, an ISO and processor) a hold.

Analysts fret about the impact on a processor if a large account should bolt.
Montgomery already has factored in the eventual loss by SPS of Lechmere, a
northeastern retailer that was acquired by Montgomery Ward a year ago and is
expected to take its processing business to GE Capital after court proceedings
are settled.

No other client danger flags are being raised, however.  Total relies on the
AT&T Universal card for a large share of its processing volume, but a
long-term extension last year gives the analysts comfort.  "It would concern
me more if the contract was coming up for renewal," notes Larry Hickey of
First Analysis Corp.  With NationsBank and Bank of America now working with
Total, the company isn't overly dependent on any single client, he points out.

The riskiness of credit granting keeps investors up at night and makes them
skittish about the pure card stocks like Advanta Corp., MBNA Corp., First USA
Inc., and Capital One Financial Corp.  The processors, on the other hand, are
a safe harbor and a good way to cash in on plastic's transformation to a major
transaction device.  As one analyst observes, "Boring is beautiful."

Indeed, the boring predictability of card processors' growth rates and margins
of 20% for the foreseeable future make this one of the most appealing classes
of stock on Wall Street.

JANUARY, 1996

Detente for Lawyers And Collectors?


Three years ago, they were the new kids on the block.  But now, electronic
attorney collection networks are proving themselves by boosting recoveries of
charged-off credit card debt and relieving card issuers of some of their legal
burdens.  And collections agencies, many of which vehemently opposed the
lawyer networks muscling their way onto collectors' turf, now are beginning to
accept the newcomers.

In fact, it's going beyond mere begrudging acceptance.  Some collections
agencies themselves have already formed or are planning alliances with
attorney networks.  And at least one agency might even create its own attorney
network.  "They're not mutually exclusive anymore," says Warren S.  Rosenfeld,
managing partner of McNeily, Rosenfeld & Associates, a Washington, D.C., law
firm that operates the Rosenfeld-Net.

Equifax Inc., the big credit-reporting agency that also owns a major
collections company, Equifax Risk Management Services, crystallized the new
attitude last October when it formed a venture with Rosenfeld's firm called
Litigation Access Web.  "The backdrop is the collection agencies have felt
this was our turf and were very reluctant to send any accounts out, or refer
to attorneys," says Lyle F.  Herrmann, Litigation Access Web product manager.
"And the attorneys were saying, 'why use collectors?' There was some finger
pointing and bragging rights-me, me, mine, mine, mine.  But there is an
effective place and role for the agency-type collector, and there is an
effective role for litigation."

Moving Closer

The folks who give the collections agencies and lawyers their business are
voicing similar opinions.  "Both sides are moving closer to each other," says
Eugene V.  Brugger, recovery manager for Columbus, Ohio-based Bank One
Columbus, which uses the National Attorney Network for part of its recovery
work.  "I think there's a realization that there's money to be made by
collaboration."

Besides NAN and Rosenfeld-Net, there are now several other attorney networks
(box, page 52).  They include the National Association of Retail Collection
Attorneys' NARCA-Net; Dozier Legal Network, a subsidiary of the Richmond,
Va.-based Dozier and Associates P.C.; and the network run by the American
Association of Collector Attorneys.

While the networks vary in the range of services they offer and technological
capabilities, the common thread is that they allow card issuers to place
charged-off accounts and supporting documents with law firms electronically.
That reduces the paper burden, and some networks make it easy for issuers,
using computers and software linked to the networks, to keep track of
litigation and the performance of each firm.

The networks also can quickly place accounts with their law-firm members,
which means issuers' lawyers can devote most of their attention to monitoring
what the firms acting on their behalf are doing rather than hunting for
competent attorneys wherever they have deadbeat customers.  "We're dealing
with one attorney instead of 50 attorneys in 50 different states," says Edward
J.  Casey, collection and recovery manager for Bridgeport, Conn.-based
People's Bank, which uses Rosenfeld-Net.  "It takes a big burden off of us."

Growth Industry

Sensing a growing need for such tracking and oversight services, the attorney
who founded the Dozier Legal Network, John W.  Dozier Jr., stopped doing
actual collections work last year when he founded his namesake network.  "We
came to the conclusion that in order for this to work, we (shouldn't be) a law
firm trying to run a computer network, we needed to be a technology company
providing a legal application," says Dozier, who hopes to have more than 400
law firms affiliated with his network by year's end, compared with 70 at the
end of 1995.

Indeed, the attorney networks almost unanimously are reporting strong growth.
AACA's network placed 16,000 accounts worth about $70 million last year, but
President Raymond J.  Cook projects 30,000 accounts and $140 million in
placements this year.  "Credit grantors want to try something different than
the traditional 'we'll place it with a collection agency approach,'" Cook
says.

Despite the networks' growth, one factor reducing tensions between the lawyers
and the collectors is the overall growth of the card industry.
General-purpose card receivables grew 20% in 1993 and 19% in 1994, and 1995's
growth will probably come close.  Such huge growth means lots of charged-off
debt even though credit quality, while showing some signs of fraying, still is
high.  In fact, card issuers probably can expect to recover about $2 billion
this year.

Thus, even some collectors who expressed deep skepticism about the new
attorney networks ("This Is No Lawyer Joke," April, 1994) profess today that
they're not too worried.  "From my personal perspective, they've not taken
anything at all (from us)," says Craig J.  Costanzo, chairman and chief
executive of Management Adjustment Bureau, a Buffalo, N.Y., agency that
handles about $100 million in charged-off card debt annually.  "There's just
so much business out there, it's unbelievable."

Doubling Recoveries

While a majority of the attorney networks have only brief track records, some
are starting to rack up impressive numbers-and thus forcing collection
agencies to take notice.  GE Capital Corp., the nation's largest third-party
retail card issuer, started placing accounts for legal action through
Atlanta-based NAN in 1994.  For the first nine months of 1995, recoveries
through NAN were 106% higher than they were for accounts placed for
conventional legal action in the same 1994 period.

The reason?  The electronic network makes it easy to monitor each account's
status, and to compare the performance of the approximately 70 law firms GE
Capital uses nationwide.  With more than 300,000 charged-off store card
accounts being placed for legal action yearly, fewer cases are getting lost in
the shuffle, says Mary K.  Kinsey, senior vice president of collections
services for GE Capital Credit Services.  "It really forces them (law firms)
to look at every single account," she says.

Money on the Table

While there are wide variations among individual issuers, collections experts
estimate that less than 5% of charged-off accounts-perhaps even as low as
2%-result in litigation.  But some observers say that as many as 10% of
deadbeat accounts should be litigated-a goal that's hard for national issuers
to hit as they struggle to manage dozens of law firms handling thousands of
cases.

The attorney networks say they can get the cases into court that should be in
court.  NAN's president, attorney Douglas W.  Wallace, says his network is
aiming for $1 billion in placements this year, compared with 300,000 credit
card claims for just over $500 million in 1995 and 120,000 claims for $240
million in 1994, the network's first year.  He estimates about 70% of the
cases referred to the 165 law firms in the network result in lawsuits.  "It's
a given that legal action is more effective than any other form of recovery,"
says Wallace.

Adds St.  Louis collections attorney Donald B.  Kramer, president of Kramer &
Frank P.C.  and founder of NARCA:  "Credit card issuers are used to getting a
6% recovery from collections agencies.  Attorneys can double or triple that as
long as they give the attorney enough time.  The agencies pour out the
pressure in the first 60 days, but if you look at the end of two years, they
attorneys absolutely kill the agencies."

Collection agencies, meanwhile, disagree with the practice by some issuers to
send certain deadbeat accounts directly to lawyers, even though agencies might
produce as good or better recovery rates.  "I think clients are making a poor
decision in sending straight to a network," says one collections executive who
insists on anonymity.

Though collections agencies may disagree with the attorneys' bluster, growing
numbers are acknowledging that lawyers have an increasingly important role in
recovering bad debt.  "I do believe that agencies, by not aligning themselves
with attorneys, are leaving a lot of money on the table," says Douglas B.
Schultz, chief executive officer of United Recovery Systems Inc., a Houston
collections agency which does work for seven of the 10 largest card issuers.
"I do see attorney-agency alliances in the future."

With that in mind, Schultz is considering a partnership with one of the
networks, though he hasn't decided on which one.  He might even form his own
network.

Profit Issue

And while Schultz can get along with lawyers, he nonetheless has some
misgivings about a formal business partnership because of the profit question.
If the issuer-client lets his agency keep 35% of the recovered debt, but the
lawyers take 25%, "that leaves only 10% for me," Schultz says.  And that thin
margin could be reduced even further depending on which party has to absorb
the court costs, he adds.

Still, Schultz thinks allying with attorney networks at the very least makes
sending paperwork back and forth easier-and thus makes clients happier.  And
if he can show card issuers that his recovery rates are going up because of
more legal action, so much the better, because it will bring more volume to
the agency.  "I don't think there's that much profit for the agencies, but
it's another option," he says.

Equifax retains an average of 33% of recoveries and hopes to make its new
Litigation Access Web service profitable by asking clients to absorb the court
costs.  As of early December, some 800 accounts had been referred to the legal
service, but Equifax's Herrmann says it's still too soon to quote recovery
rates.

Clearly, however, Equifax is looking to feather its already large collections
nest-$3 billion a year in placements, about a third of which is card debt-by
adding the legal network to its roster of services.  "We wanted to prove to
the industry that we could take the high road to have our collection-agency
business work hand-in-hand with an attorney network," says Herrmann.

Equifax's basic criteria for referral to the network hinges on the account
balance (less than $1,000 is less likely to be litigated), the span of time
since a payment, and whether the debtor has a valid address and is employed.
Debtors with jobs and assets upon which a court can slap a lien, such as a
house, are most likely to be sued.

Issuers and attorneys still have to be very careful about which consumers they
intend to sue.  Management Adjustment Bureau's Costanzo, who still remains
wary of the attorney networks, notes that the federal Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act makes it illegal to threaten lawsuits unless the threat is
followed by action.

But Banc One's Brugger says that his bank, for one, is scrupulous about what
it tells debtors.  "The only time we'll tell customers we're going to sue them
is if we have the intent," he says.

Ironically, the number of Bank One's lawsuits against cardholders has gone
down recently, according to Brugger who did not cite specific figures.  He
attributes that to more diligent work by the attorneys early in the process.

Even Costanzo concedes that correspondence from an attorney can scare payments
out of recalcitrant debtors.  "The fact that they send a letter out on an
attorney letterhead is very helpful," he says.

And as that notion gains more and more currency among issuers' collections
managers, the future looks increasingly bright for the attorney networks.

JANUARY, 1996

Send In the Repairmen


It's been well over a year since major amendments to the federal Bankruptcy
Code took effect.  The amendments were hailed by many creditors, including
credit card issuers, as important changes which would both curb bankruptcy
filings and significantly enhance bankruptcy recoveries.  To date, neither
benefit has materialized, although some of the amendments have had positive
results.

Indeed, bankruptcy filings have been on a 12-month increase.  When the final
1995 numbers are made official, total filings for the past year will likely be
in the neighborhood of 920,000, which would be the third-highest yearly total
ever.  The rate of increased bankruptcy filings for the past four quarters
echoes the bankruptcy explosion of the mid-1980s.

The 1994 Bankruptcy Code amendments also have yet to significantly increase
per-case recoveries.  As a result, card issuers are becoming more vocal in
demands for a further tightening of bankruptcy laws.

The Good News

One of the several positive changes made in 1994 was the raising of the
Chapter 13 debt ceiling to $250,000 of unsecured debt and $750,000 of secured
debt.  This allows more consumers to seek relief through reorganization of
personal debts under Chapter 13, as opposed to filings under Chapter 7, in
which the debtor's assets are liquidated, or Chapter 11, in which business and
personal debts are reorganized.  In the later two cases, recoveries to card
issuers have always been lower.  In some of the areas of the country, Chapter
11 filings have declined, while Chapter 13 filings have increased, although
only marginally.

Another positive change which holds promise for the long term was the
streamlining of the reaffirmation process by eliminating the need for court
approval.  By signing a reaffirmation agreement before a bankruptcy discharge
is entered, a debtor agrees to continued liability after bankruptcy.  Those
debtors who sign such agreements usually do so to avoid a creditor's complaint
contesting the discharge where the account was loaded up with charges before
the bankruptcy filing, or where an issuer has offered to let the debtor
continue to use the card account after bankruptcy.  The latter group includes
a growing number of issuers who see reaffirmation as a good way to cut
bankruptcy losses.

A third positive change was extending the so-called pre-bankruptcy presumption
period, during which the charges are presumed to be nondischargeable, to 60
days.  The presumption applies to both cash advances and luxury goods and
services where either exceeds $1,000.  This change is reported to have
effectively enhanced issuers' ability to quickly settle potential
dischargeability claims for relatively large sums.  Because so few accounts,
relative to total bankruptcy filings, have activity which rises to the level
of fraud required under the present bankruptcy code standard, actual increased
recoveries from this change, while significant, have not been dramatic.

Finally, the 1994 amendments created the National Bankruptcy Review
Commission, comprised of nine appointed members who have begun their two-year
mission to review the bankruptcy laws, take testimony from affected parties,
and make recommendations to Congress regarding future amendments.  While it is
a positive development to have a focal point for change, the obvious downside
would be congressional reluctance to consider changes before the commission
has weighed in with its report almost two years from now.  Issuers should,
therefore, consider a dual approach to reform:  long-term advocacy through the
commission and, hopefully, faster-track changes by seeking direct legislative
input into needed amendments.

Exemptions

A negative change in the 1994 law was the increase in the dollar value of
property debtors are allowed to protect from sale by a bankruptcy trustee.
The so-called federal-exemption amounts were doubled across the board.
Examples include the homestead exemption which was increased from $7,500 to
$15,000 ($30,000 for a married couple), and the household-goods exemption
which was doubled to $8,000 ($16,000 for a married couple).  Although the
federal exemptions only apply in 15 states, at least two of the 35 other
states have recently increased their exemption amounts.  One was California,
which doubled the exemptions available to its residents, citing the federal
increase as a basis.

Because so-called asset Chapter 7 cases can take two years or longer to
liquidate, it is still too early to tell the effect of the exemption change.
But because every exemption dollar comes directly out of funds which would
have otherwise gone to unsecured creditors, the negative effect will certainly
be significant.

Much of the past and present volume of bankruptcy filings is attributable to
the marketing of bankruptcy, both direct and indirect.  Indirect marketing
includes word of mouth (with almost 1 million filings per year, there are a
lot of voices out there), newspaper coverage (it is virtually impossible to
find an issue of any major-market newspaper that does not include an article
about a well-known company's or celebrity's bankruptcy filing), and how-to
books about bankruptcy.

All of these indirect marketing aspects have resulted in the almost complete
erosion of the stigma once attached to filing bankruptcy.  Yes, bankruptcy
still is an extreme emotional hardship for most people, but the reluctance to
file is much easier to overcome in an environment where famous individuals and
companies are often perceived (usually incorrectly) to be using bankruptcy
relief as a mere financial-planning device.

By far the most effective bankruptcy marketing, however, has been what is in
effect direct marketing by debtors' attorneys.  They have done an excellent
job of making consumers aware of the bankruptcy option through advertisements
in the Yellow Pages, newspapers and on television, and through targeted mail
sent directly to persons facing lawsuits for defaults.  It is no coincidence
that the bankruptcy explosion of the 1980s came on the heels of the Supreme
Court's relaxation of advertising restrictions upon attorneys.

Countering the Messages

In the face of this successful marketing of bankruptcy, major issuers have
been attempting for some time to communicate the negative aspects of a
bankruptcy filing to customers, most importantly a bankruptcy's negative
affect upon obtaining future credit.  Many issuers have also been actively
referring delinquent customers to local branches of the Consumer Credit
Counseling Service as an alternative to bankruptcy.  Some issuers have
advocated placing national newspaper ads explaining non-bankruptcy options.

Just as important as combating bankruptcy marketing is the need to focus upon
improving recoveries from the increasing number of bankruptcies.  In this
regard, it is useful to look at the big picture which shows that, nationally,
almost 70% of consumer cases are filed under Chapter 7.  Of these, only about
5% result in any recovery to card issuers.  Issuers' main bankruptcy
recoveries have always come from Chapter 13 repayment plan cases which,
unfortunately, are less than a third of all filings.

The main avenue to a dramatic increase in bankruptcy recoveries, then, is to
shift as many Chapter 7 cases as possible into Chapter 13.  This has been
tried repeatedly by suggesting amendments to Congress which would eliminate
Chapter 7 or greatly restrict its usage.  The only such change ever actually
to survive the political process and become enacted was the largely
ineffective substantial-abuse provision, added in 1984.  That provision allows
the court to dismiss a Chapter 7 filing if the judge determines the case
constitutes an abuse of the law.  It was intended to directly force those
debtors with sufficient income to fund a repayment plan into Chapter 13.  But
because of procedural and substantive problems inherent in the wording of the
statute, the provision has never had the desired effect, and is ripe for
further amendment.

Rather than focusing solely upon tightening the availability of Chapter 7
relief, however, issuers should consider ways in which Chapter 13 can be
enhanced and thereby made more attractive to consumers.  A common complaint
among debtors' attorneys and Chapter 13 trustees is that debtors have no
incentive to repay unsecured creditors under Chapter 13.  This is because,
they argue, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is just as likely to result in the denial
of future credit as is a Chapter 7 filing, and both types of filings are
reportable for up to 10 years.

The Reporting Issue

One way to enhance Chapter 13 would be to roll back the credit-reporting
period for a Chapter 13 filing while leaving Chapter 7 at 10 years.  If, for
example, Chapter 13 filings could only be reported up to six months after
discharge, it might be anticipated that many debtors would opt for Chapter 13
as the best way of rebuilding their credit.

The Chapter 13 option would be further enhanced if issuers were to adjust
their records upon receiving a Chapter 13 discharge to reflect a favorable
settlement.  They could also alter lending policies to provided that customers
who complete meaningful Chapter 13 plans would be considered for future credit
according to their individual circumstances, and not be denied credit
automatically because of a past Chapter 13 filing which affected the issuer.

With regard to post-bankruptcy credit, Chapter 13 trustees in Texas and Ohio
have had debtor-rehabilitation programs in effect for several years.  Under
these programs, debtors who successfully complete larger-percentage repayment
plans are considered on their merits for new credit by participating lenders.
The lenders do not promise new credit, but do agree to disregard the Chapter
13 filing, or to consider it as a favorable indicator of a debtor's
rehabilitation in evaluating a credit application.  The trustees report that
the program has successfully encouraged debtors to choose Chapter 13 over
Chapter 7.

A strong advantage of focusing upon enhancing Chapter 13 relief is that
legislative opposition presumably would be minimal because the proposals are
not restrictive, but rather offer debtors incentives to rehabilitate through
Chapter 13 on a voluntary basis.  This approach reflects compassion for those
who got in over their heads with credit, sometimes for reasons beyond their
control, but often due to an unsuccessful adjustment to the relatively new age
of convenient credit.  Surviving in this era requires self-discipline and
credit education, the lack of which is a problem that is societal in scope.

A Favorable Argument

In addition, as a foundation upon which to argue for legislative action, a
favorable argument can be made that the historically high ratio of Chapter 13
to Chapter 7 cases in most of the Southeast should be possible in the rest of
the country.  The Southeast, with the exception of Florida, traditionally has
had a larger ratio of Chapter 13 filings because, according to some area
bankruptcy professionals, conservative attitudes prevail in the largely rural
areas, and Chapter 7 exemptions in those states have been generally more
restrictive.

This does not mean that a tightening of Chapter 7 should be ignored.  On the
contrary, removing the subjective standard in many dischargeability contests
(the so-called intent to repay) with a more objective (reasonable ability to
repay) standard, would ease the difficult burden of proof now facing issuers
in many jurisdictions.

Going further, although strong opposition could be expected from the consumer
lobby, it could be proposed that all principal from debts incurred 90 days
before bankruptcy be automatically nondischargeable without the need to file a
dischargeability complaint.  Such an approach would have a foundation in other
Western countries' bankruptcy laws, which are generally far more conservative.

In sum, issuers' goals of decreased bankruptcy filings and enhanced recoveries
could be met, in part, through making Chapter 13 more attractive, which would
likely encounter little opposition, while also proposing tighter Chapter 7
dischargeability standards.

A Plan to Improve The Bankruptcy Law


* Make Chapter 13 more attractive to consumers by shortening the time negative
bankruptcy information will stay on their credit reports.  * Issuers should
consider more favorable treatment for debtors who choose Chapter 13 compared
with those who use Chapter 7.  * Change the subjective "intent to repay"
dischargeability standard in Chapter 7 cases to an objective "reasonable
ability to repay" standard.  * Make principal debts incurred within 90 days of
a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing nondischargeable-in other words, the consumer
cannot escape responsibility for repayment.

Sorting Out the Mail


The mountain of mail coming from credit card issuers keeps rising to new
heights.  Card mailings are projected to have totaled 2.8 billion pieces in
1995, an 18.5% increase from a year earlier, according Tarrytown, N.Y.-based
Behavioral Analysis Inc.

In order to get a better read on which issuers are mailing the most and the
types of cards most frequently mailed, Faulkner & Gray Inc., publisher of
Credit Card Management, began tracking in April 1994 mailings to staffers in
its Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C.  offices.  Details from the
solicitations were published monthly in CCM's sister publication, Credit Card
News.  Mailings collected through November 1995 totaled 1,077.

While the results of such a survey are not a statistically representative
sample of the entire industry, they do provide a road map of which issuers are
dominating mailings and the types of pricing strategies in play.

Top Mailers

Though issuers are mailing more than ever, the bulk of those mailings are
coming from a handful of issuers.  The top 10 issuers tracked in the survey
accounted for 56% of all offers received.  To no one's surprise, Citibank was
the top mailer with an 11.5% share, followed by Capital One Financial Corp.
with a 6.8% share, and First USA, at 6.5%.  Unexpectedly checking in fourth is
San Francisco-based Providian Bankcorp (formerly First Deposit), which ranks
22nd in receivables, with a 6.1% share.  MBNA rounds out the top five, with
4.9% share.

On the pricing side, annual fees remain alive, though they continue to lose
ground.  Overall, 27% of solicitations received had an annual fee.  A
breakdown of solicitations received for 1995 reveals that issuers are mailing
fewer solicitations with annual fees.  Just 26% of solicitations received in
1995 had annual fees, down from 29% in 1994.  And nearly all gold card offers
are promoted as non-fee cards, according to BAI.

Fixed interest rates are also disappearing from the landscape.  Variable rates
are now king.  Of the general purpose card offers received, 78% promoted a
permanent variable rate, and 29% offered a variable teaser rate pegged to the
prime rate, LIBOR, or some other floating measure.

Teaser rates virtually have become a prerequisite for card mailings, as 82% of
solicitations offered either a fixed-rate or variable rate teaser.  The split
on the duration of the teasers was fairly even:  48% pitched teasers for six
months or less, while 52% offered teasers for more than six months.

As for the types of cards being mailed, gold cards were the dominant subset,
netting 52% of bank card mailings received.  BAI reports that gold cards
represented 48% of bank card mailings during the second quarter of 1995.
Cobranded cards accounted for 15% of all CCN's bank card mailings.  Cobranded
cards totaled 20% of bank card mailings during the second quarter, according
to BAI.

MasterCard International still leads the cobranding derby.  Cobranded
MasterCards represented 65% of cobranded card mailings that did not offer
consumers a choice of brand, compared with 35% for Visa.

Among cobranded partners, AT&T's Universal Card lead the way, accounting for
22% of cobranded card mailings.  American Airlines' AAdvantage card was second
with a 17% share of mailings, and the Shell MasterCard placed third with a 12%
share.

Given the volume of mail, Faulkner & Gray intends to monitor card offers even
more closely in the future.  Which issuers will be the biggest mailers in 1996
and what types of offers will consumers see?  Stay tuned.

An End Run By Fraudsters


When it comes to the war on fraud, the credit card industry has been so
focused on developing new technologies, such as smart cards, to foil con
artists that they may have forgotten to scrutinize the legal loopholes and
their own business practices for potential weaknesses that swindlers can
exploit.

Indeed, the indictment last month by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles of 20
Vietnamese immigrants for bank fraud has exposed a serious flaw in the
Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1988, in addition to possible flaws in how
card issuers govern their own organizations.

The type of fraud perpetrated is a so-called booster-check scheme in which the
suspects allegedly wrote checks from accounts with insufficient funds to boost
their credit limits, then made cash advances and expensive purchases with the
cards before the checks were rejected by the banks.  After the credit burden
became too great, the defendants allegedly declared bankruptcy.

The scheme defrauded issuers nationwide of more than $40 million, and more
arrests are expected.  Similar ploys could cost issuers as much as $100
million, says Assistant U.S.  Attorney Marc R.  Greenberg.  That's about 14%
of the $734 million in bank card fraud in 1994.  Investigators have subpoenaed
the records from 150 credit card issuers, including Chase Manhattan Corp.,
AT&T Universal Card Services, Banc One, and Bank of America.

The case raises concerns that changes need to be made to the Expedited Funds
Availability Act of 1988, which requires banks and issuers to post a check and
credit the funds as soon as the check is received, rather than waiting for it
to clear.

Prosecutors claim loopholes in the law enabled the suspects to withdraw large
cash advances or buy big-ticket items with the cards after mailing to their
card issuing banks bogus checks to boost their credit limits.  Some defendants
allegedly sent five checks of $5,000 each to one issuer in a week, then spent
the entire amount before the first check was cleared or rejected by the bank,
Greenberg says.

After the defendants depleted all available credit on their cards, they would
file bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy court records reveal each cardholder has from
$100,000 to $685,000 in unsecured credit card debt.  "The law requires issuers
to open the line of credit as soon as the check is received," says Joel S.
Lisker, MasterCard International Senior Vice President of Security and Risk
Management.  "This is a foolish thing to do."

Sharing the Blame

Responding to fraud concerns, the Federal Reserve Board plans to survey banks
on the extent of check fraud losses caused by the Expedited Funds Availability
Act.  The six-page survey should begin arriving at financial institutions
around mid-February.

But the case is also drawing attention to card issuers own short- comings in
the fraud battle.  Fraud experts argue that competition and complacency have
prompted issuers to write off booster check fraud as a collection issue
instead of fraud, overlook red flags that suggest fraud, and make cards too
easy to obtain.  One suspect had five MasterCards from one bank, each one with
a maxed out credit limit, says Greenberg.

Adds Everett Whatley, president of Raleigh, N.C.-based Card Risk Management
Global:  "Competition makes issuers less sensitive to fraud and
creditworthiness.  They should not allow checks to boost a credit line.  If a
large check is received, they should ensure the funds are in the bank account
the check is written from before posting it."

That's a logical solution, but will issuers heed the advice?

I'll Trade You My Portfolio...


Card executives who were savvy traders of baseball cards during their youth
may want to brush up those skills.  The concept of acquiring credit card
accounts via a straight-up trade for accounts of equal value is being
considered as a low-cost alternative to buying portfolios.

Indeed, with fewer portfolios on the block and escalating premiums, portfolio
trading makes good sense.  After all, issuers can rid themselves of accounts
that don't fit the makeup of their portfolio, such as affinity cards that were
acquired via a merger, by trading for accounts more in line with their
business, such as those in their home market.

Confused?  Don't be.  "The idea is to trade away accounts that are more
valuable to another issuer in exchange for accounts that are more valuable to
you," explains Michael J.  Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting Group,
Westbury, N.Y., which is broaching the idea to clients.

Let's Make a Deal

That's certainly an attractive proposition in an era when banks are under
increasing pressure to grow assets.  But completing an equitable trade is not
an easy task, warns to Robert K.  Hammer, chairman of R.K.  Hammer Co., a
Newbury Park, Calif.-based consulting firm specializing in portfolio sales.
"I was involved in two attempted trades back in the 1980s, and both times the
deal fell through because one side always felt their portfolio was worth more
than the other portfolio," Hammer recalls.

Just how feasible is portfolio trading?  Auriemma argues that with banks being
pushed by investors to grow assets, issuers will start to give serious
consideration to the concept because the money saved by not paying a premium
to buy a coveted block of accounts can be put toward card marketing.

But before issuers rush off to make the trade of a lifetime, they had best
check with their accounting departments about the cost of adding those
accounts to the portfolio.  Issuers thinking of trading portfolios ought to
ask themselves the following questions before pulling the trigger on a trade,
cautions one Wall Street analyst:  Can the acquisition costs associated with
those accounts still be be amortized?  Will the accounts acquired in a trade
be more expensive to service than those traded away?  And will the acquired
accounts be more profitable than those traded away?  "There are a lot
accounting issues that must be addressed," the analyst adds.

Card experts agree that portfolio trading can be pulled off if the parties
involved price their portfolios equitably.  "Portfolio trading is such an
attractive option, any prudent issuer will look at it," says Hammer.  Who
knows, maybe one day credit card executives may trade card portfolios as
easily as they traded, when they were kids, a baseball card of Mickey Mantle
for one of Willie Mays.

Cutting Up Commercial Cards


For years, card marketers have successfully sliced and diced the consumer card
market into thinner segments by creating products that cater to specific
cardholder needs.  But when it comes to commercial cards, there has been
little segmentation.

Sure, issuers have created purchasing cards and cards targeted at small
businesses that offer a revolving line of credit, but those are basic
segmentation techniques, much like standard and gold cards.  Consequently, few
of the high-powered segmentation techniques learned in the consumer market
have been applied to commercial cards.

That's because corporations and businesses have historically looked to card
programs to lower their operating expenses first.  Cardholder perks are
considered a frivolous expense that raise the cost of the card program.

But that attitude is changing.  American Express Co.'s launch of a platinum
corporate card last October signals that small-business executives, at which
the card is targeted, are demanding more consumer card perks from commercial
card issuers.

Catering to Needs

The reason:  small-business executives tend to be less sensitive to the cost
of a commercial card program than large corporations, says Fred O.  Gumbel,
president of the electronic commerce division for Electronic Data Systems.
"Small businesses are more willing to accept perks on commercial cards than
large corporations even though those benefits may be built in to the price of
the card," says Gumbel, who headed First Bank Systems' corporate card
portfolio before moving to EDS in 1994.

AmEx, which says its small-business customers asked for more perks, answered
the call with its platinum corporate card.  The card charges a $300 annual fee
and $150 for additional cards.  Cardholders receive free companion tickets
when they buy a full-fare, first-class or business-class airline ticket; free
enrollment in AmEx's Membership Rewards program; free room upgrades,
continental breakfast for two, and late checkout at participating hotels; and
confirmed restaurant reservations.

Now that AmEx is applying segmentation techniques learned in the consumer
market to commercial cards, will bank card issuers follow?  The answer is yes.
"There are bank card issuers interested in marketing a cobranded commercial
card," declares Peter L.  Williamson, managing director of Stamford,
Conn.-based Salestrac USA Inc.

So coveted are some consumer card perks that small-business owners are paying
for business expenses with consumer cards.  "The right rewards are a big plus
for small businesses," says Williamson.  Perks small-business commercial card
holders may see are frequent-flier miles, car-rental and gasoline discounts.
"Segmentation is becoming more important in corporate card marketing," says
Dorsey R.  Grant, AmEx's vice president of customer loyalty, small-business
services.  "Whether it's data reporting or cardholder perks, commercial
cardholders have specialized needs."

Risk-Based Repricing Draws Flak


On cyberspace chat lines and consumer-rights phone lines, Capital One
Financial Corp.  is drawing heat for the policy it calls risk-based repricing
and consumer advocates say is just unfair.

Since last spring, a couple of dozen consumers have contacted Bankcard Holders
of America to complain about Capital One's strategy of altering interest rates
on existing customers' credit lines when periodic credit-report reviews reveal
customers have been issued other credit cards, have assumed new debt, or have
otherwise altered their credit profile.

"That's not a huge number, but the ones we hear from are irate," reports Ruth
Susswein, BHA's executive director.  "They're being bumped from 12.9% to
24.9%.  If they're a poor credit risk, I don't see how a rate hike is solving
the problem."

Syndicated columnist Jane Bryant Quinn also took Capital One to task for
sharply higher rate hikes and the "gobbledygook" explanations given to
consumers for the adverse action.  Quinn cited the case of a fireman whose
interest rate went from 13.9% to 24.96% despite timely payments.  She
suggested bank regulators should scrutinize the practice.

BHA also has been critical of other issuers for what it terms penalty rates,
citing Citibank and AT&T Universal for higher late fees and rates for
cardholders who fail to uphold their credit agreement.  But Susswein notes the
concept of increasing rates for existing customers on the basis of credit
reviews of other trade lines is different, and she suspects Capital One isn't
the only issuer doing it.

Capital One President Nigel W.  Morris defends the strategy and predicts most
issuers will eventually follow suit.  He says the practice of both raising and
lowering rates "on a selective basis" has been done by the former Signet card
center since 1989.

"Down the road, the credit card business will look more like the insurance
business, with pricing based on likely outcomes instead of one price for
everybody," Morris says.  "Knowing who to do it to and when to do it is
critical."

Whether a trend will develop toward risk-based instead of performance-based
repricing is open to debate.  One issuer who requested anonymity says higher
rates based on poor credit behavior "makes good business sense," but changing
rates or fees for existing customers because they are assuming debt with
another lender amounts to "preying on the laziness of the American public,"
cardholders who stick with higher-rate cards simply because they don't bother
to find better deals.

Tapping the Ethnic Market


Card issuers looking to tap the expanding Hispanic market ought to keep an eye
on Key Federal Savings Bank's new secured Hispanic affinity card.

Key Federal, which is partnering with Texas-based SER, a renowned and
respected national nonprofit organization dedicated to creating education,
literacy, employment, and job-skills programs for Hispanics, is betting the
card will be a hit in a market in which affinity cards tend to flop.  "We
think SER will give us an edge in attracting the uncarded Hispanics," says
Robert M.  Bouza, Havre de Grace, Md.-based Key Federal chief credit officer.
"SER's programs reach a large portion of our target audience."

But some Hispanic affinity card issuers argue Key Federal faces a tough sell.
"Many Hispanics without cards prefer cash," says Patti D.W.  McCoy, a senior
vice president with First Consumers National Bank, issuer of Adelante affinity
card for Hispanics.  "There is a huge difference between potential and
reality."

Time will tell.

It's Takeoff Time For Two Powerful Airline Cards


The fleet of airline cobranded cards got two new members this month that
promise to raise the stakes in a high-flying market.  On Jan.  4, American
Express Co.'s Centurion Bank and Delta Air Lines released details of their
much-anticipated Delta SkyMiles Optima frequent-flyer program.  Then, on Jan.
9, American Airlines and the Air Travel Card, the airline industry's
60-year-old travel payment system, announced the launch of the American
Airlines AAsset Card.  It is a cobranded MasterCard that can be used both as a
corporate air travel card and multi-purpose travel-and-entertainment card.  It
is being issued under a partnership between Air Travel Card and GE Capital
Financial Inc.

Just what impact these new cards will have on the business
travel-and-entertainment market is unknown.  But they bring major new players
into an already fiercely competitive game.

"Folks realize there's a lot of money being spent on business travel," says
Michele Turkel, president of Spectrum International Consulting Corp.,
Scarsdale, N.Y.  "There's going to be a lot of new travel products."

Both new cobranded airline cards face an uphill battle.  The Delta SkyMiles
Optima card is a late entrant in the frequent-flyer arena, and must offer a
unique rewards package to make it stand out from other products already
well-established in the marketplace, observers say.  Indeed, American Express
makes no secret it is trying to lure away cardholders from Visa and MasterCard
cobranded frequent-flyer card programs by offering incentives for
Delta-related purchases, points that never expire and bonus points for
carrying balances.  "This is the credit card product our customers have been
asking us for," says Brian Kleinberg, AmEx's senior vice president of new
product development.  It is the first ever cobranded card for Delta, although
the airline has long participated in AmEx's Membership Rewards loyalty program
(CCN, Sept.  1, 1995).

Delta and AmEx expect the card to bring in more than 500,000 new members to
the SkyMiles program over the next five years, says Paul Matsen, Delta's vice
president of advertising and consumer marketing.  SkyMiles currently has 18
million members.

The SkyMiles card offers 1.5 SkyMiles for every dollar spent on Delta Air
Lines and Delta Connection tickets as well as Delta Dream vacations, and one
mile per dollar on all other purchases.  The card also differs from other
frequent-flyer cards in that there is no expiration date on using the points
as long as the cardholder travels on a Delta or Delta Connection Flight every
three years.  American Express will issue a gold version of the SkyMiles
Optima later this year.

The Delta SkyMiles card also rewards cardholders for carrying a balance-0.2
SkyMiles for each dollar spent on new purchases.  This could give an AmEx a
profitability edge in a market whose customers are notorious for their
reluctance to revolve balances.

The SkyMiles card carries an introductory interest rate of 8.9% for the first
six months and then converts to the prime rate (currently 8.5%) plus 9.4%.
The card carries a $55 annual fee which is waived for all primary AmEx green,
gold and platinum card holders.  The annual cap on SkyMiles accumulation is
$60,000 in charges.  Bonuses for Delta purchases are exempt from the limit.

"This card was really developed for people who fly Delta, want to earn
frequent-flyer miles and like the financial flexibility of being able to carry
a balance from time to time," says Mary Miller, AmEx's senior vice president
of partnership sales and relationships.  She says extra SkyMiles are awarded
to revolvers not to encourage cardholders to carry a balance but to compensate
revolvers because "they are carrying a heavier financial load" because of
interest payments.  "We thought we'd give back something," she says.  "We
don't think it encourages anybody to revolve if they weren't revolving
otherwise."

But some observers say most non-revolvers wouldn't be interested in the Delta
SkyMiles card because they can earn points on AmEx's other charge cards
through its Membership Rewards program.  "If I already have Membership
Rewards, what's the added benefit for convenience users?"  asks Anne Morgan
Moore, president of Synergistics Research Corp., an Atlanta-based consulting
firm.

However, American Express views the Delta SkyMiles card as a complementary
product to its charge cards, Miller adds.  "Our research tells us people like
to segregate their spending, particularly business travelers, our core target
group," she says.

And though charge card holders who participate in Membership Rewards also can
accumulate frequent-flyer miles on Delta, Miller says the SkyMiles Optima
isn't expected to harm that program.  "They're different value propositions,"
she says, noting that Membership Rewards is aimed at cardholders who don't
revolve balances.

There are mixed reviews on the SkyMiles Optima, with some observers saying
AmEx missed the opportunity to develop a truly unique frequent-flyer product.
"I think it's terribly disappointing," Turkel says.  "They waited 10 years to
come out with this product and they come out with something that won't break
through the clutter."

But others disagree.  "American Express definitely pulled off a coup," says
James L.  Accomando, president of Fairfield, Conn.-based Accomando Consulting
Inc.  He notes that the Delta SkyMiles Optima is "very rich" in benefits
compared to other frequent-flyer cards.  For example, most other programs
offer only one point for every dollar spent and put a three-year-limit for
redeeming frequent-flyer miles.

In addition, the $55 annual fee is comparable to those on other AmEx products
while it falls in the middle range of what other issuers charge for their
frequent-flyer cards, Accomando says.  But the richness of the benefits could
prove to be an Achilles' Heel in the long run, he adds, saying, "a program
like this is very expensive to manage.  The users are transactors-they're not
necessarily people who roll over balances."

The Delta SkyMiles card is one more step in American Express' goal of reaching
$30 billion in outstandings by the year 2000.

The SkyMiles Optima is one of two cobranded offerings from American Express.
Last October, AmEx introduced the no-fee Hilton Optima card (CCN, Sept.  15,
1995).  Miller says there may be some overlap between the two cards' bases
since both target frequent travelers.

The SkyMiles Optima card was officially launched Jan.  5 with a television,
print and outdoor advertising as well as a direct-mail campaign.  Delta and
Delta Connection carriers operate more than 4,800 flights daily to 297 cities
in 48 states and 29 countries around the world.  American Express in late
August announced it would launch a cobranded card with Delta, but didn't
release details of the program until a Jan.  4 press conference.

But frequent-flyer card programs are only one area seeing increased
competition.  Corporate air card programs-in which a corporation is billed
centrally for all it airline expenses-also are facing some new competition.
Through an agreement with GE Capital Financial Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of GE Capital Services, Air Travel Card will be able provides its seven major
U.S.  airlines that issue the card with the banking, billing and reporting
services needed to offer a comprehensive cobranded card for
travel-and-entertainment expenses, says Charles B.  Fischer, Air Travel Card
managing director.  American Airlines-which also offers the AAdvantage
frequent-flyer card issued by Citibank-is the first air carrier to offer the
card.

More than 100,000 corporations, including half of the Fortune 500, use the Air
Travel Card.  More than 200 airlines accept it.

Air Travel Card sought a partnership with GE Capital because of airlines'
requests for a multi-purpose card that could serve as a corporate air, T&E and
calling card, Fischer says.

Under the program, the participating airline will do central billing for the
air charges while GE Capital will handle billing for all non-air expenditures,
says Mark Meythaler, American Airlines manager of credit card marketing.
Billing services can be customized if corporations prefer to have all charges
on one bill.  The cobranded T&E market is likely to get more crowded before
the year is out.  A recent Synergistics' report notes that more and more
issuers are looking to frequent-flyer programs as a means of enhancing cards
to compete with the proliferation of value-added cards on the market.

"I think we're going to see many more cobranded cards," says Randy Petersen,
editor and publisher of InsideFlyer.  "The Delta program is only the second of
at least two to three more cobranded card to be launched by the end of 1996."

Worsening Credit Quality Casts a Pall Over the New Year


Analysts predicted a decline in consumer credit quality most of last year.
Now for a not-so-happy New Year's gift:  Those predictions are coming true.
Example:  Moody's Investors Service's most recent index of securities backed
by card receivables shows U.S.  consumer credit quality in the third quarter
of 1995 slipping, the first quarterly dip in three years.

According to Moody's, chargeoffs in the pool of securities it rates rose to
4.14% of outstandings in the third quarter from 3.99% in the third quarter of
1994.  For September, the chargeoff rate increased to 4.27% of outstandings
from 3.83% in September 1994, the sharpest year-over-year increase since
January 1992.  Moody's tracks $109 billion in securitized outstandings from 74
issuers.

Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst Edward O.  Bankole blames the boost
on the recent upturn in consumer bankruptcy filings.  Nonbusiness bankruptcy
filings in the third quarter rose for the second consecutive quarter, to
220,945, from 195,308 in the third quarter of 1994, a 13.1% increase,
according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts.  Some observers
say personal bankruptcy filings could hit or pass 900,000 when figures for
1995 are tallied.  That would be the most since 1992, when there were 900,874
filings.

Delinquencies in Moody's pool of securitized receivables averaged 4.08% in the
third quarter of 1995, compared with 4.37% a year earlier, Moody's says.  But
Bankole says the rate is distorted by the continuing rapid growth in credit
card loans, which reached $299 billion in June 1995, up 28% from June 1994,
according to the data from Visa, MasterCard and Discover.

The trend is being noticed by other observers.  According to the American
Bankers Association, total delinquent dollars outstanding rose to 4.21% of
outstandings in the third quarter, from 3.58% in the second quarter and from
2.90% in the third quarter of 1994.

Some industry observers blame the increase in delinquencies on the surge in
bankruptcies as well as the continued aggressive marketing of credit card
offers.

The number of personal bankruptcy filings for 1995 will near historic levels,
Stuart Feldstein, president of Budd Lake, N.J.-based SMR Research Inc..  This
is troubling to issuers because bankruptcies account for roughly 40% of
chargeoffs.  According to the latest figures from the Administrative Office of
the U.S.  Courts, there were 832,415 filings between Oct.  1, 1994 and Sept.
30, 1995.

Some point to increasing consumer debt loads at a time of slow wage growth as
another factor in rising delinquencies.  The amount of revolving credit alone
rose 19.1% in the third quarter over the year-earlier period, according to
Federal Reserve figures.  Meanwhile, wage growth, and thus the ability to pay
off some of that debt, rose only 5.1% during the same period.

Intense competition among issuers also has been driving down credit quality as
they scrape to get their cards in the hands of as many consumers as possible.
In the push to keep portfolios humming, some issuers are relaxing their
standards and issuing cards to riskier customers, observers say..

Other observers say the continuing decline in credit quality is a correction
for the rapid growth of card portfolios in the early 1990s.  Chargeoff rates
"are seeking their proper levels," says Michael E.  Staten, director of Purdue
University's Credit Research Center.

The Strange Phenomenon Of Overpaying Credit Card Bills


The practice of overpayment of credit card bills came under scrutiny recently
when fraudsters allegedly used the tactic to defraud 120 issuers out of about
$40 million(CCN, Dec.  15, 1995).  Issuers say the practice is longstanding
but rare, and they say there are legitimate reasons cardholders would make
payments in excess of their credit limits.

Overpayment can expose an issuer to fraud.  Because of banking laws, issuers
are required to post the checks and credit the funds as soon as they are
received.  This allows the crooks to take large cash advances and go on
spending sprees before the checks are returned as insufficient.

But there is a small percentage of cardholders who occasionally will make a
payment over their credit limits, issuers say.  This is usually to prevent
getting behind on payments or to anticipate purchases that might exceed credit
limits while traveling over extended periods.

Industry sources have no figures on how many legitimate customers pay their
accounts above the credit limit.  "It's very rare," says a spokesperson for
Jacksonville, Fla.-based AT&T Universal Card Services.

But is there really a need for customers to increase their credit limits by
overpaying?  No, says Chris N.  Theoharides, principal of Theoharides
Consulting, Massapequa, N.Y.  Banks have made it easy to get credit line
increases thanks to toll-free numbers.  And risk scores allow banks to quickly
judge if the cardholder is worthy of an increase.  Adds Bill Dobbins, vice
president of fraud operations at Chase Manhattan Bank:  "Why give an issuer
money that's not collecting interest?  You can pay while you're away through
fund transfers or have someone handle your affairs."

Issuers interviewed say they will accept an overpayment-but with caution.
Cincinnati-based Star Banc Corp.  allows cardholders to overpay and have a
balance, says Senior Vice President Collin G.  McKenny.

"But we watch that because that's one of the tricks of the bad guys," McKenny
says.

AT&T says it handles overpayments on a case-by-case basis.  "If a cardholder
won't be where their mail is and will be doing some spending, we ask them to
let us know ahead of time," the spokesperson says.

One indication that a prepayment is legitimate is that a bill coupon
accompanies it, says the AT&T spokesperson.  But depending on how far over the
credit limit the check is, Chase, AT&T and Advanta say they may call the
cardholder's bank ahead of time before posting the funds.

If a check is received above a credit limit, Key Federal Savings Bank will
post the check but hold some of the money from availability until the bank is
"reasonably certain" the check will clear the bank from which it is written,
says Robert M.  Bouza, president of operations.  The move is done only in
certain cases where the customer is believed to be high-risk and is not
against banking laws.  "If a check bounces, you've given away the available
balance-plus," he says.  "You're out of a heck of a lot of money."

Chase's Dobbins says the bank will credit the account, but also will call the
bank the check is issued from to check the validity of the payment, he says.

Overpayment is not always a prelude to fraud, but it should set off warning
bells, depending on how far over a customer's credit limit a check is, Dobbins
says.  Fraud experts say a sure warning sign is a check that is mailed with no
coupon in an overnight mail envelope.

"Someone with a $5,000 credit limit that owes us $1,000 and pays us $1,000
isn't unusual," Dobbins says.  "But someone who owes us $1,000, but pays us
$10,000 causes a lot of bells to go off," Dobbins says.

Behind the Growth of Penalties For Rental Car No-Shows


Visa U.S.A., American Express Travel Related Services Co.  and Dean Witter,
Discover & Co.  all are now offering guaranteed car-rental reservation and
no-show penalties for rental companies during peak periods.  Problem:  These
appear to be services no one needs.

Visa and AmEx rolled out their services in December.  A Discover spokesperson
says the issuer has offered similar services since last May.  But no major
rental companies have signed on to any of the three companies' plans, though
spokespersons from Alamo, Value and Thrifty car-rental agencies say they are
considering them.

Ironically, Visa and AmEx say the services are in response to requests from
the car-rental industry trying to combat a chronic no-show problem.  Some
industry estimates peg no-shows at as much as 70% of reservations in some
cities during peak periods, such as three-day holiday weekends.

Anticipation

However, executives from Visa and AmEx say they are confident that companies
will climb on board soon.

Participation in the programs is voluntary.  Under the services, car-rental
companies first must agree to offer guaranteed reservations to customers along
with penalty fees.  Customers then would be offered the choice of making a
standard reservation as they currently do, or guaranteeing a reservation under
the new guidelines.  If a customer accepts the guaranteed reservation, he then
agrees to authorize Visa, AmEx or Discover to charge penalty fees if he fails
to show up or call to cancel within a specified time period.  It is the rental
company's responsibility to charge the fee.

Under Visa's program, cardholders who guarantee their car rentals during peak
periods with a Visa card, are guaranteed a car will be waiting at their
destination for up to eight hours from their expected arrival time.  In the
event of an overbooking, the rental agency is required to rent a comparable
vehicle from another agency and deliver it to the cardholder.  Customers must
cancel eight hours prior to pick-up to avoid a charge for up to a one-day
rental.  In case of a flight cancellation, cardholders have up to one hour
prior to the scheduled pick-up time to cancel.

American Express offers its customers similar guarantees..  Cardholders will
be assured a car will be held for them for at least 12 hours from their
scheduled arrival time.  If the agency overbooks, the rental agency must
provide a comparable vehicle from another firm.

AmEx cardholders must cancel within 48 hours prior to their scheduled pickup
time to avoid as much as a two-day rental charge.  If the customer's flight is
canceled, the penalty is waived.

Discover officials would not discuss their services, except to say a car would
be guaranteed for 24 hours and that a customer would be charged up to a
24-hour rental fee if he didn't show up without a cancellation.

Bad Feelings

But a major obstacle to car-rental agencies implementing the new services is
that penalties may create ill will with customers.  "If a business traveler
gets a flight canceled, they have to make a lot more calls than to just the
rental agencies," says Hertz Corp.  Vice President of Governmental Affairs
Joseph N.  Russo.  Rental agencies currently do not impose penalty fees for
no-shows who reserve conventional cars.  Hertz is not opposed to penalty fees
but objects to the idea of having such fees mandated by credit card companies,
Russo says.  Hertz and Garden City, N.Y.-based Avis impose no-show penalties
for so-called special equipment, such as convertibles or four-wheel-drive
vehicles that are high in demand.

A Post-Holiday Lull in Direct-Mail Campaigns


Most issuers stayed on the sidelines in the waning days of 1995 and the
opening days of 1996.  Faulkner & Gray researchers in New York, Chicago and
Washington received only 38 solicitations in the weeks following the Christmas
and New Year holidays.

Among the most active mailers was MBNA America Bank, which hit the mails with
a wide variety of offers for everyone from wine aficionados to veterinarians
and physical therapists.  It also used the Northwestern University football
team's trip to the Rose Bowl as an opportunity to boost the university's
alumni group affinity card.

Bank of Boston, which re-entered the card business after a five-year absence,
also was promoting its Visa Gold card carrying an APR of prime plus 3.756% and
a $28 annual fee.

Diners Club Guns for AmEx in New Ad Campaign


Stiff competition in the travel-and-entertainment arena is causing normally
tame Citicorp Diners Club to bare its teeth.  And in public.  Last month,
Diners took a swipe at T&E giant American Express Co.'s revamped Membership
Rewards program in ads that ran in major newspapers.

The ad headline boasts, "If your rewards program is missing two major
airlines, it's probably still green," and bears a facsimile of an AmEx green
charge card.  Though not naming the carriers, the ad refers to American and
United airlines, which participate in Diners Club's loyalty mileage program,
but not in AmEx's.

"The renamed American Express rewards program promises the frequent business
traveler 'a world of choices," the ad reads.  "The truth is, it doesn't even
cover the continent."

Standing Up

Diners executives say the ad is part of a more aggressive marketing campaign
the issuer is launching.  Additionally, they say the new name AmEx chose for
its loyalty program last year-Membership Rewards-is a little too close in name
to their Club Rewards program.  And they want everyone to know it.  "When AmEx
comes out and copies our name, we have to stand up and be counted," a Diners
spokesperson says.  "We wanted to remind readers that AmEx has an inferior
program."

Diners Club finished the year with about seven million cardholders and charge
volume around $25 billion.  That pales in comparison to the 37 million AmEx
cardholders and charge volume of roughly $150 billion.

The Best?

AmEx executives defend their loyalty program, saying it offers cardholders
much more variety and utility.  The program has been honored as the best
international program for flexibility and variety by InsideFlyer, a Colorado
Springs, Colo.-based travel magazine.  "We're confident our program is the
best," an AmEx spokesperson says.  "The fact that it is recognized by premier
travel publications speaks for itself."

The Diners Club ad and its aggressive stance is unusual, but laudable for the
issuer, says Randy Petersen, InsideFlyer's editor and publisher.  "There have
been some changes in attitude and they are for the better," he says of Diners'
new ad campaign.  "I'm a big fan of AmEx, but Diners' comparison is true."

While Diners' ad makes a legitimate product distinction, it could backfire,
says Richard N.  Kimmel, principal of Kimmel & Co., a Chicago-based
advertising firm.  The ad makes Diners appear petty , "and being petty does
not look good," he says.

"If I had an American Express Card, I might be interested in the airlines that
aren't participating, but the ad doesn't tell me," Kimmel says.  "I don't
think this ad does them a lot of good.  It sounds desperate because it is
strident, untrustworthy and irritating."

Won't Back Down

The Diners spokesperson denies the ad is an act of desperation.  "Not at all,"
the spokesperson says.  But Diners will not back down from American Express
even though it has a fraction of AmEx's advertising budget.  "Our pockets are
not as deep as theirs so we have to muster up," the spokesperson says.

The chances of AmEx bringing American and United into its fold may be slim.
American has a long-standing contractual relationship for the purchase of the
airline miles offered through Diners Club cards and the Citi-American Airlines
cobranded card.  United has a similar cobranding arrangement with First
Chicago, but could join AmEx when the current contract expires, Petersen says.

Carlson, Household Become Traveling Companions


Since 1991, Salinas, Calif.-based Household Credit Services, the card-issuing
arm of Household International, has steadily cultivated its corporate bank
card portfolio.  The program has grown to more than 126,000 cards at the
beginning of 1995, making it the second largest corporate bank card file, from
a paltry 4,200 at the end of 1991.  Now Household has taken another step some
observers say will give its program a major boost and make a splash on the
travel-and-entertainment scene:  the issuing of a cobranded corporate card
with Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the Minneapolis-based travel agency giant.

The card, appropriately dubbed The Business Card, is the first corporate card
offered by a travel agency, and one of the first cobranded corporate travel
cards, Household executives say.  Initially, it will be marketed to companies
with commercial travel accounts of $1 million or more.  A version for smaller
corporate accounts will be rolled out in mid- to late-1996.

Tracking Expenses

The Business Card will be a general-purpose bank card, available as a
MasterCard or Visa.  It will offer a variety of spending limits and travel
insurance packages.  Companies can either use computer modules to compile
expense reports from the card in-house or outsource it to Carlson.  The fee
for each card and interest rate will be announced later.

As part of the venture, Household and Carlson Wagonlit will produce a joint
proprietary management information system (MIS) data base that they claim will
offer companies more detailed information than other corporate cards about
airlines, hotels and car rentals employees use.  Like traditional expense
reports, it will allow companies to track costs as well as identify the most
frequently used travel vendors, says Ron Muratore, director of planning and
communications for Household's credit card group.  "It is a management tool
that captures more data and presents businesses with a bigger and better
picture on how their money is spent," he says.

Carlson Wagonlit executives say the new card will offer more information and
better integration with a cli-ent's expense reporting system than competitors,
but would not discuss specifics.  "Our whole plan is smooth integration with
other corporate travel systems as well as providing the information that's
needed to manage the travel expense activity," says Terry L.  Thelemann,
Carlson Wagonlit director of marketing product services.  "We don't want our
customers to jump through a lot of hoops to get the advantage of the card."

But executives from Citicorp Diners Club and American Express Co.  say there
is nothing new about the Household-Carlson venture.  Spokespersons from both
companies say they provide detailed, yet easy-to-interpret MIS reports and
software allowing companies to receive the reports on-line.

Major Player

Some observers say the new card could swiftly be a major player in the T&E
arena.  "Anytime two giants like Household and Carlson join, it will draw
attention," says Donald J.  Auriemma, chairman of the Westbury, N.Y.-based
Auriemma Consulting Group.  "They are both leaders in their respective
fields."

The fee per card will vary on how the customer wants to structure its expense
reports, Muratore says.

The program will be launched in the U.S.  and Canada during the first quarter.
It subsequently will be expanded to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region later
this year.

Carlson Wagonlit is one of the world's largest travel agencies with annual
sales of $12 billion, and 4,000 locations in 125 countries.

First Bank and Target Aim For A Cobranded Bull's Eye


Dayton Hudson Corp.'s discount chain Target Stores Inc.  and First Bank System
Inc.  will launch a cobranded card later this month.  The Target Rewards Visa,
believed to be the first issued by a major discount retailer, will have no
annual fee and will offer rebates at Target stores.  Details on the rewards
program and interest rates won't be disclosed until the card's launch near the
end of this month.

Target, which last January began issuing the Target Guest private-label card
in selected markets (CCN, Oct.  1, 1995), decided to start a cobranded program
to give its customers a "more utilitarian card," a spokesperson says.  "It
allows people who are pretty loyal to Target to use the card at other
merchants.  It's a unique opportunity to build Target loyalty."

The cobranded card isn't expected to draw customers away from Target's
private-label portfolio, the Target spokesperson says.  The Guest Card is
issued by Dayton Hudson's Retailers National Bank, Sioux Falls, S.D., which
issues only private-label cards.

Initially, the card will be issued only in Florida and Indiana, where the
chain has a total of 83 stores.  The program will be rolled out gradually to
other states over the next year, the spokesperson says.  Target has 673 stores
in 33 states.  The discount retailer serves over 1 million shoppers per day.

The Target Rewards Visa is expected to generate about $2 billion in
receivables and a return on assets in excess of 2% by 1998, says Philip G.
Heasley, vice chairman of First Bank System.  First Bank, which also issues
cobranded cards with Northwest Airlines and AmWay.

Merger Mania Spreads To Issuers on The East Coast


Merger mania shows no sign of slowing down as banks continue buying one
another, perhaps to avoid being swallowed up themselves.  Toward the end of
last year, the trend swept up the East Coast.  Last month, Bank of Boston
announced it will buy Boston-based BayBanks, while Providence, R.I.-based
Fleet Financial Group announced it will buy the U.S.  operations of
British-based National Westminster (NatWest) Bank.

The Bank of Boston/BayBanks merger will mean a major boost to Bank of Boston's
reborn credit card program.  After re-entering the card business last
September after selling its portfolio to Chase Manhattan five years ago, Bank
of Boston ended 1995 with 102,000 accounts and $124 million in receivables,
says Bank of Boston Director of Credit Cards Services Jeff Slawsky.
Acquisition of BayBanks' portfolio will add 278,000 accounts and $300 million
in receivables.  "This will make us bigger, quicker," he says.

Pending completion of the Bank of Boston/BayBanks merger, Bank of Boston plans
to begin issuing nationally, Slawsky says.  BayBanks' card program has a
strong presence in New England.  "We plan on being a pretty aggressive
issuer," he says.  Details on how the two portfolios will be merged have not
been determined.

Farther south, NatWest's U.S.  Group had been for sale since last September.
Fleet reported 1.1 million accounts and $1.5 billion in receivables at
year-end 1994, while NatWest reported 826,590 accounts and $1.1 billion in
receivables, according to Faulkner & Gray's 1996 Card Industry Directory.

DEMAND FOR SCORING PREDICTED FOR 1996

     More complex uses of scoring are expected to emerge in 1996 as
the tool becomes more widely-used by credit managers for marketing and
predicting loan profitability.  
     Expect scoring models to be used as customer and total
relationship management tools rather than just as risk assessment
methods, experts say.  
     Scoring also will gain acceptance in previously unchartered
waters, such as the mortgage lending market.  
     But industry experts tell us you need to be prepared for
legislative and implementational obstacles related to scoring.
     Concern over consumer privacy also may prompt more patrolling of
this technology by regulators.  Creditors and scoring vendors should
pursue consumer education programs to ease fears over scoring tools
and to ensure that new legislation will not restrict their business
practices. 

Evolving Scoring Methods

     Creditors can expect a change in business focus in 1996 from
credit risk management to customer relationship management, according
to John Coffman of Credit Strategy Management (CSM) of Atlanta.  For
example, many creditors now  are starting to use data and predictive
models to manage the entire customer relationship, including
retention, relationship optimization, product design and targeting.
     Creditors need to understand that risk management by itself is
not sufficient to ensure optimal profitability, and that the
management of risk must be integrated with the management of other
aspects of customer behavior, according to Coffman.  
     Scoring's use is being encouraged by the Washington, D.C.-based
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac).  Freddie Mac issued a
four-page letter last summer supporting scoring practices by lenders
for residential mortgages. 
     A few months later, Fannie Mae, formerly known as the Federal
National Mortgage Association, put out an eight-page letter that
encouraged lenders to use credit scores in the application process.  
     The moves by both organizations have prompted new entrants into
the scoring arena -- the technology no longer will be used by only
credit card companies, but also by mortgage lenders and various other
players in that market, said Marty Abrams, director of privacy and
consumer policy at TRW of Orange, Calif.
     "It really has changed the way mortgage [lending] has been
conducted, because now we have an endorsement of scoring by a quasi-
governmental agency," said Chet Wiermanski, vice president of
acquisition and risk management services for Chicago-based Trans 
Union.

More Work Needed To Educate Consumers, Regulators

     Abrams believes increased use of automated processing throughout
the marketplace -- not just credit models, but response and
profitability models as well -- will create greater interest on how
those models work.  "I think that this is the first in what will be a
fairly broad discussion into the whole sense of how models work, and
how they affect consumers," he said.
     Wiermanski also sees a need for stepped-up consumer education to
offset critics' fears that scores will be used to reject low scorers.
     Score developers and users will need to do more than educate
consumers on how they determine scores -- they'll need to educate
businesses also.  "There is going to be an incredible use of
statistical modeling of data to determine who it makes sense to do
business with, and who it doesn't.  And that is going to create a lot
of controversy," Abrams said.
     If the industry isn't proactive in educating consumers,
regulators may force it to be with new rules or legislation.  
     The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, was
considering last year whether to require creditors and bureaus to
disclose risk scores as part of a consumer's credit report file. 
After much industry feedback, the FTC decided
against mandating a score disclosure.  "That, to me, was a key
decision, considering the complexity of risk scores and proprietary
score cards on the part of credit marketers and credit grantors,"
Abrams said.

Consumer Education Issues

    The decision may create some key consumer education dilemmas in
the coming year.  "We still have to find a way to help consumers
understand how they can better prepare themselves to be good credit
consumers," Abrams said. In addition, creditors and scoring vendors
likely will struggle with regulators' concern over "disparate
treatment" and its relation to scoring, said Fran Lyons, principal or
Scoring Solutions Inc. in Atlanta.  
    Regulators fear that consumers in protected categories will be
turned down for mortgage loans because they are scored based on their
credit history, causing the disparate treatment of a protected group.

Total Relationship Management

    The industry will have to educate regulators that scores do not
result in disparate treatment.  The evidence overwhelmingly suggests
that automated decision-making is much fairer to consumers than
judgmental decision-making, Abrams said.  
    Coffman thinks the industry as a whole will continue to move in
the direction of total relationship management:  "It has caught on
quite quickly."  
    He cited recent articles on AT&T Universal Card as an example of
this trend.  "You're seeing more and more companies recognizing that
they need to integrate the management of these two functions:  risk
management and customer management [see related story, p. 8]," Coffman
said.

Success Strategies

    One key to success in the credit management arena will be the
creation of a comprehensive and easily accessed customer database. 
Many creditors already have begun creating customer databases for this
purpose, and the trend will continue, Coffman said.  
    Using a comprehensive customer database, along with modeling
tools, will allow the creditor to manage all customer relationships.  
    The database might include current and historical financial data
as well as transaction data.  It also should include external data
about customers, such as credit history and other demographic or
lifestyle data.  (Marty Abrams, TRW, 214/390-3659; John Coffman, CSM,
404/266-1242; Fran Lyons, Scoring Solutions, 770/988-264; Chet
Wiermanski, Trans Union, 312/466-7794.) 

Scoring 101

     More and more creditors and scoring vendors will be forced to
educate consumers as to the ABC's of scoring, experts tell us.  
     But what should you focus on when developing a consumer education
program?  TRW instructs its representatives to focus on five "fair
information values" when interacting with consumers:
   *  partnership between TRW and its customers;
   *  fairness;
   *  balance; 
   *  education; and
   *  dialogue. 

Advances in Scoring

     Consider these latest scoring and credit management tools from
industry vendors:

*  TRW and Fair, Isaac are working together to offer small business
lenders a way to download and score TRW business credit reports with
Fair, Isaac's Small Business Scoring Service (SBSS).  SBSS, a
combination of software and pooled-data scorecards for evaluating
small business credit applications, provides an automated interface to
TRW Business Information Services' database of business credit
reports.     (Fair, Isaac, 800/999-2955; TRW, 800/854-7201.) 

*  Equifax offers RE-APPEAR, an automated notification delivery
service for the collections industry.  Users of the service select
criteria so that credit files of consumers who have collections
pending with the user and have disappeared or "skipped" are flagged. 
When new or different address or inquiry activity is posted to the
file, RE-APPEAR automatically notifies the customer of the name,
address and phone number of the credit grantor who queried the file
and who can then provide updated information on the consumer. 
(Equifax, 800/879-1025.) 

*  Trans Union's Revenue Projection Model (RPM), a two-year model
typically used to predict likely revenue to be generated from
prescreened solicitation prospects, now can be used to make inactive
accounts, low-balance revolving accounts and seasonal accounts more
profitable, according to Trans Union officials.  Research conducted by
Fair, Isaac, the developer of the model, shows that RPM also can be
used to rank order existing customers based on likely revenue 
generation in the 12 months following scoring.  (Trans Union, 312/466-
7730.)

TIPS FOR MANAGING YOUR NEXT BANKRUPTCY COLLECTION AUDIT

    A careful audit of your outside bankruptcy collection agent can
help improve bankruptcy accounts management and increase profits.  To
aide in this endeavor, CRMR elicited advice from one independent
consultant, Raymond Bell Jr. of Abington, Pa.
     Bell spent many years managing a bankruptcy department for a
major credit card company and has audited both collection and
bankruptcy accounts.  He directed the handling of consumer bankruptcy
cases at a national law firm and now is a full-time, independent
consultant.
     If you do nothing else when auditing your outside bankruptcy
collection agency, your time will be well-spent reviewing the final
trustee accounting reports to ensure that your claims have been paid,
Bell said.
     "The final trustee accounting report is the most important audit
tool in ensuring that you have received correct disbursements from the
bankruptcy estate," he explained.
     This report will indicate whether accounts have been transferred
to a different bankruptcy type, if payments were recorded improperly,
or if the trustee made a mistake, he added.
     Require your agent to provide a complete account listings for
Chapter 7, 11 and 13 cases that are active, with data fields for the
following:

*  Account assignment date;
*  Date account information was placed in the agent's system;
*  Date the request for notice was sent;
*  Date the proof of claim was sent;
*  Date the proof of claim was received by the court of the trustee;
*  Date of court adversary proceeding;  
*  Chapter 13 planned percent payback;
*  Claim balance filed with the court;
*  Last payment date, payment amount and accumulative amount of
       total payment received.

     You should review the rationale used to generate the reports, and
ask that the agent retain the account listing in an extract computer
until your audit is completed.  This will allow you to subsort
information as needed quickly and your requests will not slow down the
agent's system during business hours, Bell said.

     Bell had other suggestions to follow during an audit:

*   Establish a pattern of follow-up frequency and criteria for cases.
For xample, how many missed payments should trigger a follow-up call
or isit for Chapter 13 cases of a certain amount of credit?

*   Internally select segments of cases from each type of bankruptcy
for random spot checking.

*   Using at least three remittance reports within a 12-month period,
test for payments on at least 50 percent of the accounts.

*   Review your contract provisions and take a copy with you for
reference during your audit.

*   Review your prior audit commentary and the agents response.  Take
copies to the audit with you for reference purposes.

On-site Review

    Bell said the first place he visits during an on-site review is
the lunch- and meeting-room bulletin boards.  These tell a lot about
how the agency communicates and whether it is up-to-date on issues, he
added.
    While at the agency, perform audit functions without interruption
and do not leave notes unattended.  If you need to ask questions,
which can intimidate agency staff, make a concise list and be sure a
manager is present at this stage in the review, Bell advised. 
    While on-site Bell suggests reviewing the following:

*   Licenses.  Are they current and do they apply to state provisions
governing an agency?  In cases of an attorney, has this person passed
the bar in the state in which he/she is working?  Additionally, the
attorney must have renewed the license in each state of practice and
must meet the state's continuing legal education requirements.

*   Written procedures.  The policy guidelines that pertain to your
account should be up to date.

*   Staffing.  Additions, deletions or administrative promotions as
they relate to relate to your account should be explained thoroughly.

*   Training.  In-house training, organizational structure and
frequency of internal case reviews by management should be adequate.

Post Review

    After the on-site review, be sure to provide the client with an
overview highlighting the negative and positive aspects of your report
before you leave.  This discussion should be private, Bell said.  
    Provide the agency with your audit summary.  This ensures there
is agreement to proceed with any corrective action and the
implementation and completion time of desired action.  "The agency
should be required to respond, in writing, by a pre-agreed time," Bell
said.  
    Common problems that may affect agency turnaround include
unorganized agency files, unreceived documents and payments, Bell
added.
    To keep bankruptcy proceedings running smoothly, Bell suggested
several in-house tweaks.  For example, establish tracking abilities
for electronic and paper referrals to the agency and require the agent
acknowledge referrals.  Additionally, time and date stamp all
bankruptcy correspondence before sending it to the agency.  This will
aid in auditing the agency's procedures, he said.
    Also, establish computer models to predict cash flow and
projected return on Chapter 13 cases that can be compared to actual
in-coming, Bell said.
    Internally track agent support requests listing the nature an
type of request every quarter.  This will help you be more proactive
with this information in the future, Bell said.
    Lastly, implement a training program for your bankruptcy and
audit staffs to ensure future audits run smoothly, Bell said. 
(Raymond P. Bell, private consultant, 800/735-0481.) 

Agency Reports You Need

*   Final trustee accounting reports.
*   A monthly tally of Chapter 7, 11 and 13 claims filed.  Reconcile
          this with internal records.
*   A monthly summary of post-petition asset Chapter 7 cases filed. 
          Reconcile this with internal records.
*   A monthly summary on any claim that will not be paid with
          explanations.
*   Notification of balances that differ from the account balance
          referred to the agent.
*   A monthly summation of claims paid as reported on the final
          trustee accounting reports. 
*   A monthly list of claims where objections were received, the cause
          of the objection, and the final disposition of the
          objection.
*   A quarterly submission of Chapter 13 cases where no payment was 
received for 24 months or more without explanation from the court of
the trustee handling the cases.
*   A quarterly report listing Chapter 7 cases where no discharge
          order has been received in eight months or more with no
          explanation from the court or trustee.
*   A monthly summation of cases where a dismissal order was received.
*   Quarterly status of litigation, including all costs incurred to
          date in the case.
*   Monthly summation of settled cases for which documents have not
          been received by the agent in 60 or more days, with
          explanation.
*   Monthly status of unresolved litigation cases that were filed more
          than 90 days ago.
*   A monthly random selection of at least 5 or  more litigation cases
          with related court pleadings and correspondence.

VIDEOCONFERENCING HELPING INCREASE LOAN APPLICATIONS

    Videoconferencing is helping Hempstead, N.Y.-based NatWest Bank
to nearly double the rate at which applicants fill out their loan
forms by bringing the process directly to the model-home site.
    Prospective condominium buyers in a 700-unit development in Park
Place, N.J., now can access NatWest loan officers via
videoconferencing directly from the model home.  However, consumers
must finish the paperwork at the branch.
    "Typically 25 percent [of people inquiring about mortgages] will
fill out the application.  We are running over 50 percent when they go
fill out the application at the model home," said Andrew Demeo,
director of interactive marketing for NatWest.
    Videoconferencing allows consumers to see NatWest loan
representatives and view information on the television screen while
talking on the phone.
    "It is a remote delivery and they are not pressured by being in
the room with an individual," said Demeo.  "They feel in total control
and that seems to be important to the consumers.  It gets to our
culture as Americans.  When a salesperson comes and talks to us in
person, we let them finish their sales pitch.  However, the
socialization of how we deal with telemarketers is different.  Most
people tend not to stay on the line.  If you can offer that type of
control to the customer, yet offer as much personal contact as a face
to face [conversation] and make it fun, it works."

How it Works

    Once consumers have toured the model home, they can enter the
living room, turn on a television set there and place a call
simultaneously to a NatWest representative.  The consumer can see a
still graphic of the representative in the top one-fifth of the screen
on a proprietary pay-per-view channel.
    The remaining four-fifths of the tv screen is reserved for moving
graphics.  For example, customers may want to see in graphic form how
payments for a 15-year adjustable mortgage compare to a 15-year fixed
mortgage.  The NatWest representative can input the necessary
information on the screen and a graphical presentation will appear at
the model home.
    NatWest is testing full-motion video for the service and plans
soon to offer standard personal computer (PC)-to-PC modem
communication.  The bank also is preparing a videoconferencing service
over the Internet.
    Demeo would not reveal the cost of the product, but said it "is a
lot less than you think."  He explained that is a matter of deploying
a pc and television set in a cabinet.  
    Demeo advises lenders to think of videoconferencing as an
opportunity help consumers find products which are appropriate for
their specific needs.  "The key element is presenting concise
information as well as [having the consumers] feel like they are
meeting somebody," Demeo said.
    After the homebuyers decide which loans are right for them, the
NatWest representatives will transmit a closing bill and title right
on the tv screen.  In addition, NatWest can estimate the closing and
tax costs for the consumers.  The application cannot be completed on-
line.  However, consumers are taken line-by-line down the application
so that they will have all the necessary information when they visit a
NatWest branch to complete the application.
    NatWest launched the service in the first quarter of 1995 after
Demeo's marketing staff worked closely with officials at the QVC home
shopping channel to learn how to concisely present complicated
information via video.
    For example, QVC warned Demeo that customers need to be
entertained more in a videoconferencing presentation as they are less
apt to just sit and listen when they can simply press an off button. 
(Andrew Demeo, NatWest Bank, 
516/559-8004.)

LESSONS FROM GOVERNMENT WORKERS.  

    Creditors should establish written policies on handling
delinquent payments from certain consumer segments, credit consultants
tell CRMR.  This is especially true for creditors that service
government employees, in light of the recent lengthy federal
government shutdown which left many employees without paychecks for
weeks. Consider these strategies, offered by some industry
consultants, when developing a government employee policy:

  *  Review on a case-by-case basis. Examine each case for unusual
circumstances before penalizing an account or initiating collection
efforts.  

  *  Instruct customers to contact you. Consumers may assume you are
aware of their situation.  Statements and bills should advise
consumers to contact a credit department and explain any payment
difficulties. 

  *  Consider special programs. Lenders can establish special
unsecured loan programs with no- or low interest rates for federal
workers affected by a government shutdown.  These programs may not 
be very lucrative, however, they will inspire long-term customer
loyalty, experts say.

MOVER AND SHAKER EMERGING. 

    U.S. appraisal automation vendors beware:  one provider of
appraisal reports and services is pushing to become a significant
player in the industry.  Premier Appraisals of Atlanta recently
purchased H.A. Yeargin & Associates, a residential real estate
appraisal company.  Premier officials said the company plans to
aggressively acquire other independent appraisal firms and market
these services in housing markets throughout the United States. 
Several investors are funding Premier's acquisition program, including
Chrysalis Ventures of Louisville, Ky., Windcrest Partners of New York
and David A. Jones, chairman and CEO of Humana Corp.  (Michael Mattox,

HUD OKAY MEANS MORE AUTOMATION.  

    Look for the new year to bring an uptick in automated
underwriting (see related story, p. 1).  The U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for example, recently approved
the use of an automated underwriting program by Collateral Mortgage
Ltd. of Birmingham, Ala.  The program, pmiAURA system, offered by PMI
Mortgage Services Co. of San Francisco, will be used to underwrite
Federal Housing Authority (FHA)-insured mortgages.  Collateral
Mortgage is the second pmiAURA system licensee, and only the third
lender nationally, to receive HUD approval to use an automated
underwriting system for FHA loans.  The system predicts the relative
likelihood of loan default by combining a risk-based, computerized
statistical model with a database drawing on the experience of more
than 1 million loans.  The pmiAURA system uses a rules-based
technology to check an application's conformance with conventional or
government underwriting guidelines.  (Brad German, PMI Mortgage,
703/934-6352.)

FIRM REORGANIZES DIVISIONS.  

    Creditors and vendors should watch for new developments from
Atlanta-based Equifax as it reorganizes its corporation.  Equifax
announced last week that its Financial Services Group has assumed
international responsibility for all its products and services. 
Thomas F. Chapman will assume responsibility for international
operations.  Chapman, the executive vice president and group executive
in charge of Financial Services, also will oversee the developing and
deploying of new products and services in the United States.  "This
change ... is going to maximize our international development and
customer service while improving product innovation and technological
enhancement," Chapman said.  Equifax's international revenues now
exceed $210 million a year.  (Norman Black, Equifax, 404/888-5040.)

RISK MANAGERS NEEDED, REGARDLESS OF LAYOFFS

    You could fare better in the churning financial services
marketplace by becoming skilled in implementing leading-edge credit
technologies.  That's the lesson evident in the business' latest major
downsizing, AT&T Corp.'s plan to lay off 40,000 employees as part of
its efforts to reorganize by 1997.
    More than 200 of the people already accepting AT&T's voluntary
severance    packages work in the Jacksonville, Fla.-based AT&T
Universal Card division, a spokesperson confirmed.  He would not say
how many are from the risk management department nor give details on
the severance packages offered.
    But CRMR has learned that risk management executives are among
the total.  Several of them already have been approached by other 
issuers, says one credit executive who asked not to be named.  

High Demand

    These executives are in such high demand because of their ability
to implement leading-edge technologies, such as statistical analysis,
behavior scoring and neural networks, the source said. 
    A recent survey by Allard Associates of San Francisco, an
executive recruiter in the credit card and banking industries,
indicated that 75 percent of issuers surveyed would be adding staff in
1996.  Respondents said many of these people would be in the risk
management area.  These issuers also reported the shortage of
qualified executives is so acute that card companies are prepared to
sponsor non-U.S. citizens for the jobs.  (Mitch Montagna, AT&T
Universal, 904/954-7571; Kathy Trott, Allard Associates, 415/433-

CUS RELIEVED BY IRS' RULE OVER DEBT REPORTS

The Internal Revenue Service's final rule on reporting of discharge
of indebtedness is much more acceptable to the lending industry than the
proposed regulation, which ran into a firestorm when published for comment
in 1993.
        Tim Pryor, director of NAFCU's regulatory compliance office, told
Credit Union Accountant the IRS' rule is significant for credit unions
because it eases the paperwork burden in two areas: when bankruptcies are
filed and when a debt is discharged by state law.
        The amount of debt written off isn't the most important aspect, the
debt loss will be the same despite this rule, Pryor said. The rule is most
significant because it reduces the amount the paperwork, he said.
        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, require
financial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C information
returns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600
or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders because
they say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven in
excess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.
        Lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigating the
need to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRS for
several years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need to
forgive debt.
        Pryor said the final rule is "a very big issue for credit unions
because the previous rule would have required a credit union to file a 1099
when a debtor went bankrupt." And since bankruptcies are on the rise and
expected to increase, credit unions would have been inundated with
paperwork. (See related story page 4).
        According to Wayne Winegarden, a NAFCU staff economist, "a rise in
bankruptcies since December 1994 is evident in the call report data, and
other preliminary data supports the idea that the December 1995
bankruptcies will increase even further."
        The previous rule, Pryor said, would also have required a credit
union to file a 1099 whenever a debt was discharge by state law--something
he said is next to impossible for a credit union to assess. He said it's
difficult for a credit union to figure out the statute of limitations on
each debt and the actual date the debt was discharged. "Operation of state
law only applies when it is raised as a defense," he said.
        The final regulation says that disclosure to the IRS of debt
forgiveness will be required only when one of the following "identifiable
events" occur:
         The failure of the borrower to make any payments on a debt for
three years with no significant collection activity by the financial
institution.
         A contractual modification or discharge between the financial
institution and the borrower.
         Discharges in bankruptcy of business loans, but not for consumer
loans.
         The successful assertion in court by the borrower of the statute
of limitations as a bar to collection.
         The cancellation of a debt by receivership, foreclosure, or
probate proceedings.
         The expiration of the statutory period for commencing a proceeding
on a judgment.
        Credit unions must comply with these requirements for discharges
occurring on or after Dec. 22, 1996.
        It's important for credit unions to note, however, that the IRS has
provided several exceptions to the list of "identifiable events," said
Cornelia Schneider, the National Association of Federal Credit Union's
associate director of taxation and accounting.
        "Specifically, discharges in bankruptcy are not reportable unless
the credit union knows that the member incurred the indebtedness for
business or investment purposes," Schneider said. "A credit union will not
have to report a discharge of indebtedness upon the expiration of the
statute of limitations if a member's affirmative defense is upheld in a
financial judgment or decision of a judicial proceeding and the period for
appealing has expired. In addition, the final regulations do not require
interest to be included in the reporting of amounts discharged."

SAR, CTR EXEMPTION LIST MIGHT EMERGE MARCH 1

The new Suspicious Activity Report form, reported by sources last
week to be due out by Feb. 1, will most likely come out March 1 at the
earliest, and might contain a threshold for money laundering, a Treasury
official told Credit Union Accountant.
        Banks will begin using the forms when the final regulation becomes
effective.
        The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) also hopes to
release a preliminary Currency Transaction Reporting exemption process in
conjunction with the SAR.
        As proposed, the SAR had no threshold for suspicious activities
involving money laundering. As a final rule, a FinCEN source said on Jan.
17 that, in response to comments received from the industry, Treasury may
include an as-yet unspecified threshold for money laundering. This is the
only threshold the regulators say will possibly change from what has been
previously proposed.
        The SAR, to be administered by FinCEN and federal regulators, is
proposed to be used to report suspicious transactions of bank fraud,
insider abuse, etc. involving a specific customer if $5,000 or more is
involved. If no particular individual can be identified, the threshold will
increase to $25,000.
        The form replaces the old Criminal Referral Form and a box on the
Currency Transaction Report. The form will be required to be filed with
FinCEN only rather than with a number of agencies.
        "It is unlikely that the new SAR will be out by Feb. 1," said a
FinCEN official. "Each of the agencies has to finalize its own regulation,
the database which accepts the suspicious transactions has to be up and
running, and the form has to be ready. FinCEN's reg is in the clearance
process, as well as are the other agencies' regs, I believe. The form
itself is close to being final and the database is operational.
        "The instructions on the form, telling you when and what to file
are subject to change, since the instructions are driven by the reg itself,
which has still to be issued as final."
        A preliminary exemption list for Currency Transaction Reporting is
also expected to be released in conjunction with the SAR release, said an
agency official.
        "There is a two phase approach," said the source. "The easy stuff
will be a (not-specified-yet) existing list--something like the stock
exchange list that people can refer to by opening up a newspaper and lists
businesses that are already exemptible under current regulation. Phase two,
the rest of the exemptions of local places, we are still working out. My
guess is that the second list will come as a proposed rulemaking, up for
comment."
        "Law enforcement, regulators and the industry all agree that there
are too many CTRs, but we need to finalize the process, which will reduce
burden, without impeding law enforcement." --Lisa Troshinsky

EXAMINERS GET LIBERTY IN CUSO LIMITS

NCUA has said that for purposes of CUSO loan and investment
limitations, an examiner can decide on a case-by-case basis to value a CUSO
either at original cash investment or by an equity method of accounting.
        The regulator said even though these limitations are statutorily
derived, it gives its examiners leeway because statutory and regulatory
history provide no clear answers.
        Michael L. Miller, assistant vice president for compliance at
Indiana FCU, Indianapolis, wrote to NCUA Sept. 11 and asked several
questions concerning the loan and investment limitations for CUSOs in
Region IV.
        Miller first asked if the 1% investment limit in a CUSO is based on
the original cash investment or the equity method. He explained that in
January 1994, Indiana FCU invested $100,000 in Indiana Members Financial
Services Inc., a wholly owned CUSO that is the sole owner of three other
CUSOs--a mortgage company, a vehicle leasing company and a collection
company. During the first year, Miller said, IMFS lost $36,000. He asked if
IFCU's CUSO should use the original investment of $100,000 or the equity
method balance of $64,000 to calculate the investment for the 1% limit.
        In legal opinion letter No. 95-0930, dated Dec. 13, Richard
Schulman, NCUA's associate general counsel, told Miller that IFCU should
use the aggregate cash outlay figure of the original investment of $100,000
to calculate the CUSO investment limitation. Schulman noted, however, that
for measuring a credit union's investment to a CUSO in financial
statements, GAAP should be followed. GAAP uses a cost method, equity method
or consolidated financial statements as measurements.
        Miller also asked if IFCU's original cash investment in the IMFS
subsidiary companies be included in the calculation or should it use the
equity method's balance.
        Schulman replied that IFCU's original cash investment, being the
aggregate cash outlay, in the other CUSO's should also be included in the
calculation. He said this is what is meant by "aggregate" limitation.
        Miller then inquired whether IFCU's lines of credit to the mortgage
CUSO and leasing CUSO were considered a loan to a CUSO for the 1% limit
since these organizations are not directly owned by the credit union. He
explained that when IFCU owned the second tier CUSO directly, lines of
credit to the mortgage CUSO and leasing CUSO were established. The lines of
credit are to fund loans and leases until the underlying loan or lease
instrument is sold back to IFCU or another investor. --Melanie Waddell

BRIEFS


Fed To Issue Study
On Check Fraud
        The Federal Reserve Board has asked financial institutions to
comment on a proposed one-time check fraud survey that will help it fulfill
the congressional mandate to report on the advisability of modifying the
Expedited Funds Availability Act.
        The changes to the EFAA, which is implemented through Regulation
CC, would extend the maximum permissible hold period for local checks as a
way to decrease losses related to check fraud.
        Comments are due to the Fed by Feb. 20. Data collected from the
survey will cover the period Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 1995.
        Congress has also directed the Fed to study:
         Whether a pattern of significant increases in losses related to
check fraud at depository institutions attributable to the provisions of
the EFAA exists.
         Whether an extension by one day of the period between the deposit
of a local check and the availability of funds for withdrawal would be
effective in reducing the volume of losses related to check fraud.
         Whether to make recommendations for legislative actions.
        The survey will gather information about the relationship of all
funds availability schedules mandated in the EFAA to check-fraud losses as
well as specific information about the types of check fraud and the causes
of check fraud losses at depository institutions.
        A copy of the proposed survey and instructions, the Paperwork
Reduction Act Submission (OMB 83-1), supporting statement, and other
documents may be requested from Mary M. McLaughlin, Federal Reserve Board
clearance officer at (202) 452-3829, Division of Research and Statistics,

Hawaii Auditing Firm
Acquired by Big-Sixer
        A Honolulu-based accounting firm that specializes in credit unions
was acquired by a CPA giant earlier this month, creating an extended
auditing base on the West Coast and Hawaii.
         Kwock & Co. CPA Inc., in the Aloha State, was taken over by KPMG
Peat Marwick LLP Jan.1. The move allows KPMG to provide services for the
first time in Hawaii.
        "They absorbed me," said Steven Kwock, said head of the CPA firm
that bears his name.
        Kwock added the merger allows for more resources in the future.
        "I'm looking to the year 2000. I'm also looking ahead technology
wise as well including the Internet. Credit unions are moving from on-line
services to in-house (operations)," Kwock told Credit Union Accountant.
        Kwock said he works exclusively as a credit union auditor, and
since the merger, his position becomes the director of credit union
accounts in Hawaii and the Pacific Southwest region for KPMG Peat Marwick.
        Kwock said he audits 65% of the credit union audit market in
Hawaii, which totals $3.1 billion. Until now, KPMG had no share of that
market. Before the merger, the Big Six firm served 69 credit unions
totaling $17 million in assets.

NAFCU's Tech '96 Show
Set for San Jose, Calif.
        At a time when many institutions are trying to beat the ever-
ticking technology clock, NAFCU has chimed in with a conference and trade
show in Silicon Valley to showcase the latest in high-tech creature
features for credit unions.
        Credit unions of the 21st century, new financial systems and
technology issues will be featured Feb. 8-9 in San Jose, Calif., as CU
executives and vendors gather for NAFCU's Tech '96 trade show and
educational program.
        "We want to have a forum to provide technology to those who have
already implemented technology," said Ken Robinson, president of the
National Association of Federal Credit Unions.
        Robinson added the conference has an added value because the
technology experts can point to some of the pitfalls technological services
occasionally bring to the marketplace.
        Highlighting the show will be Keynote Speaker Richard Stroth, the
executive director of CSC Vanguard, the research and advisory arm of
Computer Sciences Corp. Stroth is a strategist on the application of
emerging information technologies.
        For conference registration information, call (703) 276-2772.

CU Auditing Firm
Acquired by Insurance Co.
        A credit union auditing firm has been acquired by an insurance
company--a move the auditing firm hopes will help it break into the
insurance business.
        American Indemnity Co. Ltd., a firm based in the British West
Indies, acquired a 54% controlling interest in International Standards
Group Ltd., a Florida-based company that specializes in supervisory audits
for more than 300 credit unions through agreements with several leagues.
        "This is the first step in our overall plan to expand into the
insurance business," said Joseph Lents, president and founder of ISG, in a
recent statement. Lents said ISG will continue to focus on credit union
services.
        A source within the industry told Credit Union Accountant that ISG
is attempting to expand into insurance because it's not making any money
from supervisory committee audits.
        Attempts to reach ISG were unsuccessful.

COURT: MEMBERS CAN'T SHIRK STUDENT LOAN DEBTS

An important legal ruling handed down in Massachusetts could calm
fears of credit union CFOs and strengthen the long arm of debt collection.
        In the case, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said CU members
can't use bankruptcy as a method to avoid paying off student loans. The
December ruling also is significant because, for the first time, a court
said that federal credit unions are "government units" for purposes of
having educational loans nondischargeable.
        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy
proceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofit
organization.
        The ruling stemmed from a suit brought by T.I. Federal Credit Union
in Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.
DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case went
before the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definition
of both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for these
loans.
        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.
        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylaws
provided that shareholders get a dividend," Koban said. He won this point
in bankruptcy court.
        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its case
to U.S. district court, which ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.
        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the
"government unit" status, so the case was appealed. The 1st Circuit said
federal credit unions are, in fact, government units, so it didn't see the
need to address whether it was also a nonprofit.
        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning of
this section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)
offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.
        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpayments
are nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifying
as a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,
insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor's
loans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters of
either provision," the 1st Circuit said.
        Koban, reached by Credit Union Accountant, asked rhetorically
whether this ruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bank
is a "government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested the
law should simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period.
This ruling is counter intuitive."
        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn't
address the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress is
the only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, not
the courts.
        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'
educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.
        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.
        According to the brief of the case, T.I. federal credit union
advanced loans as part of its special educational loan program. This
program differs from standard loan programs in that it allows for lower
interest rates, gives borrowers longer repayment periods and allows loans
to be aggregated in maximum amounts greater than those permitted under
personal loan programs. The program also enables borrowers to
simultaneously borrow additional funds and refinance outstanding balances
on previous loans.
        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times for
assistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into a
single promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes
$32,618.
        His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but his
lawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely. --Ken Reed

CREDIT UNIONS AND STUDENT LOANS, A YEAR-END BREAKDOWN

One-third of all credit unions that give student loans offer only
Guaranteed Student Loans (FFELs), one-third offer only other types of
student loans and a third offer both, year-end 1994 CUNA data show.
        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage of
credit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.
Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a credit union that lends
FFELs, and 37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lends
other types of student loans, CUNA said.
        FFELs are generally preferred because a larger portion of the risk
is shared with the government.
        A study by the National Association of Federal Credit Unions found
that, of the 336 member CUs responding to its survey, the average credit
union offering student loans has $240 million in assets while the average
credit union not offering such loans has $103 million in assets.

FOCUS ON FASB


AcSEC To Explore
Balance Sheet
        The Accounting Standards Executive Committee, a committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is considering a new
project to determine when various types of securities transactions should
be recorded on the balance sheet.
        Currently, these transactions can be settled in regular ways, in
accordance with normal market practice, or with delayed delivery, where the
counterparties agree on a settlement date. There are also more contingent
transactions, such as those in the mortgage market, which are referred to
as "to-be-announced" trades.
        The issue AcSEC will consider is whether each of these types of
transactions should be recorded on the balance sheet on the trade date or
on the settlement date. Until now, there has been diversity in practice as
to when these transactions are recorded, which has raised questions among
users of the instruments.

FASB Extracts Leases
From Hedging Project
        The Financial Accounting Standards Board narrowed significantly the
scope of the hedging and derivatives project Dec. 21 when it decided that
leases would not be included.
        The project, in its current form, provides the option of marking
derivative instruments or all financial instruments to market. While other
financial instruments may suffer this fate, the current method to account
for leases will not be affected by the outcome of the project.
        "One reason the Board decided not to include leases was that it
would expand the scope of the project considerably," said Jennifer Clark, a
FASB staffer. "The Board decided to remain narrower and deal with the
issues that most concern hedging and derivatives."
        Robert Conklin, one of the three FASB staffers in charge of the
project, said in the meeting that the Board previously had decided not to
include leases in the scope of two other FASB statements due to the
difficulty in separating the value of the monetary portion of the lease
from the nonmonetary portion. The same reasoning applies to the hedging
project, he said.
        He also noted that the staff was concerned about the lack of
valuation methodologies for leases, another one of the numerous complicated
issues relating to leases. So instead of including leases in the
derivatives project, the staff recommended considering a new project on the
capitalization or valuation of all leases.
        The Board also agreed that the interest component of a change in
the value of a derivative financial instrument, other than an option,
should be recognized in earnings in the period the change occurs, and that
the interest rate to be used would be the current market rate.
        In addition, the initial premium, or the time value component,
related to written or purchased options should be amortized into earnings
on a straight-line basis over the life of the option. Further, any gain on
a purchased option should be recognized in earnings to the extent that
expense has been recognized for the option premium paid.

Comprehensive Income
Takes Tiny Step Forward
        The Financial Accounting Standards Board debated Dec. 22 how to
report accounting adjustments, comprising prior-period adjustments and
cumulative-effective adjustments, and concluded that they should be
reported in the same place. Which place, however, remains unclear.
        The decision represents at least another minor step forward in
FASB's comprehensive income project, which began deliberations in late fall
and seeks to define a new location for items currently not reported in the
income statement. The board began discussing the project on Nov. 29 when it
tentatively decided that all recognized items of comprehensive income
should be reported in one or more statements of income for financial
performance.
        The Board began discussing precisely what those items are by
examining prior-period adjustments and cumulative-effect adjustments, of
which only the latter is currently included in net income. The matter
becomes complicated because some changes in principle are reported as
cumulative effect adjustments in certain situations and prior-period
adjustments in others.
        To clarify the matter, the Board requested the staff to develop
examples illustrating the three different approaches for reporting
accounting adjustments, which the staff has already outlined. The first one
is the "comprehensive income approach," which would interpret comprehensive
income strictly and exclude accounting adjustments. The second approach,
referred to as "all-inclusive income," would interpret comprehensive income
broadly, equating it with the all-inclusive income concept, and excluding
accounting adjustments. The final "compromise" approach would report both
comprehensive income and all-inclusive income, with accounting adjustments
being displayed as the difference between the two.
        The staff, headed up by project manager Todd Johnson, said that any
of these three approaches would be workable if they were applied
consistently over time. The staff also said that the current status quo
approach not be adopted as an official standard, as it is not consistent
with either a strict interpretation of comprehensive income or the all-
inclusive concept.

Network Marketers Give POS Center Stage


Having been given center stage by many shared regional electronic funds
transfer networks, point of sale is on track to become one of EFT's greatest
marketing hits.  Looking to further spur transaction volume, which has
increased by more than 77% over the last two years, networks are expanding
their direct debit marketing budgets while incorporating non-traditional
vehicles to expand their geographic reach.

More regional networks are offering incentives and developing education
programs to generate activity, while minimizing use of the more expensive
television, radio and newspaper advertising.  "The cost for television
advertising is way over our budget for effectively communicating in a
seven-state region," says Cindy Ballard, senior vice president of
Houston-based Pulse, the sixth-largest network.  "Instead, we're working with
banks to help them market to their merchant customers in all areas."

Pulse is focusing on the acquirer side by holding retailer workshops and
making joint sales calls with independent sales organizations to sign new
merchants to accept on-line cards.  The network switched strategies following
a 1994 TV campaign in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which increased network
awareness but did not change consumer usage habits.

Also moving away from media advertising is Chicago-based Cash Station, the
10th-largest POS network, which aired television commercials after launching
direct debit in 1992, but now is working more closely with merchants and
members to spur activity.

Cash Station expects to expand an incentive program it tested at an Illinois
Kmart Superstore last year, in which coupons were distributed to consumers for
discounts when the Cash Station card was used for purchases.  Clerks also were
given prizes if they prompted customers to pay with the Cash Station card.
"Television is very effective when a new product is introduced, but awareness
of POS debit in our area already is high," says Cathy Alexander, Cash Station
senior vice president.  "But there still is an absence of knowledge on the
part of members and merchants."

Indeed, even with network POS transaction volumes soaring, hundreds of
thousands of retailers still do not accept debit cards for payment.  Many
merchants that acquire debit transactions, meanwhile, do not adequately market
the products to customers.  Thus, networks are devising methods to spur
retailers to promote debit.

Louisiana-based GulfNet, the 14th-largest network, has devoted more than half
of its 1996 marketing budget to POS, up 10% from last year, with most of the
funds being used to expand merchant debit acceptance.  The network wants to
expand distribution of incentive coupons at the point of sale to consumers who
paid for purchases with a check or credit card.  The coupons give cardholders
$2 off their next purchase with a GulfNet card.  Schwegmann Giant Supermarkets
ran the promotion for a month last year and $15,000 worth of coupons were
cashed in, says Del Tonguette, GulfNet president.

"Offering incentives is key because studies show that if you can get people to
use the card twice you, might create habitual users," says Ronald Rawson,
president of San Francisco-based R.  C.  Rawson Co., a consulting firm
specializing in EFT awareness, education and usage.  GulfNet also will focus
on expanding network signage at the point of sale and assisting independent
sales organizations in signing retailers.  All but four of GulfNet's 2,000
retailers were recruited by ISOs.

But while many networks have devised strategies for marketing POS at the local
level, some still expect to use the media to reach specific markets.
Virginia-based Most, the fifth-largest network, which attributes much of its
60% increase in POS volume last year to radio and billboard advertisements,
will again use the vehicles to emphasize the different applications tied to
the Most card.  "Television is too costly," says Mary Kilby, Most senior vice
president.  "We believe in supporting a brand across a broad region, but we
can only support TV in one or two markets."

Multiple Methods

Most also expects to work with a product manufacturer in distributing savings
coupons to consumers if they buy a specific product with the Most card.  Last
year more than 5 million coupons were distributed between September and
December for savings on Haagan Daz ice cream.  The network, which advertised
in a minor league baseball park last year, also is considering expanding its
sports marketing activities.  "We have 94% total awareness and 80% POS
awareness, but we still have to look at increasing POS usage, which is only
40%," Kilby says.

Yet, while many networks have diminished their media advertising, some still
have not abandoned the airways as a prime marketing source.  Florida-based
Honor, the fourth-largest network, will advertise from August to December on
such cable stations as Cable News Network, ESPN, A&E, TNT, USA and The Weather
Channel.  Honor is concentrating on cable because it is less costly than
network television and many viewers have the same demographics as active EFT
users, such as being upwardly mobile and early adopters of new technology.

The network will use 85% of its marketing budget for POS this year, up from
50% in 1995.  Honor's activities are being financed by the network's 6-cent
acquirer-paid POS interchange fee.  While 3 cents of the fee is passed on to
card issuers, the network maintains 3 cents for POS promotions.  "POS has the
greatest potential for growth so we promote it more than ATMs," says Elizabeth
Storm, Honor director of marketing.

Also using television in its POS marketing mix is Michigan-based Magic Line,
the 7th-largest network.  Magic Line will run POS TV commercials this spring
and fall in Michigan and Indiana.  The network also will hold seminars to
educate merchants on direct debit, and is considering reinstating an incentive
program that ran for eight weeks last year in which merchant acquirers
received cash awards for each new POS device they deployed.  Of Magic Line's
$1.1 million marketing budget, $400,000 will be spent on POS in 1996.

Some networks, meanwhile, are distributing their marketing dollars in
accordance with the volume generated by the different applications.  San
Diego-based Star System, the largest regional network, will use 30% of its
advertising budget for POS.  Star switched more than 25 million ATM
transactions in December and over 12 million POS transactions.

Star will promote POS on cable television and radio this year, and expand its
marketing in Oregon and Washington.  The majority of Star's marketing will
focus on the network itself and not a specific application.

Another major player incorporating radio advertising is New Jersey-based NYCE,
the second-largest network, which plans to run two 60-second spots for an
eight week period across its entire Northeast region.  NYCE also is devising a
co-op program with merchants which could include electronic coupons or a
loyalty program.

NYCE expanded its market when it merged with Connecticut-based Yankee 24 in
1994 "Radio reaches our target audience, which is typically younger people on
the move," says Scott Strug, NYCE director of marketing.

Other major networks, such as Washington-based The Exchange, Delaware-based
MAC and Massachusetts-based X-Press 24 still are finalizing their marketing
plans.  L

AT&T Disconnects Itself From The Busy Smart Card Lines


While foreign and domestic vendors are flooding the U.S.  smart card market to
position for an expected chip card boom, a major player is departing.  Debit
Card News has learned that AT&T Corp.  is selling its smart card business
unit, which develops and markets contactless card systems.

AT&T is reportedly looking for a buyer because the unit did not fit into the
company's recent reorganization and was not profitable, sources say.  AT&T
reportedly will finish its existing smart card contracts, but will not take on
new customers.  An AT&T spokesperson would not confirm the planned sale.

The move to sell the smart card unit follows AT&T's 1995 announcement that the
global telecommunications and technology company is streamlining its operation
for greater efficiencies.  AT&T is creating three distinct companies for long
distance services, technology and systems, and computer hardware
manufacturing.  The AT&T Smart Cards business unit was created in 1982.

Companies using AT&T contactless smart cards include Delta Airlines, which has
a ticketless boarding program for its Northeast shuttle, and New York-based
Chemical Bank, which is running an in-house contactless card pilot with 300
employees.  Both projects are expected to continue.  Drew University in
Madison, N.J., suspended an AT&T contactless card pilot last year, but is
considering reinstating it.

While most payments industry players are gravitating to a contact card system
in which a smart card is swiped through a card reader, AT&T is marketing
contactless smart cards that must be passed in front of, or near, a card
reader.  While contactless cards are best suited for applications where
transaction speed is crucial, such as persons going through turnstiles in a
train station, the systems are more expensive to implement.  Contactless cards
and terminals are estimated to cost more than twice that of contact cards.
Cards range from $10 to $20, and terminals from $200 to $1,000.

Change Of Plans

AT&T's reported plan to sell its smart card unit follows its announcement last
spring that it would license its contactless technology in hopes of making it
the world's standard for cashless wallets and electronic commerce.  At that
time, AT&T said it was negotiating with three companies in the U.S.  and
abroad.  However, Italy-based Olivetti Co.  reportedly was the only company to
license AT&T's technology, which it used to pilot contactless cards on the
Autostrada, Italy's main freeway.

"When AT&T decided to license its technology to other companies, that was a
signal that they were looking for the way out," says an industry observer
familiar with AT&T.

Indeed, a lack of payments industry interest in contactless technology could
have led to AT&T's decision to sell its operation.  Most observers say AT&T's
system was too expensive for widespread use in supporting stored-value card
programs, which are typically positioned to replace low-value cash
transactions.

In addition, more efficient contactless systems already are being marketed.
For instance, while AT&T's design requires cards to be brought within inches
of a reader, radio frequency-based contactless systems only require cards to
come within a few feet of a reader.  Analysts believe AT&T's design is too
similar to swipe technology.  "Contactless smart card technology is great, but
AT&T never got any real applicable products off the ground," says Jerome
Svigals, a Redwood City, Calif.-based smart card consultant.

A Brighter Future

But while AT&T had problems expanding its smart card business, analysts say
there still is a future for contactless cards.  Indeed, some players that have
encountered difficulties with contactless cards still are planning to utilize
the technology.  Drew University discontinued an AT&T contactless campus card
program that was being used by about 2,500 students and faculty after a year
because the cards were too weak to support high usage.  However, Drew is
considering reinstating the technology with more resilient cards.

Drew's cards were used for identification, stored value and to pay for meals,
but problems stemmed from cardholders' mistreatment of the plastic.  "The
technology worked fine, but students shove their cards in their book bags and
jeans pockets and if it doesn't work, then a student doesn't get a meal," says
Harry Scarpa, Drew University director of purchasing.  Drew is currently using
a mag-stripe campus card.

Still, Drew was impressed with the potential for supporting multiple functions
on the AT&T contactless card.  Drew's chip cards 3 kilobytes of memory,
compared to the one kilobyte of memory in most contact cards.

In addition to cost and reliability issues, contactless card acceptance also
is hindered by a smart card industry that still is evolving.  New applications
that generate additional fee revenue are needed to support a more expensive
card product,such as contactless cards, says Timothy McNaughton, manager of
pilots and implementation at Royal Bank of Canada.  Royal Bank will issue
contact smart cards for the Mondex electronic purse program that will be
launched in Canada later this year.

But while the payments industry is not ready to embrace contactless cards, the
technology is still expected to find a niche in the transportation sector.
The San Diego-based Cubic Automatic Revenue Collection Group, which designs
and implements contactless systems, reports that contactless cards permit more
than 72 persons to move through turnstiles in two minutes, compared to about
60 with contact cards.

Indeed, a number of metropolitan transit authorities, including those in New
York and San Francisco, are reportedly considering implementing contactless
systems.  Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Area Transit Authority already is
testing contactless smart cards for rail, bus and parking services.  More than
1,000 employees are involved in the one-year pilot.  The Washington's transit
authority also is negotiating with North Carolina-based First Union for the
cards to be used in an open contact environment (Debit Card News, 11/30/95).

Easier Access

Meanwhile, enhancements to contact smart card systems are expected to make it
easier for card issuers to upgrade their products for contactless smart card
applications.  One method under study would be to place card jackets with
contactless capability over contact cards.

"One reason why the industry decided on contact cards was because it is much
easier to make a contact card contactless than vice versa," says David Lott,
senior associate at Dove Associates, an Atlanta-based payments consulting
firm.

And Visa and MasterCard, which are supporting contact smart card programs, say
market demand could result in hybrid products.

Visa Leads The Canadian Prepaid Push


When the SmartCash stored-value venture was announced last summer, a major
payments participant was conspicuously absent from its proposed ownership
list:  Visa International.  But while SmartCash and its participants, such as
MasterCard International, Electronic Payment Services and Chemical Bank, still
are cementing the business plans for their nationwide stored-value business,
Visa has taken a lead role in expanding smart card activity in North America.

The California-based bank card association recently signed four Canadian
institutions to pilot its Visa Cash stored-value product.  And with its
sponsorship of a smart card program that will be launched in conjunction with
the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Visa has become the instrumental player
in generating prepaid card activity in the region.

But the North American programs are just one piece of Visa's worldwide smart
card initiative.  Visa already is piloting Visa Cash in Australia, and plans
to have the product issued in markets around the globe.  Indeed, Visa expects
its chip card activities to expand in six regions this year.  "Visa Cash not
only will grow in various parts of Canada, but it will expand over time in
each of our operating regions," says Gaylon Howe, Visa senior vice president
of stored value products.

However, the most recent Visa activity is occurring in Canada, where Toronto
Dominion Bank, Scotiabank, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union and Les
casisses Desjardins, will be piloting Visa Cash.  Toronto Dominion and
Vancouver City Savings went live in December.

Toronto Dominion is issuing 10,000 disposable Visa Cash cards to 5,000
employees in Toronto, who can purchase cards through a card dispensing machine
at bank headquarters for use in a cafeteria.  Up to 15 card readers are
expected to be installed at retail locations over the next several months,
including Michel's Baguette, MMMarvelous MMMuffins, and The UCS Group
convenience stores.

Adding Income

In addition, Toronto Dominion expects to eventually add other retailers, pilot
a rechargeable Visa Cash card, add smart card features to existing debit and
credit cards and support a loyalty program.  "We see the stored-value product
creating a new revenue stream for the bank," says Steve Phillips, Toronto
Dominion manager of access cards and smart card development.  "Visa research
shows consumers are willing to pay a fee to obtain cards, so we wanted to get
our feet wet and generate technical and business expertise with a pilot."  The
test is expected to last six to 10 months.  The bank expects to eventually
roll out the card to other provinces, Phillips says.

Stored-value card activity also is under way at Vancouver City Savings, which
is issuing 1,200 Visa Cash cards in $20 denominations to its employees in the
Vancouver area.  The cards can be used for purchases at a local McDonald's, a
Subway shop, a bank cafeteria, a gift shop at the Science World children's
museum, and a Starbucks coffee shop.

Vancouver City Savings is one of Canada's largest credit unions with 250,000
members.  "We compete with larger banks and feel we can get ahead in the
market with stored value," a spokesperson says.  Vancouver City's pilot will
run through the spring.  The credit union plans to eventually roll out Visa
Cash throughout British Columbia.

Still developing its chip card program is Toronto-based Scotiabank, which
plans to launch a six-month in-house pilot in early February at two bank sites
in Toronto with 5,000 employees.  Employees can use the cards at the bank
cafeteria, MMMarvelous MMMuffins and Starbucks Coffee shops.  "We want to be
ready when the market moves," says Bob Lounsbury, Scotiabank vice president of
card products and marketing.  "But we don't yet see stored-value cards as
providing an opportunity to steal customers away from other banks."

Quebec's largest credit union, Les caisses Desjardins, will launch a Visa Cash
pilot by March in a yet to be determined location.  The credit union is
scouting for an area with a high concentration of stores that deal in
small-value transactions, such as in an office complex.  Program details are
expected to be finalized by the end of the month.

Acquirer-paid interchange pricing for Visa Cash in Canada has not yet been
determined, though each bank will set its own fees, participants say.
Consumer pricing has not been set, but employees will not pay extra card fees
during the test.

The Canadian financial institutions are positioning to garner a piece of the
large market for low-value transactions.  Visa estimates that transactions of
under $10 account for $75 billion annually in Canada.

Bank executives believe Canadians will embrace stored-value cards because many
consumers already are active debit users.  For instance, Toronto-based
Interac, the national on-line point-of-sale network that was launched in 1990,
has doubled its POS transaction volume in the last year.

More than 7 million Interac cards have been issued up, from 5 million in 1994.
Interac had 50 million POS transactions in December, up from 25 million a year
earlier.  Yet, Interac executives do not expect stored-value activity to cut
into on-line volume because stored value is designed to replace cash or
low-ticket transactions.  The average Interac purchase is about $47.

Competitive Pressures

But while Visa Cash is expected to operate alongside Interac, the stored-value
product could still face strong competition from the London-based Mondex
electronic purse program.  Mondex has signed Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce-two of the largest institutions in the country-and
Hongkong Bank, to issue cards.  Mondex plans to test its product in Guelph,
Ontario, during the second half of 1996.  Guelph has 100,000 residents and
1,200 merchants (Debit Card News, 11/15).

Mondex is positioned as a cash replacement and cards can be loaded with value
at ATMs, bank counters and telephones.  Consumers also can transfer value
among cards, and send value electronically from the point of sale to the bank.

"We are looking to get practical experience from an actual market test, which
shows we are moving faster to bring smart cards to the marketplace," says
Timothy N.  McNaughton, Royal Bank of Canada's manager of pilots and
implementation.

Though some observers believe Visa Cash has an advantage with name awareness,
analysts say both companies face the challenge of getting consumers to try a
new stored-value product.  "Visa's brand recognition gives it an edge, but
both products are starting from scratch," says David Lott, senior of Dove
Associates, a payments consulting firm.  "There is ample room in Canada for
both products."

Another President Departs From Debit Processor Deluxe Data


For the second time in less than three years, one of the debit industry's most
renown processors, Deluxe Data Systems, is working to keep its course in the
midst of a leadership upheaval.  Milwaukee-based Deluxe has named John B.
Benton as interim president, replacing James E.  McGowan.  Benton is chairman
and chief executive officer of Benton International Corp., a Torrance,
Calif.-based consulting firm which develops processing systems.

McGowan exits his position just 28 months after being named president.
McGowan replaced Alan G.  Brown, who reportedly was forced out in 1993.  In a
statement released by Deluxe, Gus Blanchard, president and chief executive
officer of parent company Deluxe Corp., said that a number major changes and
additions to product offerings are planned, and "I felt this major expansion
required new leadership to move us to a higher plane."

Deluxe's new growth strategy, which was developed after a six-month analysis,
features four major initiatives including enhancing the company's payments
protection capabilities and creating larger information data bases.  The aim
is for Deluxe to function as a technology partner and act as a link between
financial institutions and their customers.  Client institutions would be able
to electronically hook their customers to a variety of banking application,
such as being able to check balances from a home computer.

Other initiatives involve restructuring the company's catalog and direct
marketing units, and a major cost reduction and asset redeployment program to
help finance Deluxe's expansion plans.

This development of new initiatives and the replacement of McGowan follows a
rough period for Deluxe.  The company has faced difficult times in recent
years as EFT networks, Deluxe's Data's major clients, have taken their
processing in-house.  For instance, New Jersey-based NYCE, the second-largest
shared network and a former Deluxe client, began processing its own
transactions in 1992

Deluxe also lost a major processing customers in 1990 when Brown Deer,
Wis.-based Tyme, the 22nd--largest network, switched from Deluxe to M&I Data
Services.  Tyme, however, still is a software customer of Deluxe.

Some analysts also say that Deluxe has made some questionable business
decisions in recent years.  In 1994, the company purchased Louisville-based
Financial Alliance Processing Services, one of the industry's fastest growing
credit card processors that offers credit and debit services to about 150
financial institutions.  Some observers believe Deluxe overpaid for Financial
Alliance.

Other observers attribute Deluxe's situation to McGowan's inexperience in EFT.
Though McGowan spent 18 years with IBM and was an executive with three
software and technology firms, he was new to the electronic payments industry
when hired by Deluxe.  McGowan has has been placed on special assignment,
reporting to Blanchard.

"I'm not surprised by this because McGowan was in over his head," says Donald
Atkinson, president of Atkinson & Associates, an Irving, Texas-based data
processing consultant.  Some observers also were surprised by the suddenness
of McGowan's departure and the naming of Benton as interim president.

NACHA Adds More Pieces To The Nationwide EBT Puzzle


Seven months after stating plans to develop national electronic benefits
transfer operating rules, the National Automated Clearinghouse Associ-ation's
electronic benefits transfer council is moving forward.  The council has
developed a set of preliminary rules to clarify the roles of such EBT players
as banks, processors and state governments.  NACHA also has started
negotiations to acquire a logo for a national EBT network.

The EBT council, which is working to create a nationwide EBT system, expects
to release the final version of the rules in March.  State EBT consortiums,
such as the seven-state Northeast Coalition and the eight-state Southern
Alliance of States, plan to incorporate the NACHA rules in their operating
procedures.

"We are trying to create an interoperable environment for EBT so it makes
sense to incorporate these standards," says Daniel Berry, EBT coordinator for
New York State, which is part of the Northeast Coalition.

NACHA's EBT Council consists of representatives from state governments, banks,
processing companies and shared regional EFT networks.  The council is working
with the U.S.  Treasury and the Federal EBT task force to create
specifications for a national EBT program.

The NACHA rules are designed to clarify a wide range of EBT issues.  They
state, for instance, that scrip machines in retail locations can be used to
dispense benefits as long as the device is treated as point-of-sale terminals
and not ATMs.  Scrip machines dispense vouchers that are redeemed for cash by
a store clerk.  Networks have different fee schedules for ATM and POS
transactions.

While some observers say the EBT Council's operating rules will duplicate
existing EFT operating rules, participants say the NACHA group is helping to
simplify procedures.

In addition to developing rules, the EBT council is negotiating with directors
of the defunct Quest shared regional EFT network to use the Quest logo for a
national EBT mark.  The deal is expected to be completed within several weeks.

Kentucky-based Quest was merged into Delaware-based MAC, the third largest
shared regional EFT network last July, but the Quest name is still owned by
Transaction Services Co., which represents seven Kentucky-area financial
institutions.

Blockbuster Has A Casting Call For Its Corporate Prepaid Card


One of The Blockbuster Entertainment Group's newest releases, a prepaid debit
card for consumers, has been re-edited.  Blockbuster has shelved plans to
issue cards to consumers and is concentrating on signing corporate customers
to distribute the stored-value products.

Blockbuster is aggressively working to sign product manufacturers, restaurants
and other merchants to purchase and disperse the prepaid cards to their
customers as a marketing incentive.  Already, Planet Hollywood and publisher
Simon and Schuster have formed alliances with Blockbuster.  Simon and Schuster
is including the disposable magnetic-stripe cards in books sold at college
bookstores.  The co-branded cards can be used for purchases at 3,300
Blockbuster Video, 520 Blockbuster Music and 330 Discovery Zone children's
play-area locations in the U.S.

By targeting the corporate customer, Florida-based Blockbuster has turned its
attention from the consumer market.  Blockbuster began testing its disposable
Value Card in Salt Lake City last summer at 25 Blockbuster Video, Blockbuster
Music and Discovery Zone locations (Debit Card News, 9/7).  The company
reportedly invested more than $1 million in hardware and software for the
program.  Consumers paid $15 for cards that held $20 of value.

Yet, despite strong consumer interest in the cards, Blockbuster did not expand
the program outside of Utah.  More than 100,000 Blockbuster Value Cards were
sold in three weeks and Blockbuster said last fall that the company was
encouraged by the test.  The card was expected to cut transaction times at the
checkout, increase the average ticket size and generate interest income on
unspent funds that are held by Blockbuster.

A Blockbuster spokesperson now says the Salt Lake City program was primarily
designed to test the stored-value operating system and that the company now is
putting all its efforts "into the corporate direction."

In addition to signing product manufacturers and service companies,
Blockbuster is marketing its stored-value GiftCard as a vehicle through which
companies can distribute bonuses to their employees.  Blockbuster also is
positioning the cards as a collectible, which can feature designs depicting a
wide range of themes, such as pictures of hit movies when the films are
released on video.

Most recently, Blockbuster sold GiftCards to consumers during the holiday
season to use as gift certificates.  The Blockbuster spokesperson says using a
mag-stripe card as an electronic gift certificate cut the company's processing
costs and the vehicle is expected to be used again this year.  The GiftCard is
expected to be marketed internationally.

Blockbuster stored-value transactions are processed by Omaha-based First Data
Corp.'s Card Establishment Services/NaBANCO unit, the company's credit card
processor.  During a transaction, the cards are swiped through the stores'
credit card devices and sent to CES/NaBanco for authorization and processing.
Cardholders can check remaining account balances at the point of sale.

The move to market a stored-value product is just Blockbuster's latest
activity in the card market.  Last spring Blockbuster rolled out a co-branded
Visa credit card with NationsBank.

California Surchargers Survive A State Sales Tax Scare


The threatened extinction of the surcharge in California has subsided for the
time being.  The state has backed away from a plan to collect sales tax on
consumer fees that are attached to on-line point-of-sale and automated teller
machine transactions.

The measure, which was proposed last summer by the California Board of
Equalization after an audit of the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s Prestige Stations
Inc.  subsidiary, could have cost companies that surcharge millions of dollars
in back taxes.  The regulation also could have resulted in a decrease in
merchant surchargers, and hefty consumer fee increases to compensate for the
taxes, analysts believe.

California determined last year that it was owed taxes from consumer
surcharges on transactions generated at 280 Arco service stations in
California.  Prestige Stations Inc.  operates Arco's 400 company-owned
stations in California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington and Arizona.  Arco charges
consumers 25 cents to initiate on-line debit POS transactions.  While Arco and
California officials would not state the amount of taxes that were in
question, which date back several years, observer believes it was in the
millions of dollars.

The Board of Equalization last month ruled that Arco and other surcharges
should not be subjected to a sales tax because the consumer fee is more of a
financing charge than the sales price of an item, says Dennis Fox, supervisor
of audit planning for the California Board of Equalization.

The board recently published regulations for EFT fees which state that vendors
could be taxed on surcharges if, for instance, the extra fee is not stated
separately; if the consumer could not purchase the property at a price which
does not include the amount of the fee; or if the fee is calculated as a
percentage of the sales price.  The provision is expected to become law in
about four months, following public hearings and a comment period.

By excluding surcharges from the tax code, California has kept a strong
merchant revenue pipeline in place.  Anaheim-based Carl's Jr., for instance,
one of the U.S.'s largest on-line POS merchants with close to 2,000 terminals
in more than 500 outlets, surcharges consumers 50 cents a transaction on
purchases.  Indeed, Fox said the fast-food industry lobbied the state to drop
its plan to tax surchargers.

While Carl's Jr.  reportedly implemented the fee to discourage consumers from
initiating small purchases just to get $40 or more in cash back, analysts
believe the fast-food outlet, as well as Arco, is generating strong income
from the fee.

"This removed a significant barrier to the imposition of surcharges in
California," says Eric Bell, vice president of Los Angeles-based First
Interstate, a leading merchant acquiring institution.  "Most of the surcharge
revenue was pure gravy."

But while California point-of-sale surchargers might have dodged a major tax
bullet, the merchants could be facing another obstacle later this year when
California-based Visa's Interlink national POS network is expected to ban all
merchants from surcharging transactions.

Though the network outlawed surcharging as of November 1993, retailers that
were surcharging prior to that date are allowed to continue the practice until
this November.  The Visa board could address the issue this year, analysts
believe.

Debit-Conscious Australia Says G'Day To Prepaid Cards


While Australia may be best known for its kangaroos and koala bears, some
North American payment players might also be equating the country with guinea
pigs.  For Australia has become a major test site for new and advanced debit
products that eventually will be employed in the U.S., including smart cards.

A stored-value card test is under way on the Gold Coast, a tourist area on the
east coast of Australia, by Visa International.  MasterCard International will
launch a pilot in Canberra, Australia's capital, in March.  The smart card
pilots will help determine how stored-value programs will be designed and
promoted in the U.S.  and other regions.

"The Australia pilot will help us leverage what we learn from consumers,
merchants and member banks about product positioning and marketing," says
Walter Greenberg, MasterCard senior vice president and stored-value project
manager.

Debit Savvy

The bank card associations are using Australia as a test site because research
found that the majority of Australian consumers are willing to use
stored-value smart cards in lieu of cash.  Australians already have embraced
on-line debit cards, with 17 million debit cards issued to the population of
17 million.  Last year, Australian taxis began accepting MasterCard's Maestro
global POS network cards for payment in Sydney.

But while both associations are expanding into Australia, they are following
different routes.  Visa's Visa Cash product currently is just distributed as a
disposable stored-value card, but a reloadable application is expected to be
rolled out in February.

Meanwhile, MasterCard will offer a rechargeable MasterCard Cash card when it
rolls out a stored-value program in March.  "We started with the disposable
card to gain critical mass," says Bruce Mansfield, Visa's head of chip cards
in Australia.  "Because reloadable cards feature bank logos, we didn't want
our banks to compete against each other at the beginning of the pilot."

MasterCard, which is marketing its MasterCard Cash product to consumers this
month via direct mail, will link its stored-value smart card to existing
credit and debit accounts.  MasterCard is not issuing disposable cards for the
Australian pilot.  "Our research shows that consumers want enhancements to
existing cards, rather than have more cards in their wallet," Greenberg says.

Targeting Tourists

Australian stored-value activity was kicked off by Visa in mid-November on the
Gold Coast, an area that attracts nearly 3 million visitors per year.  The
smart cards are being issued by five major financial institutions:  Australia
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Union
Services Corp.  Australia Ltd., National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking
Corp.

The banks have issued more than 10,000 cards and installed 250 card-reading
terminals at an estimated 100 retail locations.  Visa is implementing a
marketing campaign which includes print advertisements and billboards.
Approximately 150,000 cards will be issued during the year-long pilot.

The Visa Cash cards are being sold at about 50 locations, including movie
theaters, theme parks, hotels and financial institution branches.  Reloadable
cards will be added in February and cardholders will be able to add value
through automated teller machines and at the point of sale.

Visa also expects to have 1,000 smart card terminals installed by February.
Most merchants, which include Kmart, Target, McDonald's, 7-Eleven, Shell Oil
and Bond University's book and coffee shop, are situated near two major
shopping centers.  Three theme parks, including Sea World, will accept cards
at about 150 terminals and are expected to go live this month.

About a half-dozen card dispensing kiosks also will be tested and the pilot
might incorporate home-based telephones to add value.  An upgrade to allow
cardholders to store multiple currencies at sites around the world is planned
for 1997.  Pricing for reloadable cards could range from 50 cents per
transaction to $10 annually.

While Mansfield will not disclose current Visa Cash volume, he projects that
activity will reach 25,000 transactions per week in March.  Acquirer-paid
interchange pricing will be determined by each bank.

Meanwhile, MasterCard is just as aggressive in expanding its Australian
program.  MasterCard has been signing merchants since October and expects more
than 200 retailers and 300 smart card terminals to be involved in its pilot in
Belcommen, a suburb of Canberra.  Retailers are paying for terminal
installations.

Gauging Interest

MasterCard Cash issuers-Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp.  and Standard Charter Bank-will run
month-long, in-house tests with up to 500 employees to strengthen employee
understanding of the product and to test the stored-value operating system.
The employee pilots also will test different consumer pricing.  The banks
expect to issue up to 10,000 cards for the nine-month consumer pilot.
MasterCard banks began a direct mail campaign this month for MasterCard Cash.

Final pricing schedules will be completed by March.  While Australian
regulations restrict banks from publicly disclosing consumer and merchant
pricing, research shows that customers prefer monthly or annual fees, rather
than per-transaction fees.

MasterCard Cash cards will be distributed through bank branches and
cardholders can reload value onto the card's computer chip by transferring
funds from bank accounts at ATMs and at the point of sale.  Future
enhancements could include loading value through home-based telephones.
Full-function kiosks also will be installed, where customers can check
balances and transaction information.

In addition to their Australian effort, Visa and MasterCard also expect to
sign issuers in New Zealand.  L

Quick Hits


Visa Stored Value Hits South America

Visa International is expanding into South America with its Visa Cash
stored-value product.  Thirteen Burger King restaurants in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, are accepting the smart cards as part of a six-month test thatbegan
last week.  Visa also is testing Visa Cash in an unspecified number of
McDonald's restaurants in Colombia.

The Buenos Aires project includes 52 merchants, including drug stores,
newspaper stands and taxis.

Debit Puts A Tiny Dent In Bank Branch Activity

Despite expanding debit card activity, bank branches still are capturing the
bulk of retail transactions.  Tampa-based Payment Systems Inc.  reports that
in 1995, 52% of all retail transactions were initiated at financial
institution branches, down just 2% from 1994.  The total volume of
transactions conducted at a traditional branch increased by 6% between 1994
and 1995.

Meanwhile, the share of all transactions conducted at automated teller
machines increased from 22% to 26%, with ATM volumes increasing by 32%, PSI
reports.  Phone banking's share of total transactions increased from 12% to
15%, with a 39% volume increase from 1994 to 1995.

Payment Systems Inc.  determined that active ATM users also use phone banking
systems to transfer funds between accounts or inquire about cleared checks,
and use bank branches to initiate deposits.  ATMs account for 47% of
transactions made by consumers to obtain cash, up from 39% in 1994.
Traditional financial institution branches account for 49% of cash
transactions, down from 54% in 1994, PSI reports.

Paypoint Network Gets A New President

Steve Minihan has been named president of the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s
PayPoint subsidiary.  Minihan replaces John K.  Lannan, who reportedly left
Paypoint because of disagreements with its directors on the future direction
of the operation.  Lannan was responsible for turning Los Angeles-based
Paypoint from a proprietary switch into a major third-party debit and credit
card processor.

In another personnel move, MasterCard International name Sheila Scarry senior
vice president in charge of U.S.  debit products.  Scarry replaces Arthur
Kranzley, who left MasterCard last year to become senior vice president for
Pennsylvania-based Advanta Corp.

CREDIT SUISSE OFFERS PHONE LINK TO GERMAN INVESTORS

CREDIT SUISSE has become the first Swiss bank to launch a telephone
sales service in Germany. The service is called CS-Direct Invest and
follows the May 1995 launch of CS-Direct Invest in Switzerland.

German clients will be able to carry out investment business via an
"account/safekeeping account" in Switzerland. With a minimum investment
of DM10,000 ($7,000), German clients can use CS-Direct Invest to build
up a portfolio from Credit Suisse's Credis Investment Funds.

A Credit Suisse spokeswoman confirmed that because the accounts are
based in Switzerland, German customers are covered by Swiss banking
secrecy laws. Recent years have seen a number of clamp-downs by the
German authorities on banks for allegedly facilitating customers in
avoiding tax through Luxembourg-based funds.

Credit Suisse priced its Swiss product high - mainly to avoid losing
too much business from other areas of its banking service. But the
approach in Germany has been different: "CS-Direct Invest has a
competitive price structure in Germany, but there is a clear
differentiation from discount banks such as Direkt Anlage, Comdirect
and Bank 24," said a bank spokeswoman."Our selling point is not so much
price as service."

The product comes with investment advice and a personal adviser, unlike
German competitors Direkt Anlage, which pared costs to the bone by not
including advice, though it provides information.

The German funds market has grown 25 percent a year since 1990, and
Credit Suisse expects it to grow at least 15 percent a year until 2000.
A spokesman for rival Swiss Bank Corporation said that while it had no
plans to launch a similar product in Germany it was closely observing
the market.

The project will not involve any co-operation with the Winterthur
insurance company, which CS has linked up with in Switzerland.

There are no plans at the moment for PC banking with CS-Direct Invest,
but the bank is watching developments, especially in relation to
improving security.

UNITED STATES:  SIGNET MAIL LOANS MEET LOSSES

AN INNOVATIVE direct loan programme by US regional bank Signet of
Richmond, Virginia has encountered high loan loss rates and sparked
concern among bank analysts. But Signet says the high loan losses are
part of its statistically-driven "cell testing" method and are no cause
for alarm.

Signet's "loan by cheque" programme is one of the most daring
experiments yet in "branchless" banking. The programme uses databased
marketing and advanced computer models to generate pre-approved
consumer loans of up to $10,000. For each pre-approved loan, the bank
simply mails out a cheque to the targeted consumer, who can then cash
it at his local bank.

The new programme relies on the statistical science of "information
discovery", an approach first developed by the US credit card industry
and used to great effect by Signet's highly successful credit card
operation, which the bank spun off into Capital One in early 1995.
Capital One, which uses information discovery to generate customised
new card offers, increased its accounts by 22 percent and its
receivables by 42 percent in 1995.

Information discovery studies each customer's behaviour and calculates
the "net present value" of each customer relationship. It then
continuously analyses customer data to isolate behavioural clusters
that permit the bank to generate customised card or consumer loan
offers. Once these offers are tested and retested among the bank's
existing customers, the resulting models, or "hypotheses", are used to
generate new offers to non-customers taken from external lists.

Signet's cheque-by-mail programme is part of an ambitious bid to
transform the mid-sized regional bank, which has $10 billion in assets
and some 250 branches, into a national consumer bank. Since 1993, the
bank has used statistical modelling and bought lists to mail out offers
for consumer credits, student loans, home equity products and mutual
funds to tens of thousands of prospective customers, who have only to
phone a toll-free telephone number to accept the terms offered.

The bank's declared strategy is to take the statistical methods
pioneered by the credit card industry and extend them into consumer
lending and direct banking. A number of large US banks, including First
Bank and Wells Fargo are using similar methods for national marketing
drives in small business lending and home equity loans, for example,
but Signet's effort is the most aggressive and broadly-based.

"Signet is turning into a cross between a consumer finance company and
a regional bank. It could turn into a huge national company," said Tom
McCandless, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York. "Many banks are
trying to emulate what they're doing."

But the experimental nature of Signet's marketing methods have lately
become a cause for concern among analysts. Signet's programme ran into
trouble in the third quarter of 1995, when its gross charge-offs rose
to $9.3 million, up 63 percent from the previous quarter. As a result,
Signet was forced to double its loan loss provisions to $8.7 million,
and redoubled them again in the fourth quarter to $18.6 million. The
bank's total net charge-offs jumped 20 percent from the third quarter
to $15.6 million.

Signet explained that the higher loan losses were the result of two
mailings the company made in late 1994 to test how lower acceptance
criteria would affect response and profitability. The two mailings
generated $175 million in new loans, but three quarters later they had
created an annualised loss rate of 11.23 percent.

Signet has responded that the third-quarter losses were the result of
mailings the bank deliberately made to higher-risk segments. "In order
to build more effective models, we had to have some losses, and in
order to get some losses, we had to mail to higher risk segments,"
Signet chief operating officer Malcolm McDonald told American Banker.

While the bank was expecting a higher loss rate for these mailings, it
did not expect the high response level - and resulting loss levels -
that the mailings produced. Earlier mailings, he said, did not produce
enough losses to build statistically robust models. McDonald explained
that each mailing has expected losses built into it, and that Signet's
cheque-by-mail programme could sustain higher loan losses and still
generate a"positive net present value".

But fourth-quarter losses have further highlighted the problems of the
loan-by-cheque programme. The loan loss ratio of the programme's two
high-risk mailings reached a miserable 19.5 percent in the fourth
quarter, against 2 percent for the rest of the programme. But Signet
stands by the programme, whose loans its hopes to double in 1996. It
expects high losses to continue in the coming quarters, as high-risk
loans decline as a percentage of the total loan-by-cheque portfolio.

WINTHERTHUR GOES DIRECT WITH SWISSLINE

WINTERTHUR, the Swiss insurance company, has launched a direct
insurance subsidary called Swissline. The company says the opportunity
exists because of the deregulation of the mandatory motor insurance
market.

Balz Hoesly, chief operations officer of Swissline, expects volume to
grow to between 10 percent and 15 percent of the non-life insurance
market by 2000, and expects to make a profit in four to six years.
Swissline will initially offer motor insurance and linked products like
legal help and breakdown recovery, but it is hoped that it will expand
into other forms of insurance "fairly soon".

Swissline is a stand-alone company, and is legally the underwriting
agent for Wintherthur Insurance and Wintherthur Life. It employs 70
people.

"We are aiming to gain lasting competitive advantage in the entire
value-added process," said Hoesly. He cited motivated staff,
first-class service, cost advantages for customers, rigorous cost
management and a high-tech infrastructure as the basics needed for the
success of the direct operation.

Swissline says it deliberately waited for the deregulation moves to
start operations.

BANC ONE RETHINKS SCREENPHONE

A SCREENPHONE pilot launched by US super-regional Banc One has stumbled
badly after three months, forcing the bank to rethink its commitment to
screen telephony. Banc One's poor results highlight the screenphone's
failure to achieve any success in the US market in 1995. Several large
institutions, including Citibank, withdrew from screenphone pilots last
year, and many other banks chose to focus on PC banking instead.

Banc One launched the pilot in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in September,
in partnership with hardware vendor GTE and processor Visa Interactive.
GTE's screenphone was priced at $150, perhaps the lowest price on offer
in the US, where some high-end models have sold for $700. GTE hoped to
sell 2,000 units by the end of 1995, but it sold only several hundred.
Most of the buyers were blue-collar men who were older and less
affluent than expected.

Banc One mailed 150,000 screenphone offers to its customers in Texas,
but the promotion generated far more inquiries about the bank's PC
banking programme than its screenphone service. (Banc One currently
offers PC banking in Ohio through on-line service Prodigy, a programme
it plans to extend to other markets this year.)

In its 1996 Home Banking Report, Jupiter Communications in New York
estimated that PC home banking accounts in the US at 750,000 in 1995
and predicted they would grow to 13 million by the year 2000. But for
screenphones, Jupiter Communications offered a less sanguine view - the
19,000 US households using screenphones for remote banking in 1995
would grow to 600,000 by the year 2000. Since screenphones, unlike PCs,
bear the enormous marketing and hardware risks involved in launching a
new consumer device, Jupiter's screenphone projection should be enough
to dissuade most large banks from trying.

While the screenphone was widely discussed at the 1994 Retail Delivery
Systems conference, it received no attention at all at the 1995 RDS
show, where speeches on PC and Internet banking drew huge crowds. Asked
at one 1995 RDS session to name his greatest marketing failure, Keycorp
marketing chief Steven Cone replied,"At Citibank, my biggest mistake
was backing the screenphone, a wonderful device that no one uses."

BARNETT TESTS CABLE NETWORK

AFTER NEARLY a year of delays, Barnett Banks of Jacksonville, Florida
will offer home banking over Time Warner's Full Service Network (FSN),
an interactive cable service which the entertainment group launched in
December 1994. Time Warner's FSN, the first interactive cable pilot in
the US, has signed up 3,500 customers in Orlando, Florida and now
offers customers local phone service as well as broadband data
transfer.

Barnett's programme, the first US home banking pilot that uses
full-motion interactive television (ITV), will allow FSN subscribers to
combine remote banking with such interactive services as video on
demand, home shopping and video games.

Barnett's home banking package, which is free for all FSN customers who
also bank at Barnett, allows users to check their balances, view
statements and transfer funds by manipulating displays on their TVs
with the help of cable set box. All customer information resides with
Barnett, which encrypts and secures transaction information on its own
proprietary operating system.

Once the holy grail of remote delivery, interactive cable in the US was
completely eclipsed last year by the phenomenal growth and popularity
of the Internet. Only two operators have introduced interactive cable
pilots - Time Warner and regional telco Bell Atlantic, which launched
its service in New Jersey last month.

The expense of upgrading infrastructure has delayed the progress of
both projects and cast doubt on their commercial viability. Bell
Atlantic, for example, said its current cost for telephone and
interactive video service installation is $17,000 per household.

AMEX TESTS IN GERMANY

AMERICAN EXPRESS says its pilot direct bank in Germany is performing
well, though it is "too early" to give figures on the number of new
customers.

The bank offers a Eurocheque card which allows cash withdrawals, cheque
deposits, direct debit functions, and ATM access to thousands of ATMs
across Europe and the world. The service - Giro Direkt - was launched
in October.

The number of accounts in American Express Bank in Germany rose 30
percent between April and October 1995. Of new customers, 50 percent
were not holders of American Express cards.

"Amex Bank has been successfully selling a similar product to its card
members since 1991. We saw that there was growing interest outside the
card member base to offer a similar product.

"We are waiting to see the results of that test, and will then review
the situation," said a spokesman.

Giro Direkt will be evaluated on, among other criteria, the number of
customers and their profiles and usage patterns.

It is possible that the company will open a similar operation in the UK
or elsewhere, if the German operation is a success. American Express
has direct banking operations for card holders only in Paris,
Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

But a spokesman warned: "There are no plans to do anything in the UK at
this stage. We will look at the banking environment, what consumer
interest there is and then move from there."

The project started in Berlin and Hamburg, where the bank says there is
a clear reflection of its current customer profile.

Giro Direkt customers can bank by phone, fax or letter from anywhere in
the world. The bank is hoping to have PC banking by the summer "at the
latest".

Amex declined to say how many staff work on the direct bank, but
American Express Bank employs 220 people from its Frankfurt
headquarters.

DUTCH COURAGE

The Netherlands was one of the first countries to embrace direct
delivery. Yet the country's major institutions show marked differences
in their approach. Diarmuid MacConville reports

DUTCH FINANCIAL institutions were among the pioneers of direct
delivery, and the Dutch are among the world's keenest users of direct
services. At present, about 8.5 percent of retail bank customers use
the telephone, and UK market research company Datamonitor believes that
by the year 2000 almost a quarter of the Dutch population will be
banking by phone.

Direct banking in Holland started in 1978, 15 years before banks
elsewhere realised that customers wanted more flexibility in banking.
Postbank, before its privatisation and absorption into NMB Bank, and
ultimately ING Group, coined the phrase "Thuisbankieren", which is now
used generically for all home banking.

Only cash withdrawals and lodgements required a visit to the post
office; all other transactions could be carried out at home, usually
over the phone. Postbank prospered with direct banking: market share of
savings rose to 17 percent in 1989 from 13 percent in 1978.

Three players - Rabobank, Postbank, and ABN AMRO - dominate the Dutch
market, and account for 80 percent to 90 percent of most types of
banking business. But smaller players, including insurance companies
like Achmea and Aegon, are starting to nibble at the edges of the
direct banking market. Postbank has been by far the quickest into the
direct market; the other big banks are only slowly starting to add
direct banking services to the main offering.

A spokesman for a rival bank said: "That is because for us, direct
banking is only one channel of distribution, not the main one, like it
is for Postbank."

Postbank, part of the ING group, is basically a stand-alone direct
bank, though it does have dedicated counters in post office branches
around the country. It started experimenting with alternative
distribution channels in the 1960s, while it was still state-owned.
Today, the telephone is its main distribution channel. It claims a
banking relationship with one-third of Dutch households, about 6
million people.

Postbank has 500 staff at four processing centres, all dealing with
customer queries. The bank generates most of its customer credit
inquiries from the post offices (60 percent) compared to 27 percent
from mailed material, which is also used extensively.

Some 800 customer service agents at 11 Postbank call centres deal with
8.5 million inquiries. This has been supplemented by Girofoon, an
Automatic Voice Response (AVR) unit launched in 1993. But Postbank
managers are sceptical about customer acceptance. "We are convinced
that many of our best customers do not yet appreciate it," said Herman
Huizinga, Postbank's head of telephone banking. "Because we are not yet
convinced of the full acceptance of the medium, we are not forcing
customers to use voice response."

The bank also has AVR units to reply to questions about share prices
and its mortgage products.

ABN AMRO, which also has an AVR unit, started its pilot human operator
phone banking service early in 1996. Clients of 33 branches can use it,
allowing them to buy and sell stocks and shares and obtain market
information. From February 19, a service line will be available,
allowing account transfers and other banking services.

An ABN AMRO spokeswoman said that the continuation of manned phone
banking depends on the results of the pilot. The bank wants to focus
the direct banking as an add-on service for branch-based customers
rather than as a stand-alone operation. Now employing about 50 people,
the call centre is expected to expand to several hundred if the manned
telephone banking operation goes ahead.

Achmea Group came from the merger of Avero Central Beheer Group (AVCB)
and Zilveren Kruis Group and started operating at the start of 1995. A
Salomon Brothers study put the market penetration of its Dutch direct
car insurance service (Centraal Beheer, set up in 1975) on a par with
Direct Line, the UK's largest motor insurer.

Direct banking, run by AVCB Bank, was started as part of the Central
Beheer direct insurance operation in 1988. It offered consumer credit
and started operating as a stand-alone bank in 1992 when it got a
banking licence allowing it to offer savings accounts. It now also
offers credit cards.

The bank makes use of the insurance operation's call centre, mostly for
non-clients who call to get information about the bank, often after a
mail-shot. Existing clients phone the front offices direct to transact
business, and staff at the front offices spend most of their time
dealing with client calls. Product manager Cobi Weddepohl said very few
clients feel the need to call in person to the bank offices.

All banking activities are being reorganised within Achmea; there are
currently three banks with AVCB Bank selling products under four
different labels. The aim is to have one bank holding company with one
back office and several front offices.

Co-operative Rabobank Nederland, which has about 4.9 million retail
customers, has an AVR unit. This was only set up in late 1994 and
allows balance inquiry, funds transfer and information on personal
loans.

A Rabobank spokesman said its priority is "advisory banking", and that
any telephone services are additional. "Meeting customers face-to-face
is a very important part of the relationship." But the spokesman added:
"That could change if the there's a need in the market. For example,
our order line for share buying came in due to competition from
others."

Generale Bank Nederland (formerly Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland),
while much smaller than its rivals, has dipped into the direct banking
market with Direktbank. It offers a limited range of banking services,
and its main distribution channel is through a network of independent
intermediaries. Sources in Generale have indicated it could turn more
to direct banking to increase market share without the expense of
creating more branches.

VSB Telebank, part of the financial conglomerate Fortis, was started in
1990 as a result of an efficiency drive in the VSB Bank. It started
with five staff and now has 30. Some 18 telemarketing staff man the
lines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year
- the first Dutch bank to offer this service.

Calls doubled after the first year and have grown linearly since then.
At the same time, branches are being closed or are reducing their
opening hours.

An AVR unit deals with simple queries and standard calculations. When
more detail is required on a particular item, telesales staff will
arrange a meeting with staff in the nearest branch.

The bank strongly believes in tying most customers to their branches,
thus overcoming the resentment often felt by established branches from
the development of a direct banking operation. Branches are credited
with sales made by telemarketing staff who take commission on it.

The bank is careful to point out that it also has stand-alone customers
in niche markets; this relates generally to the "upscale market
segment" where it operates with financial advisers Finles, a company
specialising in advising professional associations.

VSB said that the conversion rate - the number of contacts that lead to
a direct sale - is substantially higher for VSB Telebank than for
branch contacts, and said that 70 percent of VSB Telebank sales are
settled on the phone rather than through the post or branch visits.

Spaarbeleg, the banking subsidiary of insurer Aegon, believes its low
overheads allow it to offer some of the most competitive interest rates
on the market. Customer numbers have doubled since 1993 to 700,000.
Revenues increased by two-thirds to DFL488.5 million ($268.4 million)
over the same period. It positions itself as a simple, high-interest
alternative in the savings market.

One of its two products is a savings account for employees of
corporations which allow employers to offer their employees a fixed sum
of money in a tax-efficient manner at an attractive rate of interest.
Aegon thinks that the savings market will continue to grow in response
to the government's policy of encouraging citizens to provide for
themselves.

Heinie Hakker, banking analyst at BZW, said that of the insurance
companies nibbling the edges of the market, Aegon's Spaarbeleg has been
the most successful, because it offers better interest rates than the
banks and also uses direct marketing techniques.

A Postbank spokesman, commenting on the high interest rates offered by
Spaarbeleg, admitted it would not be able to compete with this rate on
all its accounts, but said Postbank has the huge advantage of a very
strong position in the payments system.

The next development in direct banking in the Netherlands is the
October 1996 launch of a multifunctional chip card. PTT Telecom, the
Dutch telecom company, has joined forces with ING to create a card
which can be used in shops, phone booths and banks. They can be loaded
with money at post offices, telephone booths, and eventually at home
with a special attachment to existing phones. The money added to the
card will be debited from a customer's account.

Between them, the phone company and the bank have "access to
practically every household in the Netherlands", according to Ben
Verwaayen, president of PTT Telecom.

The system is especially designed to be an open one, and the designers
hope other retail groups will take part in it. The Dutch partners say a
project on this scale has never been tried before in Europe and
possibly beyond.

They did not wait for the consensus that is usual among Dutch banks
before launching a project. "The speed to market was all-important,"
Verwaayen said.

A similar electronic purse is being piloted by the other Dutch banks,
though it is a less ambitious project than the "multifunctional" card
venture.

ABN AMRO and most other banks say they are undecided about joining the
new venture, pointing out that they are already committed to an
all-bank chip card project, currently under test in Arnhem.

BZW analyst Hakker said: "Both ING and PTT are putting themselves
behind it, and they are in dominant positions in their markets. It can
become a big success. The Arnhem card has been badly received by trade
and industry because it is too inflexible and too expensive."

Rabobank said it will "certainly not" be involved in the Postbank card.
A spokesman said that the combined banks' card would probably be
available in a few months, before the Postbank card, and that research
from the pilot project in Arnhem was very positive.

"On a scale of one to ten, customers gave it 7.2 and retailers gave it
6.9. Retailers don't think it's too expensive. And 58 percent of
retailers would recommend it to others, said a Rabobank spokesman.

PC-based home banking is well advanced. For example, Postbank has
117,000 customers, including 91,000 retail who subscribe to Girotel,
the PC-based home banking service launched in 1988. Subscriptions have
taken off since September 1994 - a three-fold growth was seen after the
introduction of a friendlier home banking system.

The service is off-line, so users can complete all the necessary data
and send when they are ready. This has led to cost savings for the bank
as well as for customers who do not have to wait for processing to be
done on-line, saving them on the phone bill.

Rabobank has 80,000 private customers and 70,000 companies banking via
PCs, and expects this to grow to 200,000 within "a couple of years".
The bank's PC banking started in 1992. A typical day would have about
150,000 corporate transactions and 35,000 personal transactions.

The use of smart phones has met with little success, however. On a
Postbank test, while technically successful, customers felt that the
added convenience of banking with screenphones did not outweigh their
high costs.

"At the moment, we draw the conclusion that the coming years will be
dominated by the use of the straightforward phone. Rapid penetration of
mobile telecommunication can support this. And in all circumstances we
have to rely on our staff to communicate with the customer," said
Postbank's Huizinga.

AVCB Bank is trying out PC banking in 1996, and may go ahead depending
on the results of the pilot.

HONG KONG SET TO LEAP-FROG DIRECT

A variety of factors particular to the territory mean that the
development of direct delivery is taking an unusual course in Hong
Kong. Andrew Moody reports

HONG KONG, like many centres in Asia, is a major focus for technology.
The people, too, are gadget-obsessed. It is therefore somewhat
surprising that this culture of technology has not spread to direct
delivery.

The lack of development in this area is not because Hong Kong is
unsophisticated in banking terms - it is one of the leading financial
centres of the world, and its 400 banks are a key element of that
strength.

But while the corporate banking community is fairly advanced in
technology terms, retail banking appears pretty slow off the mark. A
key reason for this is that Hong Kong is by geographical and
sociological accident clumsily suited to the primary forms of direct
delivery in banking.

Telephone banking often requires huge space but Hong Kong, where land
comes at a higher premium than anywhere in the world, does not have
much to spare. And in a country where unemployment has until recently
been insignificant, no-one, particularly anyone calling themselves a
banker, wants to be a telephone operative.

Sergio Rial, general manager of ABN AMRO in Hong Kong, agrees that the
steps towards telephone banking in the territory are only tentative.
"The real challenge and the barrier to phone banking in Hong Kong is
the people. In a place of full employment, no professional wants to be
behind a phone. I don't think they would be able to hold their heads up
as a real banking professional," he says.

And he adds: "Going through password procedure and paying people's
utility bills would not be anybody's idea of fun. Everybody here wants
to be part of a go-ahead marketing team, not this."

So what have Hong Kong banks been doing in terms of direct delivery
systems? The first steps towards telephone banking came in the late
1980s and early 1990s, pioneered by the territory's major players,
Hongkong Bank, Hang Seng Bank, Citibank and Standard Chartered.

"We have been in direct banking since 1990 in one form or another. We
can do telephone, we can do fax and we have been looking at the most
cost-effective and customer-receptive forms of direct banking to
implement," says Eric Tai, senior executive, retail, marketing and
planning for the Hongkong Bank and a leading figure within the
territory's banking community.

"Most banks in Hong Kong have some direct banking offer but it is still
offered within the bank itself rather than by setting up a separate
entity such as First Direct."

But the services offered in Hong Kong are more primitive compared to
many of those in the west. The standard product is automated so that a
customer speaks to a voice-activated machine which is able to carry out
simple routine transactions. Generally, only AB and high-rated
customers get the chance to speak to a person, but that individual may
be someone from their branch who they would normally deal with during
the course of their conventional banking transactions.

High employment and land prices are not the only barriers to telephone
banking. The greater role played by the ATM compared to the west may be
another.

In Hong Kong, the ATM is not just something in which you insert your
card to check your balance and withdraw cash but something much more
highly prized. People can pay their utility bills, swap money between
different accounts and carry out a variety of other functions.

In fact, in most streets in Hong Kong the ATM machine seems to be a
community focal point, like some open air post office, where people can
stop and gossip, judging by the crowds they tend to gather around them.

Staggeringly, there are 7 million ATM cards in use in the territory
serving a population of 6 million.

In part, the ATM has taken over many of the functions served by
telephone banking in the west, and the average ATM transaction costs
the bank one-eighth of what it would cost over the counter.

ATMs, however, are still more costly than more modern methods of direct
delivery. They don't operate independently of branches. In fact, many
operate within them, so this halfway house towards full direct delivery
is far from ideal.

But the real catalyst for a wholesale change to more sophisticated
forms of banking could be the economy itself. So far, economic
pressures on the banks to adopt new methods of technology have
certainly been nowhere near as great as in the west.

Retail banking in Hong Kong is as profitable as virtually anywhere in
the world. Much of this has to do with the fact that Hong Kong has
averaged economic growth rates of between 5 percent and 8 percent for
the last decade. It has also operated an infamous interest rate cartel.

Bank customers have, therefore, been getting richer and more
middle-class. There have therefore been fewer bad debtors, savings
rates have been higher and the bottom line of the banks ever bigger. In
1993, for example, the Hang Seng Bank, 62 percent-owned by the Hongkong
Bank, was the most profitable retail bank in the world, according to
credit rating agency IBCA. Consequently, banks have not been forced to
cut costs by closing branches, get rid of staff and move more quickly
towards automated methods of banking.

This factor, however, is beginning to change. GDP growth forecasts for
Hong Kong, particularly over the difficult period of 1997 when the
colony transfers from British to Chinese control, look very uncertain.
A survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, published in January,
points to growth slumping to 1.7 percent in 1997, compared to around 5
percent now. If this is the case, retail banking in Hong Kong can no
longer rely on the ever-increasing wealth of their customers to dig
them out of a hole.

The new harsher economic environment has undoubtedly begun to change
the thinking among senior bank executives within the major banks.

Alex Au, vice chairman and chief executive of the Hang Seng Bank, is in
no doubt the banks will have to adapt to the new environment.

"What is coming will be dramatic and will totally reshape the business.
By the end of the millennium retail banking will have undergone major
plastic surgery," he says. "It has become increasingly apparent that
the future of banking lies in automation and technology applications.
With the higher cost of operations, finding a more efficient way to
deliver banking services to customers is one of the critical factors
for financial institutions."

ABN AMRO's Rial believes that Hong Kong banks in their evolutionary
development will actually by-pass conventional telephone banking and
take a quantum step from branch banking to PC home banking. "Because of
the constraints within the market, I can see this happening. There are
also many local factors making it difficult to operate telephone
banking in any meaningful sense, so I would not be surprised if Hong
Kong banks took this peculiar step forward," he says.

Some, however, do not quite hold with this theory. Peter Wong,
vice-president of global consumer banking for Citibank in Hong Kong,
believes there is mileage in telephone banking. From his office next to
the futuristic Hong Kong Telecom Tower in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay, he
mainly deals with higher net worth customers.

"We have had considerable take-up of our telephone banking services,
and they have gone down well with our customers. We have a satisfaction
rating for this service of 90 percent, compared with 82 percent for our
conventional banking," he said.

Assuming, however, that the era of telephone banking in Hong Kong is
some form of interregnum - a brief stop on the way to more
sophisticated systems of direct delivery - what methods do the banks
have in mind?

The leading banks are already investing heavily behind closed doors
into technologies that will make home PC or TV banking a reality.
Electronic banking is already available to the corporate market and it
will inevitably spread into the retail market. Consumers in Hong Kong
are very computer literate; it is estimated that 200,000 people in the
territory are already Internet subscribers. And it is expected that
within just a few years, once banks have developed secure transaction
technology, there will be a flood of customers wanting to do their
banking over the Internet.

The direct delivery of banking services into people's homes through
interactive multi-media services may happen even more quickly. A number
of banks are planning to broadcast product information through this
technology in 1996 paving the way to them conducting transaction
banking through this medium.

Electronic cash could soon become a reality in Hong Kong with the
imminent introduction of smart cards. The Mondex card is expected to be
on trial later this year with a major launch in 1997. How it will take
off is difficult to judge. It is seen in the west as an anti-crime
measure but in Hong Kong there is virtually no cash crime.

A bank likely to lead the market is the Hongkong Bank, which has been
investing heavily in this new technology. "We are not doing home
banking yet but we are coming along with it. We are currently working
with Hongkong Telecom jointly to do TV banking. All the different
interfaces which are possible technologically are being looked at,"
says Hongkong's Tai.

Its sister bank, the Hang Seng, is also a driving force. "In terms of
technology products in use Hong Kong is still in the early stages of
technology banking when compared to the western countries," says Alex
Au.

"But although investment in new technology involves huge sums, banks
cannot afford not to make the investment. For in the end, technology
banking means - for both external and internal operations - improved
efficiency, higher productivity, better risk control and lower costs."

NAB LEADS IN PHONE BANKING

NATIONAL AUSTRALIA Bank has leapt ahead of its major competitors in
phone banking by permitting loans to be issued over the phone.

In late December, the bank announced that it had launched a telephone
loans service which will approve homes loans within 25 minutes, and a
personal loan or a credit card approval in around 15 minutes, using a
computer-based credit assessment system developed by the bank over the
past two years.

Provided the customer passes all tests, loan approval is subject only
to the customer presenting the required documents when calling into a
branch to sign loan documents.

Telephone banking has come very much into its own over the past two
years in Australia, with most of the smaller banks notably ahead of
their major rivals in offering phone services. NAB managing director
Don Argus, said National was the only bank "offering this level of
convenience".

ADVANCE ON THE NET

SECOND TIER Australian bank, Advance Bank, has become the first
Australian institution to allow its customers to access accounts
through the Internet.

Using software developed by an Australian company Techway, based in
Sydney, Advance announced in late December that its customers could now
use a pin number to gain access to their accounts through the bank's
site on the Internet.

A bank spokesman said the information accessible was initially limited
to basic account information, but the bank hoped to extend the services
available into a full alternative to its existing phone inquiry
service.

The security of the system is guaranteed by two levels of encryption,
with the second level involving a 128-bit key used for each session, as
opposed to the commonly used 40-bit encryption key.

The customer needs adequate Internet access, but does not require any
additional software.

UK WELCOMES DIRECT ROUTE

BANKS AND building societies came top of the supplier list for people
who would buy life assurance, pensions and investments over the phone,
according to a UK survey by consultants Prospektus.

When asked which type of company they would buy direct, "My bank or
building society" was the preferred choice of 76 percent, almost twice
the number choosing a "traditional insurance company", the next most
popular choice.

Anna Ellison, director of consultants Prospektus, says that people feel
that their bank is less likely to sell them an unsuitable product.
"It's the idea of the old-fashioned bank manager - a relationship where
they don't want to see me get into trouble."

The survey found people tended to associate selling by insurance
companies with pressure to spend more than they could afford.

One quarter of the 4,000 people surveyed said they were prepared to
complete the purchase direct, either by phone, mail or computer. This
seems to contradict the general view that these products are too
complex to sell direct, and require advice and advisers.

A major attraction of buying direct seems to be"the positive experience
of the price and service benefits delivered by companies such as Direct
Line and First Direct". Six out of ten customers cited value for money
as their key motivation for wanting to buy this way.

Banks were most popular among the mass market while affluent customers
tended to see pensions and insurance as more complex matters requiring
advice.

Customers cited companies like Marks and Spencer (17 percent), the Post
Office (34 percent), and even the utility companies (16 percent) as
places where they would buy life assurance, pensions and investments.

POLAND'S BANK CONSOLIDATION PROGRAMME CRITICISED BY S&P

BANK RATING agency Standard & Poor's has criticised Poland's bank
consolidation programme, saying it will not affect the creditworthiness
of the banks.

The Polish government has changed its bank strategy in the past year to
accelerate the privatisation of the remaining banks. Rather than
selling them off as it has done with four of the nine banks to date, it
now plans to merge the banks into two of the leading specialised banks -
 Polska Kasa Opieki (Pekao) and Bank Handlowy w Warsawie.

Under the plan, Bank Handlowy w Warsawie will absorb Pomorski Bank
Kredytowy (PBKS) and Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy (BPH), while Pekao will
merge with Bank Depozytowo-Kredytowy, Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy and
Polski Bank Rozwoju (PBR).

According to Standard & Poor's, "the consolidation would not
significantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,
or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range for
zloty-denominated obligations".

It added that certain risks would increase in the near term, as the
mergers would bring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio, and
the integration process could be difficult. S&P said that objections
from shareholders of the already semi- privatised banks BPH and PBR, as
well as from regional bank managements "could still scuttle the deal".

Recent reports from Poland said the president of BPH claimed she would
fight the merger with Bank Handlowy w Warsawie if it meant BPH would
lose its separate identity. And the president of Pomorski Bank
Kredytowy is reported to have said that a takeover of PBKS and BPH
would cause chaos and delay the privatisation process.

S&P said that"a more jaundiced view" held by some market players is
that the consolidation strategy is merely a ploy by the government for
reasserting control over the banking system, a theory which will be
borne out, it said, if Bank Handlowy w Warsawie and Pekao are not
privatised.

On the plus side, S&P said the consolidation plan could give the two
banks greater diversity and market share, which could be positive
factors. Bank Handlowy w Warsawie would gain more retail deposits and
commercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution network
and possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertise
of Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail brokerage
strength.

CZECH REPUBLIC:  CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCES PLAN TO EASE BANK CRISIS

THE CZECH National Bank (CNB) has announced a consolidation programme
for small Czech banks to improve confidence in the sector, following
the near-collapse of a fourth bank in January. The programme affects
about 8 percent of the banking sector and will require small banks to
recapitalise and reduce their bad debt exposures by the end of 1996.

Ekoagrobanka, a small agricultural bank based in Usti nad Labem, north
Bohemia, was forced into administration by the CNB's Banking
Supervision Committee in mid-January and remained closed for more than
a week after rumours flared that it was having difficulties, creating
queues outside its 79 branches.

The CNB advanced the bank CK1 billion ($37.4 million) to help cover the
rush on its demand deposits, and the CNB issued a statement in support
of Ekoagrobanka and its likely recovery. Shareholders agreed
reluctantly to a capital reduction by nearly CK600 million to only
CK1.2 million plus the injection of CK500 million of fresh capital from
Konsolidacni Banka, which becomes the largest shareholder.

The CNB stated that Ekoagrobanka depositors should face no limits on
their withdrawals once the bank opens again for business. Although
depositors are insured for 80 percent of deposits up to CK130,000 under
a new national scheme, many are nervous following the collapse of three
other Czech banks in the past two years - Kreditni a Prumyslova Banka,
AB Banka and Ceska Banka.

The CNB had Ekoagrobanka under close scrutiny due to its large level of
overdue loans, but CNB spokesman Martin Svehla said unlike the three
banks which collapsed, Ekoagrobanka had a realistic plan for
strengthening its capital adequacy and was implementing that plan
within the agreed time.

The 1994 annual accounts of Ekoagrobanka received a heavily qualified
audit from local firm BDO. The auditors noted that reserves for
doubtful debts of CK266 million should, in fact, be CK1,291 million and
provisions against losses on securities should be raised from CK25
million to CK494 million. Total assets in the qualified accounts
amounted to CK12,005 million.

Short-term deposits amounted to 66 percent. The stated profit was CK63
million on CK1,286 million of revenue. The bank had planned to double
its share capital by issuing CK600 million of shares on the Prague
Stock Exchange, but there were few interested buyers.

The National Bank of Slovakia followed the example of their Czech
counterparts and placed the ten Slovak branches of Ekoagrobanka in
forced administration in mid-January.

The CNB has not revealed the names of the banks which it has forced
into its new consolidation scheme, partly for fear of creating further
pressures at a sensitive time. But it is known that many small Czech
banks are struggling from high levels of bad and doubtful debts and low
margins compared to the larger banks.

Banking analysts consider the Czech Republic to be over-banked,
especially with many smaller banks failing to offer a differentiated
service and thus suffering from a lack of access to low-interest loans
and poor quality borrowers.

CZECH REPUBLIC:  CREDITANSTALT TO SELL FUND MANAGEMENT BUSINESS

AUSTRIAN BANK Creditanstalt has agreed to sell its Czech fund
management business Creditanstalt Investment Company to Czech bank
Agrobanka.

The Creditanstalt Investment Company (CAIC), which was established to
participate in the Czech Republic's privatisation programme, manages
the investment portfolios of two coupon privatisation funds,
Creditanstalt Czech Investment Fund (CCIF) and the Creditanstalt Czech
Infrastructure and Utilities Investment Fund (CCIUIF).

Creditanstalt owns 80 percent of CAIC with the rest held by local
investors who are also selling their stake. The sale should be
finalised in the next three months, according to Creditanstalt.
However, the Austrian bank will retain the money market, share funds
and pension funds business of CAIC which will be managed by
Creditanstalt Securities in Prague.

CCIF is listed on the London Stock Exchange where foreign investors
hold over 10 percent of the fund. Agrobanka has offered to buy over
these shares. When complete, Agrobanka will then own all of the shares
of the fund manager and will control the management and investments of
CCIF and CCIUIF.

Agrobanka is the fifth largest bank in the Czech Republic with 350
offices and a sizeable funds management business. Despite the sale,
Creditanstalt still maintains a considerable presence in the Czech
Republic where it has eight offices and a share in Komercni Banka.

RUSSIA REVOKED OVER 300 BANK LICENCES IN 1995

RUSSIA'S CENTRAL Bank revoked the licences of 315 banks in 1995. This
represents over 12 percent of the total number of banks operating in
the country last year.

More than 80 percent of the 2,500 commercial banks examined by the
Central Bank had also broken the law during the year. The Central Bank
also restricted the operations of 423 banks and introduced temporary
management at five banks.

The majority of suspensions happened in August when a liquidity crisis
hit the Russian banking system, crippled the domestic credit market and
brought the system to a standstill. Many banks were unable to meet
obligations on the interbank market (see EEB56). The crisis left few
banks untouched with many smaller banks in particular being badly hit.

The crisis led to a shift in the balance of forces that has affected
even top banks. It led to a serious shake-up in the banking system with
many of the top banks forging close alliances with each other.

Many of the top ten banks reacted to the crippling demise of the
interbank market by forming their own alliance, offering to resume
lending to each other in return for mutual access to financial records.

In response to the crisis, the Central Bank is planning to introduce in
March new laws which will determine how banks will be run and funded.
It has also set up a programme to identify troubled banks.

CZECH AND RUSSIAN BANKS IN JOINT VENTURE

INVESTICNI A Postivni Banka (IPB), the third largest Czech bank, has
entered into a joint venture to establish an investment bank in Russia.
The First Czech-Russian Bank was established in Moscow in a deal
between IPB and local firm Vozrozdenije Bank. IPB will hold a majority
of the $6 million of initial capital.

IPB officials said they had considered buying an established operation,
but settled instead for a joint venture with a local bank which had
complementary operations. The new bank is IPB's first joint venture
outside of the Czech Republic.

UNISYS LOSES A SECOND CONTRACT IN PRAGUE

WESTERN COMPUTER heavyweight Unisys is licking its wounds in the Czech
Republic after losing a major defence contract as its rivals raked over
the embers of its failed contract with savings bank Ceska Sporitelna.

In December Unisys won a tender to supply the Czech Army with an
integrated computer system as the country prepares for entry to NATO.
But the announcement created such a furore among competing firms that
the authorities cancelled the deal a week later.

Although the main reason was said to be the lack of compatibility of
the Unisys system with NATO systems, the army also appeared surprised
to hear about Ceska Sporitelna's experience with the computer firm.

Unisys sealed its first contract with Sporitelna in 1992 to automate
the bank's back office functions, including bookkeeping and inter-bank
transfers, and later to develop a fully integrated banking system
throughout 650 branches. But the projects were dogged by delays,
constantly changing requirements and ongoing disputes.

Sporitelna claims Unisys was using the Czech Republic as a retirement
home for low-quality staff. Unisys claims Sporitelna lacked consistent
policies and made unreasonable demands outside the terms of its
contracts. Either way, in 1995 the bank cancelled the deals and took
over training and project management, leaving Unisys with a hardware
service contract. Both claim they are owed millions of crowns by the
other.

Whatever the truth of the matter, the issue has given Unisys rivals a
major competitive weapon and left the firm scrambling to convince
locals of its capabilities.

CZECHS SIGN AGREEMENT WITH KUWAIT

THE CZECH Republic signed an investment treaty with Kuwait in early
January and is poised for a substantial boost to its search for $100
million of debt to help finance a transnational railway reconstruction
linking Poland and Austria through the Czech Republic.

Czech prime minister Vaclav Klaus toured Kuwait with 25 bankers and
businessmen as part of a general diplomatic and trade mission
throughout the Gulf. The new Czech-Kuwaiti investment treaty aims to
protect investment in the respective countries.

Elsewhere, Czech banks are preparing for an increase in business with
the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Croatia, now that a peace pact
appears likely to hold. The Czech Export Bank (CEB) and the Export
Guarantee and Insurance Company (EGAP) are both working on funding to
help support merchants and others targeting the battle-scarred zone.

Czech and Slovak businesses once had strong ties to the region, and
many expect to renew them now that the embargo on Serbia has been
lifted. Some firms are also keen to capitalise on the extensive
reconstruction and infrastructural work which will be required, with
the CEB and the EGAP hoping to help with finance and insurance.

HUNGARY SEEKS TO DELAY CROSS-BORDER BANKING

HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES want a two-year postponement of an OECD
membership requirement allowing foreign banks to open branches in the
country, according to the finance ministry.

Hungary is expected to join the OECD later this year but wants the two
year grace period to overhaul its banking sector and prepare for cross-
border banking. Hungary has already spent nearly $3 billion
restructuring and privatising banks and helping them deal with bad
loans.

RUSSIA'S MOST-BANK OPENS IN AZERBAIJAN

RUSSIA'S MOST-BANK opened a branch in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan,
at the end of December. It is the first major foreign bank to open a
branch in Azerbaijan following the Azerbaijani parliament's decision
last year to lift the restriction on foreign capital not exceeding 49
percent of the charter capital of any bank in the republic.

Most-Bank Azerbaijan will serve local and Russian exporters and finance
the construction of housing and industrial enterprises in the city. The
new branch is Most-Bank's first foreign subsidiary.

IPARBANKHAZ OF HUNGARY TO CLOSE

IPARBANKHAZ, THE state-controlled Hungarian commercial bank is to close
in February. At an extraordinary general meeting on December 29, the
bank's shareholders decided to cease banking activities by the end of
February as no buyer had been found for the bank. The state controls
over 80 percent of the bank.

EEB reported last month that the troubled commercial bank was to be
closed down after a gradual liquidation reimbursed depositors.

Iparbankhaz stopped accepting new current accounts at the end of last
November and it will cease to handle these accounts from the end of
January. The bank has asked deposit account holders to withdraw their
funds and said it will pay no interest on deposits after January 15.

Banks have been invited to submit offers for the bank's branches, and
offers will be evaluated by the end of January.

BUDAPEST BANK DEAL GOES THROUGH

GE CAPITAL, the banking and insurance arm of the US General Electric
corporation, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) purchased a combined 60 percent stake in Budapest Bank in
Hungary in late December.

The transaction has been the first bank privatisation in Hungary in
which the state sold off a majority stake to strategic investors in one
round.

The privatisation allows control of the bank's board and management to
pass from the state to the institutions's new owners. GE Capital will
have operational control of the bank, and will provide the Bank with
new financial products, technology and training.

The deal cost $87 million with GE Capital taking a 27.5 percent stake
and the EBRD acquiring 32.5 percent. In October GE Capital signed a
memorandum of agreement with the Hungarian government to carry out due
diligence of Budapest Bank as a prelude to purchasing a stake in the
bank (see EEB57).

Budapest Bank, Hungary's second bank by capital, with a comparatively
large retail network of over 74 branches, was under pressure to secure
a buyer by the end of 1995 in order to hold on to a controversial state
capital injection made prior to a failed buy-out deal earlier in the
year.

Swiss Bank Credit Suisse pulled out of a purchase deal following its
own due diligence. It is believed to have been mainly dissuaded by key
discrepancies in strategy between the two banks.

Budapest Bank declared a net profit in 1994 of HUF1.6 billion ($12.2
million), mostly due to a capital injection of HUF12 billion secretly
made by the government to shore up losses after the compulsory creation
of a HUF21 billion fund to cover bad loans. It has assets of HUF210
billion and has an image as one of the most innovative banks with
western-style management and product launches.

BANK CRISIS HITS LITHUANIA

THE LITHUANIAN banking system was plunged into crisis in the New Year
sparked by the suspension of the two of the country's commercial banks
at the end of December. The Bank of Lithuania suspended the operations
of the banks and froze their assets, accusing them of insolvency.

The two banks which had been set to merge - Litimpeks and the
Lithuanian Incorporated Innovation Bank (LAIB) - are now at the centre
of an insolvency and fraud investigation.

The reasons for the insolvency of the Lithuanian Joint-Stock Innovation
Bank and Litimpeks banks are being investigated. International audit
company Ernst & Young is performing an audit in these two banks," said
a Bank of Lithuania statement.

The suspensions and investigation have had a serious knock-on effect on
the rest of the banking sector with fears of a run on bank deposits.

On January 9, the government and the Central Bank issued a statement
saying most of the commercial banks were operating normally and
advising people to ignore rumours about the instability of certain
banks. It also urged them not to withdraw deposits from commercial
banks and said that banks were not experiencing difficulties with
payments to customers.

Reports in early January suggested that many Lithuanian commercial
banks had started to run out of hard currency as depositors rushed to
withdraw funds following the suspension of the two banks. Depositors,
fearing a devaluation of the national currency, the litas, queued at
major banks to withdraw hard currency from their accounts.

One report said the demand for US dollars increased tenfold since the
crisis broke, while another said hard currency deposits had dropped by
22 percent and individual deposits by 16 percent. But the government
and the central bank ruled out a devaluation.

However, both the Prime Minister and the President promised state aid
for personal and corporate account holders of the two suspended banks
and said the government will assume liability for their deposits.

The Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, passed a law on December 21
bringing in a mandatory insurance scheme to protect private investors
against lost bank deposits.

Lithuanian politics were also thrown into chaos by the crisis when the
foreign minister and defence minister resigned in protest against Prime
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius's move to withdraw deposits from his
accounts in the LAIB just days before its operations were suspended.

President Algirdas Brazaukas, however, refused to accept the ministers'
resignations. Slezevicius maintained he did nothing wrong and said he
would stay in office despite some calls for his resignation.

There were also calls for the resignation of Central Bank Governor
Kazys Ratkevicius. His resignation on January 9 was not accepted by the
government which felt it could cause more instability in the banking
sector. Ratkevicius rejected charges that the Central Bank had not
exercised sufficient control over the activities of commercial banks.

On January 12, a joint mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank met with the Prime Minister, the finance minister
and the chairman of the Bank of Lithuania.

Originally, the aim of the mission had been to evaluate the economic
state of the country. But following the crisis, it is now investigating
the reasons behind the problems of the two banks. Together with
officials from the Bank of Lithuania, it will prepare a programme to
overcome the difficulties in the banking system.

LITHUANIAN BANK ISSUES NEW SHARES

VILNIAUS BANKAS, Lithuania's largest private sector bank, recently
completed an international private placement of 34,000 new shares,
raising Lit17 million ($4.25 million) for the bank. The shares were
priced at Lit500 each. The funds raised are aimed at helping the bank
expand its general lending activities.

Vilniaus Bankas, which had total assets of around Lit450 million at the
end of 1995, was established in March 1990 with its head office in the
capital of Lithuania, Vilnius. It has a network of 13 branches,
primarily located in the country's urban, commercial and industrial
centres.

It was the first Lithuanian bank to introduce ATMs and banking cards
and is the sole issuer of Visa cards in Lithuania. Vilniaus Bankas is
twinned with Dutch bank ABN AMRO, which advises it in major operational
areas.

AMENDMENT TO BENEFIT INVESTMENT BANKS

THE CZECH investment market got a shot in the arm in the early New Year
with an amendment to the law on investment funds. The amendment enables
the creation of "managerial funds", which may hold majority stakes in
companies. The law, and related investment activity, is spelling a boom
for local investment banks.

Voucher privatisation funds can now be converted into more aggressive
and predatory managerial funds, but only if they buy out dissenting
privatisation fund shareholders at a price equal to or above net asset
value. That may help to reduce the massive discounts of up to 50
percent at which most privatisation funds are trading.

The amendment, approved by the Czech government in early January, is
partly in response to a sudden rise in mergers and acquisitions in the
market, which CS First Boston head of equity sales Peter Mayer called
"a feeding frenzy".

Recent corporate raids have included a $200 million shopping spree by
Bahamas-based US businessman Michael Dingman, with help from leading
Czech fund manager Viktor Kozeny, targeting a handful of blue chip
companies in late 1995 (see EEB 58). The pair were closely followed by
a flurry of stockmarket deals involving Motoinvest, a private firm
operating through Plzenska Banka and Agrobanka, both of which
Motoinvest now controls.

Motoinvest snapped up millions of discounted shares in the
privatisation funds run by the leading Czech banks, and later sold them
back at a substantial profit. Komercni Banka's fund has now swallowed a
poison pill to help prevent a similar raid in future. Motoinvest rose
to fame by buying up heavily discounted small privatisation funds and
selling their assets at a large profit.

In December, Motoinvest bought the Czech privatisation fund management
operations of Creditanstalt, one of the most popular fund managers in
the first wave of voucher privatisation. Other merger and acquisition
activity in December included a deal by leading privatisation fund
manager Ceska Sporitelna to sell 40 percent of its two voucher funds to
Bankers Trust for CK6.7 billion ($252 million) - a discount of more
than 40 percent on their net asset value.

Tomas Fiala, investment funds analyst at Czech stockbroker Wood & Co,
said the level and scope of such financial activity may eventually be
curbed by securities legislation which was proposed alongside the new
investment funds law. The government rejected details of some of the
proposals, including provisions to protect small shareholders by
setting ownership limits beyond which corporate raiders would be forced
to make a takeover bid for an entire company. Fiala said the proposals
have gone back to the drawing board but are likely to be approved by
parliament after the general election in October.

Fiala said the approved changes to the law on investment funds may
improve the impact of the post-communist privatisation process upon
Czech industry, since portfolio investors may now officially take
effective control of their investments for the first time.

Privatisation funds are prohibited from owning 20 percent of any single
company and therefore are forced to work together to achieve managerial
control of companies and effect operational changes. The concept of
active management is not universally accepted and stirred controversy
when some fund managers endeavoured to"tamper" with their investments.

Even so, privatisation investment funds own the bulk of shares in Czech
industry, and the result has been a slow start to economic reform in
the private sector. Some analysts claim the privatisation funds run by
banks, which are among the largest in the country, are especially to
blame for the lack of commercial reform, since many own shares in
companies which are major clients of the banks, and the banks exert
pressure to prevent major changes in their clients' activities.

The new draft law allows the investment fund managers to manage pension
funds for the first time. Its most likely impact is to help fund
managers reduce costs by merging their separate management teams. After
one year of pensions legislation, the major banks and insurance
companies and the leading employers have already established 35 pension
funds. Government authorities expect the total to reach a maximum of 45
before shrinking as market forces dictate rationalisation and mergers.

All funds will also face more stringent reporting requirements.
Penalties for non-compliance are also much stiffer, at a maximum of
CK10 million plus the possibility of suspension, forced administration
and the replacement of management by finance ministry regulators.

GROWTH BUT NO PROFIT FOR PENSION FUNDS

THE NUMBER of Czech pension funds topped 40 by the end of 1995 but few
are yet in profit, according to the Czech Statistical Office.

Total losses in the nine months to the end of September 1995 were CK244
million ($9.17 million), the statistics office revealed recently.
Pension revenues in the first half of 1995 were CK1.02, billion on
which the funds were reported to have lost a total of CK569 million. A
poll in June by the Factum agency found 20 percent of Czechs were
participating in pension funds and a further 21 percent were thinking
about it. A Social Affairs Ministry spokesman said the number of
participants was at the higher end of estimates. The Ministry expects
the total number of funds to reach at least 45 this year, but due to
competition and the lack of immediate profitability, the number is
expected to consolidate.

Some pension schemes have fewer than 5,000 participants, and the figure
of 100,000 participants is exceeded in only three cases: Penzijni Fond
Komercni Banky, Podnikatelsky PF and Vojensky Otvreny Fond. Komercni
Banka's fund has the largest capital base, at CK120 million, followed
by Prumyslovy PF (a subsidiary of Investicni a Postovni Banka) and
Allianz-Hypo.

HUNGARY:  THOMSON BANKWATCH ISSUES BANK RATINGS

US-BASED BANK rating and consulting agency Thomson BankWatch has
assigned intra-country issuer and local currency short-term debt
ratings to a number of banks in Hungary.

The Cental-European International Bank, the Hungarian Foreign Trade
Bank (Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank) and Unicbank are the top-ranked
banks in the country, according to the agency's ratings. Worst
performers are the Commercial and Credit Bank (Kereskedelmi Bank and
the Hungarian Credit Bank (Magyar Hitel Bank).

Last July Thomson BankWatch acquired Bank Research Eastern Europe
(BREE), a bank rating agency specialising in providing research on east
and central European financial institutions. The Hungarian ratings are
the first BREE ratings to be converted to the BankWatch scale. Intra-
country (IC) issuer ratings reflect a combination of pure credit risk
and performance risk, and offer a relative indication of the likelihood
of receiving timely repayment of principal and interest as well as an
opinion regarding the company's vulnerability to negative events that
may alter the market's perception of the bank.

The ratings use a nine-point scale ranging from IC-A for banks with
exceptionally strong fundamentals, representing low-risk, to IC-E for
banks whose viability is in doubt. The nine-point scale is IC-A, IC-
A/B, IC-B, IC-B/C, IC-C, IC-C/C, IC-D, IC-D/E, EC-E.

Short-term debt ratings apply specifically to local currency
obligations. The ratings range from LC-1, indicating a very high
likelihood that interest and principal will be paid on a timely basis,
to LC-4, which is considered speculative. The four-point scale is LC-1,
LC-2, LC-3 and LC-4.

BankWatch uses a rating methodology which involves a thorough analysis
of both financial as well as qualitative factors. Emphasis is placed on
management, market position, ownership, the local environment and
strategic initiatives. Extensive on-site due diligence is conducted on
an annual basis.

"For Hungarian banks, the environment has been extremely challenging
over the last several years. Delayed bad debt work- outs, under-
investment in modern systems and few sophisticated services in an
ineffective regulatory environment have all hampered the restructuring
process in the banking sector," explained Ramin Habibi, president of
Thomson BankWatch-BREE.

As in other eastern European countries, Hungarian state-owned banks
inherited a huge volume of bad loans from the old economic system.
Major reforms were initiated in 1987 with the introduction of a two-
tier system. However, Hungary's massive foreign debt burden held back
the state from cleaning its banks' portfolios as quickly as in
neighbouring countries. Since then, state-owned banks have been
recapitalised along BIS norms, and bad loans have been swapped for long-
term state bonds under the Loan and Consolidation schemes initiated in
1992 and completed at the end of 1994.

"While much improved, asset quality remains an issue," said Habibi.
"The fragmentation of supervisory responsibilities has impeded
effective regulations. Hungary's unique situation has given foreign and
joint-venture bonds an unprecedented opportunity to penetrate the
domestic market. Such intensified competition has fostered a new
rapidly evolving environment, with local management becoming much more
client- oriented and responsive to market needs.

"Overall, much progress has been made to establish a well- functioning
financial system - one that can operate without the support of the
government, but there still is a difficult road ahead."

THE PROSPECTS ARE GOOD

Eastern Europe, though still a drop in the ocean in terms of world
insurance premiums, is a rapidly growing market. In the first part of a
major survey, EEB reports on the state of the industry in countries of
eastern central Europe.

AFTER YEARS of reforms the turnaround in the insurance industry in
eastern Europe appears to have begun. Despite the fact that the world
market share of the region amounts to less than 1 percent and the
insurance industry is still extremely under- developed, the prospects
are good.

Clearly-defined rights of ownership and privatisation of the economy
are of the utmost importance for the insurance industry, according to a
1995 report by Economic Studies Unit of Swiss Reinsurance Company
(Swiss Re). An important indicator for progress in this area, it said,
is the private sector's share in total production which, in most
countries, rose to over 50 percent by the middle of 1994.

But, it added, insurance penetration - the proportion of income spent
on insurance policies - is still quite low throughout the region,
ranging from 3.4 percent in Slovenia to just 0.3 percent in Romania.

In Slovenia, incomes and insurance penetration stand at around half the
EU average, and in the other eastern central European countries at
about one-third. The low penetration could be attributed to the fact
that in the first few years of the changeover to a market economy,
premium income fell in most countries.

The year 1993 appears to have been a watershed for insurers in eastern
Europe. The falling rates of inflation, the economic upturn and the
turnaround to sustained real growth in premium have been having a
positive effect on the insurance industry since 1993. The volume of
premiums in the region increased by an average of 8 percent compared
with the previous year. Worldwide, growth stood at 6 percent. Premium
volume continues to grow at a faster rate than on the world market as a
whole.

The countries of eastern central Europe accounted for 62 percent of
total premium volume in 1993, with Poland the most important single
market. However, in 1994, Russia replaced Poland as eastern and central
Europe's biggest single market. But Swiss Re noted that, apart from in
Poland and Slovenia, it has not yet been possible for eastern European
countries to make up for the sharp downturn in insurance activity which
occurred in the first few years of the transition to a market economy.

Life insurance has shown the highest growth in most countries. However,
it is also exceptionally underdeveloped, accounting for just 25 percent
of premium volume in 1993 against the European Union average of 50
percent. The decline in economic activity resulting from the changeover
to a market economy affected life insurance more than it did non-life
insurance, according to Swiss Re. Only in Poland and Slovenia was there
any increase in the initially very low level of life insurance, it
said.

In 1993, the life insurance sector in eastern central Europe began to
experience strong growth. Provided inflation rates continue to fall and
there are improved investment opportunities on the developing capital
markets and tax incentives for private provision for old age, the life
insurance sector should also see above-average growth in the years
ahead as levels of prosperity rise, according to Swiss Re.

In the non-life sector, motor insurance is expected to dominate. Marine
insurance has also helped to push up growth in non-life business. But
motor insurance is expected to continue to account for 40 percent-50
percent of this sector, in line with traditional developing market
growth patterns, until rising prosperity levels make for more diverse
demand.

General third-party liability insurance is also projected to grow
significantly. Indeed, in contrast to western Europe, it could
initially outstrip personal accident and health cover, a segment
traditionally more than twice as large as liability. Agricultural
insurances, which were very prevalent when reforms began have fallen
off considerably and their importance looks set to decline even
further, especially in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

But reinsurance rather than insurance is likely to grab much of the
limelight until eastern European countries are in a position to raise
minimum capital requirements. These are still being kept precariously
low due to the structural weakness of the insurance sector and the lack
of capital.

Under these conditions, reinsurance is of the utmost importance for
safeguarding solvency, said Swiss Re, both by providing support to new
private companies during the process of growth and by helping with the
restructuring of the former monopoly companies, which often do not have
an adequate capital base.

That leaves reinsurers, especially foreign ones, in a strong position
to tap a regional market which hands over 5 percent more than the
European Union's average of 17 percent of non-life insurance to
reinsurance. Most countries are eager for foreign reinsurers to take on
the secondary insurance market that no local players are willing or
prepared to supply adequately.

The progress of the past five years has also been helped by the reforms
in the regulatory framework of the various countries and the enactment
and enforcement of supervisory laws. Different approaches have been
taken by different countries - Poland's market is highly deregulated
with emphasis on financial control and Hungary has substantive control
for all products.

It should be noted that regulations in various countries are still in a
state of flux with regulations to be passed or laws completed. The
legislators in the countries of eastern central Europe have been
strongly influenced by European Union Directives when drafting
regulatory legislation.

POLAND

Although replaced by Russia as the region's biggest single insurance
market in 1994, Poland's insurance sector continues to grow quickly.
Economic development, a decreasing level of inflation and the
progressive adjustment of legal regulations to EU directives create
good opportunities for the insurance sector, according to corporate
finance and advisory services firm Ernst & Young in Warsaw.

Among the 41 insurance companies licensed to run insurance businesses
in Poland, 13 are conducting life business with the remainder running
non-life business.

In 1993, the Polish market represented 27 percent of the total premium
collected in eastern Europe. In 1994 all insurance companies jointly
collected a gross premium equal to ZL4.15 billion ($1.75 billion) - 33
percent more than in 1993.

In the first half of 1995 the gross premium collected in the life
business increased by 40 percent more in comparison with the first half
of 1994, while the gross premium of the non-life business was 21
percent more.

In 1994, almost 70 percent of premiums were accounted for by general
business with the remainder accounted for by life business.

At the beginning of the 1990s, the development of the life products
market was rather slow due to high inflation, low average real wages
and the marginal size of the middle classes.

The majority of the Polish population had one cheap group life
insurance with a very limited level of protection. However, Poland's
life insurance industry enjoyed dramatic growth in 1993 and 1994. Life
insurance premiums collected in 1994 were approximately 45 percent
higher than in 1993 and amounted to around $0.6 billion.

Taking into account that inflation was at 32 percent in 1994, this
represents a real increase of about 13 percent. In 1994 the main areas
of growth were in group life policies. PZU, the state- owned insurance
company which still dominates the Polish market, collected premiums
amounting to $500 million, although its market share decreased to 95
percent.

In the first half of 1995, PZU's market share reduced further to 90.3
percent, losing out to foreign insurers Commercial Union (5.2 percent),
Amplico (3.9 percent), AGF (0.4 percent) and Nationale-Nederlanden (0.1
percent).

The continuing development of the life insurance market will depend on
the level of economic growth, inflation trends and changes in the
social security system and income tax policy, according to Ernst &
Young. The following factors will determine the development of the life
insurance market in the coming years.

1. Unfavourable personal tax treatment of life products. However, the
regulation introduced this year allowed the companies to consider life
insurance premiums for the first time (paid on behalf of employees) as
company costs. Life insurance premiums will not be tax deductible in
the short and medium term unless an aggressive lobbying campaign is
conducted.

2. Further postponement of the social security reform since 1990. In
April 1995, the Council of Ministries presented the draft of the Social
Security Act with a new pension system (consisting of a state pension,
a social insurance pension and a voluntary pension plan).
Realistically, a programme for social security reform could be prepared
and approved in 1996. This programme will definitely not be "a shock
therapy", but rather a step-by- step approach, explained Ernst & Young.
Regulation concerning close-end funds and pension funds have also been
drafted and will be passed and implemented in 1996. This may start
benefiting the life insurance market by 1997 or 1998.

3. VAT on insurance agents' services was implemented in 1995 and had a
big impact on agents' incomes. Under pressure from the insurance lobby,
tax decreased to 7 percent until the end of 1995. The tax rate for 1996
is still unknown.

4. The monopoly of PZU and state protectionism. In June 1994, the
Ministry of Finance accepted a plan presented by the management of PZU
for its privatisation without turning to the EBRD for a $200 million
loan designated to boost the company's reserves. Under the plan, the
Ministry opted to split the PZU into two separate companies. But
following the change in government at the end of 1995, it was decided
not to split the PZU, but to leave the company intact and privatise it
in 1996 through the sale of shares to employees, individual investors
and carefully selected institutional investors.

5. Low confidence in the financial institutions among the Polish
population. Such an attitude was the result of Polish private banks and
private insurance companies going bankrupt.

Ernst & Young said that the economic growth of 1994 points to the
resilience of the recovery which was initiated in mid-1992. The
economic mechanisms launched a guarantee that the rate of economic
growth will be kept at 4.5 percent in the 1990s and long-term inflation
is showing a gradual downward trend.

The annual inflation rate which was 32 percent in 1994 is expected to
fall to 10 percent in 1999. Therefore, it can be expected that the
development of the life insurance market will accelerate in the coming
years, said Ernst & Young.

Foreign insurers may not open branches in Poland until 1999. However,
they may set up separate companies, in full accordance with Polish law,
and/or enter into joint ventures with Polish partners. Despite local
companies facing technical problems, a lack of qualified personnel and
limited solvency, a number of foreign companies are approaching the
market.

The most popular distribution channel is the own distribution network,
a regional level structure, with branches and sub- branches or
representative offices. The number of independent brokers and agents is
growing, with around 600 brokers now licensed in the country.

According to Ernst & Young, co-operation between different insurance
companies and Polish banks is expected to grow with the increasing
acceptance of the idea of bancassurance and the fact that most of the
foreign companies created joint-ventures with Polish banks when they
entered the Polish market.

A law on insurance activities was passed in July 1990. However, due to
the rapid development of the market, much-needed changes were
implemented with the Insurance Act in October 1995. Ernst & Young said
that these changes had the following objectives:

* Increase the compatibility to EU directives;

* Better protection of the insured by increasing the financial
requirements of companies applying for an insurance licence as well
existing insurers. In particular, the share capital for insurers
entering the market, should equal the minimum guarantee capital
(Ecu800,000 for life business or Ecu200,000-Ecu400,000)

* Increasing and clearly defining the power of insurance supervision
which will control insurers, brokers and agents. An independent Office
of Insurance Supervision (OIS) will be established. At present,
insurance supervision is part of the Ministry of Finance.

* Re-drafting all the provisions unclear in the former insurance law -
in particular, the licensing rules for new insurers and requirements
with respect to actuaries will be described in more detail.

* Clearly defining the rights and obligations of insurance brokers.
These provisions are based on recent EU directives.

The Ministry of Finance must issue a licence for a company to set up an
insurance business. A company may not issue both life and non-life
policies. Neither can they engage in other non-insurance business. They
can only operate as joint-stock or mutual companies.

There are strict guidelines regulating reserve capital, contingency
funds compensation in the case of a lack of compulsory insurance (like
motor vehicle third party liability, fire insurance for farmers' real
estate, farmers' civil liability). The assets may be invested only in
approved instruments, with some limitation to the portfolio's
composition.

According to Ernst & Young, the Polish Finance Ministry which, for the
moment, supervises the insurance sector, is to press for a
strengthening of the capital base of Polish insurance companies. In
order to prepare domestic companies for direct foreign competition in
the domestic market after 1999, foreign companies who want to enter the
Polish market are strongly encouraged to merge with small Polish
insurance companies.

HUNGARY

The Hungarian parliament passed a new insurance law in 1995 which came
into effect on January 1 this year. All newcomers to the insurance
market must set up separate life and non-life companies. The 14
existing insurance companies will not be forced to establish new
companies but will be obliged to clearly separate accounting and
management structures for each sector.

Insurance companies will also face new minimum capital requirements
with the introduction of the distinction between organisational and
security capital, distinguishing between operational and business
commitments.

The new legislation also modifies the supervisory environment,
eliminating the need for permits for non-life products. The existing
State Insurance Supervision (ABIF) agency's remit will cover ensuring
compliance with legislation, rights protection for insurance company
clients, monitoring of applications by insurers and supervision of
companies' financial status and investment procedures.

Life insurance start-ups must continue to obtain permits for their
products and have initial security capital of at least HUF250 million
($1.8 million). New non-life operations will be required to have
security capital of at least HUF150 million and up to HUF70 million
more for certain categories of product.

Although foreign insurers are admitted only by the establishment of
subsidiary companies or through participation, the market is dominated
by outsiders.

Allianz is reportedly in negotiations with state privatisation agency
APV to sell the German group the remaining 9.2 percent public stake in
local non-life leader Hungaria. Allianz has already built up a 90
percent holding in Hungaria, which own 0.8 percent of its own stock.

CZECH REPUBLIC

The implementation of a new insurance law has been in the pipeline for
some time as the current law dates back to May 1991. In any new law,
solvency regulations are intended to be in accordance with European
Union directives.

Insurance penetration in the Czech Republic is around 2.5 percent and
like other eastern central European countries is growing. Motor
liability and occupational accident insurance is compulsory.

There are no limits on the establishment of foreign insurers but cross-
border services are not permitted. Germany's Allianz and Italy's
Generali both denied speculation recently that they were interested in
becoming strategic investors in the Czech insurance giant Ceska
Pojistovna in which private fund manager PPF (Privni Privatizacni Fond)
recently bought a 12 percent stake.

Both already have domestic Czech insurance operations which although
much smaller are more flexible and able to target the most profitable
sectors of the market.

PPF bought its 12 percent stake from Ceska Sporitelna, the former
monopoly state savings bank at the end of 1995 and is negotiating with
Interbanka, the Hungarian-owned Czech merchant bank, over its 7 percent
stake in the insurer.

PPF claimed it was a long-term investor and denied it was acting for a
third party. But analysts of the insurance industry say PPF is unlikely
to hold its stake for long, but may want to build a sizeable position
and find a strategic investor.

Although Ceska Pojistovna is losing market share as the number of
competitors swells, it still claims more than 70 percent of the main
sectors such as life and motor insurance, and its revenues are growing.
It has raised motor premiums substantially and is lobbying hard for an
overhaul of the compulsory third party sector, in which it is the sole,
reluctant provider.

Analysts also point to substantial reserves of more than CK64 billion
($2.4 billion) and numerous other activities such as fund management as
likely magnets for an investor or strategic partner, either local or
foreign.

Elsewhere, Czech health insurers were forced to reassess their budgets
in December after most had their business plans for 1996 rejected by
the government.

Only five of 27 insurers got a clean bill of health under a tough new
government fitness regime. In an effort to spruce up the industry, the
government has demanded that health insurers make more realistic income
forecasts and keep administration costs under 7 percent of revenues.

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus estimated that seven of the rejected
insurers should have no trouble getting in shape by their second
attempt in January, but that still leaves 15 insurers on the critical
list.

As a result, a rash of mergers is likely to break out among the smaller
funds. But such mergers will not be easy, due to a list of problems
including long-standing debts to hospitals and doctors and difficulties
winning projected volumes of clientele.

"The system has many childhood diseases," said Frantisek Beranek,
general director of insurer Vojenska Pojistovna, referring to the fact
that the first health fund was established only in 1993. Vojenska had
its own plans rejected, but Beranek was confident of winning on appeal
after its accountants gave it a more thorough check-up.

The insurers' woes reflect the dismal state of the Czech health
industry, beset by increasingly volatile labour relations and blatant
over-billing by under-paid doctors. Insurers owe more than CK5 billion
to health providers. But even if they can pay their bills, they are
often too busy investigating claims of unnecessary treatment by doctors
who are paid per consultation.

Challenging claims is the insurers' responsibility and their only
chance to improve profitability in an industry where both premiums and
the cost of services are set by the government.

Czech health sector costs have risen from 5 percent of GDP in 1992 to
the current level of 8 percent and the government is struggling to find
a solution. It is considering a range of plans including mandating a
single agency to collect all revenues and limiting the scope of all
other insurers to offering only supplementary medical services.

If the government does choose radical surgery, the quickest recovery
may be made by the General Health Insurance Company. It was the first
to start business and it now insures 6.7 million people - well over
than half of the country.

SLOVAKIA

Insurance operations in Slovakia are governed by the insurance law of
December 1990 which was implemented in March 1991. Changes to the law
are expected to bring solvency regulations in line with EU directives.
Branch separation is planned for life and non-life businesses.

The minimum capital required to set up a non-life insurer is SK20
million-SK30 million ($672,429 - $1,008,640) and SK50 million for life
insurers. There have been no limitations on the participation or
establishment of foreign insurers since the beginning of 1992. However,
higher deposits are required for foreign establishments. Cross-border
services are not permitted. Supervision is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Finance.

SLOVENIA

A new insurance law, based on earlier German and Austrian legislation,
was passed in October 1995. This succeeded a law which had been in
operation since mid November 1994. However, further changes will be
needed to bring Slovenian law in line with European Union regulations.

"This law should last for about two or three years, but it must change
to open the market and align it with the EU. But Slovenian insurers are
still not prepared for competition," explained Dr Miro Koncina of ITEO
management consultants in Ljubljana.

Under the law, a guarantee fund has been established for insurance
companies consisting of DM1.5 million ($1.04 million) for life insurers
and the same for property casualty insurers. Supervision is carried out
by the Ministry of Finance. There is no branch separation between life
and non-life business, although separate accounting is required.

Majority participation by foreign insurers is possible, although this
is not the case in reinsurance companies. Foreign insurers must be
registered in Slovenia to operate there and cannot sell products from
abroad into the country.

Insurance penetration, while quite low by European Union standards, is
the highest in eastern central Europe at around 3 percent-4 percent or
DM800 million-DM900 million in premium volume. The market is continuing
to grow strongly, according to Koncina, but needs to reach a premium
volume of DM1.5 billion.

He concedes that the process of changing people's attitudes is
difficult. "The difficulty is that people are still waiting for state
social insurance," he said."We are in transition. We have a middle
class with money. We must spread this capital and this involves
changing tradition and culture. It is a process and it is changing."

The proximity of Slovenia to EU countries like Italy, Germany and
Austria is making this process of education easier, he said.

Former state monopolies still hold around 60 percent of the total
insurance market with the rest held by small independent companies and
joint ventures between Western and local firms.

In the second part of the insurance survey EEB will report on the
markets of Bulgaria and Romania, and Russia, Ukraine and Estonia.

FEELING AT HOME

It has been a hard five years, but western accounting firms are
starting to get used to working in Poland. David Porter reports

IT IS more than five years since the Big Six arrived in Poland, and
only now are they beginning to feel at home. Resistance from clients to
western fees seems to be easing, and hitherto frosty relations with the
local Chamber of Auditors may be starting to thaw.

Not that Poland has suddenly become an easy place in which to do
business. Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keeping
control of that growth and turning it into profits is a different
matter.

Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,
the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, with
fiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking even
currently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according to
managing partner Duleep Aluwihare.

"We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some of
our more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage to
continue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,
we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run out
of investment opportunities."

Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one of
the few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although it
plans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice or
Cracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In order
to set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going to
maintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve in
this marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.

This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,
but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticket
items," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basic
work, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.

Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,
Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clients
include Poland's finance ministry.

Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.
Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrand
and Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived in
Poland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess when
the firm should start making a profit.

Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking last July before returning
to the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We're not just
here for a financial return on investment, we're here to make sure that
Coopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."

C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking at
opening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.

Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of the
market, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,
Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firm
has acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bank
and of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successes
include the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which
raised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing group
Okocim.

PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgeted
to start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,
the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After five
years in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-national
company investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growth
is running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.

PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where the
firm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clients
include Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.
One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatised
Bank Gdanski.

Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some time
are KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche.

"We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner Bill
Drysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where we
are largely self-sufficient."

Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at Barents
Group, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of new
clients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firm
recently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run its
German practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have a
fully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said.
"Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."

KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics group
Siemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polish
clients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,
Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurance
companies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices in
Cracow and Poznan during the last year.

At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits gets
short shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm has
always been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financial
support from outside, other than very small amounts. All the other
firms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they have
X amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.
They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."

In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440
employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of its
rivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw and
Szczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is a
headache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line.

"Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It's
difficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated into
a corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standards
right way."

E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as much
business as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when it
hired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &
Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.

Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T.
"These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speak
only with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Often
you'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,
all the rest will follow."

The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in the
Polish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is the
smallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strong
position in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firm
took action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz as
head of the Polish business. Leslaw Paga was head of the Polish
Securities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.

Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is sure
that Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitely
enhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said.
"There have been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."

Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its position
in Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industries
and service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong position
in financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say we
were latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"
he explained.

Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bank
and of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's 64-
percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in the
banking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3
million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.

D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk and
Cracow during 1995.

Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.
Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four other
mid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co- ordinating
partner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "the
sort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging with
another firm.

He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name the
prospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to another
network. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we are
looking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with a
heavy UK or English language capability," he said.

Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switched
international affiliations from CKL International to Alliott Peirson
International during 1995. Baltic Accountants continues to also
represent RSM International and GMN International.

The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issue
for many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firms
like to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to local
clients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing in
Polish equity partners than others.

Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firm
holding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and US
affiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has been
given the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, while
KPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or
"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.

According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managed
firm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly-owned by Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent from
the start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the local
practices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."

Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agree
that fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gap
between what western firms are charging and what local clients are
willing to pay is narrowing.

One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment must
pay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet the
market half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper local
firms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it first
arrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.
Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in
"strategic situations".

Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of a
western-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came into
effect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accounting
procedures more into line with International Accounting Standards and
to move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on tax
compliance.

Another area where western accountants are making more encouraging
noises is in relations between the international firms and the local
Chamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when the
chamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.
Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted to
the chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners that
Poland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shutting
new blood out of the profession.

Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences being
mended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciak
said. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of course
there will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.
Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bit
frightening to them."

While the situation regarding audit training and exams remains
unacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamber
will rethink its approach.

Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous in
admitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems to
have gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably be
reviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said.
"And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."

After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all part
of the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make sure
the chamber is a strong and active body."

Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and that
the growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feels
that this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We all
experience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."

ATM SURCHARGING TOP EFT ISSUE OF 1996

     Automated teller machine (ATM) surcharges will dominate the
electronic banking industry during the next 12 months, industry
experts unanimously agreed in interviews with EFT.
     Sources predict non-discriminatory ATM surcharges will be the
banking issue of 1996 as financial services providers try aggressively
to reap profits from alternative delivery methods.
     No national EFT network allowed its members to surcharge prior to
1996.  However, 14 state legislatures passed laws prohibiting such
restrictions.
     Visa's PLUS ATM network will allow its members to surcharge on
April 1, 1996, and many regional EFT networks have lifted their
surcharge bans. 
     MasterCard's Cirrus network has not lifted its surcharge ban and
a company spokesperson said it does not plan to change its position.
     The Wilmington, Del.-based MAC EFT network, the second-largest
regional network in the  country, said last month that it will allow
surcharging in 1996.

Competitive Pressure

     Many financial institutions and other third-party ATM owners such
as Plano, Texas-based EDS and Dallas-based Affiliated Computer
Services, claim they cannot support the cost of placing ATMs in low-
volume transaction areas without a surcharge.  However, consumer
groups say surcharging is just another means for banks to add to their
record profits.
     The networks receive no money from the surcharge.  Surcharge
revenue goes directly to the ATM owner.  Banks claim they need
surcharges to compete with third-party ATM owners such as EDS and
Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), which negotiate contracts with
casinos and malls.  
     Some bank executives said EDS and ACS can outbid financial
institutions for these contracts because they offer the retailers a
cut of the surcharge.
     "A lot of pressure is on banks to surcharge even if they are
philosophically opposed to it," said Joseph Pendleton III, senior vice
president of electronic banking for Wyomissing, Pa.-based Meridian
Bank.  "If they don't [surcharge], they will not be able to manage an
off-premise program with significant value."

Who Wants the Surcharges?

     The non-financial ATM owners are not so sure financial
institutions are really opposed to surcharges. 
     One ATM owner suggested banks may be hiding behind the third-
party ATM owners to avoid public outrage.
     "We are in favor of surcharging and believe it will give us the
ability to deploy more ATMs," said T.A. "Kip" Hyde Jr., a director of
EFT development for ACS.  "As far as people like us and EDS pushing
it, that is not entirely true.  Banks are learning that in off-premise
ATM sites, there is only a certain [limit] to the expenses you can
bury in marketing costs."
    ACS surcharges range from $.50 at convenience stores to $2 at
casinos in its 4,100-ATM MoneyMaker Network.  EDS charges from $.25 to
$1 at approximately 10 percent of its 5,800 ATMs, according to company
spokesperson Carol Winters.
    Consumer interest groups don't believe the claim that remote ATMs
cost too much to run.  "Banks are already able to save billions in
teller and branch costs with ATMs and they are already generating
billions in fees," said Janice Shields, a banking researcher for the
Washington, D.C.-based Center for the Study of Responsive Law (CSRL). 
"Now, we are just adding more profit to the top."
    According to the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) -- an
affiliate of CSRL -- ATM transactions generated more than $2.55
billion in fees, while saving banks $2.34 billion in teller costs in
1993, the last year for which such figures have been compiled.  The
CFA claims more than $.78 in profits was generated for every dollar
collected from consumers for ATM services.
    With consumers being charged for using an ATM not owned by their
bank and then having a surcharge added on top of that, shouldn't the
industry be concerned that transaction volumes will decrease?
    The majority of the machines with surcharges exceeding $1 will be
placed in areas where the consumer desperately needs the money and
will pay for convenience, ATM owners said.  For example, highway rest
areas and casinos present prime surcharging opportunities.

A Transaction Drop?

    New Orleans-based GulfNet EFT Network has allowed its members to
levy surcharges because the Louisiana and Mississippi legislatures
overruled the mandate of the national networks.  However, Del
Tonguette, president of GulfNet, said transaction volume has not been
affected by the surcharges. 
    Nearly 87 percent of GulfNet's 4,000 ATMs carry member surcharges
and Tonguette said pricing has not been an issue.  He claims setting a
fair and equitable surcharge is easily determined by the consumer. 
ATM owners who charge too much will quickly lose transaction volume.
    "I am gratified to see at least Visa has seen the light.  One
prediction that I can make is that MasterCard and all of its
subsidiaries will follow suit," said Tonguette, who has been a staunch
proponent of surcharging.
    The MAC Network, which is owned by Wilmington, Del.-based
Electronic Payment Services (EPS), admits it is not exactly sure what
effect surcharging will have on transaction volume, but it does not
believe it will inhibit growth.
    "A lot of discussion and consideration [went into our decision],"
said Barbara Link, an EPS spokesperson.  "It is difficult to say
exactly what surcharging will mean.  Certainly, the banks would like
to have a lot of say [in determining whether surcharging is prudent]."
    Reston, Va.-based Electronic Funds Transfer Association (EFTA)
has not taken a position on surcharging because it claims members are
divided on the topic.  Consequently, the EFTA has not lobbied any of
the national or regional networks to lift the surcharge bans.   
However, Kurt Helwig, executive director of the EFTA, said EDS has
vocally supported surcharging, while other financial institutions have
opposed it.  Helwig understands both sides of the argument:  "This is
yet another issue we cannot take a position on.  [However,] to date,
studies have shown consumers are willing to pay for convenience ...
[But] ATM owners have to be smart about pricing because the consumer is
going to decide this marketplace."

Government Intervention

    As banks begin to learn how much consumers will pay for the
convenience of remote ATM services, it appears ATM owners will not
have to worry about scrutiny from Capitol Hill.  According to Shields
of the CSRL, "consumers don't exactly have a good Congress for
[surcharge reform] now.  It is not a good legislative climate to tap
ATM fees."
    The CSRL is working with representatives in Washington to draft
legislation that would require disclosure of fees before a transaction
is completed.
    Despite the push for surcharges, fees are not the only answer to
increasing ATM installation and maintenance costs.  EDS's Winters said
ATM owners can lower their costs by offering more services, such as
stamps, event tickets, calling card vouchers and travelers checks. 
These services can require the bulk of the surcharges, while ATM
activity is left relatively untouched.  (Kurt Helwig, EFTA, 703/435-

PROPRIETARY SMART CARD PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE STEADY GROWTH IN 1996

Smart cards will continue to gain market share this year, but their
growth still will fall short of the explosion enthusiasts seek. 
Millions of smart cards will be issued this year; however, the
majority of them will be used in closed systems such as college
campuses or large business headquarters, according to Basil Bromberg,
president of Dallas-based smart-card consultancy Smart Cards USA.
    "The big open systems are all waiting for a bank to issue [smart]
cards," said Bromberg.  "Niche systems will develop more quickly. 
After that, the shared smart card will [arrive].  For instance, a
transportation industry may link with a school [identification card]
where the [bus company] can buy some of the memory on the I.D. and the
kids can use the card to pay for the bus."

Sports Stored Value

    The eyes of the financial services industry will be on the
Visa/First Union smart card pilot at the Atlanta Summer Olympics this
summer.  Visa and First Union plan to launch more than 1 million smart
cards in an open system pilot.
    Bromberg called the pilot a glorified closed project.  "It is
only a large- scale show, really," said Bromberg.  "It is an access
card.  It is nice.  It is no great brainstormer.  The trouble is that
once the Olympics are over, all you have is a souvenir."
    It is easier for the banks to see the profitability of a closed
system at this point in the smart card's development.  The bank would
make money in a proprietary system by sponsoring the transaction
handling and money transfer.
    The specialized sport stored-value card, as employed by the
National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars, will continue to gain
momentum.  The Jaguars have issued stored value cards that can only be
used inside the stadium to purchase refreshments or souvenirs.
    "That is going to take off like a rocket," said Joseph Pendleton
III, senior vice president of electronic banking at Wyomissing, Pa.-
based Meridian Bank.  (Basil Bromberg, Smart Cards USA, 214/991-6502;

NYCE ATM NETWORK BUILDS HOME BANKING PLATFORM

The NYCE EFT network said it is ready to expand into home banking and
take advantage of the largest single opportunity for EFT transaction-
building.  As a result, it could pose a challenge to industry
mainstays MasterCard, Online Resources, Servantis and Visa.
    NYCE, the largest EFT provider in the Northeast and a subsidiary
of Hackensack, N.J.-based Infinet Payment Services, invested at least
$2 million in creating a bank-branded home banking and electronic
commerce services platform, according to NYCE President and CEO
Richard Yanek.
    The main goal of the platform is to create a single interface for
NYCE members to access customer financial institution information from
any personal financial management (PFM) software product and any
access device.
    Without NYCE or another commercial interface, if a bank wants to
allow its customers to use PFM software from Intuit's Quicken, Meca's
Managing Your Money or Microsoft Money, the institution must build a
separate interface to each vendor.  NYCE will manage the interfaces
and act as a translator so the bank's customer information will look
the same regardless of the customer's means of access.
    Three to four institutions of various sizes will begin piloting
the NYCE product in the second quarter of 1996, Yanek said.  The
product should be commercially available to NYCE's 1,200 member
institutions by the end of 1996.  
    "We tend to think of this [product] as a transporter translator,"
said Yanek.  "What comes through to the bank [is the same no matter
what the PFM software].  We already have the pipeline [to the banks]. 
And, very importantly, think of the cost of implementing such a
system.  We are spending a substantial amount of money.  But it is
minuscule compared to what an institution would have to spend
individually."
    NYCE is negotiating with "all of the providers on the market
today," Yanek said.
    New York-based MasterCard, Reston, Va.-based Online Resources,
Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis and San Francisco-based Visa started
similar home banking "translation" software in the last 12 months. 
However, Yanek claims NYCE's system will be the only one to be both
on-line and interactive.

A Change in Branding Philosophy

    All NYCE EFT products carried the NYCE brand prior to home
banking.  Yanek said NYCE has decided to allow the institutions to
brand their home banking offerings.
    "With services of this kind, the consumer is operating within the
bank.  They are working directly with the bank," said Yanek.  "Hence,
there is no need for the NYCE logo.  That contrasts with what exists
on the marketplace today.  When you sign on with Quicken, you see a
roster of all of the Quicken banks.  It is counterproductive.  When
customers sign on, they want to see or hear the name of their bank."
    What NYCE loses in name recognition, it could gain in transaction
volume and licensing fees.  
    Yanek predicts that home banking transactions will build
gradually, and by the end of the century, each home banking household
will complete approximately 24 transactions per month.  Currently,
each ATM cardholder performs an average of one transaction per month.
    In addition, NYCE plans to license and offer equity in the
product to other large EFT networks.  Yanek said preliminary
discussions have begun, but don't expect small networks to join the
home banking mix just yet.
    "Small networks will not venture unless it is free-ride," said
New Orleans- based GulfNet EFT Network President Del Tonguette. 
"Offering home banking is fine with me as long as [someone else] pays
for the expensive startup."
    Omaha, Neb.-based bill-payment provider SmartPay paid all of the
communications and hookup costs to link GulfNet member banks Hancock
Bank and Jefferson Guarantee.  The increased transaction volume at
these two banks has been negligible, according to Tonguette. 
    Tonguette, however, believes home banking will be a very small
piece of the action through the rest of this century for his company's
277 financial institution members.
    The future of home banking could be here for large networks like
NYCE.  Before creating the home banking platform, NYCE surveyed its
top 25 banks in addition to 125 other members of various sizes, asking
them to set their priorities from a list of 27 possible product
offerings.
    Home banking and bill payment services were highest on the
request list from the top 25 banks and second on the list for the
remaining banks surveyed.  At the top of their list was enhanced ATM
services.
    Financial institutions also want their customers not only to
complete conventional home banking transactions but also to have
access to financial periodicals and the Internet.
    "The reality is that [consumers and banks] are desiring something
more than home banking," said Yanek.  "A better term is 'electronic
financial commerce.'  We see a need for something more than a simple
set of transactions."  (Del Tonguette, GulfNet, 504/643-5070; Dick
Yanek, NYCE Network, 201/488-6111.)

DIEBOLD EXPANDING INTO ATM MAINTENANCE

     Diebold no longer sells only automated teller machines (ATMs). 
The Canton, Ohio-based company is producing and selling ATM management
software to avoid any loss of revenue if the ATM market becomes
saturated and profits flatten.
     Many EFT sources predict new ATM sales could decrease sharply
over the next 5 to 10 years.
     Interbold, Diebold's ATM joint venture with IBM, holds 55 percent
of the U.S. ATM market.
     Diebold took its first step into the ATM software management
arena at last month's Bank Administration Institute (BAI) Retail
Delivery Conference (RDC) in Atlanta.  Diebold and its partner,
Optical Data Systems of Richardson, Texas, have created a new
networking solution for client-server systems.
     The local area network (LAN) hub and ATM-driving software allows
banks to download programs and change ATM screens in seconds, said
Harry Bosch, Diebold business development manager.
     The system can help banks increase uptime because ATMs will not
have to be down as long for changes.  It also can save bank personnel
costs because it eliminates the need to change programs and screens by
"sneakernet" -- employees visiting each machine to load software, he
said.
    Additionally, banks can improve marketing efforts because the
system allows targeted screen changes, Bosch said.  For example, if a
bank wanted to run a promotion involving a certain chain of grocery
stores, the 50-or-so ATMs at that chain can be loaded with a
specialized screen, he added.
    In the security arena, Diebold also released an event management
system.  The software will identify ATM device failures, analyze the
situation, open a trouble ticket and determine the proper course of
action without human intervention.  It sends faxes to the owner-bank
or beeps a service representative, Bosch said.
    InterBold displayed many of its updated machines at the RDC.  The
machines can read and cash checks, print courtesy amounts and give
change.  Updated ATMs also can dispense checkbooks, stamps and
tickets.  Interbold's most advanced technology was demonstrated in its
MicroBranch, a sit-down kiosk with touch-screen monitors, dual
telephone handsets and videoconferencing.  The outside walls of the
kiosk change from clear to cloudy when occupied for privacy.
    Diebold has the right idea in enhancing and expanding its ATM
product line, said Megan Robertson, a Smith Barney analyst:  "ATMs are
commodity products, so this is a value-added product.  That's the
right stuff."
    Competitor Fujitsu ICL offers similar enhancements and AT&T's
newest machines offer coupon-printing capabilities.

S2 SYSTEMS AND ATM MONITORING

  S2 Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stratus Computer Inc.,
recently released an automated, integrated automated teller machine
(ATM) information and monitoring system (AIMS).  The system was
developed with Richardson, Texas-based ProAmerica Systems Inc.  The
two companies integrated Dallas-based S2's ON/2 electronic banking
software with ProAmerica's help desk software -- Service Call
Management (SCM).  Now, when an ATM system failure or network
breakdown occurs, ON/2 sends an alarm message to SCM.  SCM then
processes, logs and transmits the information, notifying a technician
via digital pager, fax, E-mail or voice system.  SCM also creates a
Technical Assistance Request (TAR) and records the transaction for
network and system analysis.  Using a touch-tone telephone, field
technicians can access their individual problem lists and change the
status of items, or TARs, on the lists by using personal
identification numbers assigned to each technician.  (Susan Kemp, S2
Systems, 214/458-3887.)

NEW PRODUCTS HELP BANKS INCREASE CONSUMER ACCESS

    Smart card holders now can use a portable smart card reader --
the size of a key chain -- to view balance information, according to
software and hardware supplier Oki America Inc.
    The Advanced Products Division (OAPD) of the Marlborough, Mass.-
based company released the Value Checker Balance Reader (BR).  The
personal smart card reader allows consumers to verify balances on
electronic purse smart cards or pre-paid phone cards.
    In addition, the Value Checker BR can display such other
information stored on cards as health care data, identification
numbers and electronic benefit transfer values.  The Value Checker BR
will be commercially available in the first quarter of 1996.
    The new product is an extension of Oki's Value Checker product
line.  Oki released the Value Checker Card Protector (CP) in April
1995.  (Wes Shimanek, Oki America, 508/460-8776.) 

World Wide Web Access

    Meanwhile, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Edify Corp. released its
Electronic Workforce 4.0 interactive services software product last
month.  The software allows companies to launch interactive services
quickly and cheaply via standard World Wide Web (WWW) browsers.
    Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp. already has purchased Workforce
4.0 to create and deliver interactive human resources applications for
its employees.  Financial institutions can use the software to create
direct customer access to account information.
    Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union Corp. and Richmond, Va.-based
Signet Bank both are using Workforce 4.0 to deploy WWW banking
applications.  
    Pricing is based on volume.  However, general pricing for the
Electronic Workforce 4.0 starts at $10,000 and solutions offering Web
capabilities begin at $40,000.  (Jan Hames, Edify Corp., 408/982-

TSB SIGNS CROSS-BORDER DEALS ON THE CONTINENT

TSB BANK, the UK's eight largest retail bank, has concluded contractual
arrangements with Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) and Banque Francaise
du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), which will give the German and French
banks access to the UK clearing system, for low-value cross-border
payments. Developments are already under way to make the link two-way.

Manus Fullerton, head of TSB International, said the deal will allow
WestLB and BFCE to make payments to British beneficiaries, while
complying with the proposed EC directive on cross-border payments.

"We are able to fulfil this contract using our existing technology,
which is seen by our European partners as offering significant benefits
in building a pan-European payments network," he said. "The other
factors which came into play were service levels and price . . . The
combination of TSB's proprietary systems and SWIFT's solution for bulk
data transfer (IFT) has allowed us to develop an innovative and
attractive product."

WestLB, in turn, has been nominated by the German savings banks as
their agent for sending payments to the UK. At the moment, TSB has set
a limit of #10,000 ($15,600) for transfers to the UK, while WestLB has
a limit of DM5,000 ($3,200) for payments to Germany.

Alan Gibson, international services manager of TSB's Edinburgh- based
international division, said: "There are some technological
developments taking place to establish our links, so I would not like
to say how much it will cost. We are happy with the investment made due
to the service benefits for our customers and the steps we are taking
towards meeting EU legislation."

"We see an expansion of cross-border payments, both within the EU and
further afield. The proposed EU directive on cross-border payments,
which will insist on small payments being made more cheaply and faster,
is a challenge which we have anticipated for some time," Fullerton
said.

TSB is discussing similar arrangements with a number of other banks in
Europe and further afield. "The cross-border payments system is
continuing to evolve. This process will develop and gain momentum.
Customers will see benefits in terms of improved levels of service,
greater product choice and reduced cost", Fullerton added.

"We are happy with the transfer arrangements", Wolfgang Grauer, manager
of international payments at WestLB, told EPI. "We chose TSB because
they are a well-known bank and we have already worked with them in
international payments. Since mid-December we have been sending mass
payments and it works. Volume is slowly growing."

UNITED STATES:  FEDWIRE TO UPGRADE IN 1997

THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors has expanded the format for
Fedwire funds transfers to be more compatible with the comprehensive
formats used outside the US. It has also pushed back implementation
deadlines to the end of 1997, a year later than previously discussed.

In addition to a longer timetable, the Fed last month opted for
staggered-date phase-in, with separate deadlines for send and receive
capabilities. The Fed rejected having all banks switch on the same day,
fearing that with 11,000 banks the risk of disruption to the system was
too great. "We did not believe it was practical to do a one-day
cut-over due to our large size," said Louise Roseman, associate
director of the reserve bank operations and payment systems division.

The Board ruled that all banks must be ready to receive the new format
by May 1997 and to send by the end of December. A small number of banks
will be authorised for same-day change over.

Expanding the format was first recommended by a task force of the
American Bankers' Association, though bankers acknowledged that the
costs of conversion will be very high. The greatest disagreement has
been over how and when to implement the changes. The expanded format
will permit banks to include the names and addresses of transfer
originators and beneficiaries, which are also required under new
Treasury regulations.

As a result, the format of Fedwire transfers will be more consistent
with those used by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication (SWIFT) and the Clearing House for Interbank Payments
System (CHIPS), operated by the New York Clearing House. From an
operations standpoint, US banks will able to increase automation and
facilitate more end-to-end processing of international transfers.

"The new format will allow banks to facilitate mapping of transmissions
from other transfer systems. It will make Fedwire more consistent with
SWIFT and CHIPS, and will allow for more automated mapping without the
elimination of any critical payment information," said Roseman.

Roseman said some of the highest-volume banks will be authorised to
complete a same-day change over in June 1997. Smaller banks will have
an easy transition since the Fed-provided software will be upgraded for
them. The expanded format was supported by the country's largest banks,
particularly those which transact business outside the US through other
systems. "This format will effectively make the Fedwire system more
compatible with other payment systems - SWIFT as well as CHIPS," said
Sy Rosen, vice president of payment systems at Citibank.

"More importantly, it defines fields now that would allow one to
effectively, more directly, translate format messages from other
systems. From the viewpoint of efficiency and automation, it really is
a plus," he said.

"When you have this smaller format, sometimes, when you map from one
system to another, you can't necessarily map one for one," Rosen said.
But with the new, expanded format operations staff will be better able
to translate messages field by field, he said.

UNITED STATES:  PAYMENT BY FAX MADE SECURE

TWO COMPANIES have developed systems that use computer fax technology
for secure funds transfer over public telephone networks. The system
transforms a fax machine into a front-end device for access to
automated clearing houses and financial wire services.

MoneyFax, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, holds US and international
patents. Parties initiating a transfer are registered with the MoneyFax
system and draw a unique item number for each pay order, much like a
paper cheque. Transmissions are encrypted and paperless, so the
electronic documents can be stored efficiently.

The MoneyFax system, which can be set up at banks or processor data
centres, offers such amenities as image scanning and interactive voice
response. It also notifies the sender and receiver by fax when
transmissions go through. MoneyFax is ready for delivery, according to
president William Benton. It is being piloted in a Canadian bank, which
he would not identify.

As well as talking to banks and third-party processors, MoneyFax is
seeking approval from US and Canadian governments that would allow the
system to be used for electronic tax payments.

CONNOTECH, based in Montreal, has a patent pending for a payment-by-fax
system. Its president Thierry Moreau said that over the last two years
he has developed a cheque-replacement technology that allows computer
fax-users to send data and images securely over fax lines.

This system ensures protection against misdirected calls, as well as
confidentiality so that only the intended party sees the document,
Moreau said.

CONNOTECH is currently negotiating with partners in the US and Canada
to install the system, which will be ready for field trials in nine
months.

SINGAPORE:  NETS HIT BY BREAKDOWNS

SINGAPORE'S NATIONAL eftpos system, run by the Network for Electronic
Transfers (NETS), is showing signs of strain. Recently, the system
broke down four times in two weeks.

The breakdown in service affected the whole of the island and occurred
during the pre-Christmas shopping "rush hour". The breakdowns do not
usually last more than half an hour, but the latest incident lasted
three hours, just three days before Christmas. Shoppers who depended on
NETS for payments were furious at the system's failure.

The breakdown was blamed for longer queues at the check-out counters of
many retail outlets, because customers did not realise that the NETS
system had broken down, and check-out staff did not know when the
service would be restored.

NETS attributed the recent spate of breakdowns or "system down-time"
to the surge of users trying to transact at the same time. A NETS
spokesman said the system, which is usually configured to handle five
transactions a second, was reconfigured to handle twice the volume in
anticipation of the demand of the festive season and peak-hour shopping
activities. Apparently, the system failed when actual transactions
exceeded 10 per second during peak hours, causing the breakdowns.

This has raised concerns about the system's ability to cope with
increasing volume during peak hours. Interestingly, while trying to
increase the capacity of its system to handle more transactions, NETS
caused similar breakdowns in service on several occasions during the
same period in 1993.

NETS has since assured the public that it has "rectified the hardware
problem" and is "fine-tuning the system to handle the sudden surge in
transactions". It has also decided as part of a longer-term measure to
upgrade the eftpos system to meet a higher transaction demand.

In the mean time, to address public concern about the system and to
enhance its response time to another breakdown, it has set up a
customer hotline service.

On a separate issue, NETS has announced that the pilot phase of its
national electronic purse project, CashCard, has been delayed for the
third time. This follows similar postponements in July and in the final
quarter of 1994.

NETS said the pilot implementation of the CashCard, which is to take
place at two locations, was delayed by the final technical test, which
is still on-going. It stressed that the pilot can only proceed after
the final technical test is completed, because security issues and
features which"cannot be compromised" have to be resolved first.

UNITED STATES:  PROCESSOR ENABLES BANKS TO PRODUCE CARDS INSTANTLY

FIFTH THIRD Bancorp's transaction processing subsidiary, Midwest
Payment Systems (MPS), together with Atalla Corporation, are selling a
card activation system that would allow banks to issue debit cards
instantly in the branch.

Atalla's Card Activation and PIN Selection (CAPS) 2000 System allows
banks to issue debit cards, replace lost or stolen cards, and rewrite
the magnetic stripe of damaged cards.

It also has the customer service benefit of letting depositors choose
their own PIN code. Financial institutions can perform most of these
functions in the branch that previously required outside providers,
reducing costs and waiting times.

According to the agreement, MPS installs CAPS. It also markets the
branch terminals which are the size of POS card-swipe devices, to its
client banks. The system is capable of driving up to 240 terminals
distributed through branches.

MPS, a Cincinnati-based transaction processor, claims it is the only
one to offer the service. Smaller banks can now offer the service
available at larger banks without the expense of buying the central
computer, Atalla explained. Client banks would pay MPS a fee for every
transaction. The amount of the fee was not disclosed.

UK SHARES TRADE TO GO LIVE

A UK BANK is to launch an electronic share dealing scheme available to
any personal computer owner before the end of September.

Jack Lang, technical director of Electronic Share Information (ESI),
the Cambridge-based company behind the new share-trading market, told
EPI it was "well down the line in discussions with two leading banks to
provide an interest-bearing account for customers to use on-line".

Although its main use will be to facilitate rapid payments for shares,
Lang said the account would also offer other banking services. He would
not disclose which banks were involved, but said the project would go
live either in June or September, following the summer holiday season.
He expected developments of the service in due course, with further
banking services and home shopping.

The company is the brainchild of a group of electronics and computer
specialists, chaired by Hermann Hauser, founder of Acorn Computers.
They believe ESI will revolutionise share dealing, in much the same way
that general insurance was transformed by Direct Line. "It will reduce
costs by an order of magnitude," said Lang. "Flotations will be about a
tenth of the cost of floating a company on the London Stock Exchange,
and share dealing will be considerably cheaper."

ESI will specialise in flotations and dealing in the shares of small
companies, challenging the London Stock Exchange and its Alternative
Investment Market (AIM), which will be launched to replace the unlisted
securities market.

By using a personal computer to buy and sell shares via a modem, the
company expects to dramatically reduce the cost to small investors
getting involved in the market. "If you take some of the mystique away
and reduce costs to say a #10 ($15) dealing fee, you can offer a
realistic return on a #200-#300 investment", says Lang.

Speed will be a key attraction. The software, developed by TCAM
Systems, a UK-based software supplier, will allow customers to log on,
pass through security procedures and buy packets of shares from ESI's
public order board. The bank would then transfer the funds
automatically from the account of the buyer to the seller. Lang
estimates an average transaction will take seven seconds."We needed to
find banks which have immediate money transfer systems, rather than
doing it overnight".

There are 9 million shareholders in the UK, almost half of them holding
shares in government-privatised firms. By providing affordable, direct
access to share dealing many of these may be tempted to play the market
regularly.

UNITED KINGDOM:  FIVE BID FOR PO CONTRACT

A CONTRACT for an electronic stop-list to clamp down on benefit fraud,
which costs the UK government #220 million ($340 million) a year will
be awarded shortly.

This will offer short-term protection against fraud before a
comprehensive overhaul of the benefits payment system takes place.
Benefit order books will possibly be replaced by smart cards. At the
moment pensions and other payments are made using a personalised
benefit order book issued to each claimant. Although they are already
bar-coded, copying and theft of books is commonplace.

A Senior Post Office Counters spokesman said: "given the need to combat
order book fraud, we hope to finalise things as soon as possible".

Five technology companies, including ICL Enterprises and Gemplus, are
tendering for the initial contract, which will develop a combined
bar-code reader and electronic stop-list. It will be tested"in about
1,500 post offices in a large metropolitan area," said Wilson. With
experience of the fraudsters' ability to adapt to and beat anti-fraud
systems, the Post Office is concerned that as little information about
the reader and the test location (which is likely to be London) is
released. If successful, the system will be rolled out to all post
offices.

Two contracts which apply to the automation of the UK Post Offices will
be awarded. The larger contract for revamping the entire payments
system is expected to be announced before the end of the year (see EPI
92).

PORTUGAL:  NEW BARCLAYS SYSTEM AIMED AT COMPANIES

BARCLAYS BANK has launched a "global cash system" to replace its
traditional electronic banking system in Portugal. According to the
bank's marketing director, Gloria Brito, the new system is "aimed
primarily at businesses hoping to cut accounting costs, although it is
open to anyone who wants it".

The system involves a computer link-up between a customer and the bank
and is broken down into three components - cash management, cash
pooling and cash express.

Cash management allows for cash movements within the country, and for
up-to-date information on money and exchange markets. Cash express
allows international cash transfers to be carried out on the same day.
"In effect, it is as if the customer were linked to the international
SWIFT network," explains Brito.

Cash pooling is aimed at centralising customer's accounts. "A customer
with several accounts can consolidate his various accounts on a daily
basis, thus increasing his positive accounts or reducing his
overdrafts." The system, says Brito, also means that a customer can
make predictions on their accounts in conjunction with the cash
management programme.

Brito says it is difficult to evaluate the investment made by the bank
in the new system. "Most of the necessary software already exists in
England, although we have had to modify it slightly for the local
market. This includes making a translation of the software into
Portuguese, something we are working on at the moment. It should all be
in place by the early part of next year."

The system is already available to some 50 customers in Portugal, most
of them large companies who have swapped it for the old electronic
banking system.

Barclays says it is not worried about whether or not the system can pay
for itself."Its real aim is not to directly make money, but rather to
increase our customer portfolio and to increase the movements of our
existing customers,", Brito told EPI.

IBOS SIGNS UNIBANK

THE INTERBANK On-line System (IBOS), set up by Royal Bank of Scotland
and Banco Santander in Spain, has signed Unibank, Denmark's second
largest bank, to the network.

Unibank becomes the seventh financial institution to join the
real-time, cross-border payments network. It is also the first bank in
Scandinavia to become involved, and brings an extra 440 domestic
branches to the IBOS network, increasing the number in Europe to 3,800.

According to Jorgen Christian Andersen, first vice president of
Unibank, discussions with IBOS had been on-going for about six months.
He said Unibank decided to join in order to compete with larger banks
which have a global presence.

"It is a good way of getting a branch network all over Europe without
the costs," Andersen told EPI. Andersen said it should be ready to go
live in the second half of this year.

Unibank plans to offer the service only to corporates with regular
cross-border payment needs. It will not be offered for one-off
payments; they will be sent through the normal SWIFT channels, he said.

The other members in IBOS include: Banco de Comercio e Industria in
Portugal; Credit Commercial de France; Kredietbank in Belgium; and
First Fidelity Bancorp in the US.

Economies of scale have proved elusive for IBOS, which is essentially
competing with the giant message carrier SWIFT, despite protestations
to the contrary. IBOS's future was secured last year following the
decision by US-based technology company EDS to buy a stake in the
company.

The cost of joining IBOS, said to have been a deterrent to joining, is
said to have dropped following the purchase by EDS of a stake in IBOS.
According to Andersen, the most expensive element is adapting Unibank's
back office systems to be compatible with the IBOS software.

GZS SETS UP SUBSIDIARY

GESELLSCHAFT FUR Zahlungssysteme (GZS), the bank-owned German payments
system, has set up a subsidiary for payments transfers which, it says,
will allow cross-border bulk payments in Europe to be made in three to
five business days, compared with seven to fourteen days at present.

The new operation, known as Bank fur Zahlungsservice or BZS, will
handle smaller-denomination payments of up to  Ecu 2,000 or DM5,000
($1,600-$3,200).

Payments may be routed from any of the German banks that are members of
GZS. They include all major institutions.

According to GZS, the rationale for the new bank is to realise quick
and low-cost transfers of funds within the European Union in line with
the European Commission's Green Book recommendations of 1990.

BZS will be the German link in the chain of automated clearing houses
(ACHs) which should eventually extend to all European countries. Member
banks will be charged a fixed price per transaction and are expected to
pass on any cost benefit to customers.

A GZS spokesman said that each member bank would have to calculate its
savings individually, but acknowledged that Germany's major banking
groups might still find it cheaper to operate their own systems.

The co-operative banks' TipaNet system, for instance, offers flexible
arrangements for cost-sharing between the sending and the receiving
bank and should eventually deal with substantial volumes.

BZS will make transfers to ACHs in other European countries and to its
member banks on a bulk basis. At present, the system can handle
eurocheques only. While GZS hopes to extend the service to bank cheques
too, no final decision has been made on whether to offer that facility.

BZS is not yet in a position to operate a pan-European system. The
pilot system set up with Belgium has gone into operation immediately,
and the link should be extended to the UK, Austria and Italy in the
course of this year.

Frankfurt-based BZS will be headed by Detlev Buchal, the chief
executive of GZS, and Gerhard August Stern, who was previously head of
payments systems at Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen in Frankfurt.

CANADA'S INTERAC DOWN, BUT UP

INTERAC DIRECT Payment, Canada's national on-line debit network,
weathered its first Christmas season as a fully-deployed system,
handling volumes that were almost three times higher than December
1993.

Several bankers gave the debit card system glowing marks for its
performance. However, the system suffered a set back during the height
of the Christmas shopping season when local and wire news media
reported that HMV Canada, a major chain of record stores based in
Toronto, complained that the system caused "frustrating delays."

Interac general manager Fred Harris told EPI the system experienced no
significant downtime in December, while other defenders dismissed the
complaint as an isolated case. In addition to problems within the
merchant's system, longer transaction times could be attributed to
system-clogging volume: a peak 1.2 million transactions passed through
the system on Christmas Eve, he said. He did not expect that Interac
would be modified as a result of the complaint.

"If that is the case, then I would suggest that there was a system
failure," said Mel Fruitman, president of Retail Council, an
association of Canadian retailers, adding that a debit system should
work quickly and accurately no matter what day it is. "Even ten seconds
is an infinite amount of time when people are waiting. If a system is
having these delays, it is not meeting customer needs," Fruitman said.

Interac features a distributed system, Harris explained. When one
bank's card is used at a "foreign" POS terminal, the transaction is
passed to the issuing bank for authorisation and clearing. Interac
maintains no central switch, except for a central diagnostic facility.

"We did not see any degradation or problems with the core network,"
Harris said. With the distributed architecture of the system, he
explained, transaction delays could be traced to any number of steps in
the cycle. Of 26 million transactions made with Interac cards, 18
million to 19 million went through the core interchange backbone.

According to Harris, 5.5 million cardholders used the system 26 million
times in December, generating C$1.4 billion ($1 billion) in sales - a
more than 50 percent increase over August's C$892.5 million in sales.
And compared to December 1993, when 2.5 million customers generated
C$500 million in sales, system volume last month almost trebled.

"We think it will double again this year," Harris predicted. The
greatest system growth took place after April, when Ontario was linked
to the system. Ontario is also the province where most national chains
are centred.

In other news, Harris said the Bureau of Competition is still
scrutinising the network. Earlier in 1994, it was revealed that
regulators were investigating Canada's only EFT network after it
received complaints of excessive fees and charges.

US FED HITS `SHOULDER SURFING'

THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors took aim at "shoulder surfing,"
a technique used by criminals at ATMs, by eliminating the requirement
that banks print a consumer's account number on every ATM receipt.

According to an interim rule approved last month, banks are no longer
required to "uniquely" identify the consumer's account or card number
on ATM receipts.

Previously, Regulation E, which governs electronic fund transfers in
the US, specified that banks print a consumer's number so that a
transaction could be clearly identified. It is presumed that banks will
truncate the account number to three or six figures out of a 12 number
account, enough so that a transaction can still be identified.

Criminals can often videotape or photograph people entering their PINs,
which they then combine with receipts that are often disposed at the
ATM. Criminals are then able to counterfeit cards and access accounts
with the PIN codes.

Losses due to counterfeiting are conservatively estimated at $25
million to $40 million, according to Tami Ishida, a senior researcher
at Dove Associates, a Boston-based consultancy. She agreed the interim
change would help to slow fraud losses.

While issuers will win out in the long term by denying counterfeiters
critical data, converting terminals to accommodate the new rules will
cause some expense, she observed. Acquirers will have to re-programme
some 400,000 POS terminals and 109,000 ATMs.

Industry reaction was positive. A spokeswoman for the Star System, one
of the largest EFT networks in the US, said her network was pleased
with the change. "This will significantly help curtail the size of the
problem caused by shoulder surfing," she said.

However, she added that the interim rule is vague and the industry
would be better served with uniform standards."It allows too much room
for interpretation. We're urging them to be more specific so the
industry has better guidelines," the spokeswoman said.

INFINET BOSS SAYS REGIONALS WILL PROSPER

REGIONAL NETWORKS may face pressure from neighbouring regionals,
national brands and non-bank processors. But there are substantial
opportunities, even as customers demand increasingly sophisticated
services, according to InfiNet Payment Services chief executive Richard
Yanak.

In a December 21 speech before the Electronic Banking Economics
Society, a professional association in New York, Yanak described his
vision for the future of the newly-created InfiNet and for other bank
EFT networks.

"People value their time even more than they value money," he said,
listing the first among absolutes that rule today's payments industry.
"We need to deliver those services whenever and wherever they are
wanted."

Until now, Yanak said, shared networks were limited to transaction
switching, terminal driving and other aspects of maintaining ATM
systems, such as card authentication and embossing. In the next year
and beyond, networks will introduce remote banking, electronic bill
payment, off-line debit, and electronic purses, he said. And as banks
face pressures to reduce costs, InfiNet could serve as a bank-owned,
third-party service provider to the virtual bank, Yanak said. Bankers
have to examine if they need a data centre or back office. Yanak warned
that past in-house efforts have not shown success. Chemical Bank and
Huntington Bank both have launched bill payment systems to no avail, he
said.

Providing new and expanded services will help to generate new revenue
for member banks. Yanak told the EBES attendees that InfiNet will
explore developing in-house services, buying other enterprises and
forging business alliances. "Every service can generate a fee income
for our members. If priced properly, consumers will pay," he said.

Yanak said InfiNet is looking at creating a terminal leasing business.
The network would strike deals with manufacturers, buying large numbers
of units at lower prices and leasing machines to banks. By partnering,
he said, "InfiNet would guarantee manufacturers substantial orders at a
price lower than is available to any individual bank. Participating
bankers, who would pay a monthly rate, would be sure to always receive
updated ATMs."

Yanak questioned Visa and MasterCard's apparent direction of late, and
suggested the traditional division of territory could be jeopardised.
"Are the regional networks superfluous? Under the right circumstances,
they wouldn't be needed," he said. But banks have turned to regional
networks to remain competitive. "A substantial fraction of the payments
business has moved to non-banks, in part due to the policies set out by
the associations."

This year, Yanak observed, the creation of Visa Interactive remote
banking and MasterCard's purchase of the BankMate network in St Louis
posed tangible threats to regionals. While advising a wait-and-see
approach, Yanak said the nationals should be watched. "If competition
between the national and regional networks increases, regionals will
have no choice but to implement universal interchange," he said.

"Both associations say they support the bank brand in its relationship
with the customer. The difference between them and us is that we
believe it," he said. For the good of the banks, in the battle for the
hearts and minds of consumers, Yanak called for a national brand to be
placed on the back of cards.

Member banks face continuing erosion of their relationship with the
community due to the growing dominance of the national marque, Yanak
said."When national brands are put on the card, it usurps the local
brand and it sounds the death knell of the depository account business.
We have to come to grips with that reality," he said. Depicting a worse
scenario, Yanak said a powerful corporation, such as General Motors,
might create a GM National Bank and offer deposit access services via
the national systems.

HUNGARY:  GIRO PROCESSING TIME CUT TO 24 HOURS

HUNGARY'S BANKING system has taken a giant leap forward with the
introduction of an inter-bank giro system. The new giro facilitates
overnight electronic domestic money transfers among the country's
500-plus bank branches.

Before the launch of the system, bank-to-bank transfers routinely took
days and even weeks, representing a major obstacle to the country's
transition to the free market.

After extensive training of thousands of employees in every bank branch
in the country, the system's architects managed to convert from an
antiquated network to the new X-25 packet switching system between
Friday November 18 and Monday November 21, 1994. Under the old system,
magnetic tapes and disks were delivered round the country by train.

"The effort was no small peanuts," said Peter Braun, president of
Giro's board of directors. "We didn't get much sleep before the
launch."

Braun is also the deputy chief executive of Orszagos Takarekpentzar
(OTP), the national savings bank, and the country's largest
deposit-taking bank with 365 branches. Giro, the system's legal owner,
is held proportionally by all of the commercial banks who are obliged
by the National Bank of Hungary to belong to the system. OTP holds the
largest stake at 22 percent.

The overnight X-25 system is itself intended to be a back-up system to
a realtime giro due out later this year. The network runs on a series
of Intel Pentium-based PCs, linked via satellite and microwave
transmitters, with further back-ups made on floppy disks.

Transfer orders are sent in the late afternoon from branches to the
Giro headquarters in Budapest, where they are sorted overnight for
dispatch early the next morning. The pending real time system, made
possible by a World Bank grant, will be administered on a Bull DPS7000
mainframe.

One reason for launching the overnight back-up system before a real
time system was to determine whether the back-up system was functioning
properly, according to Pal Kerekfy, software director for IDOM, a
domestic information technology company which administered the
transition to the X-25 exchange.

In addition, the Bull network has been delayed for more than two years
pending the central bank's newly-defined system of liquidity control
among commercial banks. Now, the National Bank sets a liquidity limit
for each bank daily. The X-25 network's software was developed from the
beginning to accommodate the liquidity limits, while the Bull system
still has to be modified accordingly, Kerekfy said. IDOM, which was
taken over by Deloitte & Touche last year, also won the tender to
administer the installation of the Bull system.

Before the projects are completed, all commercial banks will have to
adopt a new system of client account numbers. At the moment, the banks
use as many as 40 systems of keeping track of client accounts, said
Kerekfy.

The National Bank has devised a new system, also to be implemented
universally this year, but it has decided to delay the new account
number system until after the launch of the Giro as"it was considered
too much of a shock to modify both systems at the same time", Kerekfy
said.

In more than a month of operation, the new giro system has functioned
without a problem, apart from the occasional human error among clients.
The margin of error is within the 1 percent to 2 percent international
norm, said Braun.

FRANCE:  SELF-SERVICE EXTENDS TO STOCK TRADING

IF A new series of tests succeed, self-service banking may be extended
to include stock exchange transactions. The tests are being undertaken
in two branches of CIC-Paris (Credit Industriel et Commercial), and may
be extended to other banks and branches where sufficient demand exists.

The CIC-Paris experiment is being undertaken in partnership with the
Societe des Bourses Francaises (SBF), which manages the French stock
exchange. It is scheduled to run through June 1995. During this period,
CIC-Paris and SBF will analyse results based on quantitative and
qualitative considerations. These include: the number of users; what it
is used for; and clients' suggestions. A decision on whether or not to
extend the service will then be made.

The test terminal, known as the "Borne-Bourse", consists of a
specially-equipped Minitel (part of the French national videotex
system) with a colour screen, a keyboard and a smart card reader called
"LECAM". Initially, there will be one terminal in each of the two test
sites.

Users of the service simply put their bank card into the card reader
and enter their PIN code. This gives them access to the CIC-Paris stock
market videotex service. Menu-driven software guides them through the
session.

At the moment, the service includes three offerings: personal portfolio
information (by value, rubric, settlements, and taxes); general
information on various stocks and the market, on privatisations and on
CIC-Paris mutual funds; and order placement for buying, selling,
cancellation or amendment. For reasons of security, clients must
confirm any orders they pass by entering their PIN a second time. Under
the present experiment, clients must use terminals only at branches
where they have an account and a portfolio.

SBF made the decision to run this trial last year, following the
success of its"Points-Bourse" information terminals. The Points-Bourse
programme, which was launched in 1992 in partnership with various
banking networks, provides clients with up-to-date SBF stock exchange
data using a system called Chronoval.

The programme has grown dramatically since October 1992, when the
number of these terminals located within branch offices totalled 45 in
six banking networks. By the end of 1994, there were 263 terminals used
by 28 partner banks. SBF officials hope for similar success with the
new venture.

PAYMENTS COME OF AGE

Previously the poor relation of the banking industry, payments are
increasingly seen as the most interesting and profitable area of the
business. Electronic Payments International looks back at some of the
developments of the past year which have shaped this thinking

IF 1993 was the year when eftpos took off, then 1994 was the year of
the smart card. The issue of rising telecommunications costs, coupled
with the problem of fraud, forced banks to move away from traditional
magnetic stripe technology and look at the alternatives. Without doubt,
1995 will see a continuing migration to chip card technology.

Smart Cards

Encouraging results from France's Cartes Bancaires smart card system,
prompted banks in other countries to begin investing in the technology.
Cartes Bancaires' decision to replace magnetic stripe cards with chip
cards was criticised by local banks and dismissed by the international
banking community as an expensive folly.

However, events in 1994 vindicated Cartes Bancaires' decision. Card
fraud in France dropped by 50 percent between 1992 and 1993, falling
from 0.08 percent to 0.04 percent of all transactions. This translates
into losses of Fr207 million ($40 million) at the end of 1993, as
opposed to Fr472 million in 1991. Interestingly, though, Cartes
Bancaires abandoned its electronic purse project being developed with
La Poste, the French postal service.

In January, National Westminster Bank in the UK announced the imminent
launch of Mondex, arguably the most ambitious smart card scheme. The
card, which includes an optional wallet, is being developed in
conjunction with British Telecom (BT), the UK's main telecom supplier.
Midland Bank, a subsidiary of the giant HSBC corporation, also
announced its involvement in the scheme.

Due to go live this year in a pilot in Swindon, Mondex allows users to
transfer funds between their bank accounts and their cards through BT
telephones and adapted NatWest and Midland ATMs.

Tim Jones, senior executive of IT, strategy and policy at NatWest, and
the man behind Mondex, said the scheme differs from other electronic
purse schemes in that Mondex aspires to replace cash, with no audit
trail. Cardholders can transfer money between wallets and can lock it
with a PIN-code. If the person loses the wallet, the cardholder has
lost the money.

Despite, or perhaps because of, its technical sophistication, Mondex
has been severely criticised by industry sources. At the International
Smart Card Conference held in Frankfurt in February, Tim Jones came
under fire from speakers from Banksys, Belgium's national payments
organisation which has developed its own electronic purse scheme, and
from others who questioned Mondex's security and economic viability.

Armand Linkens, director of marketing and sales at Banksys, said the
team developing the Belgian pilot looked at Mondex and concluded that,
because it leaves no audit trail and because it is an "open", rather
than a "closed" system, the potential for fraud was considerable.

However, Mondex does have its proponents. Jerome Svigals, a US-based
smart card consultant, said NatWest has taken a bold step in the right
direction. Firstly, it increases productivity at the bank and the
retailer because it eliminates cash handling. Secondly, the banks
benefit from the float created by a prepaid card.

In fact, the industry became increasingly divided into two camps: the
pro-Mondex banks and the closed system banks.

A further division within the smart card industry was created by the
card associations, Visa and MasterCard/Europay. In December 1993, Visa
and MasterCard/Europay agreed to co-operate on chip card
specifications. The decision was greeted with enthusiasm by the
industry, but failed to hide the fundamental differences between the
card associations approach to smart card applications.

Under the leadership of Charles "Chuck" Russell and with Roger Peirce
in charge of delivery systems, Visa was less enthusiastic about smart
cards than MasterCard. Although this philosophy changed with their
departure - Russell left as president and chief executive officer at
the end of 1993, while Peirce left in March 1994 - Visa is still
unconvinced that smart cards should be implemented as a replacement for
magnetic stripe cards. MasterCard, and particularly Europay, have
committed themselves to migrate to smart cards within an ambitious time
frame.

At Europay's annual members' meeting in Bergen, Norway, the
association's board agreed to invest Ecu1 billion ($1.2 billion) to
implement smart cards. It expects its members to begin introducing
smart cards by 1996. Understandably, the decision was dismissed
as"headline-seeking" by Visa.

Europay claimed that members would see a return of $2 billion within a
seven-year period as a result of a reduction in fraud. Visa, meanwhile,
replied by saying these figures were only relevant to Europay, since
its fraud was higher than Visa's. This is because Visa had reduced
fraud as a result of its Card Verification Value (CVV) technique.

It was not long after the Europay board's decision that MasterCard
announced it too was fully endorsing smart card technology. The
decision was made in tandem with Europay's decision, but MasterCard
would not say how much money it was committing to the project. It did
say, however, that it would be converting terminals to accept chip
cards by 1996.

Visa, aware it was becoming branded as the anti-smart card
organisation, sought to counter this with some high-profile
announcements. In March, it said it was planning an electronic purse
project which would rival the Mondex scheme.

In order to develop such a scheme, Visa linked with two groups of
industry specialists to develop specifications for a purse. The first
includes banking groups working on electronic purse projects: Banksys
in Belgium; Cartes Bancaires in France; Taiwan's Financial Information
System Centre; Sociedade Espanol de Medios de Pago in Spain; Sociedade
Interbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) in Portugal; Denmark's Danmant;
Electronic Payment Services (EPS), NationsBank and Wachovia - all from
the US.

The second group included technology companies, such as Gemplus and
VeriFone. These were contacted to help develop the specifications for
an electronic purse scheme, while the first group were responsible for
ensuring technical compatibility across the various schemes.

One notable exclusion from the first group was Mondex. The significance
of this was played down by both groups. Mondex said it was following
standards set by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) and the
European Commission's working group (CEN), but would not say if it had
been contacted by Visa.

Europay was sceptical about the Visa initiatives, sticking to its
figures on fraud. Neither organisation said Visa's working groups
jeopardised the joint specifications committees, although Europay
professed disappointment that it had not been made aware of the
consortia.

However, despite their differences, Visa and MasterCard/Europay did
announce the completion of their joint specifications. On November 8,
the third and final part of the standards, which determine how smart
cards and POS terminals would process financial transactions, card
applications, and provide for contingencies were announced.

As the associations battled it out for the upper hand, individual smart
card initiatives continued during the year. In February, Banksys
announced the towns to be involved in its electronic purse trial. The
card, later called Proton, was developed to replace cash at the point
of sale. The trial, due to go live in December in Leuven and Wavre, was
one of the most ambitious purse schemes. Given the centralised nature
of the country's payments system, the electronic purse was expected to
migrate to general bank cards in the future.

In July, NETS, the national payments organisation in Singapore,
expanded its CashCard electronic purse project by linking with a local
university and Singapore Telecom. The CashCard scheme announced an
affinity programme with the National University of Singapore. It was
adapted to the needs of students and university staff for payments on
the campus. The Telecom deal opened up 25 adapted telephones to
CashCard holders.

Meanwhile in August in Portugal, the SIBS-backed purse announced it was
to go live in the third quarter of the year, several months early.
Unlike other pilots, it was controlled in the branch of one of the
member banks, Caixa Geral de Depositos.

Danmont, the first major electronic purse scheme, celebrated its second
anniversary in September. Transaction volume grew 108 percent in the
first quarter of 1994, compared with the last quarter of 1993.

In the US, one of the few backers of smart cards, EPS, announced
details of its electronic purse pilot in September. It is due to go
live in the fourth quarter of this year. Due to involve 10,000
customers, the trial will take place in a five-mile corridor in
Delaware.

South Africa also backed smart cards that month. Six of the country's
main banks are involved in the project, called the South African
Electronic Purse. The pilot, which went live in September, involved 100
merchants and 12,000 customers in Alberton, a suburb of Johannesburg.

Finland became the next to announce the launch of an electronic purse
project. Called Avant, the scheme was backed by the Finnish central
bank and came in two forms, a prepaid phone card, and a reloadable
electronic purse. About 40,000 cards were expected to be in issue by
the end of last year.

Mondex received a considerable boost near the end of the year when
Hongkong Bank signed to the scheme. It agreed to become a franchisee
for the scheme in the Asia region. The agreement was a natural result
of Hongkong Bank's association with Midland Bank, one of the banks
behind Mondex.

Finally, the Dutch banks announced the details of its electronic purse
scheme, to be launched in October 1995. The scheme, called Chipknip,
will be piggy-backed on to the banks' eurocheque cards. Interpay, a
merger of Eurocard Nederlands and BeaNet, will manage the scheme. It
expects up to 20 million smart cards to be in issue in three to four
years.

Cross-border payments

Low value, cross-border payments continued to dominate discussions
during the year, with various payment clubs emerging. One of the first
payments networks, Interbank On-line System (IBOS), launched by Royal
Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander in 1990, continued to sign new
banks during the year. The system transfers money, on-line, real time
to and from any branch of its members, which include, Credit Commercial
de France, Banco do Comercio e Industria in Portugal, Kredietbank in
Belgium and First Fidelity Bank in the US.

Although IBOS is keen to play down the potential conflict with SWIFT,
the international financial message sender, many see it as operating in
competition rather than as complement to SWIFT. Critical mass remains
an elusive goal for IBOS. The company says that 20 members would make
the system viable.

In February, the first signs that the European Commission (EC) was
preparing to take stern action against banks emerged. At the
International Electronic Payments Conference in Frankfurt, Peter
Troberg, head of DGXV, the directorate in charge of financial services,
warned banks that, unless improvements were made to the quality of low
value, cross-border payments, a directive would be proposed.

The financial community rallied together against the Commission,
accusing it of unrealistic expectations, saying that low value,
cross-border payments represent less than 5 percent of all payments.
Improvements, they said, could not be made since it could not be
justified by the volumes involved.

Despite the protests, various payment clubs went live during the year,
partly in response to the EC's threats. In April, B.epsys, a consortium
of seven of the largest Belgian banks, went live with its low value
system. It began processing payments between Belgium and Germany
through an arrangement with Geselleschaft fur Zahlungssysteme (GZS),
the bank-owned payments organisation. The system operates similarly to
an automated clearing house, with domestic transactions routed for
international clearing.

In that month, NatWest announced that the group in its payments club:
Commerzbank; Societe Generale; Banco Central Hispano, was to be
expanded. Unlike IBOS, which uses SWIFT message standards but does not
use the SWIFT system, the NatWest group used the international network.
In December, the bank rumoured to be joining was Banco Comercial
Portugues.

It was in December that the system went live with its first transaction
using SWIFT's Interbank File Transfer (IFT) service. It claims to cut
the transfer time down from eight to three working days.

Meanwhile, in July, Banque Nationale de Paris and its strategic partner
in Germany, Dresdner Bank, launched a cross-border payments service.
The service is designed for payments of up to Ecu2,500 ($2,800),
charging a fee of Fr140 ($7).

In September, TipaNet, the cross-border payments initiative set up by
the co-operative banks in France and Germany was adopted by Bankers'
Trust in the US, Swiss Bank Corporation and Austria's
Raiffeisen-Zentralbank. Like the NatWest system, TipaNet uses SWIFT's
IFT system for transfer of payment messages.

Despite these initiatives, the European Commission dealt a blow to the
industry in October when it proposed a directive to improve
cross-border payments. The decision was met with dismay from the
banking industry, but the Commissioner for DGXV, Raniero Vanni
d'Archirafi, was adamant the banks were given adequate time to improve
the situation.

The proposal came after a second study was undertaken for the
Commission which showed that double charging occurred in 36 percent of
payments, while at 46 percent of branches, no written information was
available.

Banks criticised the quality of the research in the report and the EC's
interpretation of its findings. They said that in most instances the
banks were within the Commission's parameters. The average cost of a
transaction had fallen from Ecu22.39 to Ecu19.80 since the last survey,
while the time for the transfer of payments, 4.8 working days, was well
within the EC's recommendations.

Other developments

ATMs continued to be adapted to deliver extra services. In Brazil,
Tecnologia Bancaria (TecBan), the Brazilian company which runs the
Banco24Horas ATM network, revamped its machines to allow for bill
payments. An initial 30 Pagamento Eletronico terminals went live in
March in Sao Paulo for paying electricity and telephone bills. TecBan
expects 500 to be installed by the end of this year, with other
utilities, such as gas and water companies coming on-line.

In Thailand in May, Bangkok Bank began selling mutual funds through its
400 ATMs. The system was launched in conjunction with BBL Asset
Management, a subsidiary of Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.

La Caixa in Spain also offered extra services through its ATMs. Called
Servicaixa, the system dispenses concert, local transport and airline
tickets, provides for the payment of taxes, and pay for university
fees.

The service was expanded in February 1994 by installing a further 400
machines, bringing the total to 800 and could be accessed by all the
bank's Sistema 6000, Visa and Eurocard cardholders.

The US

The US electronic payments marketplace showed signs of maturity in
1994, as government regulators alerted the banking industry that it
promised to pay closer heed to competition issues.

The pace of regional EFT network consolidation slowed slightly, though
there was no shortage of merger discussions. In November, the
Missouri-based BankMate network was purchased by MasterCard, a move
that confirmed the worst fears of regional executives, who suspected
that the national associations want to be more than just gateway
switches.

The only major merger to succeed was between Yankee 24 and NYCE. They
merged as equals in October, creating the third-largest network in the
US. The MAC network continued westward when its members, which acquired
owners of the Quest network in Kentucky, absorbed the network into MAC.

Local jealousies in Colorado, however, sparked a spin-off as small,
independent banks formerly affiliated to the Rocky Mountain Bankcard
System created their own network. There was reportedly great strife
between the independent bank and First Bank Systems, which recently
purchased the owners of the Rocky Mountain network.

Talks, were broken off between Cash Station of Chicago and Magic Line
of Michigan in May, both parties citing philosophical and cultural
differences. The perennial discussion of a merger between the Honor and
Most networks, in the southeast US, also bore no results.

State and federal watchdogs caused the greatest stir in April when the
US Justice Department brought anti-trust charges against Electronic
Payment Services, parent to the owners of MAC, the largest ATM network
in the US. The Justice investigation resulted in EPS signing a consent
decree that said EPS must open the network to third-party processors,
reversing a long-standing network policy.

EPS management said the consent decree, which is not an admission of
guilt, made no difference because EPS earlier changed its bylaws. The
consent decree accelerated the timetable for opening up the network.
Justice complained that MAC policies left banks, particularly small
institutions, vulnerable to higher fees and charges. Competing EFT
networks said this action was inevitable, with the rising importance of
ATMs in the consumer banking industry, but also added that MAC's
restrictive policies were unique in the US.

US Congress also entered the fray, with several consumer groups
lobbying the House Banking Committee. A subcommittee headed by Joseph
Kennedy took bankers to task, questioning the wide variety and the
rising cost of service fees in the last few years. No further action
was taken after the public hearing.

The US Government, in an effort championed by Vice President Al Gore,
supported the development of systems that would deliver federal and
state benefits via the electronic payments system. With limited runs in
Texas, Maryland, California and Ohio, EBT programmes performed well.

However, the Federal Reserve Board created a storm with its decision to
extend Regulation E to stored-value cards, including EBT cards. EBT
proponents criticised the Fed action, claiming Regulation E will stymie
projects because of the heavy liabilities that would be transferred to
state governments and onerous reporting requirements.

MasterCard, at the end of 1994, sparked a new round of competition
concerns when it unilaterally declared that its national on-line debit
programme, Maestro, would not prohibit duality. A few years earlier,
MasterCard and Visa were rebuffed by the National Association of
States' Attorneys General for trying to launch Entree, a joint debit
card programme.

MasterCard submitted its proposed rule change to the group for comment.
When the group responded that it was not filing suit, MasterCard
executives proceeded with the change. Visa and other industry observers
noted that the Attorneys' opinion, while not against the proposal, was
hardly an endorsement they emphasised that the group had reserved the
right to bring suit in the future.

Americans showed that they have warmed to electronic payments. Visa's
72 million cards in circulation generated 35 million in sales volume as
of second quarter 1994. Officials from regional networks, Visa, and
MasterCard report that debit volumes are starting to rise, claiming a
larger share of total spending. MasterCard reported that ATM usage had
begun to carry over to debit.

Perhaps most unsettling was the sudden realisation that computer
software and telecommunication companies are poised to play a very
significant role in payment systems. Assuming the role of bankers'
worst nightmare, Microsoft and its outspoken president, Bill Gates, was
widely credited with awakening bankers to the urgent need to adapt to
changing times. Bankers also learned about software and technology
companies, such as Intuit and Netscape Communication.

Several companies shook up the industry by plying alternative delivery
channels, such as banking by telephone, screen-phone and by personal
computer. Visa in July established Visa Interactive when it bought most
of Virginia-based US Order. Interactive billed itself as a bank-owned
solution for banks that wanted to offer home banking and bill payment
services.

Non-banks were very active. US West, Electronic Data Services (EDS) and
France Telecom Intelmatique formed Interactive Transaction partners
(ITP) and quickly signed such sizeable clients as Comerica Bank Texas.

Visa trumped MasterCard when it signed a deal with Microsoft in
November. It agreed to develop software that would allow consumers to
make payments securely and transact business over computer networks.
This and other software will open up the worldwide web to commerce. In
December, First Data Corporation, the largest transaction processor in
the US, signed a deal with Netscape Communications that could route
credit card transactions over the Internet. MasterCard finally followed
in January when it launched its own programme with Netscape.

In ACH news, bankers turned long-standing grievances against Fedwire
into action this year with the formation of the Private Sector ACH
Exchange, or PAX. Visa USA, the New York Clearing House, and Arizona
Clearing House agreed to link up, allowing banks to route ACH payments
outside the Fed. At the moment, the federal reserve, which plays the
role of both regulator and competitor, controls 80 percent of the
business. In its first year, Citibank NA and Chemical Bank joined the
new system, while PNC Bank moved more of its business through Visa ACH.

The private sector scored another victory when lobbying, led by the
National Clearing House Association (NACHA), spurred the Federal
Reserve to drop its bid to process corporate tax payments to the US
Treasury, a programme expected to add $1 trillion in payments to the
national ACH volume. ACH executives also had feared that the government
could have exceeded its authority by controlling such a significant
piece of business.

PAYBACK TIME FOR MEXICO?

Mexico roared into the markets with its first deals of the year,
raising more than $1 billion last week from some of the same investors who
decried the country as untouchable just a year ago. The sovereign easily
raised DM 1 billion Monday with its first ever 7-year DM issue, equal to
$690 million. The state bank Nafinsa raised $100 million Wednesday and the
import-export bank Bancomext issued $300 million in commercial paper.
        But top Mexican financial officials denied that the country is
using the sovereign cash expressly to make any of the $1.3 billion in
payments due Jan. 29 on short-term swaps drawn from the U.S. Treasury and
the Fed.
        "People might think it is for the IMF or the U.S. Treasury, but the
money does not have a specific purpose," insists Daniel Martinez, advisor
to Martin Werner, Mexico's director general of public credit."The money is
just being used to refinance short-term debt and improve the debt profile."
        Market sources, however, disagreed and seemed amused with Mexico's
curious response.
        "They have some money to pay back to the U.S. Who are they
kidding," wonders a syndicator.
        Chemical Bank analysts suggest that Mexico will almost surely repay
the half due to the Fed, for legal reasons, but that payment on the
Treasury's half is less certain. There's been "some hint" that the Mexican
government has been seeking to roll over the debt, says the research group
in a Jan. 8 analysis. But, "given the politically charged environment in
the U.S., we believe this will be a hard sell," Chemical says.
        Martinez  refused say when Mexico would issue next. Perhaps the
country will follow Argentina to Japan--Mexico has certainly mimicked
Argentina before. The Argentine government is said to be leaning towards a
yen deal, maybe as soon as this week (see page 8).
        Deutchemark deal fever shows no sign of abating--the likely drop in
German interest rates should stoke even more issuance. Mexico was the
second Latin American country to lengthen a DM tenor to seven years. Co-led
by CS First Boston and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the issue carried a 10.38%
coupon, 1/8% higher than the 10.25% coupon that Argentina's seven-year deal
carried two weeks ago.
        A syndicate source says the Mexican issue's higher coupon makes it
slightly more attractive than the Argentine seven-year bond, and has sold
briskly with German and Swiss retail investors. Mexico last tapped the DM
market in October with a five-year DM 1 billion deal for 9.38%.--Dan B.

DEBT RESTRUCTURING TICKING ALONG

With the holidays over, the commercial debt restructuring deals of
Peru, Panama and Slovenia are seeing renewed progress toward completion.
There have been no reports of significant snags or delays in any of the
deals; the original timetables seem to be substantially on track.
        As it promised, Panama has refrained from asking for a rebalancing
of options choices in its $3.5 billion Brady, even though the choices were
far from the balanced breakdown the country the country had sought. With
nearly all the debt spoken for--and no indication of any major renegades
among creditors--the overwhelming majority of orders came in for interest
reduction bonds, covering 81.9% of the debt by Panama's count. Pars bonds
were chosen for only 13.6% of the debt, and discounts only 4.5%. Nary a
creditor chose new money.
        "There is nothing at this point that would hold the deal back,"
said a banking source. Panama is still reviewing the final documentation.
No signing debt has been set, but the two sides are still hoping for
signing in this quarter, and a closing in the next.
        The aggressive timetable for Peru's $9 billion Brady has slipped a
little. Bank creditors handed their version of the term sheet to Peru in
early December, right on time, but it hasn't yet come back. The Peruvians
say they want a first quarter closing, but it looks now like both sides
would have to work like lightning to accomplish that. There has been no
further movement on specifying more closely the debt's participation in
debt for equity swaps; apparently the term sheet will say only that the
Brady debt can't be excluded from any such scheme the country puts forth.
        Slovenia's bank advisory committee was last week awaiting waivers
from creditors that would free Slovenia's share of the ex-Yugoslavia's debt
and allow Slovenia to begin paying off about $800 million in obligations at
Libor + 13/16. Creditors holding at least two-thirds of the debt must
approve the country's exit from the joint and several liability for ex-Yugo
debt. Bankers have not expected a problem, but the New York blizzard and
the fact that some French banks reportedly didn't get the documents until
last Tuesday could create some slight delays. Slovenia hopes to close the
deal within 70 days from waiver approval. -- MD

THINK TANK CHIEF FORESEES CUBAN BLOODSHED

Despite some Cuban economic modernization and a tentative opening
toward non-U.S. foreign investment, Cuba and the United States are unlikely
to move toward eliminating the long-standing U.S. economic embargo against
Cuba in the near future, predicts Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on
Foreign Relations.
        In fact, Gelb foresees something much darker: the possibility of a
bloody civil war "as awful as Bosnia" in the coming years, with the
transition away from a Castro regime.
        Cuba "could be on the edge, in three years, or 10 years, of real
civil war," Gelb suggested last week during a talk at the Americas Society
in New York, shortly after returning from a week of talks in Cuba that the
Council on Foreign Relations arranged with the Cuban government.
        Gelb, a former Pulitzer-prizewinning New York Times journalist and
U.S. diplomat, participated in a series of meetings with top Cuban
political and economic officials during his November visit, which included
five hours of talks with Castro.
        His conclusions are bad news for investors who hope for
regularization of Cuba's defaulted $4 billion debt to Western banks. While
offshore and other non U.S.-registered funds have taken small positions in
defaulted Cuban loans (the Emerging Markets Traders Association recorded
nearly $1.2 billion face value in trades of Cuban instruments last year,
$652 million of that in loan trades that averaged less than $2 million
each), and there are several funds collecting money in wait for better
portfolio investment opportunities on the island, the main impetus for
appreciation of such investments would be the lifting or softening of the
35-year-old embargo.
        Liquidity would improve dramatically, as U.S. investors now banned
from holding the debt would be allowed to participate. War, of course,
could wipe out such positions altogether. Cuban debt now trades in the low
to mid 20s.
        Cuba has a team of well-trained economic managers, which Gelb
equates with the teams Mexico has sported in the last dozen years. However,
their initiatives would presumably be overshadowed by the thrust U.S. -
Cuban diplomatic relations.
Both Sides Take Hard Line
        Pressured by anti-Castro Cubans in the United States, President
Clinton is highly unlikely to soften the U.S. stance toward Cuba in the
runup to the Nov. 1996 U.S. presidential elections, Gelb points out. But,
for reasons of its own, the Castro administration isn't particularly eager
to see sanctions lifted now, either.
        Despite a 40% plunge of the Cuban economy after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and a desperate need for U.S. investment, Castro seems to
fear that the end of the embargo also might mean an end to his regime.
Cubans could become further disillusioned with their president if they
conclude that domestic problems typically blamed on the embargo persist
after it is lifted.
        "My sense is that Fidel Castro is not interested in the next year
or two in making any significant concession to the United States," Gelb
says.
        Gelb advocates gradually lifting the embargo, to avoid shocking the
Cuban economy, and calls for increased diplomacy via U.S.-Cuban military
contacts and a strengthening of the trend to encourage U.S. NGOs to operate
in Cuba.
        But he doesn't think the present situation can last too long,
partly because of the great pressure of an alluring American society 90
miles away.
        "I don't think the situation is long-term stable," Gelb says. Cuba
has begun to grow again, but the 2.5% growth expected this year--perhaps 4%
later on if the sugar harvest is good--is far too slow to be meaningful
after a tumble that was far worse than the United States suffered during
the Great Depression.
        "I just don't think the Cuban situation will continue to evolve
peacefully," he says. He reports that Cuban officials are "very concerned"
about how to create a transition from the rule of Castro, who doesn't want
to leave. Under one scenario, the Cuban military could end up disbanding,
Miami Cubans could return en masse, and the island could find itself thrust
into a civil war.

NY FED'S E-MARKETS CHIEF: IT'S NOT A CRACKDOWN

The New York Fed's new emerging markets group will be strongly
focused on information gathering and policy recommendation--and wasn't
created to crack down on emerging markets banking and financial practices,
the chief of the effort stresses.
        "I'm not supposed to blow the whistle. I'm not supposed to smack
people in the fingers," says Terrence Checki, who last week was named to
the new post of executive vice president of emerging markets.
        Checki, 50, becomes the New York Fed's eighth executive vp. The job
is intended to consolidate various pieces of emerging markets research and
supervision that had been scattered across different departments, he says.
His top priority, he adds, is to be sure Fed policymakers know what's going
on.
        While it seems logical to take such a step after the solution to
Mexico's Dec. 1994 peso crisis landed squarely and expensively on the U.S.
government's doorstep, and the Daiwa Bank trading loss debacle appeared to
catch the New York Fed failing to act on information it had for years, Fed
officials said creation of the group was neither expressly the result of
these issues, nor a signal of stepped-up or changing regulatory practices.
"We're not doing anything now that we haven't done before," Checki said.
        Checki, whose former title was senior vice president in charge of
international banking supervision, has long been the New York Fed's LDC
expert, working closely with both banks and Latin countries during the LDC
debt crisis in the 1980s, functioning as ex-NY Fed chief Gerald Corrigan's
top international troubleshooter and then taking on the same role for
current NY Fed chief William McDonough.
         But Checki doesn't see his role as limited to U.S. commercial or
foreign bank supervision. Instead, he expects to maintain information ties
with all of the players and influences driving emerging markets--keeping
informed about the initiatives of investment banks and funds, tracking
political, economic and financial trends, and consulting with other central
banks.
         His priority is to get emerging markets information to McDonough,
preferably "before it emerges," and make policy recommendations, he says.
        The way to prevent the a new LDC debt crisis is to secure better
economic information from third world counties, Checki says, echoing the
majority consensus put forth by U.S. policymakers and market players in the
wake of the Mexican crisis.
         "I think we need to see that the information is as available as
possible to as many users as we can," he says. While he believes that the
IMF "should not be in the business of assembling information for the
private sector," he does think the Fund has an important role to play in
making sure good financial information is procured from borrowing
countries.
        His advice to those thinking of participating in emerging markets
for the first time: "Tell them to be sure of their ability to swim," he
says, "and to understand how deep the water is."--Mary D'Ambrosio

TELEBRAS RATED TO SOVEREIGN CEILING

Moody's has assigned an initial B1 rating to Brazil's
Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras (Telebras). About $720 million worth of debt
securities are affected. The rating is constrained by the Republic's B1
sovereign ceiling.
        The agency says Telebras needs to raise significant funds, reduce
overhead and adjust its rates as it loses its virtual reign as the monopoly
provider of Brazil's telecommunications service.
        Moody's believes, however, that the Brazilian government will
establish a new regulatory and pricing framework to adjust Telebras's rate
structure so the rates become closer to the costs of providing services,
enabling Telebras to compete more effectively in the new environment.
Chilgener Rated Baa1
        Moody's has assigned a Baa1 to Chilgener of Chile, at the sovereign
ceiling. The rating will apply to the company's $150 million Yankee.

CALDERA MAY FACE VIOLENCE; CHINA TIED TO DENG'S FATE

Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera faces the increased threat of
political violence and a military coup if he accepts IMF conditions, and
the country may emerge with a center-left government in the 1998 elections.
China's business climate is threatened by a weak central government and
political uncertainty as Deng Xiaoping's death nears. In Ecuador, a
sluggish economy and a divided congress mean May 1996 elections are
unlikely to usher in economic improvements.
        Those are some of the conclusions that the Syracuse, New York
analytical firm Political Risk Services presents in its January forecast.
        Romanian President Ion Iliescu's supporters are unlikely to win a
majority in September's Parliament elections. But both Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori are seen as secure in
their positions.
        Venezuela's considerable problems remain due to an overdependence
on oil exports and a lack of fiscal discipline, in the opinion of these
analysts, in a climate of high inflation and no growth. Inflation is
projected to climb to 75% in 1996, from 46.9% last year. Caldera's populist
stance is not making the country's situation easier either, and leftist
Causa R may benefit in the 1998 elections. Causa R's presidential candidate
Andres Velasquez finished second to Caldera in 1993.
        In China, despite some forms of private enterprise, there is much
concern over the business climate. Some government groups are discussing
the removal of foreign tax breaks. Another potential problem is the growing
aggressiveness of the Chinese military in the South China Sea. Pressure
from the U.S. over the status of Taiwan and Hong Kong, trade policy and
human rights could also threaten foreign businesses, analysts say.
        In Ecuador, prospects are slim that President Sixto  Ballen's
administration can implement necessary economic reforms to stimulate the
economy. GDP growth is expected to fall to 1.8% in 1996 after reaching 3.6%
this year.
        The economy is also at risk because of increased violence and the
threat of a military coup. But the May 1996 elections are unlikely to
result in a regime any more capable of improving the economy.
        Romania's Iliescu is favored to win September's presidential
elections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a parliamentary majority.
Despite opposition, Iliescu remains popular as he moves the economy towards
integration with the EU.
        Budget cuts and market reforms are being implemented to qualify for
assistance from the IMF and the EU, but not enough to greatly improve the
business climate. But, inflation is projected to fall dramatically to 28%
in 1996 from 161.5% last year and GDP growth is expected to rise to 4% this
year from 3.6% shrinkage in 1995.
        In Egypt, Mubarek's willingness to use force, mixed with political
liberalization, has kept the opposition off balance and solidified his
control in Egypt. Some progress has been made in reducing foreign debt,
controlling inflation and stimulating economic growth,but essential
privatizations have yet to occur.
        Peru's Fujimori also shows no signs of losing control, standing
high in public opinion polls. Peru's economy is healthy by South American
standards, and Fujimori presided over the country's debt-restructuring
deal. A question for the long term is finding a presidential successor.

LEGAL NOTES

Legal Notes is prepared by James Leavy and M. Cecilia Gaviria of Serra
Michaud & Associes, Paris based on information produced by law firms from
Latin America. This is part one of their monthly report. Part two will
appear next week.
Brazil
Measures to strengthen the financial system
The government and the Central Bank have adopted a series of measures to
support the financial system, parts of which have come under strain as
Brazil moves to a low-inflation monetary system.
a) PROER
A package of measures concerns a special program created by the Central
Bank and known as PROER (Program for Encouraging the Restructuring and
Strengthening of the National Financial System).
Created by Resolution 2208 of the Central Bank, PROER consists of the
following major elements:
i) a special line of financial assistance linked to securities or other
operations of the National Treasury or Federal Government entities, to
losses arising in the process of reorganization of financial institutions,
to the costs of restructuring and modernizing operational systems and to
mobilization of assets of the participating institutions. (Circular 2636 of
the Central Bank sets out the principal conditions applicable to operations
using this financial line);
ii) availability of resources arising from compulsory deposits or
contributions, linked to acquisition of bank CDs issued by entities
participating in PROER;
iii) greater flexibility in reaching operational limits required of
financial institutions;
iv) deferment of costs related to restructuring and modernizing of
financial institutions.
In connection with this program the Government adopted a provisional
measure providing for several tax concessions to entities taking part in
PROER, including the following:
a) where an entity is incorporated to take over a failing institution, it
may treat the institution's difficult loans as losses ("difficult loans"
are defined in Resolution  2210 of the Central Bank);
b) the incorporating entities may treat as a financial cost, the difference
between the purchase price of their investment and the book value of their
interest in the acquired entity;
c) for tax purposes, the losses described in a) and amortized costs
described in b) (up to a limit each year together with tax losses carried
forward from previous years, of 30% of gross profits) can be offset against
gross profits.
Central Bank Circular 2633 specifies that access to the PROER program will
be decided on by the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis and is limited to
recognized financial institutions which acquire the control of another such
institution or whose control passes to such institution or which assume the
rights and/or obligations of such an institution. The Circular specifies
that admission to PROER does not diminish any criminal or other liability
which the directors of an entity taken over might otherwise have.
b) Other Measures
Provisional Measure 1.182 applies the rules of existing legislation on
quarantine of property ("indisponibilidade de bens") to that of the persons
controlling a financial institution which is the subject of intervention,
liquidation or temporary special administration. It authorizes the Central
Bank to take special measures such as injecting additional capital,
transferring control or corporate restructuring for the purpose of
safeguarding the public interest (including the interests of depositors)
where a financial institution is in serious difficulty. It sets out the
types of measures which can be taken with the prior authorization of the
Central Bank when a financial institution is subject to intervention,
liquidation, as well as the measures which can be taken in respect of the
directors of the affected institution.
Resolution 2.212 of the Central Bank strengthens the capital adequacy and
prudential requirements of financial institutions, particularly in the
context of a change in the control of such institutions.
Resolution 2.211 of the Central Bank approves the by-laws and regulations
of the Credit Guarantee Fund, which is designed to guarantee deposits and
other credits against financial institutions in case of bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar situations. Financial institutions contribute monthly
to the Fund an amount equal to 0.025% of the balance of accounts guaranteed
by the Fund.

Colombia
Privatization legislation
Following a decision of the Constitutional Court, Congress has adopted
legislation to regulate article 60 of the national constitution and thus
provide a general legal framework for privatizations. The new legislation
provides that privatizations must be carried out in accordance with a
program approved the Finance Ministry and the relevant Ministry to which
the respective entity is attached, which program must be notified to
Congress.
Each privatization must be carried out in a context which permits wide
dispersion of share ownership, protection of public resources and (where
applicable) continuity of the public service which is provided by the
privatized entity.
Current and former employees of the entity would be given preferred status
in the allocation of shares, as would, labor unions, employee pension
funds, investment funds and similar entities.
Shares in the relevant entity must be offered at a price which reflects the
valuation carried out under the authority of the relevant ministry. Offers
can only be made when arrangements have been put in place to enable those
having preferred allocation rights to exercise those rights, including
special lines of credit (minimum term 5 years: security interest on shares
being purchased). Those receiving preferred share allocations may be
required to retain their shares for up to 2 years and limits may be placed
on the amount of shares allocated to senior management of the entity
immediately prior to privatization.
The new legislation specifies that privatizations of financial institutions
are subject to the special legislation governing the financial sector and
that no privatizations of certain entities in which the State telecom
company has an interest may be carried out before Jan. 1, 1998.

Mexico
Adjustments to financial institutions legislation
A recent congressional decree has made some adjustments to the legislation
governing banks, securities markets, insurance and guarantee companies and
specialized financial institutions. Among the changes are the following:
i) provision is made so that the shares held by foreign financial
institutions or insurers in their Mexican subsidiaries are clearly
identified. At least 51% of the shares in the subsidiary must be held in a
special category reserved to the foreign controlling entity (or its holding
subsidiary). Those shares can only be disposed of with the prior
authorization of the Finance Ministry;
ii) the limits on individual holdings of shares in insurance or guarantee
companies can be exceeded where such a company is being converted into a
local subsidiary of a foreign entity;
iii) financial institutions must establish systems for dealing with clients
inquiries and complaints and a system of arbitration is provided for before
the National Banking and Securities Commission where a dispute persists
between a financial institution and its client;
iv) special provision is made for recovery of claims owed to the national
government and generally for carrying out treasury activities in respect of
assets held by or belonging to the national government, including funds and
securities.

SOVEREIGN FUND SEES VALUE IN VENEZUELA AND BULGARIA

Diego Aramburu, manager of Atlantic Security Bank's Atlantic Sovereign
Fund, thinks Venezuelan and Bulgarian bonds will help him build on the
23.06% gain the $26 million fund achieved last year.
        The Cayman Island-registered fund, held by the offshore securities
arm of Banco Credito de Peru, performed slightly behind the J.P. Morgan
Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus, which returned 26.78% in 1995. But
Micropal ranked the fund third out of 23 Latin American regional debt funds
through last November.
         The fund is 100% emerging markets debt, and Aramburu, who invests
mostly in Bradys and some sovereign Eurobonds for yield and liquidity,
touts bonds of Venezuela and Bulgaria as values this year.
        "We understand the risks in Venezuela. We think there are
fundamental changes in the policy that will make Venezuela attractive,"
says Aramburu, who works out of Lima and Miami. Though he is critical of
President Rafael Caldera's populist stance, he supports the government's
recent devaluation and thinks an IMF deal is coming soon.  He is also
counting on banking, social and tax reforms to cut the fiscal deficit.
Gasoline price hikes are also likely as part of an IMF deal, but the fund
manager differs from many analysts in believing that social unrest will not
result. "The population is understanding better that some measures need to
be taken. They are going in the right direction," says Aramburu.  But he
predicts that Caldera won't be reelected in 1998.
        Aramburu recently bought options on Venezuelan DCBs, bringing the
portfolio's Venezuelan holdings to 5%. "The fact is the market gave us
relative value with those," he says.
        Aramburu also argues that Bulgarian Bradys, which make up 10% of
the fund, are undervalued compared with Poland's. "There is not a big
difference between those countries," he insists. "Bulgaria's financial
numbers are not the best, but they are improving." Aramburu thinks
Bulgarian IABs, yielding around 14%, are one of the most undervalued
instruments available today.
        The remainder of the fund's portfolio includes a heavy 10% position
in Peru, a standard 25% stake in Brazil, 15% holdings in each Argentina and
Mexico, 7% holdings in Nigeria and small positions in other Latin
countries, such as Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.
        The fund started in Oct. 1994 when the company merged the bank's
Latin and Growth funds. Aramburu had established the Latin Fund in 1990,
shortly after joining the bank, and set up the Growth Fund two years later.
But, "both funds had similar objectives so it didn't make sense to have the
two separate," he says.
         Fund products cannot be sold in the U.S. The Sovereign Fund pays
dividends twice a year equal to six-month Libor + 1% of the value of the
purchase price of the fund's shares. Latin American private investors are
the typical clients,  and they purchase shares with a minimum investment of
$50,000.
        Aramburu, 34, is a total return investor who uses bottom-up
fundamental analysis when making investment decisions. He also follows
political situations closely, but acknowledges his worst mistakes have been
those made primarily based on news from various newspapers around the
globe.
        "The political part of analysis is very difficult to quantify, and
we are very much interested in quantification," says Aramburu, who holds a
Ph.D. in international economics from the University of Miami. Aramburu
follows a model that establishes a relationship between the values of
assets against a country's fundamentals.
        Aramburu generally holds assets for at least three months, but
trades part of the portfolio heavily once a month to find high yields. The
fund is now fully invested, compared to the 40% cash it held at the
beginning of 1995.
         Aramburu maintains a 25% stake in Brazilian holdings because he
finds excellent values among DCBs, Exits and EI's.
        Argentine FRBs and discounts make up the bulk of the 15% Argentina
position. Aramburu says Argentina is being unfairly correlated with pre-
peso devaluation Mexico; he thinks the country's stronger export sector and
reserve position leave it in superior shape. Aramburu expects Mexico to
struggle mightily during the first half as fourth quarter 1995 numbers are
released, but foresees improvements later in 1996.              One country
he won't invest in is Russia, despite the $32 billion debt rescheduling
agreement. "The problem with Russia is the lack of financial numbers," he
says. "It's like investing in a company that you don't have the financials
for. I still don't have a grasp on what Russia's numbers are. --Dan B.

BRAZIL BUYBACK TALK STOKES LDCS

The LDC debt market gained for the second straight week, despite
concerns over the U.S. budget negotiations, rising about one point on the
week to Thursday. Brazil led a spirited rally last Thursday on strong
rumors that it will soon conduct a two-step buyback worth $300 million of
debt owed to it by Paraguay. Brazilian locals were active in the buying as
well as a U.S. insurance company, which purchased $150 million worth of
Brazilian C-bonds, pars and EI's, according to a New York trader. C-bonds
gained two points to 61 3/8 bid, 61 5/8 offered, while IDU's were up almost
a point to 87 1/8 bid, 87 1/2 offered.
        The market traded up early last week, before halting last Tuesday
when the U.S. budget negotiations bogged down again. But the market rallied
later in the week and stopped following the long bond down. The long bond
then rallied last Thursday afternoon following President Clinton's news
conference to yield 6.15%. "The emerging markets are short of treading
water watching the U.S. budget discussions, but the underlying bid is still
strong," says the trader, noting how new money continues entering the
market.
        Mexican issues were mixed. Discounts gained almost one point to 74
bid, 74 1/4 offered, while pars lost 1/2 to 66 1/8 bid, 66 3/4 offered.
        Argentine issues were flat. FRBs were unchanged at 72 3/8 bid, 72
5/8 offered, while pars lost about 1/2 a point to 56 3/8 bid, 56 5/8
offered. Venezuelan issues held firm as the market watches the country
resume discussions with the IMF this week. Pars were flat at 58 1/8 bid, 58
3/8 offered, as were DCBs at 57 1/4 bid, 57 1/2 offered.
        Exotics, big gainers two weeks ago, were flat last week. Nigeria
par bonds fell one point to 51 bid, 51 1/2 offered, while Morocco tranche A
was off half a point to 67 3/8 bid, 67 3/4 offered. Vneshekonombank dollar
loans lost almost 3/4 of a point to 34 3/8 bid, 34 7/8 offered.

NEW ISSUES


U.S. Investors Inhale ELM
     Timing was everything for Mexican cigarette company Empresas La
Modern, which increased its Euro with a 144A option to $125 million last
week. ELM's three-year deal, joint led by ING and J.P. Morgan, was
oversubscribed two to one and enlarged from $100 million. ELM was to launch
the deal last November but backed out due to a difficult market
environment. That was not the case this time, though, as the bonds,
carrying an 11.38% coupon, were equally distributed in the U.S., Asia and
Europe.
        "The deal went real well. We bought $10 million worth of bonds,"
says Steven C. Merrell, manager of IDS' Special Income Fund. "It was
relatively attractive in relation to other things offered in Mexico and is
well priced and valued."
        Merrell was one of many investors who turned away from the ELM
issue last November as the Mexican peso swooned, but was lured back by the
changing sentiment towards Mexico.
Nafinsa Gets Aggressive
        Mexico's Nacional Financiera launched a $100 million Euro via
Salomon Brothers that some market insiders considered too expensive and
aggressive. The three-year notes carried a 9% coupon for a spread of 375 bp
over U.S. Treasuries. The deal, which carries a 144A option, was popular
with European retail investors, but some in the U.S. were not impressed.
        "I think it's expensive for the investor. You can get Nafinsa paper
with the same spread for shorter maturities," says one.
Argentina Weighs Yen
        Argentina, fresh off of a DM 500 million ($347.8 million) deal two
weeks ago, is receiving bids for another issue, and may launch a
substantial yen deal this week, according to a yen source. "They've
received a number of different structures, but a yen deal looks good," the
source says. Argentina may launch either a five-year, 50 billion ($476.8
million) deal with a 6% coupon or a three-year, 30 billion yen ($286
million) issue with a 4.5% coupon, the source says. Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko
are in the running.
        But Argentina may instead issue in Italian lira again to get a
bigger deal, according to the source. Argentina issued a 150 billion lira
($93.1 million) Euro last September and may want to continue diversifying
again.
Colombia Dusts Off Yankee
        Colombia's 20-year Yankee issue lead-managed by Merrill Lynch and
Goldman Sachs is expected to launch in the next three weeks, according to
market sources. Yield-hungry investors are said to have made the deal,
shelved last November, possible again. The issue may contain two tranches--
seven- and 20-years. Neither Merrill Lynch nor Goldman Sachs officials
would comment.
Chilgener Takes $150M Deal To Road
        Roadshows for Chilgener's $150 million Yankee begin today in New
York (weather permitting) and end in California later in the week. Lead
manager Smith Barney, and co-managers Chase Manhattan and ING Baring are
marketing the 10-year notes for Chile's second largest electric generator
to high grade funds, but few emerging market accounts, according to a
syndicate source. Price talk is not available, but a source says it will be
similar to the 7% that Celulosa Arauco's $300 million Yankee carried last
December. "Chilgener is a better credit than Celulosa Arauco. It is better
rated and is a utility while Celulosa is in the forestry industry," the
syndicate source says.
Brazilian Samurai Mandate Expected
        Brazil is expected to award a mandate for a Samurai bond worth 30
billion yen ($286 million). Nomura has been rumored to be named lead, but
yen sources say it may not be a done deal. "Nomura has been backing off,"
says one. "I think they believe their relationship with Brazil will be
enough to get them the deal." The issue is expected to be for five years
with a coupon of between 6% and 6.25% and may launch at the end of
February.
BBA Leads Brazilian Banks
        Banco BBA Creditanstalt is expected to launch a DM 100 million
($69.5 million) issue for three years this week via Banque Paribas. The
deal is expected to carry an 8.63% coupon for a yield of 470 bp over the
bund.
        Other Brazilian banks, including Banco Safra and Banco Bamerindus,
are expected to launch deals before the month is out. Safra is planning a
Eurobond, while Bamerindus is planning a Deutschemark issue via CS First
Boston, market sources say.
Telebras Set To Dial Italy
        Telecommunicacoes Brasileiras (Telebras) is expected to launch a
300 billion lira ($189.9 million) deal via J.P. Morgan this week. The
issue, expected to carry a coupon of between 13.25% and 13.50%, may be
increased to 400 billion lira ($253.2 million) due to positive responses by
potential investors, market sources say.
Japanese Brave Refah Threat
        Despite the possibility of a Muslim-led government in Turkey, some
Japanese investors have a strong thirst for Turkish paper. Turkey launched
a 10 billion yen ($95.4 million) deal via Yamaichi last week. The 10-year
notes sold at par with a 7.2% coupon and were purchased by Japanese
institutional investors and financial institutions. "This issue was driven
by a specific demand by a series of investors," says a Yamaichi source.
Turkey raised $493 million last December with a three-year 50 billion yen
deal led by Nomura Securities. Turkish officials are now contemplating
issuing more bonds in other currencies.--Dan B. Levine

CLARIFICATION

A story about the emerging market business on Dec. 18 left out
phrases in several statements by Bank of Boston Managing Director Ignacio
Sosa.
        Sosa said that "Whatever we did previously in emerging markets
sales and trading has absolutely no relationship to where we are going. He
added that the bank's focus "on the new issue side will be on corporates,
that is one difference in relation to our competitors who focus on
sovereigns."
        We regret the omissions.

IFC GETTING OUT OF BANKERS' YARD

WASHINGTON
Commercial banks are applauding the new guidelines
adopted by the International Finance Corp. designed to keep the World
Bank's private finance arm out of areas that could be handled by the
private sector. However, in a report by the Institute for International
Finance reviewing
the IFC changes, the banks cautioned that there are areas where the IFC
needs to be more clear about its efforts to avoid displacing private banks.
        The banks expressed concern about the IFC continuing to participate
in financing in countries that would have no trouble attracting private
sources, and should have been graduated from the IFC program by now, among
them Chile, Colombia, Turkey and Thailand.
        The IFC has left this "graduation" up to private banks, and has not
set a clear criteria for staff to judge whether a company or country should
be treated as off limits. Often companies that have a long-standing
relationship with the IFC are inclined to return there in the future, even
when they could find private capital sources.
        In these cases, the IFC should only become involved in exceptional
circumstances, and limit participation to countries that could not
otherwise find financing, the report stated, although it added the proviso
that a country's graduation should be reversible, so that the IFC could re-
enter if needed.
        "In Latin America and Asia the private sector is capable of doing
the job, if not single-handedly, than at least predominantly," while there
is much more need for the IFC in Africa, said Donald McCouch, group
executive of Chemical Bank, who participated in preparing the report.
However, McCouch said the IFC should be given credit for trying to adapt to
a changing world.
        The IIF report, which focuses on nine areas of the new IFC
guidelines, in general was in favor of the changes. "We believe the IFC is
taking important steps towards increasing its effectiveness and increasing
its ability to catalyze private finance for developing countries," said
Charles Dallara, managing director of the IIF.
        "It will help focus the efforts on places where it is most needed,
and greatly reduces if not eliminates the displacement of private sector,"
Dallara told reporters, adding that scarce IFC resources should not be used
on a project that could be financed wholly with private funds.
        The report also recommended the IFC limit its activities in
securities underwriting and equity participation to exceptional cases where
it is clear the transaction would not be completed without IFC
participation.
        The value of IFC participation in underwriting international issues
has been limited, since it has worked with well-known companies in
developing countries that could have been underwritten by private
investment banks. However, IFC has scaled back its operations in this area.
        There also were concerns about a conflict of interest when the IFC
acts as a lender, particularly in a B-loan syndication, in a company in
which it has equity interest.
        The report praised the IFC for deciding to refrain from competing
in bidding for privatization advisory mandates, but said the IFC should
continue to scale back its advisory operations, and stay out of any bidding
for such programs. It should concentrate on establishing regulatory
environments necessary for privatization, model privatization transactions
in countries like Russia and the Ukraine, and focus on those where there is
negligible private sector interest, such as Haiti.
        Bankers stressed that in no instance should the IFC link financial
support to obtaining the advisory mandates, which Dallara said he has seen
happen many times in the past.
        The report also recommended the IFC increase its use of guarantees
to leverage private financing, continue its efforts to diversity sources of
co-financing for B-loan syndications, use private sources more for
appraising, arranging and managing project financing, and put in place an
appeals procedure for institutions concerned about displacement.

PEOPLE

The next two weeks will be nervewracking for Chemical Bank and
Chase Manhattan emerging markets division employees,  as Chemical/Chase co-
emerging markets heads Daniel Canel and Jorge V. Jasson are expected to
eliminate some duplicate jobs. "The additional cuts are probably going to
come at the end of the month," says a Chase insider.
        Canel and Jasson named 13 top managers last month for the new
capital markets division: seven from Chase and six from Chemical. Chase
head Brady trader George P. Grunebaum and Chemical managing director Raul
Ponte become head traders in the U.S., while Barry J. Hoffner and Brian C.
Lazell, each of Chemical, hold the same positions in London. Chase research
head Lawrence J. Brainard maintains the same position in the consolidated
group, with Chemical research chief Thomas J. Trebat as deputy. Chase head
of syndication Cynthia Powell also keeps her spot, Chase's Federico L.
Amadeo is responsible for Latin America origination and Chemical's Gabriel
G. Politzer will cover Latin America local markets and external debt.
        Also, Chase's John P. Colligan has been tapped to handle U.S.
sales, while Chase's Gustavo M. Dominguez is responsible for derivatives,
structured products and arbitrage. Rounding out the appointments are
Chemical's Anette L. Kolenda, named business manager, and Chase's Rachelle
C. Keller, who was selected as Kolenda's deputy.
        Noticeably absent from the list is Chemical syndication head Juan
Lacroze, who helped engineer Mexico's $1.5 billion Eurobond last December.
Lacroze is remaining with the new Chase--just not in the syndication
department. But his new role has not been announced.

COMMISSION INVITES COMMENT SECOND BANKING DIRECTIVE

THE DECEMBER issue of European Banker, in the article Freedom or
fallacy?, discussed some aspects of the Commission communication on
interpretation of the Second Banking Directive, highlighting different
Member State interpretations of the Directive and quoting some initial
reactions to the communication by national banking associations. EU
Financial Industry Monitor readers may be interested in more details on
this text of major importance.

The Commission published its text, strictly speaking a Draft
Communication entitled "Freedom to provide services and the interest of
the general good in the Second Banking Directive", in the Official
Journal No C 291 of 4.11.95.

An introductory passage states that the Draft is "the Commission's
contribution to the discussions under way on the problems associated
with freedom to provide services and the interest of the general good"
under the Second Directive. It points out that the discussions have so
far been restricted to the Member States in the Banking Advisory Group
and the Working Party on the Interpretation of the Banking Directives.

The Commission, however, "takes the view that the broadest possible
consultation should be held on its interpretative work" and so invites
interested parties to submit comments on the Draft by 4.3.96. After
consideration of any such comments, the Draft will, if appropriate,
become a Commission interpretative communication which will give banks
an idea of how the Commission will view particular problems brought to
its attention.

This is a most unusual step. First of all, it is very rare for the
Commission to issue interpretative communications on directives. It has
done so in the case of several of its own regulations, for example in
the competition policy field, but very seldom in the case of Council
directives since they have to be implemented through national law.

Secondly, although the Commission has certainly consulted interested
parties in the past on the interpretation of EU legislation, it has
never published a draft interpretative document with an invitation to
the world to comment on its intended interpretation.

The reason for taking this unusual step is very honestly stated in the
introduction to the Draft Communication:

"In the course of its contacts with numerous economic operators, the
Commission has come to realise that continuing uncertainty with regard
to the interpretation of basic concepts, such as freedom to provide
services and the interest of the general good, has seriously undermined
the workings of the machinery set up by the Second Directive and is
such as to deter certain credit institutions from exercising the very
freedoms which the Second Directive sets out to promote."

It is also worth emphasising that this Draft Communication may be only
the first in a series. The Commission has tipped off the specialised EU
press that it considers it premature to issue such Drafts for the
"third generation" insurance directives and the Investment Services
Directive but that it is already reflecting on the problems of
interpretation of these measures and is committed to the coherence of
the positions adopted for all financial services.

This is hardly surprising, given the great reluctance of certain Member
States to open up their insurance and securities markets to services
provided cross-frontier and their alleged use of the general good
provisions of directives to make life difficult for institutions from
other Member States.

The Commission's approach

Only the European Court of Justice can give a final, definitive
interpretation of EU law. The Commission, therefore, makes it clear in
its Draft Communication that the contents are without prejudice to any
European Court of Justice interpretation of the Second Banking
Directive.

What the Commission has done is to restate the principles laid down by
the Court of Justice in giving judgment in cases involving the freedom
to provide services and the interest of the general good in other areas
of EU law and to examine the application of these principles to the
Second Banking Directive.

In a key passage which is implicitly revelatory of the restrictive
position of some Member States, the Commission states that its
interpretations of the Directive "do not necessarily represent the
views of the Member States" but then makes a threat:

"However, in accordance with its duties as guardian of the Treaty
reserves the right to exercise the powers vested in it by the Treaty
(Article 169)."

In other words, the Commission is warning the Member States that,
although they may not agree with how it interprets the Directive, if
they go against that interpretation the Commission will not hesitate to
start Treaty infringement proceedings against them. The Draft
Communication takes up thirteen-and-a-half Official Journal pages and
is both discursive and legalistic.

Freedom to provide services

Under the single licence system, a bank authorised in a Member State is
entitled to provide services without an establishment in any other
Member States after going through the sole formality of notifying its
home Member State regulatory authorities of its intention to do this.

The Commission's Draft Communication addresses:

1) the services covered by the Directive, 2) commencement of the
provision of services.

The first of these is sub-divided into: a) nature of services; b) forms
of provision of services; c) provision of services; and d) nature of
the notification.

Nature of services

Article 20(1) of the Second Banking Directive states that:

"Any credit institution wishing to exercise the freedom to provide
services by carrying on its activities within the territory of another
Member State for the first time shall notify the competent authorities
of the home Member State of the activities on the list in the Annex
which it intends to carry on."

This makes it clear that only the "core banking activities" listed in
the Annex to the Second Banking Directive are covered by the freedom to
provide services. It is equally clear that the notification procedure
only applies where services are to be provided for the first time.
Article 23(2) of the Directive explicitly states that rights acquired
by credit institutions which provided services before the Directive
came into force are not affected.

The Draft Notice then examines the questions of: 1) whether the fact
that an activity has only been carried on once or a few times be
considered enough to confer acquired rights; and 2) how far back in
time should one go to find evidence of past activity.

For the Commission it would be "absurd to set a quantitative limit . .
institution has acquired rights if it provided a service at least once
in another Member State, regardless of when. However, the Commission
adds that:

1) this activity must have been carried on lawfully, that is, in
conformity with the law in force in the host Member State at the time;
and

2) the institution must be able to provide, if necessary, evidence of
its past activity.

It also adds that institutions with acquired rights cannot be subjected
by their home Member State authorities to more onerous procedures than
were applied before the Second Directive came into effect. For example,
they will not have to notify the authorities of their intention to
continue providing the services under Second Directive terms. The
notification procedure only applies to services to be supplied for the
first time.

Forms of provision of services

Article 20(1) of the Directives requires notification for services to
be provided "within the territory of another Member State". On the
basis of European Court of Justice interpretation of the Treaty
provisions on freedom to provide services, the Commission Draft
Communication addresses the provision of services when there is
"movement" and also addresses rules on advertising.

The bank providing a service may move, in the sense that staff may go
to the other Member State for the purposes of providing the service.
The Commission considers that this situation is "undoubtedly" covered
by freedom to provide services.

Conversely, the receiver of the service may be the person to move, that
is, he/she comes to the Member State where a credit institution is
established without this being the result of canvassing by the
institution. No notification to the home Member State authorities is
required in that situation.

Nevertheless, an institution which before the Second Banking Directive
came into effect and only provided services to clients from other
Member States in that way, would have to notify if it intends to start
seeking new clients through canvassing in other Member States or by
travelling to them.

The third situation is where the service itself moves, that is, where
the service is provided by post or by modern communication method such
as telephone, fax, telex, electronic mail. In this case, the Commission
makes a distinction between whether the service is provided at the
customer's initiative or whether it follows canvassing by the credit
institution. In the first case, the institution is exempt from
notification but, in the second, the canvassing is proof of an
intention to provide a service in another Member State and notification
is, therefore, necessary.

It follows that the notification procedure should be completed before
the credit institution and its customers establish "commercial
relations". The Draft Communication points out that, where a credit
institution subsequently wishes to offer services not covered by its
initial notification, an additional notification would have to be made
first.

Advertising in another Member State

When does advertising amount to an intention to provide services in
another Member State and so create the obligation to notify? The
Commission's starting point is that:

"It is only where, by its very nature, the advertisement constitutes
commercial canvassing, ranking as an actual invitation, issued at a
distance, to enter into a contract, or where it precedes a physical
journey by the supplier, that it constitutes an intention to provide a
service within the territory of another Member State, within the
meaning of Article 20."

Two scenarios then arise. The first is where the bank which places an
advertisement does not intend to go subsequently to the consumer's
Member State of residence. In this case, the Commission considers that
notification of the intention to advertise is required when two
conditions are both met:

1) the advertisement contains sufficient information for the consumer
to make up his mind (for example, interest rate, duration, cost); and
2) the contract can be concluded at a distance, that is, by reply slip,
letter, telephone etc, without the bank and the customer having to
meet. If, however, the contract cannot be concluded without the
consumer going to the Member State where the bank is established,
notification is not required.

The second scenario is where the bank intends to go to the consumer's
Member State of residence to conclude a contract for a service which
has been advertised. Notification is required in this case. There may
be difficulties of classification. The Draft Communication takes the
example of advertisements in Europe-wide publications or TV channels.
The Commission considers that notification would only be necessary if
such an advertisement were directed at a specific Member State, for
example, if it appeared in a national edition of an international
newspaper.

Provision of services compared to establishment

The case law of the European Court of Justice makes a clear
distinction. When a service is provided in a host Member State, the
presence there is temporary. Establishment, in contrast, implies the
existence of permanent premises in the host Member State.

The Court has also ruled that, in the case of an activity carried out
temporarily but frequently, the Member States may apply their rules for
institutions which are established there if an institution invokes the
freedom to provide services abusively, so as to avoid the local rules
for established institutions.

The Draft Notice then considers some cases where it is difficult to
draw the line between provision of services and establishment -
electronic machines, recourse to independent intermediaries and the
permanent presence of the institution's own staff in another Member
State.

Electronic machines

Electronic machines capable of performing Second Directive core banking
activities may be covered by the concept of establishment.

A machine is unlikely to be a credit institution's only place of
business in another Member State. In the normal course of events, a
machine would be attached to a branch, agency or some other form of
establishment and so would not be "an entity in its own right". As a
result, it would be subject to the rules applicable to the
establishment to which it is attached.

In the unlikely event of an electronic machine being a credit
institution's sole presence in another Member States, then, in the
Commission's view, the machine would be deemed to be a provider of
services. As such, it would have to be notified, subject to the "first
time" rules already described.

As a provider of services, a machine would be subject to the general
good rules of the host country. In that respect, the Draft
Communication gives as an example the need for a machine to show a
telephone number in the host country.

Independent intermediaries

In its discussion of whether an intermediary used by a credit
institution to do business in another Member State is or is not to be
regarded as a permanent establishment, the Commission's Draft
Communication quotes extensively from the case law of the European
Court of Justice. It concludes that the links between a credit
institution and an independent intermediary in another Member State
amount to the institution having a branch in the second Member State
when the intermediary meets three cumulative criteria:

- he has received an exclusive brief from that credit institution and
from no other;

- he is empowered to negotiate on the credit institution's behalf and
to bind it;

- he operates on a permanent basis.

This raises the question of the intermediary who acts on behalf of more
than one credit institution and here the Commission distinguishes two
scenarios.

Where the intermediary acts exclusively for a group of credit
institutions which have jointly called on his services, all of them are
deemed to be established in the form of a branch, assuming that the
other criteria are met.

The other situation is where the intermediary acts for a number of
credit institutions which have not jointly called on his services. In
that case, the first of the branch criteria - receiving an exclusive
brief - is not met. Therefore, the instructing credit institutions are
not established in the second Member State and are providing a service
through an intermediary. Notification is required.

The Draft Communication then examines the situation in those Member
States which require intermediaries to be given mandates by the credit
institutions for which they act.

Without giving explicit answers, the Commission states that it would
have to examine the extent of the mandate, the credit institution's
ability to control the intermediary, the possibility for the
intermediary to commit the mandating credit institution.

Finally, the Draft Communication considers the situation where the
intermediary is itself a credit institution. If the intermediary offers
its customers the products of another credit institution, the latter
would have to notify its intention of exercising the freedom to provide
services in its intermediary's Member State unless, of course, it is
covered by the acquired rights provision.

If, on the other hand, the intermediary provides accommodation to a
branch of the other credit institution, there would have to be
notification of the intention to exercise the freedom of establishment.

Permanent presence of staff

Under this heading, there are two situations - either a credit
institution's staff in another Member State carry on a banking activity
or they do not.

If they do carry on a banking activity, they constitute a branch. Since
1.1.93, a branch start-up has required prior notification under the
Second Directive. If it was operational before that date with any
authorisation required by the host Member State's legislation, it
enjoys acquired rights under the Directive and so notification is not
required. If it was operational before that date but without the
necessary local authorisation, it requires notification as it had not
started operations "in accordance with the provisions in force in (its)
host Member State".

The presence in another Member State of a credit institution's staff
who do not carry on a banking activity - in other words a
representative office - does not, in the Commission view, constitute a
branch and so does not require notification. That does not, however,
prevent the host member State requiring the institution to inform it of
the opening of the office and to go through "a registration procedure
that would have to be a mere formality". The host member State would
also be at liberty to carry out "a simple, unsystematic check to
ascertain whether the office is not, in fact, engaged in banking
activities".

Nature of the notification

This is dealt with very simply in the Draft Communication. For the
Commission, the Second Directive's notification procedure:

"pursues a simple objective of exchange of information between
supervisory authorities and is not a consumer protection measure."

The Draft Communication continues by stating that notification cannot
be considered "a procedural condition underlying the validity of
banking contract". In other words, a bank which has not fulfilled a
notification requirement can be penalised for this failure but the
contracts it has entered into the second Member State cannot be
annulled on the grounds of non- notification.

In the Commission's view, that would be contrary to the Community law
principle of proportionality and would negatively affect the legal
certainty of contracts entered into in good faith.

Commencement of the provision of services

Article 20(2) of the Second Banking Directive states:

"The competent authorities of the home Member State shall, within one
month of receipt of the notification mentioned in paragraph 1, send
that notification to the competent authorities of the host Member
State."

The Draft Communication contrasts this provision on the freedom to
provide services with the corresponding provision on freedom of
establishment. The latter (Article 19(5) of the Directive) requires the
credit institution to wait for receipt by the branch of a
"communication" by the host Member State authorities.

In the absence of any such communication after a period of two months,
it can start operating. The Draft Communication points out that when
the proposed Directive was being examined in Council the idea of
applying that rule to both freedom of establishment and freedom to
provide services was rejected.

The Draft Communication continues: "In the Commission's opinion, the re-
introduction, by way of interpretation, of formalities which the Member
States did not wish to see in the definitive version of the text
adopted by the Council is neither desirable nor in keeping with the
spirit and letter of the Second Directive."

In other words, a credit institution can start exercising the freedom
to provide services in another Member State once it has notified its
intentions to its home Member State authorities, which have one month
in which to notify the host country authorities. The credit institution
may well ask the host country authorities to confirm receipt from the
home country authorities of the institution's notification but that
confirmation cannot be a prior condition for starting to provide
services. Making confirmation a pre-requisite "is unacceptable and
constitutes an infringement of the Second Directive".

The general good in the second banking directive

The general good part of the Draft Communication discusses firstly the
notification of conditions to be met in the interest of the general
good and, secondly, the applicability of rules adopted in the interest
of the general good.

Notification of conditions to be met in the interest of the general
good

This section of the Draft Commission discusses the interpretation of
Article 19(4) of the Second Directive which provides that:

"Before the branch of a credit institution commences its activities the
competent authorities of the host Member State shall, within two months
of receiving the information mentioned in paragraph 3, prepare for the
supervision of the credit institution in accordance with Article 21
and, if necessary, indicate the conditions under which, in the interest
of the general good, those activities must be carried on in the host
Member State."

It appears that uncertainty has arisen regarding the words "if
necessary". Some Member States have considered that this imposes an
obligation to indicate the general good conditions to a branch. Others
have read the words as merely giving an option or a "moral obligation".

The Commission considers that it is an option. Its principal reason for
stating this is that the text says nothing about the form and content
of notification of general good conditions. That being so, it would be
impossible to verify whether the "obligation" had been complied with.

In addition, there is no detailed, harmonised definition of "the
general good". It may vary from one Member State to another and may not
apply in the same areas in host and home Member States. Also, "there is
no way of knowing in advance what the credit institution wants to
obtain".

In conclusion, it is up to a credit institution which wishes to operate
in another Member State to establish the situation, either by its own
efforts or by asking the host Member State authorities.

Even if these authorities were to refuse to give the information, there
would be no breach of Community law, although any harm suffered might
be subject to a remedy under the national law.

Applicability of rules adopted in the interest of the general good

Services

The case law of the European Court of Justice has already laid down a
number of requirements on the national provisions which may be applied
to undertakings exercising the freedom to supply services. These must
not only be in the general good but also be:

- non-discriminatory;
- objectively necessary; and
- proportionate to the objective pursued.

In addition, the interest of the general good must not be safeguarded
by rules to which the service provider is already subject in the Member
State of establishment (non-duplication).

Finally, any restrictions on the grounds of the general good must be in
fields which are not the subject of EU-level harmonisation.
Harmonisation by Directive has already established what the Commission
calls the "Community general good". Thus, for example, national
measures on own funds, the solvency ratio, deposit guarantees or large
exposures cannot be justified on general good grounds because of the
Directives on these issues.

The Draft Communication then states that the Second Banking Directive
adds nothing new to this case law as far as freedom to provide services
is concerned.

Establishment

The European Court of Justice case law is essentially the same in the
field of establishment, with the additional rule that a national
provision which is discriminatory against branches of institutions of
other Member States may be justified on the grounds of public policy,
public security and public health.

The case law has recognised a number of areas as being covered by the
concept of the general good. Those relevant to the financial services
sector are:

- protection of recipients of services;
- protection of workers;
- protection of consumers;
- preservation of the good reputation of the national financial
  sector;
- the prevention of fraud;
- social order;
- protection of intellectual property;
- the cohesion of the tax system.

This list could be added to by the Court of Justice.

Measures in these areas would have to be justified on the grounds of
the interest of the general good and also respect the principles of
Community law already cited under services, that is, non-
discrimination, non-duplication, necessity and proportionality.

There then follows a rather theoretical and legalistic discussion
leading to the conclusion that:

"depending on the circumstances, the same restriction applied in the
interest of the general good could be adjudged proportionate in respect
of a branch, but disproportionate in respect of a service provider."

That is followed by a long and equally legalistic passage on the link
between rules governing the interest of the general good and law
applicable to banking contracts.

By determining the law applicable to a banking contract, it is possible
to establish the law applicable to the service proposed by the bank.
This raises the relationship between the mutual recognition provisions
of the Second Banking Directive and the rules laid down in the 1980
Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations.

There is, of course, an important issue here. If the Rome Convention
has the result that the law applicable to a banking contract is that of
the home Member State, can the host Member State then apply its general
good rules to the bank's operations on its territory, as it should be
able to do under the Second Directive?

The Commission's answer to this is that the Directive's mutual
recognition principle should be given effect through a three- stage
process:

- the law applicable to a banking contract should be established on the
basis of the Rome Convention;

- it should then be established whether the result of that first step
constitutes an obstacle to mutual recognition;

- if there is no obstacle, then the host Member State law would apply
to the banking contract without further ado. If there is an obstacle,
the host Member State law would only apply if that can be justified by
the general good and if the European Court's criteria for application
of general good measures are met.

Conclusions

The Draft Communication ends with three conclusions.

Firstly, the Commission does not believe that a banking activity can be
carried on under the same conditions in home and host Member States,
whatever the circumstances. Host country civil, criminal, tax or labour
laws will apply to the branch or foreign service provider as these are
not affected by the Second Directive.

Secondly, non-discriminatory restrictions applying to the service
itself must, however, satisfy the general good test (and the
accompanying principles of proportionality etc) regardless of whether
the banking service is provided through a branch or from another Member
State under the freedom to supply services.

Here, the Commission makes specific reference to restrictions applying
to:

1) the intrinsic features of the service such as cost, interest rates,
duration, contractual terms and conditions;

2) the underlying financial techniques; and

3) the way the service is marketed, such as advertising, canvassing
etc.

Finally, application of the proportionality principle to measures
justified in the interest of the common good will produce varying
results for credit institutions operating in another Member State under
the freedom to supply services or through a branch.

MORE DETAILS ON NEW APPROACHES TO THE HARMONISATION OF ACCOUNTING

THE NOVEMBER 1995 issue of EU Financial Industry Monitor reported
comments by Commissioner Mario Monti on the possibility of adopting a
new approach to accounting standards. Since then, he has obtained from
his Commission colleagues approval for a Communication entitled
Accounting harmonisation: a new strategy vis-a-vis international
harmonisation. This is essentially a discussion document, although it
sets out fairly clearly what the Commission intends doing.

The Communication starts by setting out the reasons for a new strategy:

- the known shortcomings of the existing EU legislation. The
derogations and Member State options which have detracted from
harmonisation under the basic Fourth and Seventh Directives - on
company accounts and consolidated accounts respectively - have been
carried forward into the Bank Accounts Directive and the Insurance
Accounts Directive;

- the absence of progress on harmonisation since these measures were
adopted and the unlikelihood of new legislation. The Communication
reports that a conference in 1990 brought out a clear preference for
not adopting new legislation in the near future;

- the problems faced by large European companies seeking capital on the
international markets. In particular, companies seeking capital on the
New York Stock Exchange have to draw up separate accounts according to
US Generally Accepted Accounting Practices since accounts drawn up
according to European standards are not accepted in the US, although
the reverse is the case;

- the importance of the international harmonisation process and the
danger that in the present situation Europe can contribute little to
this process and then face problems of compatibility between its
standards and international ones.

After setting out these problems, the Commission Communication briefly
cites several solutions which have been aired with the Member States:
amending the Directives so as to exempt large listed companies and let
them follow other rules, negotiating a mutual recognition agreement
with the US, setting up a European Accounting Standard Setting Body.
All of these are rejected for one reason or another.

The Communication then sets out the Commission's proposed approach,
which will have to gain the explicit support and agreement of the
Member States. It emphasises that this new approach does not involve
the EU abandoning the field of accounting harmonisation but, on the
contrary, strengthens "its commitment and contribution to the
international standard-setting process, which offers the most efficient
and rapid solution for the problems of companies operating on a world-
wide scale".

The Commission's proposed approach consists of four steps.

Checking the conformity of existing international accounting standards
with the accounting directives

This is a priority, given the urgent issue of European companies
seeking listings on international capital markets.

The Contact Committee on the Accounting Directives, set up by the
Fourth Directive, would examine the compatibility of the IAS with the
Directives. Conformity is an essential first step if the Member States
are to allow their large companies to prepare accounts on an IAS basis.

The Communication points out that the Member States would have to go
through the same exercise for their national laws because of the
options in the EU Directives. An IAS could be compatible with the
Directives but not with national law.

Inconsistencies between the Directives and IAS would have to be
examined case-by-case so as to resolve conflicts. The International
Accounting Standards Committee could be asked to change the standard in
question (the IASC executive has expressed its willingness to consider
changes) but, if necessary, the Commission would propose changes to the
Directives. To that end, the Commission believes that serious
consideration should be given to an accelerated procedure for amending
the Directives by a committee.

European contributions to the work of the IASC

To ensure EU input to the IASC, the Contact Committee should examine
IASC Exposure Drafts and try to reach agreed positions on them. The
agreed positions would be sent to the IASC. In this way, the Commission
believes that the EU can build up a position of influence, possibly
even extending to IASC agenda fixing.

This would involve enlarging the role of the Contact Committee and the
Commission favours the setting-up of technical sub- committees.

Priority would be given to consolidated accounts for two reasons.
Firstly, it is those companies which prepare consolidated accounts
which are most exposed to the problems described in the Communication.
Secondly, a general approach covering individual company accounts would
be more likely to raise problems with the Member States because of the
link between company accounts and taxation.

Improving the comparability of accounts

The Contact Committee should increase its efforts in this area by
dealing with practical problems in the application of the Directives.
For its part, the Commission will co-operate with the Contact Committee
with a view to improving coordination among the Member State bodies
involved in standard-setting.

The Commission might, for example, incorporate the advice of the
Contact Committee in interpretative communications or recommendations.
Where appropriate, it would publicise the work of the Contact
Committee.

The Directives under the new approach

The new approach can only operate within the limits laid down by the
Directives. Therefore, if it proves necessary, the Commission will
propose amending directives, although it would clearly prefer to avoid
that course and hopes that legislation can be avoided in most instances
by "effective technical co- operation" in the Contact Committee.

To that end, it is essential that all institutions involved in
accounting standard-setting are involved in Committee's work.

Similarly, the Commission considers that there should be co- ordination
between the Committee and the Accounting Advisory Forum, which
represents users and preparers of accounts and which at present is
purely consultative.

Contact Committee members could attend Forum meetings and the Forum's
expertise could be "associated" with the Committee's technical work.

The Communication ends with a conclusion that"The Union needs to move
promptly to offer the users and preparers of accounts a clear prospect
that companies seeking listings on the US and other world markets will
be able to remain within the EU accounting framework and that the US
GAAP, over which they and their governments can exercise no influence,
is not the only option".

COMMISSION CONSUMER DG PLANS DATABASE OF BANKING PRICE STRUCTURES

THE COMMISSION'S Directorate-General for Consumer Policy (DG XXIV)
plans to set up a database to compare the national price structures of
banking services and follow their evolution. It published an invitation
to tender for a study to this end in the Official Journal C 233 of 7
September.

The invitation to tender, in its description of the proposed study,
states:

"Some banking services which were in the past apparently free of charge
for consumers are now explicitly charged and some are becoming rather
expensive. On the basis of information from several Member States, the
price of these services is increasing faster than the rate of
inflation. The introduction of a single currency will also imply a new
cost structure for some of these services (for example, cross-border
transactions)."

DG XXIV, therefore, aims to create an instrument to compare Member
State price structures and to follow their evolution. The instrument
will be set up before the end of this year and updated annually. It
will cover the management of consumer bank accounts and related
operations in all 15 Member States.

The first stage of the study will be to determine for each of the
Member States the typical use of a bank account by the consumer or
group of consumers and to establish the average cost to these consumers
of the typical use.

Since national habits vary - the relative use of cheques, bank
transfers, debit cards, credit cards, etc - the study will have to
ensure comparability of study results.

All costs borne by consumers will be covered by the study, including
annual administration charges, transaction fees, interest lost through
deferred value dates, consumer credit linked to credit cards and
overdrafts.

COMMISSION PROPOSES NEW LIST OF EXCLUSIONS FROM BANKING DIRECTIVES

THE 1977 First Banking Directive contains in its Article 2(2) a list of
institutions which are definitively excluded from the field of
application of the Directive.

Article 2(2) provides for amendment of the list by the Council on a
proposal from the Commission after consultation of the Banking Advisory
Committee.

On November 11 last, the Commission submitted a proposal for amendment
at the request of Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Finland, all of which wish deletion from the Article 2(2)
of specific institutions whose exclusion from the scope of the
Directive is no longer justified.

Austria, on the other hand, requested an addition to the list.

The Commission has consulted the Banking Advisory Committee and the non-
European Union countries of the European Economic Area (Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway), since the Banking Directives are binding on
them also. (see table on page 8 in the hard copy)

UK:  EX-BINDER PARTNERS FACE RUIN AFTER RECORD DAMAGES AWARD

UP TO 150 former partners of BDO Binder Hamlyn could face financial
ruin following a record damages award by the High Court totalling #105
million ($160 million), including interest and costs.

The sum relates to the 1990 takeover of one of the firm's audit
clients, and the damages of #65 million are believed to be the highest
ever awarded against a UK accounting firm.

During the court case, counsel for Binder said the firm had insurance
cover of #71 million, leaving #34 million of the award to be met from
the partners' personal assets. With between 120 and 150 partners
believed to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000
per partner.

The action related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADT
for Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million for
Britannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989 which had been
audited by Binder.

Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profits
were #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assets
were less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT was
eventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit against
Binder in 1992.

The judge in the case found that Binder had been negligent in its audit
of Britannia, and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADT
because of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off on
the accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.

At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop was
asked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accounts
gave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishop
replied that he did.

Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted a
duty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,
verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for any
advice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which held
that auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties regardless of
whether they are negligent.

Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it will
succeed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparo
principles apply," a spokesman said. The appeal, which will not begin
until next year, could take a year or more to run its course.

BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of the
firm, which still uses the Binder Hamlyn name, joined the Arthur
Andersen Worldwide Organisation (EA 49). Bishop is still with Binder
Hamlyn in London.

Most of Binder's regional offices merged with Stoy Hayward (EA 46),
which subsequently became BDO's UK member firm, while some partners
joined other accounting firms or went into industry. Binder Hamlyn is
still trying to determine exactly how many partners are liable in the
Britannia case.

SPAIN:  C&L HIT BY MASS CONSULTING EXODUS TO E&Y

COOPERS & LYBRAND in Spain has been rocked by the defection of about 80
consulting staff, including head of department Jose Ramon Magarzo, to
Ernst & Young.

The exodus began on November 16, when Magarzo and another five of C&L's
12 consulting partners announced they were leaving for E&Y along with
three senior consultants. Since then, a further 70 consulting staff
have jumped ship.

The defections, which took C&L completely by surprise, are a blow to
the firm's consulting business, which reported revenues of Pta2.67
billion ($22 million) in 1995 - nearly three times that of E&Y.
According to a C&L spokesperson, the consulting practice had just
returned to profit after several difficult years during Spain's
recession.

Magarzo has already taken up his new position as managing director of
E&Y Consultores, replacing Michael McKay who becomes associate managing
director. In all, the first batch of nine people who left C&L have been
made partners at E&Y.

"This was part of a plan we started a couple of years ago when I came
from the US, and that was to increase the size of E&Y in Spain," McKay
said. "It became clear to us that to achieve the growth, we needed to
become a competitive force. We couldn't do it through internal growth,
we needed external resources at a senior level. That included bringing
in as managing director a Spaniard who would run the practice."

E&Y used an executive search firm to identify potential hires, but did
not specifically target C&L, McKay said. He said the former C&L
partners were attracted to E&Y in part because Ernst & Young
Consultores is a separate firm with its own profit pool.

The raid is not E&Y's first attempt to build a strong consulting arm in
Spain. Two previous efforts - the creation of a consulting division
when Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young merged in 1989 and the 1993
establishment of E&Y Consultores with financial backing from E&Y in the
US - were not as successful as the firm would have liked.

Although head-hunting is not rare, the scale of E&Y's raid is
unprecedented and has been perceived by C&L as a direct attempt to
steal a large slice of its business and seriously damage the firm. C&L
is reported to be taking legal action against E&Y and the former
partners.

It accuses E&Y of breaching Spain's fair trade laws and of inducing C&L
staff to break their legal commitments to the firm by offering them
financial compensation to leave without giving the required 15 days'
notice.

McKay denied this. "We believe we have acted in accordance with the
laws and contractual obligations of all the people," he said. "The
people who have joined us have joined of their own free will and
exercised their professional rights in the marketplace."

E&Y also denies trying to steal C&L's business and has offered to
`lend' C&L its former consultants to finish work already in hand, an
offer which C&L described as cynical and not worthy of consideration.

NORWAY:  MRI'S LOCAL FIRM MERGES WITH NEXIA MEMBER

MOORES ROWLAND International's Norwegian affiliate, RevisorGruppen AS,
has beefed up its national coverage by merging with AS Revision
Noraudit, the local member firm of Nexia International. MRI has also
signed up a correspondent firm in Finland.

The new firm, to be known as Revision Noraudit & Co AS, will have
revenues of roughly NKr160 million ($27 million), a figure which will
give it sixth place in the local rankings ahead of Price Waterhouse and
behind the other Big Six affiliates. The staff figure totals around
250, including 48 partners, and the new firm will operate out of 17
offices.

The merger was "purely" driven by national considerations, according to
Kjetil Rivelsrud, chairman of the new firm and formerly executive
chairman of Noraudit. "We'd made a decision that we had to make a
merger in Norway to strengthen our coverage," he said. "We talked with
RevisorGruppen about a merger and the result was that we had to choose
one of the [international] groups. RevisorGruppen had more referred
work for Norway than Nexia, so we decided that MRI was the better
choice."

Rivelsrud said the merger is a good strategic fit. His firm is strong
in Oslo and the northern part of the country, while the MRI affiliate
is well represented in Bergen and Stavangar in the west of the country.

RevisorGruppen, the smaller of the two firms, comprised a network of 11
offices, two of which - Molde and Horten - have opted out of the
merger. Those practices accounted for revenues of between NKr10 million
and NKr15 million, Rivelsrud said.

Revision Noraudit's fiscal 1994 revenues totalled NKr119 million. One
associated firm, with revenues of NKr5 million, has opted out of the
merger, while Nexia Consulting AS, which is partly owned by the
auditing firm, is also remaining independent of the new firm.

Noraudit previously represented Deloitte Haskins & Sells, but opted out
of the global merger with Touche Ross in 1990. It joined forces with
Nexia in 1992, and last year changed its name from Deloitte Noraudit
following a legal dispute with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International
over the use of the Deloitte name. Rivelsrud said the two sides
resolved the dispute through an out- of-court settlement.

Noraudit's defection naturally leaves Nexia with a gap in its European
coverage."They felt they had to do a merger locally," said Nigel
Hodges, Nexia's executive director. Hodges admitted that Nexia does not
refer much work into Norway and said the group will use the services of
Ola Petter Hopp, a former senior manager at Noraudit now operating as a
consultant, until a new member can be found.

Meanwhile, in Finland, MRI has linked up with Tilimerkono, a two-
partner Helsinki-based firm with revenues of $500,000. The firm, which
has nine staff, was recommended by MRI's Danish member, City Revision
A/S, and will help MRI expand into the Baltic countries, according to
John Cox, the network's executive director. The Helsinki practice was
previously unaffiliated.

JERSEY TO OFFER PARTNERS LIMITED LIABILITY

THE UK member firms of Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young look set to
be the first to take advantage of a proposed law in Jersey that will
let professionals form limited liability partnerships (LLP) on the
island.

Details of the draft law were announced on December 11 by the Finance
and Economics Committee of the States of Jersey, the island's
Parliament. It will be debated by Jersey legislators in the first
quarter of 1996 and, if approved, will then go to the UK Privy Council
for sanctioning. The measure is expected to become law before the end
of the year.

Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the Jersey
proposal. Solicitors, architects and surveyors will also be able to
establish partnerships on the island, as could practices from other
countries.

Under the proposed law, which was devised in consultation with PW and
E&Y, the LLP would remain totally liable for all the firm's debts, but
individual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligent
act would have their personal assets protected from debts arising from
that negligence.

Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner and all
LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP would
be required to put up a #5 million ($8 million) bond for judgments
against the partnership.

"We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liability
partnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Y
senior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number of
clients and all of our partners have produced a very positive
reaction." Privately, E&Y sources said the firm plans to move to LLP
status as soon as possible.

"At the moment, if you're found to be liable for negligence, then
you're liable for everything, no matter what your contribution to that
negligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.

All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales in trying to get the government to
change the UK legal principle of joint and several liability. "This
can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things take time and time
is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime, the firms need a way
to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.

Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law for
partnerships, which was created in 1907, as "not relevant to modern
times". Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary
legislation would be needed to change it, he said.

The proposal allows E&Y and PW to maintain their partnership culture
within the UK and there will be no change to their UK taxation
arrangements. The Jersey option is claimed to be cheaper than the
incorporation route chosen recently by KPMG (EA 60). A senior partner
at one of the firms estimates the saving could be as much as 10 percent
of pre-tax profits compared with the cost of KPMG's chosen route.

However, some KPMG sources raised doubts over how effective the LLP
option will be in preventing potential litigants in the UK from
pursuing a partnership registered in Jersey through the British courts.

KPMG's senior partner Colin Sharman declined to comment on the legal
advice his firm had received. "When we made our decision to incorporate
we were aware of the Jersey option and we discounted it," he said. "For
a number of reasons - one of which was the degree of security we were
looking for - we elected to go the route we have."

UNITED KINGDOM:  BANK AUSTRIA SUES PW OVER ACQUISITION ADVICE

THE LONDON office of Price Waterhouse is being sued for damages of #146
million ($220 million) by Bank Austria over its role in advising the
bank on a UK acquisition which turned sour.

The suit relates to the bank's purchase of a 51 percent stake in
Sovereign Leasing in 1990. The Manchester-based company, which was
owned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and Martin Harrison, was mainly
involved in leasing cars, property and computer equipment.

Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its
1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45
million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.

Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a due
diligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate finance
advice in connection with the transaction.

In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:
"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations and
advice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceed
with the acquisition.

"It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisition,
Sovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the way
it was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position been
revealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not have
proceeded with the acquisition."

In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions of
Sch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing and, in 1992, forced the
resignations of three former OLB directors over the performance of its
UK operations.

However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted a
real due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said the
firm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisition
took place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuation
at the time of the purchase.

"We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defend
them," Hainsworth said.

The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The case
could take two years to be heard.

CODE DEMANDS SCRUTINY OF HIGH-RISK CLIENTS

NEW REGULATIONS in Germany have introduced a Big Six-style  approach
that requires all of the country's auditors to adopt a risk-based
approach to their work.

The new requirements have been jointly issued by the
Wirtschaftspruferkammer (WPK), the state auditing body run by the
federal minister of economics, and the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer
(IdW), the private professional body that represents Germany's 6,000
accountants.

In future, all statutory auditors will have to analyse their clients'
operating environments, assess the influence of general risk factors,
make a provisional judgement about inherent business risk, and evaluate
internal control procedures.

The risk-based approach, long used by the Big Six in Germany and
elsewhere, has now become part of the official guidelines which state
that "the high-risk audit areas should be given greater weight in the
audit process".

The new guidelines form part of a revised code of conduct on audit
quality. The code, which was last amended in 1982, has been updated in
an attempt to dissuade the justice ministry in Bonn from introducing
tougher legislative controls on auditors. For the first time, the
profession's quality guidelines cover voluntary audits, tax advice,
consultancy and expert advisory work, as well as statutory audits.

Outgoing IdW president Dietrich Dorner said the profession remains
strongly in favour of self-regulation. "We don't want to wait until the
authorities and the government take the reins," he said. "We don't want
state regulation." But he acknowledged that recent controversies about
audit quality in Germany have led the justice ministry to consider
tougher regulation of the profession.

WPK president Gerhard Burret acknowledged that there had been
shortcomings in all of the practice areas covered by the new rules. In
particular, the rules are stricter on auditor independence; auditors
are required to disclose financial, personal and shareholder links with
their clients.

The rules require auditors to ensure that their work is reviewed by a
suitably-qualified colleague (the so-called double-signature
principle). Dorner said the principle was equally binding on sole
practitioners. "These accountants usually have links with other
practitioners and I expect they will use them to fulfil this
requirement," he said.

Separately, Dorner commented on the growing acceptance of International
Accounting Standards (IAS) by German companies. The IdW recently
produced a dual-language guide to IAS for members of the profession and
their clients. Dorner believes IAS will inevitably become generally
accepted in Germany even though they contradict some of the main tenets
of the country's commercial code. "Our principle of prudence is a sound
one, but it is evident which way things will go," he said. "We won't be
able to avoid IAS."

Yet Dorner does not agree that the German profession would be able to
exert more influence on the formulation of IAS by having an Anglo Saxon-
style standard-setting body. "I'm not optimistic that [such a body]
would be any better than what we have at the moment," he said."It would
pronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effect
would be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."

GOVERNMENT WARNS PROFESSION ON SELF-REGULATION

THE GERMAN government has served notice on the local accounting
profession that it must vastly improve its self-regulation if it is not
to have practice rules imposed by law.

Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingen
in early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting standards at
the Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputy
chairman of the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).

Biener was dismissive of the profession's new quality standards,
introduced just a few days earlier (see story above). Even under the
new rules, he said, German accountants are still not obliged to
actively seek out evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts.

"The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said.
"Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The law
allows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obliged
to argue things out with the company."

Biener also criticised the IdW's main practice committee for its late
discovery of shortcomings in the switch to International Accounting
Standards by Bayer, Schering and Heidelberger Zement for their 1994
accounts. Gross countered that it would have been unfeasible for the
committee to intervene any earlier, but that the changes suggested by
the committee would be incorporated in the companies' 1995 accounts.

Biener acknowledged that the leading accounting firms in Germany are
world-class, but expressed concern about the rank-and-file of the
profession. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise to
audits which are just average; rather they should allow accountants
with an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which is
up to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died out
because they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession has
grasped that message."

German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regain
public confidence, particularly as a result of the bad publicity
surrounding Daimler-Benz's accounts. As the only German company with a
New York listing, Daimler is obliged to publish not only German-style
accounts, but a reconciliation to US GAAP as well. That has resulted in
huge discrepancies between the two figures, particularly in the
company's 1993 accounts.

"Our audits have become suspect," Biener said. "Sooner or later German
accounts will no longer be accepted by the international community."

Companies' accounting departments, rather than accounting firms, should
provide the impetus for the regulation of accounting practice, said
Biener. Accounting firms have their own commercial interests to
consider, and may be reluctant to push for change. He therefore
suggested that German, and in turn European companies, set up a
regulatory body modelled on the Financial Accounting Standards Board in
the US.

In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea. "I
won't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] body
operates in a sensible fashion," he said.

TWO FIRMS MERGE AS GRANT THORNTON ITALIA

ITALAUDIT AND Hodgson Landau Brands, two of Italy's largest firms, have
merged their activities under the Grant Thornton umbrella.

The new firm should now rank eighth in the Italian rankings behind the
Big Six and the Mazars & Guerard affiliate. Combined auditing revenues
for 1996 are expected to total L15 billion ($9 million).

The alliance was approved by Consob, Italy's bourse watchdog, at the
end of September and will formally take effect early in 1996. The firm
will operate as Grant Thornton Italia, although it was the partners of
Hodgson Landau Brands, the HLB International affiliate, who made the
first move.

The new firm's partners will own 90 percent of the shares, while the
remaining 10 percent will remain in the hands of Centrobanca,
Italaudit's owner. Recent legislation obliged Italian banks to reduce
their shareholdings in auditing firms to below 50 percent by the end of
1995.

Lorenzo Penca, managing partner of Hodgson Landau Brands, will be
president of the new firm while Claudio Muollo, the head of Italaudit,
is moving to lead Grant Thornton's consultancy arm -in Italy, the two
divisions have to be kept legally separate.

Penca said the merger will enable the firms to keep pace with the
competition. "This was an opportunity we could not pass up," he said.
"Auditing firms in Italy that do not grow will find it increasingly
difficult to survive. With this merger we have established a highly-
professional auditing body with a solid base and a recognised
international name which will distinguish us from the smaller firms in
Italy. Our view is that there will eventually be only ten auditing
groups [authorised to audit listed companies] in the country and this
is our way of ensuring that we are one of them."

Previously, Hodgson Laundau Brands was ninth in the rankings, with fee
income of L7.5 billion, while Italaudit was placed 12th with revenues,
including consulting, of roughly L6 billion.

The firm will have more than 70 staff with 11 partners. Clients include
Italian dairy producer, Parmalat, two leading football clubs, an
Italian drugs company, publishers, fashion houses such as Gianfranco
Ferre, and a clutch of Italian banks.

"We may not be able to compete with the Big Six on size, but we can
certainly match them for image and professionalism," Penca said. "There
are only a small number of groups in Italy whose accounts Grant
Thornton Italia would not be in a position to audit, which leaves a lot
of potential business. The trend for smaller companies to seek stock
market listings is very encouraging and we will be looking to exploit
the situation to the full."

The merger is a blow to the HLB International network. The Italian firm
was HLB's 15th-largest member and referred out "a reasonable amount" of
work, according to Peter Frost, the group's London-based chief
executive. "The move was driven by their desire for a merger at
national level," Frost said."We are looking at one or two alternatives
at the moment."

MID-TIER BODY PUTS BRAVE FACE ON DEFECTIONS

AIRE, THE association that represents local audit firms in Italy, is
putting a brave face on a series of defections that have left it with
just four members licensed to audit listed companies by bourse
regulator Consob.

The departing members have all rejoined Assirevi, the auditing
profession's long-standing representative body. Assirevi had come to be
regarded as almost exclusively a Big Six organisation since the smaller
firms broke away to form Aire in the late 1980s.

Vittorio Salvi, head of Milan-based Sofiresa, which recently quit Aire,
cited two reasons for firms returning to the fold. "It has happened
partly because of the growth of international affiliation among Italian
firms, but also because Assirevi carries more weight with banks and
Consob," he said. "The reasons for starting Aire for Italian auditing
firms have been overtaken by events." Sofiresa is a member of Summit
International.

Hodgson Landau Brands, which recently merged with Italaudit to form
Grant Thornton Italia (see above story), was one of the few mid-tier
firms not to join Aire. Dino Mangiarotti, senior partner at the new
firm and a director of Assirevi, is convinced of the value of Assirevi
membership. "Firms wishing to audit listed companies in Italy benefit
greatly from the international name and the status of being part of
Assirevi," he said. "It distinguishes these companies from the other,
smaller firms."

Aire president Fausto Vitucci does not dispute the differing roles of
the two associations but is convinced that Aire still has an essential
role to play for auditors in Italy.

"The listed company audit market is limited in Italy and an
exceptionally high number of non-listed companies will request audits,"
he said. "The problem is how this market is divided. Smaller firms are
better suited to auditing smaller companies, particularly in terms of
costs. It seems unreasonable that the largest firms seek to impose
their brands on this end of the market because it raises fees to an
unacceptable level for many small companies."

Vitucci said the Italian market is different from others in several
ways. The stock market is small relative to the size of the economy and
audit work is more seasonal than in other countries. The big firms, he
claimed, are forced to seek work at the lower end of the market to keep
their partners busy all year round.

Recent legislative changes have required all auditors to officially
register with the authorities - more than 65,000 have since done so. On
the other hand, there is no clear regulatory authority for the non-
listed market unless the work is performed by a Consob-authorised firm.
Vitucci said Aire can provide support for smaller audit firms and
ensure that standards are maintained at the lower end of the market.

Vitucci's firm, First Professional Audit, is applying for Consob
authorisation, a step which, he said, improves auditors' status even if
they do not plan to audit listed companies. Sofiresa, for example, is
also Consob-approved although it currently has no quoted audit clients.

UK JUDGE DISMISSES NAMES' CASE AGAINST LITTLEJOHN

THE HIGH Court in London has thrown out a #200 million ($300 million)
negligence suit against IA International's UK member firm, Littlejohn
Frazer.

The suit was brought by investors in the Lloyd's of London insurance
market and related to Littlejohn's audits of the Gooda Walker
underwriting syndicate, which ran up losses of almost #1 billion in the
late 1980s and early 1990s.

In October 1994, the 3,000 investors, or Names, won about #400 million
in damages from the agency that managed their underwriting. The Names
then sued the auditor for negligence, claiming that the syndicates'
accounts had disguised underwriting losses by overstating the value of
their investments. The Names said they would not have invested in later
years had they known of the losses.

The High Court decided that the precedents established in the 1990
Caparo case applied. Whether or not Littlejohn was negligent in
auditing the syndicate was irrelevant as no duty of care was owed to
future investors at Lloyd's. The Names are expected to appeal the
decision.

The case is a setback to attempts by Lloyd's to organise a market-wide
out-of-court settlement of all the litigation that has dogged the
market for the last three years. Names are seeking damages for the
estimated #11 billion of losses run up by the market since 1988. There
is now less pressure on the auditors to contribute to the proposed #2.8
billion settlement fund (EA 56).

IRISH FIRMS TO ESTABLISH FORMAL CROSS-BORDER LINK

INCREASED BUSINESS optimism arising from the Northern Ireland peace
process has prompted McGrath & Co, the Republic of Ireland member of
ACPA International, to establish a formal alliance with Belfast firm
MTF.

McGrath has worked with MTF on a number of projects since the peace
process began at the end of August 1994. Although it previously covered
the entire island for ACPA, an increase in outside investment into the
north, particularly from the US, has created the need for
representation there.

"The peace process has set it all in motion," said McGrath managing
partner Tom Kavanagh. "We've already seen a rise in inward investment
and this can only increase."

McGrath was attracted to MTF because of its specialty in mergers and
acquisitions, an area which the Dublin firm is not particularly strong
in.

McGrath reported revenues of IR#1.75 million ($2.8 million) in 1995.
Kavanagh estimates MTF's 1995 revenues at about IR#750,000. Combined
fee income at both firms is expected to reach IR#2.7 million in 1996.

KPMG'S GERMAN MEMBER LOSES SENIOR PARTNER

JOSEF LANFERMANN, senior partner of KPMG Deutsche Treuhand since 1991,
has taken the German profession by surprise with his decision to leave
the firm at the end of December.

Although health problems were the main reason for his departure, 57-
year-old Lanfermann will continue to practise as an accountant under
his own name. Rather than appointing a new senior partner immediately,
the supervisory board asked its chairman, Hans Havermann, to step into
the breach for an interim period of two years. Havermann was previously
senior partner between 1985 and 1991 and chairman of KPMG International
until September 1995.

Separately, KPMG Germany said it expects gross revenues in 1995 to rise
5 percent to about DM1.17 billion ($800 million). Profits will also
improve, the firm said, without giving details. This growth was largely
the result of "initial successes" in KPMG's efforts to put greater
emphasis on consulting work, it added.

Meanwhile, provisional figures from C&L Deutsche Revision indicate that
the Coopers & Lybrand member has drawn almost level with KPMG as the
largest accounting firm in Germany. Partner Horst Goldbach told EA that
group fee income expanded by 9.5 percent to about DM1.14 billion in
1995. Although fee income was up in all divisions, growth was
particularly strong in consultancy work, he said.

GRANT THORNTON FORTIFIES LINKS WITH POLISH FIRM

GRANT THORNTON International has strengthened its links with Polish
firm Potworowski Kinast, a GTI representative since 1993.

Potworowski's UK office, with ten staff and annual revenues of about
#500,000, merged fully with Grant Thornton's West London office on
December 1.

Grant Thornton country managing partner David McDonnell said his firm
has supplied Potworowski with training and support since the Polish arm
joined GTI. "The intention always was that the [London firm] would join
us at some stage," he said.

Acquiring Potworowski, with its strong roots in the Polish community,
ties in with the West London office's strategy of targeting certain
ethnic groups in the capital, McDonnell said.

The latest deal brings to eight the number of firms which have merged
with Grant Thornton in the last 18 months. "We are actively seeking
further acquisitions over the next year," McDonnell said. Grant
Thornton is in preliminary talks with a number of local firms, none of
which are linked to a national network, he said.

BALSAM/PROCEDO TRIAL TO AWAIT CRIMINAL VERDICT

MORE THAN a year after a group of German banks announced a claim of
DM250 million ($175 million) against Price Waterhouse, the
Balsam/Procedo lawsuit has finally opened in Frankfurt.

But after examining evidence and hearing preliminary arguments, the
judge quickly proposed an adjournment of the case until after former
executives of the two companies, plus former PW partner Rolf Muscat,
have been tried on charges of criminal fraud.

The group trial is expected to begin in April and may last for several
years because the evidence is so complex. The prosecution hopes to
prove that the former executives carried out fraudulent paper
transactions - worth billions of marks - between Balsam and Procedo and
thus caused the collapse of both companies. Muscat, who advised both
companies, is accused of "deliberate involvement" with the alleged
frauds.

Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his case
against PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partners
acted intentionally, rather than just negligently. But he is unwilling
to delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to a prolonged
adjournment. The court was scheduled to reconvene on December 19 to
make a final decision on the adjournment, after both sides had
consulted with their clients.

The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of"intentional misconduct"
in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approving
the accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added a
new claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval without
actually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.

ICAEW, CIMA MERGER MAY COST 130 JOBS

A MERGER of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
(ICAEW) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA)
could result in the shedding of 130 jobs as the two bodies seek to
rationalise costs.

Details of the cuts were revealed in the prospectus for the merger,
which was published in early December after being approved by the
governing councils of both bodies.

The new organisation, to be known simply as the Institute of Chartered
Accountants, has budgeted to save 20 percent of the combined costs of
the two existing bodies, which employ 630 people between them. ICAEW
chief executive Andrew Colquhoun said efficiencies will be possible as
a result of the inevitable duplication of services currently being
provided by the two.

Colquhoun said the job cuts will be phased in over five years. He
expects few compulsory redundancies since staff turnover at the ICAEW
is currently running at 10 percent to 15 percent.

The savings will allow the institute to reduce its #138 ($210) annual
subscription fee by #20, bringing it closer into line with the #110
currently charged by CIMA.

However, Colquhoun denied that cost savings are the main motive behind
the merger. "We are not promoting this on the financial issue," he
said. "We are promoting this because the environment for the profession
is becoming harder and we believe we can serve the interests of
accountants better by being bigger."

The new body will offer two types of qualification: one aimed at those
training in public practice, who will continue to be known as
"chartered accountants"; and the other for those working in industry,
who will bear the title "chartered management accountant".

There will be a four-stage education syllabus, consisting of two
foundation levels, an intermediate stage and a final level. Students
will be time barred if they do not pass their final exams within seven
years of starting the foundation course. Students will be able to
accumulate exam credits at all levels except the final one.

The "England and Wales" part of the current ICAEW name will be dropped
in an attempt to give the new body a global image. "This is not
marketing for its own sake, but we believe we can offer a high-quality
qualification around the world," Colquhoun said. "They will have to
meet the standards we have here in the UK, but we do think there is a
market out there for our qualification."

The new institute will have nine regions in England and Wales, each of
which will be able to elect six members to the new council: three from
industry and three from practice. The exception will be London which
will elect 14 members.

There will be further elections in Scotland, Ireland and in other
countries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Africa. Members of both
institutes are expected to vote on the merger proposal in April or May.

Meanwhile, CIMA has gained Privy Council approval for its members to
use the individual description of "chartered management accountant"
with immediate effect. According to a statement from CIMA, the new
designation"should enable the members of both bodies to consider the
merger proposals on their true merits, as there would be no change of
title for the members of either body".

ACCA CRITIC CALLS REFORM PLAN INSUFFICIENT

EAST LONDON University professor Prem Sikka has said plans for the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) to give increased
representation to its overseas members do not go far enough in making
the body democratic.

While welcoming the proposals, Sikka, a long-time critic of the way the
ACCA is run, called for more transparency within the association, open
meetings of its governing council, and access to agenda papers and
minutes. He also repeated his demand for the ACCA president and vice-
president to be elected by the association's members. "Basically, the
people who are leading the organisation need to be mandated," he said.

The plan to disband the current London-based council and replace it
with a federal structure was put forward by ACCA chief executive Anthea
Rose at a council meeting in early December. The proposed structure
devolves power to a number of new regional councils, which will in turn
report to an international committee. Sikka has argued that the
association's 18,000 overseas members - 40 percent of the total - are
effectively disenfranchised.

A discussion document outlining the proposals was sent to all ACCA
members on December 15.

An ACCA source said: "It is true the way our council is structured
makes it very difficult for members to play a meaningful role if they
live on the other side of the world. Instead, we are to propose some
form of devolution with a federal structure."

The powers to be devolved will be debated in the discussion document.
These could include direct dealings with regional governments and the
issue of guidance and advice on local auditing, accounting and taxation
matters. It is unlikely that the regional councils will have any
control over ACCA's examination syllabus.

As for Sikka's call for direct presidential elections, the ACCA is not
ruling this out. But a change to the current practice of having the
president elected by the council is not part of the latest proposals.

Meanwhile, the ACCA's application to change its name to the Association
of Chartered Public Accountants has been turned down by the Privy
Council, the body which must approve all changes to an organisation's
Royal Charter.

In a letter to the ACCA, the council said it objected to the use of the
word "public" in the proposed name. However, it had no problem with the
use of the term "chartered".

In submissions to the council earlier this year, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales argued that the name change
would cause confusion with the certified public accountant designation
used in the US. Another vocal critic of the ACCA, Labour Member of
Parliament Austin Mitchell, argued that the association did not act
sufficiently in the public interest for it to merit the title"public".

The ACCA has been asked to come up with a new proposal and expects to
put forward a new name for its members to vote on in the near future.

A SOLUTION TO THE LITIGATION PROBLEM?

UK accounting firms may have found a partial solution to the problems
of litigation without the expense of incorporation. William Gleeson
looks at the implications of two firms' plans to register as LLPs in
Jersey

THE "ACCOUNTANCIES" - the collective noun that some UK newspapers have
started using for accountancy practices - have announced that, for the
time being at least, they are putting their hopes for salvation from
rogue litigants in the hands of the 600-year- old Jersey Parliament.
Or, at least Ernst & Young and Price Waterhouse are.

The Finance and Economics Committee of the States of Jersey - as the
island's Parliament is called - is proposing a new limited liability
partnership (LLP) law, to be debated in the first quarter of the new
year.

If the legislation comes into being, the UK's largest accountancy firms
will be able to re-register in Jersey and, should they be successfully
sued, the personal assets of the partners not directly involved in the
alleged wrongdoing will be protected.

Both E&Y and PW have said the Jersey route is their preferred way to
limit liability. It has the advantage of preserving the partnership
ethos of the firms, and is cheaper than incorporation. The change from
paying national insurance contributions under the rules for the self-
employed to the rules applying to those employed by a company would
mean, in effect, partners would face higher tax rates.

The basis for assessing taxable profits would change as well, with
Accounting Standards Board rules applying to the incorporated entity.
This particularly applies to work in progress which would be given a
higher value, making the income of the practice higher.

But serious question marks hang over the proposals. It is by no means
certain that the laws will have a smooth passage through the States of
Jersey. This body is not a traditional Parliament, and there are no
political parties. Instead, there is an assembly of individuals who
come from a wide cross-section of the community. Current members of the
54-strong body range from a retired stockbroker to a green activist.

Senator Pierre Horsfall, president of the Finance and Economics
Committee, said: "This is not in anyway like a party political system,
where you know you have a majority before you start . .
very meaningful."

Horsfall's seven-man committee has to persuade the other 47 members of
the States of the merits of the case for the new law during one stand-
up debating session.

In the autumn, a bill proposed by the States education committee to
reform the way school pupils are streamed at the age of 14 was thrown
out, forcing the committee to resign.

But limited liability for partnerships should be less of an emotive
issue for the Jersey Parliament than local education. Also, there is a
lot in it for the local economy. Passing this legislation will bring
closer ties between the island and prestigious financial sector
businesses. Of Jersey's 43,000 workers, 9,000, or just over 20 percent,
are employed in the financial services sector.

Whatever happens, the answer will be obtained quickly. Once the process
has passed through the States it must then await the approval of the UK
Privy Council, an honorary body whose role it is, by and large, to
rubberstamp the States' proposals. E&Y has said it hopes to become an
LLP sometime in the second half of next year.

But even if the proposed bill gets through in its current form, doubt
exists as to whether the new law will afford the protection being
sought.

KPMG has received legal advice that the UK courts may refuse to
recognise that Jersey's laws take precedence to UK laws. In essence,
the firm has been advised that if the accountant being sued works and
lives in the UK and signs his audit report "KPMG, London" and the
plaintiff is based in the UK, it seems perfectly reasonable to argue
that the re-registration in Jersey is nothing more than an artificial
ruse to escape the UK courts' jurisdiction.

Colin Sharman, KPMG's senior partner, said: "This law doesn't exist
yet, it is a proposed change. When we were considering it we were aware
that the States of Guernsey was thinking of revising its partnership
law and aware that the States of Jersey was considering doing so. We
have an English law solution to an English law problem which gives us
as much protection as we need."

Indeed, it transpires that KPMG has taken a long hard look not only at
the Channel Islands but at other European jurisdictions - not just the
obvious ones like Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, but France, Germany and
Spain as well.

But there are plenty who hope the cynics are wrong, not least the other
firms - Arthur Andersen and Touche Ross - which are currently sitting
firmly on their hands waiting for some progress.

It is undoubtedly wrong that all the responsibility for corporate
failure is borne by the auditors, with the failed company's management
getting away scot-free.

The firms feel time is against them. The campaign to reform liability
law in the UK is not likely to bear fruit for several years.

The same is true of UK partnership law. The Department of Trade and
Industry is said to be sympathetic to the needs of the accountancy
profession, but it is currently not high on the list of priorities of
either the government or the main opposition parties, especially with a
general election to be held sooner rather than later.

But in the end, this move is not about economic or legal realities. It
is about the psychology of poker players. Potential litigants will now
have to ask how much stronger will off-shore re-registration make the
hand of the accountancies in negligence claims?

As yet, nobody has sued partners in a firm for their homes and the
shirts from their kids' backs - and possibly no rational litigant ever
would. The fear is of the potentially irrational "rogue" litigant. In
future, if the Jersey law goes through, should any person ever think of
being a rogue, they will have to ask"is this worth it, now that the
deep pockets motive has gone?"

EARLY SIGNS OF UPTURN

Danish accounting firms are predicting sustained growth over the next
few years thanks mainly to an improvement in general economic
conditions. Sally Roden reports

ALTHOUGH FEE income growth is still quite modest, Danish accounting
firms believe they have turned a corner after recent years of
recession.

Demand from clients is on the increase, although few partners expect
auditing to drive the recovery. "Competition is still quite
substantial, but the economic recovery is beginning to influence the
profession in a positive direction," said Frank Jakobsen, international
contact partner with Grant Thornton Denmark/Grothen & Perregard.

"For the first time in several years, we are experiencing a lack of
skilled labour, indicating that firms are beginning to feel a rise in
demand."

That said, the latest batch of fee income figures are unlikely to set
pulses racing. Only two of the top ten firms reported revenue increases
of more than 5 percent, and one of those, BDO ScanRevision, said its
14.2 percent growth rate was partly the result of a merger.

"The economy has been improving in general but - at least among the
big, international firms - the audit market is affected by
rationalisation and technological changes, and in some areas is still
affected by keen price competition," said Torben Haaning, managing
partner of Coopers & Lybrand.

KPMG C Jespersen is still the top firm in Denmark with 1994 revenues of
DKr668 million ($120 million), a rise of 3.4 percent on the previous
year. For 1995, the firm estimates revenues will rise a further 2.5
percent to DKr685 million.

The 1995 figures will have been boosted by the merger completed at the
start of the year of KPMG's offices on the island of Funen with local
firm Edvin Munk. The merger gave KPMG a presence in three more towns on
the island and doubled the size of its office in Svendborg.

Among KPMG's major audit clients are shipping, manufacturing and retail
group AP Moller, electrical machinery maker Danfoss and in the banking
sector Den Danske Bank and Unibank.

Second-placed Deloitte & Touche, which changed its name from Schobel &
Marholt on January 1 of this year, reported revenues of DKr651.2
million for fiscal 1994, up 1.4 percent from a year earlier. D&T's
major audit clients include insurance company Topdanmark, for which it
also provides consulting services, and food and beverage producer
Danisco.

In third place in the rankings is C&L with 1994 revenues of DKr525
million, up 1.9 percent from a year earlier, followed by Ernst & Young
with fee income of DKr358 million, a rise of 3.2 percent.

The E&Y figures do not reflect two mergers which the firm completed
this year. On May 1, it teamed up with Borg og Green, an auditing firm
based in the northern Zealand area. The merger boosted the number of
partners in E&Y's Hillerod office to seven and increased its total
staff there to 52. Then on July 1, E&Y merged with RIO Partner, a four-
partner firm in Odense with annual revenues of DKr50 million.

E&Y managing partner Teddy Wivel said the firm has experienced a lot of
growth in management consulting and tax services and expects this to
continue in the current year.

Price Waterhouse/Seier-Petersen took fifth place with revenues of
DKr300 million in the year to June 1995. Morten Iversen, a partner at
the firm, said PW was not involved in any mergers during the year and
that its growth rate of 11.1 percent was entirely organic.

He said much of the revenue increase came from a rise in information
technology consulting and tax consulting business. "We have a very
strong tax practice and there has been a general increase in demand for
added-value tax services."

Among PW's major audit clients are pharmaceuticals group Novo Nordisk,
Tele Danmark, insurance group Trygg-Baltica Forsikring, and the local
subsidiaries of computer group IBM and oil giant Shell.

The highest revenue increase of any of the firms surveyed came from
sixth-placed BDO ScanRevision, with fee income rising 14.2 percent to
DKr297 million in the year to September. The firm said the impressive
increase was partly the result of a merger with auditing firm JRI,
which has offices in Aarhus, Skanderborg and Auning. Managing partner
Jens Rye said the merger doubled BDO's presence in Aarhus, a port on
the eastern side of Jutland.

Rye added that BDO has experienced some growth in the audit sector over
the last year. He said this was because the firm deals mainly with the
medium-sized corporate sector where price competition is less severe.

BDO has also begun diversifying into consulting. "Clients are more
willing to pay [for consulting services] because they see results,
which is not always the case in the audit sector," Rye said.

Arthur Andersen remains in seventh place, with fiscal 1995 revenues of
DKr234 million, a rise of 4 percent on the previous year. The firm's
audit business contributed 44 percent of revenues, while Andersen
Consulting accounted for 47 percent.

Andersen's country managing partner Torgny Pahle said trading
conditions in Denmark in the last year were characterised by a "very
weak audit market with no growth, fierce competition and a soft outlook
for the future". The consulting market, on the other hand, is growing
across the board, he said.

Most firms agreed with Pahle that competition in the audit market
remains strong. More and more audits are being put out to tender, and
clients are stepping up their demands for value for money, they said.

Wivel said E&Y has also noticed price competition spreading from the
audit sector into the consulting business, particularly from other Big
Six firms with strong consulting arms.

The poor outlook for the audit market is unlikely to be helped if the
government goes ahead with plans to drop the rule obliging listed
companies to appoint joint auditors. The government believes the joint
auditor system places too heavy a financial burden on the companies
concerned.

Although the proposal is still being considered, Bjarne Fabienke,
senior partner at KPMG, expects an amendment to the law before
Christmas. If it goes ahead, "the total audit market will be reduced",
he said.

As a result of the rule, the Big Six currently share many of Denmark's
largest companies as clients: brewing group Carlsberg is audited by
KPMG and PW; Bang & Olufsen, the electronics company, is audited by C&L
and PW; and the national postal service, Post Danmark, is audited by
Andersen and PW.

PW's Iversen believes the government is considering changing the joint
audit rule because Denmark is one of the few countries in Europe with
such a requirement. "In terms of the EU, it's a bit unusual," he said.

Last October, a law was passed which said no one audit client should be
allowed to contribute more than 20 percent of a firm's fee income.
Twelve months later, the general consensus among firms is that the
legislation has had little real effect.

Fabienke said the law does not apply to big firms in reality since one
client would never contribute 20 percent of total revenues. However,
problems might arise for smaller firms with lower overall fee income.

The aim of this legislation was to boost auditor independence, an issue
that was under the spotlight in recent years but now seems to have
moved off the agenda. "The profession's reputation was tarnished in the
late 1980s and early 1990s when there were a number of collapses and it
was automatically drawn into the debate," Iversen said. "That period is
behind us. The profession has regained its credibility."

Alongside the ongoing improvement in the Danish economy, the jobless
rate has fallen over the last year from over 12 percent to just above
10 percent. With this, some firms have reported problems finding
suitable staff. "When the market is growing it is inevitable that some
shortages arise," said Iversen at PW.

Wivel said E&Y has had problems recruiting in the Copenhagen area. It
has been doing presentations in the universities to encourage young
graduates into the firm with some success.

A more serious problem for the big international firms is insurance
cover. Legislation was introduced earlier this year requiring firms
with more than ten certified public accountants to take out national
insurance cover of DKr20 million. All the bigger firms already have
international insurance policies but the Danish authorities no longer
accept this. "We foresee extra cost to fulfil the national
requirements, even though we have international insurance with a more
extensive cover," said Haaning at C&L.

Denmark's traditional links to the Baltic have resulted in a number of
Danish accounting firms establishing a presence in the former eastern
bloc. KPMG, for example, at the request of the international firm,
established a practice in Lithuania. KPMG's Swedish and Finnish members
have set up practices in the other Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia,
respectively.

BKR International's RIR Revision owns a firm of the same name in
Poland, although earlier this year the Polish firm dropped the BKR link
and signed up with Moore Stephens. In Bulgaria, meanwhile, BDO's member
firm is owned by BDO ScanRevision.

DEUTSCHE POST'S TAKEOVER PLAN STYMIED BY SCHRODERS

DEUTSCHE POST's ambition to take over 75 percent of Postbank, the state-
owned German bank - in alliance with Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re - has
suffered a blow with the release of a report by UK investment bank
Schroders for the German government.

Schroders has recommended that Deutsche Post, the German post office,
should get a stake of no more than 25 percent plus one share in the
bank.

Last October, Deutsche Post, Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re made a surprise
DM3.1 billion ($2.1 billion) bid for 75 percent of Postbank, widely
considered a gross undervaluation. Deutsche Post wanted to keep 40
percent of the capital and divide the rest between the other two
bidders (see EB 118). Schroders has put Postbank's current market value
at between DM4 billion and DM5.1 billion.

Wolfgang Botsch, Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who
supported this hostile bid, seems to like Schroders's idea so far, but
has not made a definitive statement. Postbank is adamant that the stake
should be between 15 percent and 20 percent. It would not accept a 25
percent stake unless"certain conditions (not defined) were met", a
spokesman said.

Schroders has recommended that Postbank get rid of its 80 specialised
outlets in post offices, carry out marketing jointly with Deutsche Post
and sell its products over the post office counters. This would open
the way for recruiting other financial services partners, Schroders
said.

No doubt Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re would want a piece of this action,
along with the partners that Postbank sought out for a counter attack -
BHF Bank and Volksfursorge, the insurance group.

SE-BANKEN FINED FOR GIVING MISLEADING INFORMATION

SKANDINAVISKA ENSKILDA Banken, Sweden's largest bank, has been hit with
a fine of SKr2.14 million ($3.3 million) by the Stockholm Stock
Exchange for providing misinformation on the heavy credit losses which
caused a dramatic fall in its profits in 1995.

The stock exchange accuses the bank of providing misleading information
on Luxonen, a failed financial investment group, in a press release of
January 23 last year. SE-Banken stated that the Luxonen losses were
covered by SKr1 billion provisions made in 1994 and that restructuring
the group would strengthen rather than weaken its position.

In the first six months of 1995, however, SE-Banken made further
provisions of SKr2.9 billion to cover Luxonen losses. First half
profits dropped from SKr2.2 billion to a mere Skr19 million (see EB
117).

The stock exchange disciplinary committee has imposed a SKr2.14 fine,
corresponding to two annual listing fees.

SE Banken admits that it was not fully aware at the time of
the"complicated construction" of the swap contracts held by Luxonen,
which caused much of the loss, a spokeswoman said.

FRANCE READY FOR CONSOLIDATION?

Some recent deals seem to indicate that the French banking industry is
willing to consider the type of consolidation that has become common in
Europe in recent years

FOUR EVENTS toward the end of 1995 suggest that, faced with an
unprecedented crisis, the French banking industry has embarked on a
long overdue period of consolidation and rationalisation.

In December, after many hiccups, Credit National finally announced the
terms of its public offer to acquire Banque Francaise de Commerce
Exterieur (BFCE) and its intention that the two banks' operations
should eventually merge.

Each of the banks is already among the top 15 banks in France by assets
and combined they will have total assets of Fr350 billion ($71 billion)
and a corporate loan book of Fr195 billion. This will give Credit
National "the means to assert itself as one of the top French
institutions", according to the bank's chairman Emmanuel Rodocanachi.

In itself, the deal is likely to have only a limited impact on the
banking industry. Credit National and BFCE have small branch networks
and are involved in sectors where commercial banks barely tread. Credit
National, for example, focuses largely on long-term corporate loans to
large and medium-sized companies, capital markets and equity financing
business. BFCE's activities are concentrated on the corporate sector;
international trade financing and cash management services.

The true significance of the deal lies in its symbolic value. The
proposed merger is, in fact, the first such operation of consequence in
France since the merger of Banque Indochine and Banque de Suez et de
l'Union des Mines to form Banque Indosuez in 1975. It is testimony of
the French banking industry's willingness to contemplate the type of
consolidation that has become common in Europe in recent years.

The second significant event pointing toward long-overdue consolidation
was the news that GAN, a major insurance company, is to sell a majority
stake in its banking subsidiary Groupe CIC as part of its
privatisation. Groupe CIC is the seventh-largest bank in France so
there are likely to be suitors aplenty although, like many French
banks, CIC is barely profitable. It has an abysmal cost-to-income ratio
of 80 percent.

Societe Generale and Credit Mutuel have already expressed an interest,
although banks from outside France (possibly the Dutch bank ABN AMRO)
may also be tempted to add CIC's network of around 1,300 branches to
their empires.

The ardour of some suitors may, however, be tempered if it is decided
to sell the different regional CIC networks separately. The acquisition
of consumer finance specialist Sovac by giant US conglomerate General
Electric Capital (GE Capital) at least shows a revival of foreign
interest in investing in those parts of the French financial industry
that remain profitable.

Foreigners' interest in making an important banking acquisition in
France has long been frustrated by various kinds of unavowed
protectionism. At the beginning of this decade, for example, Deutsche
Bank's international division was able to show journalists 36 fat
files, each one representing an acquisition target in France that had
to be ruled out for a series of reasons.

Now, in one fell swoop, a major international company has become one of
the major consumer credit providers in a market that has been
traditionally divided between a handful of national competitors and the
subsidiaries of the big commercial banks.

The acquisition, the third significant event in French banking in
recent months, has had the effect of a bombshell on the French retail
financial services industry and may herald a period of intense
manoeuvring. Already, rumours are rife that Banque Sofinco (another
consumer finance specialist and subsidiary of the troubled Suez
conglomerate) could come on the market, as may Credit du Nord, the weak
retail banking subsidiary of the Paribas group.

The fourth and final event demonstrating a new openness in the French
banking sector is the decision to end Credit Foncier de France's quasi-
monopoly over the distribution of subsidised housing loans, called
PAPs. This may be a sign that the state is beginning to contemplate
ending other privileges reserved for a number of state and quasi-state
banks.

Likewise, the decision to replace these PAPs with interest-free
mortgage loans that are open to all banks to distribute is an
indication that the authorities are conscious of the serious problems
facing the French financial industry.

That said, French banking remains ridden by a host of special
privileges accorded to some banks and not to others. The commercial
banks (members of the Association Francaise des Banques) periodically
mount campaigns to have the same right to flexible opening hours as the
savings and mutual banks and the post office. For a number of years,
they have also been striving to obtain the same access to fiscally
advantaged products as the mutual and savings banks. It remains
unlikely that, in this respect at least, French banking will change
radically in the near future.

The sudden increase in the tempo of change in French banking in 1995
follows a lot of soul searching among the financial industry, at the
root of which is a series of events, including bail-outs (most
spectacularly that of Credit Lyonnais) and the collapse last year of
Banque Pallas-Stern. The failure of the latter bank is especially
significant in that, for the first time in memory, a bank's
shareholders did not respond to the Bank of France's "invitation" to
help refloat their investment. This spells an end to France's much-
vaunted banking solidarity and points to the growing vulnerability of
small banks.

In addition, the AFB estimates that its members' net banking income
fell by 10 percent in 1995, having already dropped by 8 percent in
1994.

French banks in general can only look with envy on their "Anglo- Saxon"
cousins which, on average, have operating margins and returns on equity
that are two or three times higher than theirs. In the latest annual
survey of bank profitability undertaken by rating agency IBCA, the most
profitable French bank (Credit Immobilier de France) ranked only 84th
out of 300 institutions in the world.

In the words of one Paris analyst,"whereas French banks used to be able
to take justifiable pride in their quality of service and technological
prowess, now they have had to become seriously worried with the more
basic themes of low profitability and how to survive in a frighteningly
competitive environment".

Perhaps even more telling in the current upheaval is the growing
realisation that banks' real estate problems (which some analysts
estimate could cost a cumulative Fr100 billion-Fr200 billion by the end
of this decade) are not going to go away soon.

Here, too, a sea change can be detected. In 1994 and the first half of
1995 the Suez group, a financial and industrial conglomerate, took the
courageous step of writing down the massive real estate losses its
various subsidiaries had accumulated in previous years instead of
posting provisions that do not necessarily take into account possible
further falls in market values, as all Suez's domestic rivals have
done.

This provisioning effort cost Suez a total of Fr11.7 billion in the 18
months up to mid-1995 and contributed largely to the consolidated
losses of Fr8.8 billion in the same period.

At least this exercise should ensure that the much-troubled group sees
the light at the end of the tunnel fairly quickly. This may not be the
case for a number of other unfortunate institutions in France.

UK MARKET FAVOURS SHAREHOLDER APPROACH

AIMING TO double shareholder value every three years has over the last
decade driven Lloyds Bank's market capitalisation up from #1.35 billion
($2 billion) to #8.25 billion - on roughly the same share base.

The bank's equity has doubled from #2.1 billion to #4.06 billion, price
to book value has risen from 64 percent to more than 200 percent and
the dividend has increased at a compound rate of 15 percent.

Lloyds's pre-tax return on equity currently stands at 35.2 percent,
higher even than Spain's famously profitable bank, Banco Popular (33.6
percent), points out a recent report from Salomon Brothers.

This impressive performance, combined with widespread enthusiasm about
the bank's recent purchases of Church & General building society and
TSB Bank, have pushed the share price sky high. In fact, Salomon
Brothers's only proviso on a buy recommendation on Lloyds is that the
bank's shares have passed the #8.25- #8.50 price mark.

Both the C&G and TSB purchases fit the Lloyds criterion for a
successful financial institution of widening the gap with other
operators: C&G for its low-cost production in the mortgage market,
strong image-based technology and turnaround skills; and TSB for the
potential integration savings it offers as well as general insurance
skills that Lloyds has up to now had to buy in.

Salomon Brothers is particularly enthusiastic about the UK, despite the
fact that shares rallied so strongly in 1995. Buy Barclays, Lloyds,
NatWest and HSBC Holdings, Salomon Brothers advises, with a hold on
Abbey National. The favoured buy is HSBC, because the shares have
lagged the recovery in UK bank shares.

Salomon is less enthusiastic about other markets. In France, where it
considers the banks are not particularly good value in relation to
earnings, it has a hold recommendation on the major banks, although
preferring the quality of Societe Generale.

Italian banks, although cheap on book value, are expensive on an
earnings basis, Salomon argues, and better share performance will only
happen in the (currently unlikely) event of an improvement in political
and economic conditions. Top Italian choice is Istituto Mobiliare
Italiano (IMI) (see page 6).

Despite the fact that Salomon Brothers is bearish about operating
conditions in the Spanish market, it has upgraded its recommendation on
Argentaria to buy from hold in the light of the mounting speculation
about mergers and acquisitions. Salomon argues that the Spanish
government has no real interest in keeping any investment in Argentaria
in the medium term. Argentaria's break-up value is a lot higher than
current market capitalisation and the likely change of government in
1996 will allow a rethink of the privatisation agenda, the report
predicts.

Salomon Brothers has also kept a buy recommendation on Bank Bilbao
Vizcaya, another bank which focuses on shareholder value. Luis Bastida,
chief financial officer of BBV, told Salomon Brothers' Global
Conference that BBV has established ROE objectives of about 15 percent
for all main business lines. The bank will repurchase more stock if
market price falls below adjusted book value and is continuing to
maximise cost cuts from the 1998 Banco Bilbao/Banca Vizcaya merger.

In Germany, the favoured bank shares are Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank.
In Switzerland, Salomon Brothers has downgraded its only buy
recommendation - Swiss Bank Corporation - to hold and cut the estimates
on the other three major banks, citing stagnant domestic banking
conditions and poor credit quality.

Salomon Brothers considers the Nordic banks, particularly Christiania
Bank, as among the best buys in Europe.

NEW CHANCES, NEW COSTS

While the large banks are in a good position to take advantage of the
new European financial regulations, the directives could be just too
much for many smaller players to handle

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has added two further pieces to the single
financial services market jigsaw - the Investment Services Directive
(ISD) and the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD).

Both came into effect on January 1 of this year and are likely to lead
to increased competition between stock exchanges and investment banks
alike, with larger players set to come out on top.

Only seven of the 15 member states were ready to implement the ISD at
the start of the new year, although all are adopting an "open door"
policy, according to the European Federation of Stock Markets. Those
that met the requirements were the UK, Ireland, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.

The main thrust of the ISD is to create a "European Passport" for non-
bank investment firms to carry out activities such as order collecting,
dealing and portfolio management more easily across borders.

Under the terms of the directive, any institution regulated in one EU
country can operate in all of the others without having to comply with
additional requirements.

The British Banking Association "warmly welcomes" the directives,
because they reinforce the basic right to cross-border financial
services, according to Peter Vipond, assistant director.

As in the case of the Second Banking Directive, the Association is
concerned that the interpretation of the ISD should not be conservative
or ambiguous (see EB 120).

Larger banks, already present in more than one EU country, can expect
lower costs as a result of the ISD but the directive will not have a
significant impact on their cross-border activities, predicted John
Leonard, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. Although some
member states have been strict on foreign players in the past, most
large banks have been free to operate where they choose.

"The ISD will have no effect whatsoever on our business, as we already
had the passport," said Dominique Hoenn, member of the board of
management at Groupe Paribas, France's second-largest banking group.
"It is a bit of a non-event for banks."

Smaller players operating in countries which have no regulations for
securities traders will, on the other hand, find themselves needing
authorisation for the first time.

The costs of keeping up with regulations may be too much and firms and
brokers could become overshadowed by the bigger investment banks which
will find it easier to adapt, Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and
capital markets at Price Waterhouse, forecast.

One market observer suggests that in terms of increased cross- border
activity US investment houses, such as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley
and Goldman Sachs, will be particularly keen to avail of the
opportunities presented by the ISD. Their authorisation in London will
allow them to spread out further into Europe.

A second objective of the ISD is to open up stock exchange membership
in all member states to all types of investment firm, whether bank or
non-bank entities. It will allow them to choose between indirect access
to membership through a subsidiary company or direct access through a
branch.

The ISD will lead to a surge in "remote membership" of stock exchanges,
according to market analysts, as it permits regulated markets operating
without a physical floor to provide terminals to investment firms and
banks in other member states.

This move will boost continental exchanges which have dramatically
modernised recently, said Jean-Pierre Paelinck, secretary general of
the European Federation of Stock Exchanges.

Indeed, the London exchange is on shaky ground at the moment after its
chief executive Michael Lawrence was forced to resign on January 4
because the board "lost confidence" in him. The board insists that this
has nothing to do with Lawrence's push for reform of trading on the
exchange this year. Few are convinced by the argument and a select
committee of the House of Commons has launched an inquiry into the
dismissal.

"Our objective is to be a market of choice," said John Kemp- Welch,
chairman of the board, who has taken over the chair of the executive
committee until a new chief executive is found. "To achieve that, we
have a large programme of work in train and this will be pursued
vigorously."

On the same day as Lawrence's departure, the board announced the
formation of a steering committee, which will oversee the decision
taken at the Stock Exchange Board meeting of November 30, concerning
market structure and regulation. The decision provides for the
Exchange's service to include full electronic trading and order
matching.

UK stockbroker NatWest Securities added fuel to the fire on January 2,
when it started to trade on the Swedish stock exchange from its offices
in London. It was the first leading UK market- maker to question
publicly the London Stock Exchange's function as a centre for
international trading.

Before the ISD came in, UK firms wanting to trade continental stocks
had to set up offices in other countries and apply for membership or
advertise their prices on Seaq International, the London Exchange's
electronic bulletin board for international dealing.

In Germany, Gruppe Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and
derivatives markets, has reacted to the ISD by installing "access
points" in London and Zurich to link to its systems and harmonising the
communications fees abroad with those at home, facilitating access to
the German market for foreign entrants.

Deutsche Borse plans to extend its electronic network to other
countries in the future, with the aim of bringing down all round
telecommunications costs.

Investment banks are likely to feel the effects of the Capital Adequacy
Directive (CAD) most, although the Directive also covers non-bank
investment firms. Under the directive, investment banks are required
for the first time to examine market risks when allocating capital.

Under the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive of 1993, banks can
carry out securities-related activities in addition to core banking
business, which means that banks and non-banks can be in direct
competition with each other in this area.

The CAD distinguishes between a bank's "trading book" and the rest of
its business (its investment portfolio and loans portfolio). It applies
broadly similar rules to the trading book as apply to the securities
business of non-bank investment firms in defining regulatory capital
and rules relating to the measurement of risk.

The rest of the bank's business is still subject to the requirements of
the Solvency Ratio Directive, which sets out an 8 percent minimum
capital requirement in respect of weighted credit risks.

Another element of the CAD is that banks and investment firms must
monitor risks at all times, keeping a close eye on large exposures.
Trading exposures to a single client will have to be restricted in most
cases to less than 25 percent of the capital base, for instance.

Analysts agree that market risks have been neglected in the past.
"Considering that Swiss banks make 29 percent of their total revenues
from trading, and the Barings collapse, it is clear that there are
risks there that should be dealt with," said Mark Rubenstein, European
banking analyst at BZW. "Banks will have to sit down and look more
carefully at the capital they need."

Banks have had two years to prepare for the CAD so on the whole they
are relatively unshaken by its arrival. The overall effect on holding
capital will be neutral and won't make much difference to banks,
according to Ian Linnell, investment banking analyst at Standard &
Poor's.

"The CAD will give a good kick to the market," he said, "but as a risk
management tool, it is not a magic silver bullet, it's too cumbersome".

Linnell suggests that investment banks themselves delegate risk control
in a much more efficient way than the CAD, a view held by many of the
banks themselves. Paribas is a case in point. Its own risk model uses
250 points of observation. "It is not clear whether we are permitted to
continue with our internal model," said Hoenn. "It would be stupid to
have to invest more in developing a new system just to comply with the
rules."

Indeed, the CAD will require increased expenditure on upgrading
technology, as it is a systems-based approach. "Everyone is investing
lots of money in systems, because they have one additional set of
calculations that has to be done concurrently and accurately," said
Leonard. IT investment among Europe's top banks ranges from as little
as 0.5 percent of asset value, according to a 1995 review of the top
100 largest spenders on IT by Spikes Cavell, the market intelligence
providers. Three banks appeared in the top ten spenders: Barclays was
number three spending $1.3 billion; ABN AMRO was number five with $960
million and Deutsche Bank ranked ninth with $814 million.

Smaller players may be crippled by the new overheads brought on by the
directives. At the end of the day, this factor, along with other
handicaps, such as lack of controlling models, will mean that the
increasingly "global" European market will become a stomping ground
mainly for big investment banks and investors.

"Larger banks can exploit their muscle on a wider front, and the
directives offer significant re-engineering opportunities," said
Aggarwal."The odds are definitely tilting towards larger players."

POLAND:  MERGER PLANS VIEWED WITH SUSPICION

POLISH BANKERS are less than enthusiastic about the government's new
approach to restructuring the banking sector.

The government has decided to merge seven state-owned banks into groups
led by Bank Handlowy y Warszawie and Polska Kasa Opieki (Bank Pekao).
Pekao is to take over Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy, Bank Depozytowo-
Kredytowy and the Treasury's 63 percent stake in the Polski Bank
Rozwoju (PBR). Handlowy would take over Pomorski Bank Kredytowy and the
Treasury's remaining 46.6 percent stake in Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy
(BPH).

Until now, the government has sold off four of the nine regional banks
one at a time - Bank Slaski, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, Bank
Przemyslowo-Handlowy and, most recently, Bank Gdanski. At the end of
last year, it sold a domestic tranche of 35.8 percent of the Gdanski
shares, and foreign investors bought all 25 percent of shares on offer
abroad. Poland's eleventh- largest bank, Bank Iniciatyw Gospodarczych
(BIG) bought 24.07 percent of the bank.

Privatisation of the institutions remaining in state hands is expected
in late 1996 or in 1997. Although the new strategy of grouping the
banks could simplify an eventual privatisation "a more jaundiced view
held by some market players is that the consolidation strategy is
merely a ploy for reasserting control over the banking system, a theory
that would be borne out if Bank Handlowy and Pekao are not privatised,"
points out rating agency Standard & Poor's.

Shareholders of BPH and of PBR, as well as the management of the
regional banks, have raised objections. The plan can only succeed if
the two banks are free of political influence, Handlowy president
Cezary Stypulkowski has said.

Standard & Poor's also argue that the consolidation "would not
significantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,
or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range for
zloty-denominated obligations".

The rating agency points out that in the near term the mergers would
bring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio and that
integration could be difficult.

"However, longer term, the greater diversity and market share could be
positive factors. Bank Handlowy would gain more retail deposits and
commercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution network
and possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertise
of Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail broker
strength."

THE UNWANTED DISTRACTION

While Italian banks are keen to grow, in recent times they have been
cutting back on foreign expansion. Now the smaller, more flexible banks
seem to be in the best position to exploit opportunities quickly

THE ONGOING troubles of Italian banks as they come to terms with
deregulation, privatisation and a more open and competitive market have
been well documented. A less well-publicised aspect of the large-scale
changes underway has been the quiet scaling down or even complete
withdrawal from operations abroad.

Most of the Italian banks' foreign expansion happened in the 1980s, on
the back of a buoyant economy at home when politically- controlled
banks could afford prestigious offices in major capitals and branch
networks in the more important markets. More recently, though,
recession and the arrival of private investment have brought more
pressing concerns at home and foreign expansion appears to have become
an unwanted distraction.

IMI, the Rome-based bank privatised last year, was one of the more
active and successful of the Italian banks abroad. Determinedly
independent from political interference, it became an efficient
operator in international investment banking and capital markets.

In 1993 Massimo Amato, managing director, of IMI International in
Luxembourg, echoed the bank's president when he said optimistically
that "IMI is a truly international bank and our intention is to become
a European institution of the highest calibre".

The bank certainly had the right credentials for satisfying the
ambitions of its management and may well have achieved their objectives
but for one costly mistake - the acquisition of the US investment bank,
Mabon Securities, for around $20 million in 1991. Little is known of
exactly what went wrong, but only two years after the purchase the bank
was said to be looking for a buyer. Problems appear to have been
concentrated in the subsidiary, Cedar Street, particularly in London,
where management walked out en masse to join a rival.

In September 1995 IMI announced that it was restructuring its
investment banking operations so that it could concentrate on Italian
markets and its lira-denominated products. It also revealed that IMI
Capital Markets, the sole owner of Mabon Securities, was to have $30
million injected into it. Little over a month later Cedar Street was
sold to a US securities dealer, MKI. There has been no mention of
losses and little coverage in the Italian press, although IMI's balance
sheet could be L60 billion ($38 million) the worse in 1995 and Mabon
Securities faces liquidation.

The mistake severely compromised IMI's other foreign operations and the
bank also closed its Frankfurt-based venture, leaving the Luxembourg
bank as the only serious foreign-based bank. Even Luxembourg's role was
downgraded and Massimo Amato returned to a high ranking position with a
medium-sized bank in Italy last year.

Banca Nazionale del Lavoro has also had well-publicised problems in its
foreign subsidiaries and has reduced its once large US operation to its
New York offices.

Other groups have suffered from market pressures. Comit, the banking
group containing Banca Commerciale Italiana, is looking to cut its
operation in France. Comit entered the French market at much the same
time as IMI was beginning its foreign expansion programme, buying Banca
Sudameris France. Losses in the French operation have forced the bank
to look for buyers of most of the 19 branches.

Banco di Napoli may also be looking for buyers in France. The Naples
bank had record losses last year and other Italian banks have bailed it
out on condition that it implements an effective restructuring
programme. This will almost certainly include the disposal of foreign
operations in France and Luxembourg.

Another casualty of the tough French market was the bank owned by
Olivetti owner Carlo De Benedetti, Dumenil Leble, which after L900
billion losses over the last five years will be put into liquidation at
the end of January.

In many cases, the purpose behind withdrawal has been to concentrate
resources on the home front where, ironically, foreign banks are
becoming increasingly active. Leaner foreign banks are increasingly
looking to exploit weaknesses in the cumbersome Italian banking system.

One of the major recent problems is the rift between Italian industry
and its banking counterparts over lending rates. The needs of smaller
exporting companies for competitive rates are quite clearly not being
met. All leading banks in Italy raised their lending rates by O.5
percent to 0.75 percent in November leaving industrialists dissatisfied
and rebellious.

Mario Carraro, head of the Veneto region's industrial association, has
little doubt that foreign banks are exploiting the rift and Italian
companies are responding.

"Working with strong currencies we can get loans at 8 percent," he
said. "Our [local] economy is primarily based on exports . .
Republic or Poland we need advice and support from banks."

The largest Italian banks appear to be the ones finding this sort of
service more difficult to offer. Often it is the smaller banks with
strong roots in particular regions that are now exploiting the
opportunities presented abroad. For example, Banca Popolare di Bergamo-
Credito Varesino, which bought the Swiss Banque de Depots et de Gestion
in 1994, says that foreign expansion is limited to creating a network
in the areas that have strong links with the home base in Lombardy.

Similarly, the Banca Popolare di Verona group, which is based in the
eastern region of Veneto, has opened offices in eastern Europe"because
that is where our clients are going for their work".

The new approach to international expansion is much more pragmatic and
often the players are the second-tier banks. This creates something of
a contradiction for the industry. On the one hand, Italy's banks are
keen to grow, with even the biggest groups small by international
standards. On the other hand, it seems to be the smaller flexible
operators which are better able to exploit openings quickly.

TAKING FRIENDSHIP A STAGE FURTHER

Westdeutsche Landesbank has formed two alliances which mark another
stage in the evolution of cross-border business at German banks. The
other Landesbanks would be well-advised to follow suit, EB reports

THE RECENT co-operation agreement between Westdeutsche Landesbank
(WestLB) and Bank Austria has created a three-way alliance between
Germany's largest Landesbank and its counterparts in Austria and Italy,
where Cariplo forms the third point of the triangle.

The strategy marks a further departure from the Landesbanks'
traditional business profile, although it is still too early to say
whether these co-operation agreements will generate significant new
business.

It is some years now since WestLB moved beyond its original job
description as local banker and lender of last resort to the public
sector in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. As competitive pressures
grew on the local savings banks (Sparkassen), which buy their wholesale
banking services from WestLB, the Landesbank found it needed to offer
better products and services and to earn more than their traditional
low-interest municipal lending business could offer.

That way of thinking led WestLB to move into corporate business and
then, as a natural consequence, into capital markets and international
commercial banking. WestLB has since grown to become Germany's third-
largest bank and is currently bolstering its London investment bank,
known as West Merchant Bank, into a significant rival to private-sector
domestic competitors, Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank.

Under the terms of the German bank's agreement with Bank Austria, which
was signed just before Christmas, each becomes the other's"preferred
partner" for cross-border financial transactions, particularly in
foreign commercial business, international payments, currency clearing
and securities business.

Bank Austria's experience in eastern Europe will be invaluable. WestLB
has established branches in a number of central and eastern European
capitals but does not have the broad network that the Austrians have
already established.

The German's other partner is Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie
Lombarde (Cariplo), the Italian bank. WestLB's ultimate aim is to
construct a network of partner banks in all the main European markets.

WestLB's aspirations in investment banking have taken up plenty of time
and resources over the past year and the man with chief responsibility
for the new alliances with Cariplo and Bank Austria is Hans-Henning
Offen, deputy chairman of the board of management and one of the two
board members responsible for investment banking. Bank sources say it
will take a good year before any substantial progress can be announced,
although quicker results might be achieved in cross-border payments.

It is clear that WestLB, the wholesale banker and umbrella for 150
local savings banks in the Rhine and Ruhr region, has chosen to rely on
alliances with other savings bank institutions. Bank Austria is a
savings bank sector institution and, like WestLB, has grown
prodigiously. Cariplo comes from the same roots and is often referred
to as the world's largest savings bank.

These upper-tier banks choose to co-operate with one another because
they understand the difficulties of convincing local savings banks to
market new products to customers rather than being able to approach
customers directly. The structure of the savings bank sector in almost
any European country usually means delays and it sometimes results in
painful, politically charged compromises.

Other state-owned banks understand that the German Landesbanks are
obliged to take on some unrewarding business, such as low- interest
credits or the administration of subsidies, for local authorities.
Since they understand each other better than private sector banks
would, the alliances between WestLB, Cariplo and Bank Austria have a
better chance of success.

WestLB's recent activities in the capital markets suggest that the
Landesbanks are still wary of liaisons with private sector
institutions. West Merchant Bank in London is being fashioned into a
competitor for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Dresdner/Kleinwort Benson.
Possibly because there is no savings bank institution with sufficient
expertise in investment banking, WestLB has chosen to go it alone. Even
the domestic competition was ousted: Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, a
minority shareholder in West Merchant Bank, was bought out so that
WestLB could avoid internal competition from German or foreign banks
with similar constituencies.

As for Bayerische Landesbank, NordLB, Helaba and the other German
Landesbanks, it is a fair bet that their future strategy will be
inspired by that of WestLB, which has long been the largest and most
international of the 13 Landesbanks.

Bayerische Landesbank, in particular, is investing heavily in other
European markets. Over the past two years, chief executive Franz
Neubauer has purchased shareholdings in the Hungarian Foreign Trade
Bank, the Czech Savings Bank in Prague, the Sudtiroler Sparkasse in
Italy - and now the Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft in Vienna.

Others are more tardy. One reason is that their energy is being sapped
by problems and challenges at home - and by the constant effort of
expanding in order to keep level with WestLB. Norddeutsche Landesbank,
Helaba and Bayerische Landesbank are negotiating a far-reaching co-
operation on everything from edp systems to international strategy.
NordLB has already bought a stake in BGB.

Traditional banking alliances are still being made with banks in
emerging markets. Bayerische Landesbank has just signed an agreement on
the financing of German exports to Russia with Inkombank, the country's
largest commercial bank. But the Bavarians are not taking any risks:
all the long-term deals concerned will be covered by the German export
guarantee agency Hermes; others will be guaranteed by the Russian
Ministry of Finance or covered by barter deals. Indeed, Bayern LB has
been sensible enough to keep its initial objectives modest.

But the other Landesbanks will have to move quickly into more strategic
alliances if WestLB, Cariplo, Bank Austria and whichever new partner
next emerges are not to steal away their regional business. Although
WestLB is still formally committed to the Rhine/Ruhr region, it now
acts for corporate customers all over Germany.

MUTUAL FUNDS READY FOR TAKE-OFF

Though they still lag far behind US investors, Britons are beginning to
appreciate the benefits of mutual funds, thanks in no small part to
Virgin's Richard Branson

ONE OF the most fascinating developments in the retail financial
services sector over the last ten years has been the rise of the mutual
fund in the US. The Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMF) is displacing the
traditional bank deposit. The volume of assets held in MMMFs now
exceeds the cash held in call or demand deposits. Conventional mutual
funds are winning market share in the longer-term savings market.
Overall, around 30 percent of US households own mutual funds.

In the UK, however, mutual funds have failed to arouse the same depth -
and breadth - of interest. Indeed, in some respects the UK mutual fund
sector lags behind that of mainland Europe.

Unit trusts, the UK equivalent of the open-ended investment fund, have
had their moments, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
More recently, the sector experienced a minor boom in 1993 on the back
of rising stockmarkets.

In the intervening periods, however, the unit trust has failed to
excite the British punter. The number of unitholder accounts reached a
peak of 2.4 million in 1970 and declined throughout the 1970s, reaching
a trough of 1.72 million. Interest in unit trusts recovered during the
1980s on the back of booming stockmarkets but it was not until 1985
that the 1970 peak was exceeded.

Interest subsided following the crash of 1987 before moving onto new
highs during the 1990s. Currently the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds (AUTIF), the sector's trade association, estimates
that there are 6.58 million unit trust accounts, with total assets of
#109 billion ($168 billion).

Since investors typically hold units in more than one fund, the overall
number of unit trust holders is probably much less. In 1993 AUTIF
estimated that there were only around 1.5 million individual investors -
 around 3 percent of the total population.

There are a number of reasons for this situation. The fact that UK
banks have tended to pay interest not dissimilar to money market rates
on bank deposits has diminished the attraction of MMMFs. Unit trusts
have had to compete on an unfavourable basis with the attractions of
alternative long-term savings products such as life assurance
contracts. Until the advent of the Personal Equity Plan (PEP), mutual
funds were not in receipt of any form of fiscal privilege. By way of
contrast, until 1984 tax relief was offered on life assurance premiums.

The relative attraction of life assurance contracts was enhanced by the
fact that they were a preferred way of funding residential mortgages.
For a significant part of the post-war period residential property has
been perceived by the average Briton as the investment par excellence.

From the manufacturer's point of view, life assurance contracts offered
other attractions. The fact that the investment value of a life
assurance policy was relatively opaque - investors just assumed that
they would receive a large sum of money when the contract was
terminated - obscured the risks associated with this type of
instrument. More pertinently, in an age of non- disclosure, it opened
the way for high costs and fees to be passed directly to the customer.

Unit trusts were more transparent. Investment losses or poor
performance quickly came to light. Costs were also much more visible
and off-putting. The nature of the contract permitted only limited
opportunities for realising commission income. In contrast to their
peers in the US, the UK mutual fund companies seemed incapable of
coming up with anything that would positively enhance the unit trust's
image.

In fact, they often seemed intent on the reverse. Loads and annual
management charges were allowed to creep up. UK companies even turned
down the UK government's invitation to introduce legislation permitting
the introduction of open-ended investment companies (OIECs), a mutual
fund structure which has become the norm elsewhere.

There is at last evidence, however, to suggest that the tide may be
turning, irrespective of the behaviour of stockmarkets (always an
important factor as far as the public's appetite for unit trusts is
concerned).

A key element in this respect was the decision by the UK government to
make qualifying unit trusts fully eligible for inclusion in PEPs.
Investors can now shelter from both income and capital gains tax up to
6,000 of unit trust investments per annum. For the first time, unit
trusts have a more favourable tax status than life assurance contracts.

The relative attraction of life assurance contracts has been undermined
by a combination of factors. The scandals associated with the way in
which these and other long-term savings contracts such as personal
pensions were sold, the advent of disclosure and the inflexibility of
these contracts have all impeded their sale.

More importantly, competition has finally arrived. There has been an
explosion in new products, especially"life-style products" such as unit
trust savings plans linked to school and college fees, mortgage
repayments and pensions. Price competition has also picked up. No-load
funds, with very low annual management fees, are becoming increasingly
common.

As is often the case, when the history of the UK mutual fund sector
comes to be written, credit for these changes will probably be
attributed to an outsider: Virgin's Richard Branson. His launch of a
low-cost index tracking fund in early 1995 was an important catalyst.
Close on Branson's heels, HSBC, River & Mercantile, Legal & General and
Fidelity Investments have all introduced low-cost index trackers.
Indeed, since the index tracker appears to have captured the public's
imagination, other suppliers are set to join them in the near future.

Will the UK be converted to the merits of the mutual fund? The
situation is certainly much more promising. The arrival of the OIEC
later this year, low-risk corporate bond trusts, low costs, low
interest rates and (hopefully) booming stockmarkets, coupled with
greater marketing awareness on the part of the fund companies, should
provide the basis for take-off. As usual, however, time will tell.

WAITING FOR THE TELEKOM BONANZA

The biggest flotation in European history represents every banker's
hopes for improved earnings in 1996

THE NEW Year has begun and Deutsche Telekom is the name on every German
banker's lips: the national telecommunications group is not only set to
launch the biggest flotation in European history, but represents every
banker's hopes for improved earnings in 1996.

If the DM15 billion ($10.4 billion) sale of Telekom shares goes well,
every bank in the land will share in the bonanza. But, if demand is
weak, banks could be left holding the stock themselves for months or
even years.

By that simple logic, it seems self-evident that the banks will try
every tactic and ruse to encourage investors to buy the nation's first
telecoms shares. That is what the German government hoped when it
decided last year not to create new tax breaks on share ownership in
order to encourage the German public to buy Telekom stock.

Instead, the government and Deutsche Telekom's own management have
appealed to the banks to invent (and pay for) whatever incentives they
think necessary to make the new shares attractive.

By placing the ball so firmly in the banks' court, the German
government is perpetuating the old belief that banks are not just
commercial organisations which aim to maximise profits for their
shareholders but also have a duty to offer financial support to
deserving parts of the economy.

It is a curious reflection of the German consensus model that banks too
are regarded as official sponsors of economic and social change.

Banks may rage about this outdated view but the Telekom debate has put
them in a difficult dilemma. All of the major banks were so eager to
win places in the Telekom issuing syndicate that they were driven to
make extravagant promises.

Deutsche Bank, one of the global coordinators, and Dresdner Bank,
coordinator for the German market, are said to have made a personal
pledge to German chancellor Helmut Kohl that the Telekom issue would be
a success at all costs. And the government's favour is all-important
for banks which want a prominent role in future privatisation issues
such as Deutsche Bahn and Postbank.

In January 1996, just weeks before the marketing campaign begins for a
mammoth placement that cannot be postponed any longer, it is now
evident what responsibility the banks face. That burden rests
particularly on the shoulders of Dresdner Bank.

Unless the banks forgo bank charges, they may not be able to sell
sufficient stock to establish investor confidence. And if demand is
weak the banks will be blamed - and will end up forced to buy the
unwanted shares. Indeed, outsiders may never find out how much genuine
demand there really was for Telekom stock.

We can only speculate what the results of the Telekom issue will be. If
banks do have to provide special incentives for private investors, that
will set a trend for all future privatisations and could have a radical
effect on bank charges in Germany.

It will also create a new interdependence between the retail banking
and capital markets division of the big German banks. That will be
unwelcome at institutions which are trying to create more autonomy in
each division, but it may be unavoidable.

CHANGES IN GERMAN MARKET

RETAIL BANKERS in Germany have been confronted by dozens of innovations
over the past 18 months: discount broking was followed by direct
banking, dual-branded credit cards, free banking and now Internet
broking.

But before any home grown innovators, such as the pioneer discount
broker Direkt-Anlage Bank, could find the time and the money to reach
out to foreign markets, German brokers have found themselves defending
their crumbling market from foreigners. Credit Suisse, for instance,
recently launched a direct brokerage in Germany.

The appearance of foreign competitors is nothing new. US-based
investment banks created a stir in the late 1980s when they established
operations in Frankfurt and began to attract capital markets business
away from German institutions. The expertise they brought to Frankfurt
propelled German banks into acquiring the same experience themselves.
With hindsight, German bankers agree that the foreign investment
bankers have been beneficial for the Frankfurt marketplace.

They are still classified as"foreign banks" and few belong to the
mainstream Association of German Banks, but in fact institutions like
Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Swiss Bank Corporation now pursue
much the same objectives as domestic banks. That recognition is the key
to the successful development of Finanzplatz Frankfurt in future.

All 135 foreign banks in Frankfurt - even the branches which simply
administer commercial business for clients from home - are concerned
about the minimum reserve requirement, the supervision of derivatives
business, the new electronic systems of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
and the improvement of international payment systems.

Although the financial legislation of 1994 introduced some reforms,
notably the establishment of a securities trading supervisory office,
both Germans and foreign banks complain that the changes have not yet
gone far enough. The finance ministry in Bonn is being lobbied by
various banking groups which hope to see a number of changes in the
forthcoming Third Financial Markets Promotion Act.

Ideally, the banks would like to see abolition of the minimum reserve,
rapid implementation of the capital adequacy directive and immediate
issue of short-term government debt.

With the finance ministry still smarting from the decision of the big
German banks to shift important capital markets operations to London or
New York, it is important for the banking community to present a united
front. That will be enormously beneficial in persuading both the
finance ministry and the Bundesbank that a free-market and not a
protectionist approach will best secure a promising future for
Finanzplatz Frankfurt.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS BOOSTS CREDITANSTALT

CREDITANSTALT, Austria's second-largest bank and long-time
privatisation target, has announced an increase in consolidated net
income of 16 percent, largely due to a strong international
performance.

Foreign business, which accounted for half of the consolidated balance
sheet, generated about two-thirds of the group's net income. The
group's net profit went up to Sch2.2 billion ($215 million) in 1995
from Sch1.9 billion a year earlier. Its operating result rose to Sch5.9
billion, up 4 percent and 40 percent higher than that of the domestic
operation Creditanstalt- Bankverein AG.

Domestic business suffered from weak credit demand, a shift to low-
interest, short-term loans and pressure on the interest margin, Guido
Schmidt-Chiari, group chairman, said on January 9. Earnings from
industrial holdings were up but provisions for loans to domestic
customers were up to Sch3.1 billion, from Sch2.7 billion in 1994.

In its recent Banking System Outlook for Austria, Moody's rating agency
expressed concern about the country's poor banking returns. After
Belgium, Austria is the most overbanked country in the European Union -
at end 1994 one bank or bank branch served only 1,384 people.

Unlike Austria's bankers, Moody's is not sure that the thin returns
will deter foreign entrants. This might, Moody's believes, "(a) only be
true during the near-term, and (b) hold only for the more plain vanilla
banking products and services".

Creating shareholder value has not been an overriding strategic
objective for Austrian banks. The politicised system has not only
contributed to the delay in selling the government's 49 percent stake
in Creditanstalt and 20 percent of Bank Austria but means that it will
be difficult for banks to improve their cost structure, Moody's argues.

Inherent competitive cost advantages "may enable more efficient foreign
entrants to compete against domestic institutions with some success",
the report says. It predicts that the country's financial markets will
become more exposed to domestic asset and savings disintermediation and
to cross-border competition "that is likely to focus on niche markets
such as mutual funds, lease finance and credit cards".

Faced with pressure at home, Creditanstalt, like Austria's other
leading banks, has been turning its attention to eastern Europe. In
this region, where Creditanstalt has to date invested Sch1.9 billion,
the bank's accumulated operating result rose from Sch330 million to
Sch366 million.

Moody's warns that competition may, in the medium term, make banking
activities in eastern Europe less attractive than they looked
initially. It also cautions that the extent and volatility of risk is
difficult to quantify.

AXA AND GENERALI TIDY UP LINKS

AXA, THE French insurance group, and Italian insurer Generali are
restructuring their complicated cross-shareholdings in a bid to develop
their long-standing but so far not very strategically productive
relationship.

AXA has announced a Fr5.9 billion ($1.19 billion) capital increase and
a restructuring which will give Generali a direct holding of 11 percent
in the French insurer.

Generali and AXA have been entangled since 1990, when AXA bought French
insurer Compagnie de Midi. At that time, the companies set up two joint
control and development holdings: Midi Participations, which is 60
percent owned by Finaxa and 40 percent by Generali; and Generali Midi
Expansion (GME), which is 60 percent held by Generali and 40 percent by
AXA.

Under the new agreement, Midi Participations will be dissolved and
Generali will buy back AXA's 40 percent reciprocal stake in GME. The
groups have also agreed to finalise a shareholder agreement by February
15, reaffirming their intention to seek joint development opportunities
and "barring unforeseen circumstances" to maintain their shareholdings
at current levels.

Generali observers have been speculating about possibly heavier French
involvement since June last year, when Eugenio Coppola di Cazano
stepped down as Generali chairman and chief executive for health
reasons. He was replaced as chairman by Antoine Bernheim, general
partner of Lazard Freres, the Paris financial group which owns 4.7
percent of Generali's equity.

At the beginning of that month, Generali had signed an agreement to
fuse its French subsidiary with La France group, indirectly controlled
by Lazard Freres, creating France's 11th-largest non- life insurer,
Generali France Holding.

CL AWAITS DECISION OF COMMISSION

THE CONFUSION surrounding the future of Credit Lyonnais's branch
network continues. The European Commission in Brussels is shortly due
to spell out clearly how the bank is to proceed in selling off 35
percent of its commercial banking assets abroad, including 50 percent
of those in Europe outside France, before the end of 1998 - the price
the bank has had to pay for its massive state bail-out (see EB).

This would mean dismantling the French banks' expensively acquired
branch network, with the exception of BfG Bank in Germany, the largest
and most profitable of Credit Lyonnais's European units and the one it
most earnestly wants to keep.

But this would also seem to be in contradiction of the assertion by
Phillippe Cloes, managing director of Credit Lyonnais Belgium, that his
bank was "not on the list of sell-offs" and a similar statement made by
managers at Credit Lyonnais's Swiss unit.

The protocol signed between the Commission and the French state which
stipulates that the 1998 deadline can be extended if the sale of assets
leads to "large losses" or "forces the main shareholder [the state] to
give fresh financial support". The bank's own board of directors has
stated that it will be "very careful that future disinvestments do not
lead to a decline in the bank's financial standing".

Credit Lyonnais has also announced the opening of a branch in the
Netherlands, designed to serve the bank's corporate customers. This
comes just a few months after the sale of the scandal-ridden Credit
Lyonnais Bank-Nederland to the Belgian Generale de Banque as part of
the rationalisation of its non-domestic network.

HYPO STEPS BACK IN THE EAST

HYPO SERVICE Bank (HSB), the wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayerische
Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, Germany's fifth-largest bank, has cut
nearly one-fifth of its branches in the new federal states.

Set up in 1992 as a low-budget bank for private clients in east
Germany, HSB lost DM28 million ($19 million) in 1995. It closed nine of
its 46 branches and let go 30 of its 280 staff in late December last
year in a bid to halve these losses by the end of 1996.

"The branches were simply unprofitable and had too few customers." said
Lothar Lanz, board member at HSB. So far Hypo- Bank has invested about
DM50 million in HSB, which currently has 110,000 customers and a
balance sheet total of DM1.5 billion.

Deutsche Bank has built up a network of 400 branches in the new Federal
States in two-and-a-half years and plans to maintain it, a spokesman
said. "It makes sense to build up a branch network, although not all
are profitable," he said. Germany's number one bank acquired 120 of
these offices through a joint venture with Deutsche Kredit Bank,
formerly an exclusively east German bank. It currently has 90 branches
in west Berlin alone.

Bayerische Vereinsbank has a widely spread network of over 100 branch
offices, built up since reunification. The bank expects corporate
business to get riskier in the coming years because a lot of state
schemes will peter out.

It also expects margins to narrow in the retail sector because
competition will be largely price-based and, for this reason, is
promoting phone banking and on-line banking.

Dresdner Bank, which has 250 branches in the new federal states, sees
"no need for cuts".

GE CAPITAL BUYS INTO BUDAPEST BANK

GE CAPITAL, the financial services arm of the US General Electric
Company, has succeeded in its efforts to buy Sovac, the French finance
company, and a controlling stake in Budapest Bank, Hungary's second
largest bank.

The Sovac board accepted GE's public offer of Fr610 ($123) per share
(or Fr7.7 billion) on December 19. The US non-bank, now holds 97.49
percent of Sovac's capital, making it one of the major consumer credit
providers in France in one fell swoop (see EB 119).

In Hungary, GE Capital has bought 27.5 percent of Budapest Bank's
shares and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's 32.5
percent for a combined price of $87 million. The move means that
Budapest Bank can hold on to a state capital injection of HUF3 million
($22,000), which it received at the beginning of last year. (see EB
119)

LEPETIT QUITS INDOSUEZ

THE COMPLETION of Banque Indosuez's strategic review has also brought
to an end Jean-Francois Lepetit's career with the bank. Lepetit
resigned as chief executive on January 15"to pursue other interests
outside the group".

He has been replaced by Christian Maurin, who takes on the functions of
chairman and chief executive. Compagnie de Suez chairman Gerard
Mestrallet becomes chairman of the supervisory board.

Maurin comes from Banque Sofinco, where he has been chief executive
since 1991. Sofinco is now France's second-ranked consumer credit
institution, with return on equity of 20 percent.

The Suez group has been working to restructure and streamline in order
to combat huge losses. In the first six months of 1995, it made a net
loss of Fr3.976 billion ($800 million), largely due to real estate
losses. Banque Indosuez reported net losses of Fr16 million after
transferring Fr5.6 billion of real estate assets to Compagnie de Suez
(EB 118).

On January 23, Banque Indosuez shareholders were due to vote on whether
to transform Banque Indosuez into a company governed by a supervisory
board and an executive board.

KLEINWORT BENSON BUYS WARBURG LEASING

KLEINWORT BENSON, the UK investment bank taken over last year by
Dresdner Bank, has bought the leasing finance and advisory subsidiaries
of rival SBC Warburg, formed through Swiss Bank Corporation's takeover
of SG Warburg, for an undisclosed sum.

Kleinwort Benson has bought most of the former SBC Warburg big ticket
leasing portfolio and an executive team of ten individuals and will
integrate the new business into its financing department.

Buying SBC Warburg's subsidiaries almost doubles Kleinwort Benson's
leasing asset base, estimated to be around #450 million ($696 million).

The SBC Warburg business is a good match because many of its contracts
were with existing Kleinwort customers, John Cameron, joint head of
financing at Kleinwort, said. It also opens up opportunities for the
expansion of the advisory business.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has taken on three utilities
analysts from Kleinwort Benson, to work on pan-European research.

CHASING THE `EUROCONSUMER'

All European branches now sport the Citibank label and the bank's aim
is to make Citibank to the financial services sector what Coca Cola is
to the soft drinks industry. Sorcha Corcoran reports

OFTEN DESCRIBED as the only true pan-European retail bank, Citibank,
the banking arm of US multi-finance group Citicorp, now generates
nearly one-third of its total revenues in Europe. Germany continues to
be Citibank's European shining star but the bank is also pushing its
global strategy of providing services "anywhere, anytime, anyhow", in
Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and, most recently,
the UK.

There have been rumours that Citibank will reorganise its European
retail operations in view of former head of retail banking Victor
Menezes' recent promotion to corporate finance officer at Citicorp. A
decision on reorganisation will be made in the next couple of months
but no comment is available yet.

Up to now, Citibank in Europe has stuck closely to its global retail
strategy, pursued in 41 countries worldwide. This is to provide
upscale, premium financial services, with a multinational service
network, through a minimal number of branches, supplemented with
telephone and ATM service.

"We aim to deliver private customers the same bank services in the same
branches across Europe," Folkert Mindermann, managing director of
Citibank Privatkunden AG, the German consumer bank, told EB. "It is a
region where we expect considerable growth in revenues."

The bank's considerable success in the lucrative European consumer
market is largely due to the fact that its niche strategy minimises
frontal attacks, argued a recent study of the Citicorp organisation,
Citicorp Europe - Refashioning Itself for the Nineties, published by
analysts Salomon Brothers.

Citibank has defined its retail target as "internationally aware,
performance demanding and located primarily in large population
centres". The middle-income market needs most attention in the near
future, Mindermann said.

Excluding the card business, Europe contributed $1.5 billion to
Citibank's total consumer revenues in 1995, representing 30 percent of
total revenues, Mindermann said. There are 500 consumer branches in
Europe, nearly half the world total of 1,200, and the bank employs
7,000 people in the region. Assets came to $50 billion last year.

The consumer business is as much a marketing company as a bank. The
aim: to make Citibank to the financial services sector what Coca Cola
is to the soft drinks industry. All European branches now sport the
Citibank label and Citibank has introduced the "model branch" concept,
in which the same signage, architecture and operating systems are used
in Citibank branches around the world.

In these branches, consumers have access to Customer Activated
Terminals (CATs), an advanced touchscreen system that recognises from
the customer's PIN what language to use. Every Citibank customer has a
Citicard, which can be tied to several accounts, even with different
currencies.

An important feature of Citibank's Euro-attack is its integrated
network, Mindermann said. The bank moved nine consumer banking data
centres scattered around Europe to a single location at Meerbusch,
Germany in 1994. All European branches now have access to account
information on line.

"Citibank is the only European bank with one integrated system,"
Mindermann said. "For this reason it is the highest ranked in Europe in
terms of consumer orientation."

The integrated electronic data processing system improves cost and
control and allows Citibank to roll out new products more quickly,
Salomon Brothers notes. The bank need simply transfer "existing
systems, products and methodologies using infrastructure, experience
and language skills available elsewhere in the network", the report
points out.

One key business area in Europe is cards. Citibank had 1 million credit
card accounts in 1995 and by the end of the millennium this should grow
to 5 million, predicted Roberta Arena, head of cards in the US and
Europe. To minimise unit costs, the bank is transferring European
transactions across the Atlantic to Citibank's processing centre in
Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Citicorp started its regional credit card effort in 1989, beginning
with four countries - Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain. In five
years, the card base had grown to 500,000. The bank has become the
largest issuer in Greece since then and is now opening accounts in two
new countries each year.

Establishing cards businesses was a "gruesomely expensive" five year
effort, Arena said. High entry costs will, however, benefit Citibank by
discouraging other players from entering its selected markets, she
forecast.

Arena expects Citibank to be the number one card issuer in Germany
before long. At the end of 1994 it ranked fourth and was within 50,000
cards of Deutsche Bank.

In a move which alarmed traditionalists, Citibank has launched a co-
branded card with Deutsche Bahn, the German railway. The dual-branding
offer allows holders of the Bahncard rail discount card to add a Visa
or Electron payment function at no additional charge.

A legal battle ensued as the German competition authority, Zentrale zur
Bekampfung des unlauteren Wettbewerbs, opposed the deal, deeming it
unlawful. Citibank won the case in November and now claims that its
Bahncard has the potential to revolutionise the cards industry in a
market viewed by many observers as still underpenetrated. There are
already 3 million Bahncard holders in Germany, and their numbers are
set to rise to 5 million over the next couple of years.

Indeed, Germany stands out for Citibank in more ways than one. As the
largest and oldest retail bank (founded in 1926), Citibank Privatkunden
AG generates over 50 percent of European revenues. Of the 500 European
branches, 300 are German, and 4,000 of the 7,000 employees are located
there.

At end-September 1995, the balance sheet total of Citibank Privatkunden
AG came to DM15.9 billion ($11 billion), up from DM15.2 billion at the
end of 1994. It now serves 2.5 million customers with 4.4 million bank
accounts, insurance policies, Citibank Visa cards and home savings
agreements.

Mindermann attributes much of Citibank's German success to the
acquisition of Kundenkreditbank in 1974. "Kundenkreditbank was very
strong at that time, with a good branch network," he said.

Although among the highest returning banks in Germany for many years,
the bank was traditionally a blue-collar-oriented company with limited
growth. Citibank revamped the bank in 1989, establishing a more upscale
image through enhancing service and marketing.

Unique to Germany so far is CitiPhone Direct Banking, a full banking
and financial service, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with personal
service by telephone. Citibank, as the pioneer of telephone banking in
Germany in 1989, started the new service in October 1995.

Previously only cash transactions were possible over the phone. Now,
customers use a personal password and identification number for
telephone handling of savings-account, investment, securities, credit
and insurance business. Only one signature is needed for all accounts.

"CitiPhone Direct Banking has got off to a very good start," said
Mindermann. "Already we have reached more than 3,000 new customers, and
are receiving an average of 1,500 calls a day. Most people are
interested in all the services offered."

Citibank plans to use the Aachen-based telecentre for CitiPhone Direct
Banking to target customers in other European countries. Aachen is well
situated for this purpose in the German, Dutch and Belgian border
triangle, close to France and within easy reach of the UK, so that
staff with mother tongues can easily be recruited.

In order to tap new market potential in Germany, Citibank entered in
December into an extensive collaboration agreement with HDI
Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie, the country's seventh
largest insurance group.

HDI is taking over the entire insurance operations of the Citibank
Group in Germany through the purchase of all shares in its insurance
holding company, Citifinanzleistungen GmbH. This company holds all the
shares in Citi Lebensversicherung, set up in 1985 and in Citi
Versicherung, set up in 1992. A purchase price has not been disclosed.

Under the agreement, Citibank will integrate the products of HDI into
the marketing channels of its banking operations - both the branch
network and telephone banking channel - and HDI will, in turn, offer
its private clients the banking products and services of Citibank.
"HDI's 1.8 million private insurance customers will provide us with
very good cross-selling business,", Mindermann said.

Citi Leben, whose product range covers individual, whole life and risk
insurance, had total sum insured by end-November 1995 of DM16.7
billion, up 4 percent on 1994. HDI notched up consolidated premium
income totalling DM8 billion in 1994 and a net profit of DM134 million.

This kind of co-operative agreement will be important for Citibank in
Europe in promoting its concept of a "multi- finance service in banking
operations", Mindermann said. In linking up with HDI, Citibank is
continuing along the path already taken in offering home financing
(together with Rheinboden), home savings agreements (with mh) and
health insurance (with Barmenia) in order to optimise its own financial
services business by exploiting "intercorporate alliances".

The most recent European market Citibank has targeted with its consumer
services is the UK. During 1995, it opened five branches, all following
the same strategy as elsewhere on the globe.

"We simply rolled out what's been happening in Germany, France and
Spain," said Mike Dennehy, consumer banking and marketing director for
the UK. "The UK is such a mature and sophisticated market that we had
to be sure we got the formula exactly right before starting a consumer
operation."

Account structures differ around Europe but the UK has adopted various
features from other Citibank markets. For example, if a customer has a
balance of over #2,000 on all of his/her accounts, there is no banking
charge, a feature of the Belgian operation.

The UK has also taken on the Greek policy of instant credit card
issuance. Customers can receive a card on the spot, if they fulfil all
the requirements, simply by filling out a form.

The biggest obstacle to setting up a retail operation in the UK was the
fact that Citibank was so well known as a corporate bank, Dennehy said.
In the UK since 1902, Citibank now employs 3,000 people, 400 of which
are now in the consumer business. The bank has been offering mortgages
for 25 years. Dennehy stressed that Citibank in the UK is only after a
niche market - clients earning #30,000 ($46,418) and above with an
"international element to their lives".

"We're not looking for hundreds of thousands of customers, but tens of
thousands," he said."They could be someone who works in Belgium one
week out of four, or has a house in France, for instance."

CITIBANK TO PULL BACK IN FRANCE?

CITIBANK IS set to become the latest of a series of foreign banks to
reduce their presence in France. According to reports, Citibank's
French subsidiary is attempting to sell its small and medium-sized
enterprise portfolio and its small branch network in the provinces in
order to concentrate on its consumer banking business in the Paris
area. Among the possible candidates set to take over this portfolio is
the Banques Populaires group.

The rumours, on which Citibank would not comment, come hard on the
heels of news that prestigious names such as Banca Commerciale Italiana
(Comit), Barclays Bank, La Caixa and American Express are all in the
process of lowering their retail banking ambitions in France.

Comit, for example, is thought to be discussing the sale of part of its
19-branch network (most of which is on the Cote d'Azur, apart from five
branches in Paris) to Banques Populaires. The Italian bank lost Fr495.8
million ($100 million) in France in the period 1992-1994, mostly
because of its involvement in speculative property loans.

Less prominent names such as Banco di Napoli, ASLK-CGER Bank of Belgium
and the Banque Franco-Portugaise have also announced lay- offs and
decisions to refocus their businesses.

The news also comes shortly after the release of figures by the
Association Francaise des Banques which suggest that the chances of
survival of small niche-based retail banks (many of which are owned by
non-French institutions) are extremely slim. These suggest that net
banking income and operating profits have continued to fall steadily
through the first half of 1995.

As foreign banks in France generally lack the critical mass to
withstand this downward pressure and increasing competition, their
attempts to carve out a branch-based business have been frustrated.

PORTUGAL BEATS GERMANY TO TOP LEAGUE OF SAVERS

The Portuguese appear to be the thriftiest people in Europe, according
to OECD data.

The surprising figures push Italy and Germany into second and third
places in terms of household savings as a proportion of disposable
income.

In absolute terms, the Germans save more than any other Europeans -
simply because there are more of them, each with more money at his or
her disposal than the majority of other Europeans.

The reunification of the two German republics in October 1990 makes
historical comparisons and projections in the area of personal savings
problematical.

But in round figures, German households could put away something like
DM150 billion (Ecu 77 bn) this year in long-term financial investments
- including life assurance and occupational pension funds.

Besides being among Europe's heaviest savers, the Germans also have the
distinction of being the steadiest.

In comparison with other states they show a batch of remarkably
consistent savings ratios:  total savings (including investment in
housing) as a percentage of disposable income;  financial savings as a
percentage of total resources available for investment; or long-term
financial savings in relation to short-term - all follow a
conspicuously regular pattern.

Another distinguishing feature of German households is a low level of
indebtedness, particularly compared with the French and the British.

Although there is evidence that in Germany (as in the United Kingdom)
consumers regard borrowed money in very much the same way as income, as
part, in other words, of their normal budget, a recent survey showed
that nearly half the adult German population still feels uneasy about
the idea of having to take out a loan.

Higher consumer confidence

According to the OECD, from  data supplied by the Ministry of Finance
and the Bank of Portugal, Portuguese households save a greater
proportion of their income than anyone else in Europe.

Throughout the 1980s the personal savings ratio, as defined above,
averaged 25.9 per cent.

The ratio reached a peak of 28.3 per cent in 1985, but declined by
nearly six percentage points over the next three years.

Although real disposable income grew at the record rate of 6.5 per cent
in 1990, its rate of increase has since eased to 2.8 per cent in 1992.

At the same time, the savings ratio has also continued to decline, and
in 1992 was 21.6 per cent.

The decline was probably due to a number of factors.  The slowing down
of consumer price inflation, with its positive impact on households'
net worth was one.

Added to this were higher consumer confidence, the progressive relaxing
of liquidity constraints, expectations of higher permanent incomes as
future employment prospects improved, and (until 1991, at least) the
notably sharp rise in retirement pensions.

But a household savings ratio of 21.6 per cent of disposable income is
still well above the ratios of the other OECD countries, and a number
of social and economic factors are at work to maintain such a high
rate.

It is estimated that there are some 4.3 mn  Portuguese living abroad
(one million of them in other EC countries), compared with a resident
population of 10.4 mn.

Remittances from emigrant workers, although showing a decline in 1992,
have made and still make a substantial contribution on current account
to the Portuguese balance of payments, and although no data are
available to allow one to distinguish this specific flow of funds,
these remittances may be assumed to give a significant boost to
personal sector savings.

A comparatively high proportion of the resident workforce is self-
employed, and motivated by the consequent volatility of income and
comparatively low social protection to maintain a fairly high level of
precautionary saving.

A further element in personal saving is probably intended to maintain
or restore the net wealth of households subject to erosion  by a rate
of inflation which, although falling since 1990 is still the second
highest (after Greece) in the European Community.

Finally, the relatively under developed consumer credit market may also
play a part in Portugal's high household savings ratio, as it certainly
does in Italy.

Italy has the highest household savings rate of all the major OECD
countries -  in recent years even above Japan by between one and two
percentage points.

Although the rate has declined steadily since its peak around 26 per
cent in the 1960s and early 1970s, in the last three years it has
averaged more than 15 per cent, compared with just over 8 per cent in
the United Kingdom and 12 per cent in Germany.

The fact that Italy's savings rate is so high is at first sight
surprising, and probably not consonant with what many people outside
Italy take to be the national temperament.  But the causes of such a
high rate are not immediately cultural, but technical.

Low development of capital markets

In a paper1 presented to an international conference on savings
behaviour held in Helsinki in 1991, a team of Italian economists found
that the low development of Italian capital markets was the main reason
for three conspicuous characteristics of the Italian savings rate
(whether national or private): its high level; its substantial
reduction in the past three decades; and its strong correlation with
the growth of the national economy.

The authors of the paper showed that Italian credit and insurance
markets are considerably smaller, relative to GDP, than those of other
comparably developed countries.

Credit finances a trivial share of household consumption and
investment, Italy's small credit market being explained by the terms of
consumer credit (high down payment levels; a wide spread between
borrowing and lending rates) rather than by demographic or cultural
factors.

One consequence of these technical factors is that the Italian mortgage
market is one of the smallest among OECD countries, and expressed as a
percentage of private consumption expenditure, only a small fraction of
the average of the seven major (G7) countries.  This factor alone,
according to Sig Guiso and his co-authors,  may account for some two or
three percentage points in the aggregate savings ratio.

Italians still buy little life insurance

Italians still buy very little life insurance, in comparison with the
citizens of other G7 countries, particularly.  Life assurance premium
income is now increasing rapidly (by 22 per cent in 1991, compared with
19 per cent in France and 13 per cent in Germany), but the level of
life assurance per inhabitant is still only a fraction (between  20 and
25 per cent) of the level in those other two EC countries.

The authors of the Helsinki paper give reasons, however, for supposing
that credit market imperfections outweigh imperfect insurance markets
in explaining the behaviour of Italian households.

They also discount any special bequest motive in explaining the high
personal savings rate, arguing that the rate at which the elderly shed
their assets is actually greater in Italy than in Japan or the United
States.

`The  evidence,'  they conclude, `suggests that Italians are not
different in any major respect from other OECD citizens;  rather, it is
Italian capital markets that are different.'

RATIONALE OF THE RATIOS

In spite of their importance to national economies, household or
personal savings are defined by official statisticians essentially as a
residual item.

Savings from their point of view are simply that portion of an
individual's income that he or she refrains from spending.  They're
what's left, in other words, after consumers have stopped consuming.

Official statisticians also like to refer to `disposable income', by
which they mean income, from whatever source, after taxes have been
paid and social security payments or receipts have been netted out.

Flows of personal savings are calculated in effect as the surplus of
current income over current expenditure, and disposable income is
allocated for the purposes of national accounts entirely between saving
and consumption.

Consumption is estimated from a variety of data, and simply deducted
from income in order to arrive at savings.

The figures on savings are supposed to be checked against other
indicative data, but this enterprise tends to show up some pretty
glaring discrepancies, which official statisticians seek to correct by
falling back on conveniently undefined `balancing items'.

In any case, household savings, as featured in national accounts,
include investment in housing, both in house or apartment purchase and
home renovation or improvement.

In some countries, spending on consumer durables is also sometimes
counted as saving.

Realistic measure of savings

Financial savings, which are mainly what this newsletter is concerned
with, are therefore only a part of household savings, as habitually
defined.

But if the numerator in the household savings ratio is too broad to
indicate the magnitude of purely financial savings, the denominator is
too narrow to determine households' financial resources.

Because apart from actual income, derived from salaries, wages and
investments, householders (which in practical terms include millions of
individuals who do not actually hold a house) also often borrow money,
and perhaps not quite so often, inherit it.

For this reason, more and more analysts of savings trends in a number
of countries are focusing attention on the financial resources
available to households, rather than on income as usually defined.

The practical implications of what may seem to be conceptual nuances
are enormous.

From the point of view of financial services, as pointed out by Dr
David Fleming in his paper, Time for a realistic measure of savings1,,
`a high-savings, highly-borrowed market is very different from a low-
savings, lightly-borrowed market, even if the net savings level is the
same in each case.'

Why bother, then, with the traditional household savings ratio?

The only answer to this is that for the time being it is the most fully
documented and consistently estimated savings indicator available.  And
it is the only savings indicator so far to form any possible basis for
comparisons not only between different countries, but between one
period of time and another.

ITALY:  SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION REGIME APPROVED - FINALMENTE

After something like 18 years of argument, and in the face of a barrage
of heavy criticism , the Italian government finally approved a
legislative decree on supplementary pension funds.

Finally approved - but such is the nature of the legislative process in
Italy, that the government can still amend the decree by the end of
this year, with the result that the debate continues with undiminished
vigour.

Two more decrees on the funds' establishment procedures, contracts with
their managing bodies, and investment criteria will be issued over the
next six months, and the intention is that the schemes will become
operative in 1994.

The new pension funds - fondi pensione complementari or integrativi -
are `supplementary' in the sense that membership of them is open to
persons already contributing to state schemes.

This will take some of the burden off the state pension system in a
country with an ageing population and a notoriously large and still
rising public sector deficit.

As it is, state pensions are now less generous than they were in the
past.

Most workers and managers earning more than L50 mn (Ecu 28,000) a year
are already covered by voluntary plans, so that the main market for the
new funds will be  employees and self-employed individuals with incomes
below the L50 mn level.

As about 80 per cent of the working population fall into this category,
the market is potentially a large one.

But it's an entirely open question how many will decide to participate
in the new pension funds instead of putting their savings into high-
interest Treasury bills (buoni del Tesoro - BOT) or private insurance.

The new pension funds will be legal entities, established through
company contracts or workers' agreements promoted by trade unions that
are signatories to national labour contracts.

Employees, whether in the public or private sector, grouped by
category, company or public body, may institute defined contribution
plans with a guaranteed rate of financial return.  These funds may be
constituted within the assets of an individual company.

Self-employed workers and tradesmen and free-lance professionals,
grouped by trade or profession or territorial sector, or by their trade
associations, may constitute defined benefit plans.

The benefits, the size of which will be determined by the statutory and
contractual choices made at the act of constitution of each pension
fund, will be paid in the form of income (rendita), though members may
receive a lump sum (capitale) equivalent to 50 per cent of the current
value of the amount accrued.

Length of service benefits will be paid

Members who have contributed to the new funds for at least five years
will be eligible for old age pension benefits when they reach the
pensionable age laid down in the compulsory system.

Length-of-service benefits will be paid to individuals who have been
members of the funds for at least 15 years, and who are not more than
ten years younger than the age envisaged in the compulsory system
(which will be raised gradually from 60 to 65 years for men, and from
55 to 60 for women).

Fund members for whom severance pay (trattamento di fine rapporto -
TFR) has been accrued for at least eight years may be granted advance
payments for medical treatment or for the purchase of a house as first-
time buyers.

For tax purposes, employers may deduct contributions up to 50 per cent
of the quota taken from the TFR.

Members' contributions will benefit from a 27 per cent tax deduction on
amounts up to a maximum of L3 mn.

This applies to all contributors, whether they are employees (for whom
contributions are also made by their employers and from the TFR) or
self-employed (for whom such contributions are not paid).

The L3 mn limit also includes other deductions that may be made for the
payment of life policy and health premiums.

The contributions made out of the annual allocation to the TFR are not
taxable, but when the TFR is liquidated, these quotas are taken into
account in determining the amount of tax to be paid.

All payments into the fund will be subject to a withholding tax of 15
per cent per annum, but members are allowed a tax deduction of 17.6 per
cent on the income or capital they eventually receive.

Company payments are subject to a 10 per cent `solidarity contribution'
to the national institute for social security (Istituto nazionale di
previdenza sociale - INPS).

The supplementary pension funds are not allowed to undertake insurance
commitments directly.

Their assets may be managed under agreements concluded with three
distinct types of entity.

The first is the so-called SIM - societe di intermediazione mobiliare,
a type of company instituted in December 1990 which as well as carrying
out brokerage, dealing, market making and underwriting operations may
also manage assets.

Banks rank with SIM for this purpose, as well as other EC
intermediaries that perform the same activity and that have obtained
mutual recognition.

The second category of pension fund asset managers comprises  insurance
companies authorised to handle life assurance and capital redemption
policies.  Indeed, plans with defined benefits and guaranteed rates of
financial return are allowed to manage their resources only through
contracts with these insurance companies.

Financing by workers and employers

Finally, fund assets may be managed by entities already managing
compulsory pension schemes (principally the INPS).

With the permission of the anti-trust authority, the INPS may conclude
agreements with the supplementary pension funds for the collection of
contributions and the disbursement of benefits.

`Open' (as distinct from defined group) pension funds may be instituted
by the intermediaries authorised to manage ordinary pension funds
(brokers, banks, insurance companies, social insurance institutions) as
well as by the companies that manage investment funds (fondi comuni
d'investimento).

Membership of open pension funds is available only to workers covered
by the compulsory pension system and employed by companies that have
not established complementary pension schemes, and to workers who have
lost the requirements for participating in the group schemes to which
they would normally belong.

Financing the complementary pension funds is the responsibility of the
workers and the employers.

No one may contribute more than 10 per cent either, in the case of
employees, of the annual wage taken as the basis for determining
severance pay, or, in the case of the self-employed, of annual income.

The government is expected to make some changes to the decree,
particularly concerning its tax provisions, perhaps changing the 15 per
cent withholding tax and introducing instead a 15 per cent obligatory
investment in convertible bonds to encourage privatisation.

FRANCE:  RECLASSIFICATION OF SICAVS AND FCPS

The French stock market supervisory body, the Commission des operations
de Bourse  (COB), has revealed details of its plans to change the
classification of all managed funds operating in France.

All Sicavs and fonds communs de placement (FCPs) sold in France will be
affected by the new classification, due to take effect from January 1,
1994.

The new system involves five descriptive categories and three sub-
categories, and replaces an out-of-date 13-category classification
introduced in 1985 before derivative products became an important part
of funds, and before Sicav monetaires took off.

The new categories are designed to inform savers more clearly whether a
fund is invested in equities, bonds, or monetary instruments, whether
it has a guarantee, or whether it involves potential currency exposure.

For investors this is expected to give a better appreciation of risk
than the old system which, while giving an idea of equities, bonds and
short-term investments, divided these into several sub-sections with
minor differences.

The COB says that the new system will also help multi-service groups
such as banks and financial intermediaries determine their
responsibilities in relation to investors and their depository bodies.

France is the only European country to have an obligatory fund
classification system that has such an impact on the day-to-day
operation of funds.

The new classification requires an equity fund to remain at least 60
per cent invested in equities at all times.  A monetary instrument fund
is restricted to a maximum of 10 per cent investment in equities.

Funds holding convertibles must declare whether their convertibles
behave more like an equity or more like a bond.

Fund managers now have four months to decide which categories their
funds fall into, and to make any necessary adjustments to management
aims and techniques.

The COB will then give its approval to the self-declared allegiance, or
suggest a recategorisation.

Any fund managers who disagree with COB recommendations can move to the
diversified section, which covers all funds not eligible for `pure'
categories.

Although the new system of classification was not prompted by the ucits
directive, it is expected that French funds will remain compatible with
it.

Foreign funds sold in France are unlikely to have to change their
management practices, as they fall straightforwardly into the foreign
equities, foreign bonds, or foreign monetary categories in the case of
single-instrument products or, for mixed funds, into the catch-all
diversified products category, which will also include all funds under
discretionary management, as well as funds invested in convertible
stocks.

SPAIN:  FIRST PROPERTY FUNDS LIKELY BY AUTUMN

Property investment funds - fondos de inversion inmobiliaria - are the
latest arrival on the investment scene in Spain, under a royal decree
issued last month.

The concept of such funds has existed in Spanish law since 1964 but it
was not until July last year that a new law specifically laid out the
framework for an instrument that is well established in many other EC
member states.

And only in May this year, with the issuing of royal decree 686/1993,
was the earlier framework fleshed out with the detail needed for the
creation of the first property funds, which may be launched as early as
the autumn.

One of the benefits that Spanish officials hope to reap from this new
savings instrument is a stimulus to the housing market, at present deep
in the doldrums.

Property investment funds tend to flourish in a relatively deep and
well-developed property market, where they may boost its development
and enhance its stability.

Opening the way for small savers to enter the housing market via fondos
inmobiliarios will mean `new financing for the property market',
according to a top executive of the Groupe Pelloux.

Spanish officials also hope that the new funds will fill a specific and
important market gap: that of rental housing, which is scarce in Spain.

The July 1992 law clearly referred to the role it is hoped the funds
will play by calling them in the preamble `a component of the
government's housing policy.'  But some experts say this narrow focus
is a weak point of the 1992 law.

A needed long-term investment vehicle

Another great benefit of property investment funds in Spain is that
they will provide a new and much-needed long-term investment instrument
in Spain.

According to the same Groupe Pelloux spokesman, the funds will fill a
gap in Spanish capital markets, which at present have only 10-year
Treasury bonds as long-term instruments, whose volume is still quite
small.

The 1992 law specifies that property investments may not exceed between
70 and 80 per cent of the fund's assets.  The remainder can be invested
in tradable securities, either equities or bonds.

A new fund must have assets of at least Ptas1.5 bn (Ecu10 mn).

It must have at least 100 participants, and no individual investor may
hold more than a 25 per cent share in the fund.

Property assets will be valued at least once a year by assessors
registered with the bank of Spain.

Another feature of the law is that it aims to encourage medium-and long-
term investment by tying tax benefits to a minimum four-year period of
ownership of property by the fund.

Still to be defined by the Ministry of the Economy are the rules to be
applied to the diversification of funds' real estate holdings, to avoid
the risks inherent in undue concentration in a single property.

The Ministry must also decide what types of property will be open to
investment by the funds - whether, for example, building lots can also
be included.

Limits will also have to be set on the amount of outstanding loans that
a fund may contract.

But although these details have still to be clarified, an official of
the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), the stock market
regulatory body that will supervise the funds, claims that there is
already more than one candidate waiting to be the first on the market.

FRANCE:  SHARE OWNERSHIP SET TO REVIVE

The first quarter of the year showed Sicav managers increasing their
exposure to equities.

With only part of the increase attributable to the strength of the
stock market, the value of shares in their portfolios rose by FF90 bn
(Ecu13.7 bn).

French fund managers increased the proportion of the CAC-100 index
accounted for by Sicavs from 5.88 per cent to 6.36 per cent, according
to the Dealers' Book.

That is a tiny fraction compared with their counterparts across the
channel, but an increase in the funds' exposure to equities is a
necessary condition for the success of the privatisation programme.

But there may still be a lot of resistance to overcome.

Spectacular fall in equity fund owners

According to a study conducted by Sofres, the polling agency, on behalf
of the Bank of France, the number of private individuals holding shares
has dropped by some 900,000 to 4.5 mn since April 1991, the last time
the survey was conducted.

The number of people owning equity funds dropped even more
spectacularly, from 7.5 mn to 3.2 mn, but the numbers owning money
market funds rose from 4 mn to 5.6 mn over the same  period.

Of the approximately FF1,000 bn (Ecu150 bn) held in Sicav monetaires,
some FF700 bn (Ecu135 bn) is invested by private individuals, and the
rest by companies that use the funds as short-term means of cash
management.

The Bank of France and the Societe des Bourses francaises  (SBF - the
executive authority governing the day-to-day operations of the stock
market) remain optimistic, however, that share holding will rise again,
as historically privatisation programmes have been major periods of
increase, when young persons particularly are tempted to invest in
equities.

The managing director of the Commission des operations de Bourse (COB),
M. Pierre Fleuriot, predicts that employee share schemes and the tax-
favourable equity savings scheme introduced in September 1992 (the plan
d'epargne en actions - PEA) will also have the effect of lifting share
ownership.

The importance of small investors is shown by the fact that over half
the people in France owning equities have a portfolio worth less than
FF50,000 (Ecu7,600).

GERMANY:  GERMAN EQUITIES BRING GREATER REWARDS...

Mr Ralf Conen, head of quantitative capital markets analysis at
Deutsche Bank, has recently completed a study of stock market yields in
Germany covering three historical periods  1876-1913; 1924-1941; and
1949-1992.

In each of these periods the average annual yield from equities was
considerably higher than the yield from fixed-interest securities, the
most striking yield gap appearing in the period since 1949.

Since 1949, according to Mr Conen, equities have shown an average real
post-tax return of 12.08 per cent a year, while bonds have shown a
negative yield of 0.09 per cent.

In another computation, the Deutsche Bank study claims that a German
investor  who started in 1949 to put DM10,000 every year into equities
would have been a millionaire in constant 1949 terms by 1977.

But his next door neighbour who put the same amount into bonds each
year would not be a genuine 1949-vintage millionaire until the year
2059.

Mr Conen is evidently making some pretty bold assumptions about the
course of German taxes and consumer prices over the next 66 years, but
his general conclusion that the long-term German investor is paid a
pretty hefty risk premium for investing in equities seems unassailable.

 One of the more detailed findings of the study  is that, the longer
the time-span under consideration, the greater the probability that an
investment in equities is more rewarding than one in bonds.

If single years only are considered, equities were more profitable in
56 out of the 97 years covered by the research.

If periods of five years are taken as the basis of comparison, however,
in 62 out of 85 possible runs, equities were more profitable; and in
ten-year periods, 54 out of 70.


In percentage terms, this means that equities were more profitable in
58 per cent of one-year periods, in 73 per cent of five-year periods,
and in 77 per cent of ten-year periods.

When periods of 20 years or more are taken as the basis of comparison,
equities are found to have scored from 83 per cent up to 100 per cent
of the time.

In spite of the higher performance of equities, however, the German
public still show a marked preference for  bonds, at least when it
comes to putting money  into investment funds.

Last year, for example, bond funds (both German and foreign) attracted
a total of DM53.4 bn (Ecu27.3 bn) new money, equivalent to no less than
86.5 per cent of the total inflow into German funds.

As it happens, over the last year German bond funds have performed on
average better than German equity funds, benefiting both from high
yields on the bonds in their portfolios and from bond price rises
resulting from the lowering of interest rates.

But over the last ten years, for example, German equity funds have
outperformed German bond funds by a considerable margin.

According to the Bundesverband Deutscher Investment-Gesellschaften BVI
(the German Investment Fund Association), German equity funds showed an
average rise in unit value of 163.6 per cent in the ten years to the
end of March, 1993, with the top-performing fund, SMH-Special-Fonds 1,
registering an advance of 254.9 per cent.

Compared with this, the best performance shown by German bond funds was
a 113.9 per cent gain by Universal's BERENBERG-UNIV.-RENTENFONDS (the
fund which also turned in the best performance over 20 years).

The average of the 28 funds in this sector to have a ten-year or longer
track record was a 98.2 per cent increase in unit value - a mere 60 per
cent of the equity fund average.


This persistent preference for bond funds can only be based on short-
term considerations.

In any given year since 1949, bonds showed a minimum yield of 2.6 per
cent, whereas while the highest average yield of equities reached 47.2
per cent in one year, there was a year in which investors saw an
average loss of 14 per cent.

But if the risk of losing money persuades German investors to forego the
chance of enjoying more substantial returns, it also apparently focuses
their attention mistakenly on current values to the neglect of the
erosive action of inflation , which in West Germany, though less than
half the EC average, has averaged nearly 4 per cent a year in the last
20 years.

`If you want to eat well, buy shares,' runs a German saying.  "If you
want to sleep well, buy bonds.'

There may be something in that, but if consumer prices are rising while
you sleep, your dream of a bond-invested nest egg could well turn into
a nightmare.

UNITED KINGDOM:  PRIVATE MEDICAL INSURANCE USED AS 'SOFT SELL'

Although private medical insurance (PMI) is not in itself a savings
product, its development in the United Kingdom is linked to trends in
the broader savings market.

It appears that life companies - especially those that operate through
their own direct sales forces - are getting into the PMI market as a
soft way of prospecting clients for more lucrative business, such as
private pensions.

The tied sales agent must have a full range of products to offer in
order to prevent the client from going elsewhere for one particular
type of product, and then perhaps being seduced by a new company into
buying savings products as well.

A newly-launched product is easier to sell, and health insurance has
proved attractive to an industry ever hungry for new products.

Branching out into PMI offers the agent a pretext  to visit customers
to see if this area of their financial planning is covered, when the
routine annual updating visit may have lost its sales pull.

In recent years, tied agent companies such as Allied Dunbar and Lloyds
Abbey Life have entered the market, as well as major composites like
Norwich Union, Sun Alliance (through its purchase of Mutual of Omaha),
and the guaranteed bond specialist General Portfolio.

Allied Dunbar added PMI to a range which already comprised critical
illness cover (first offered in 1989) and permanent health insurance
(1985).  Allied Dunbar make their own underwriting arrangements on
these two contracts through their life funds.  Their PMI contract is
underwritten by Lloyds syndicates.

Allied Dunbar claim that one in five of all critical illness plans in
force in the United Kingdom is theirs, though in the PMI market they
are not yet a significant force, with only 20,000 contracts in
existence.

Norwich Union made a major entry into the PMI market in 1990, setting
up a new division which at the end of March 1993 claimed 375,000
clients, an estimated one-third share of all new and switched business
in 1992, and a 6 per cent share of the total market.

The managing director of Norwich Union Health Care, Mr David Cavers,
says that PMI was seen to be a market capable of rapid growth,
dominated by a couple of provident institutions (British Union
Provident Association - BUPA - of London and Private Patient Plan - PPP
-  of Tunbridge Wells), only one of which has put a lot of money into
marketing.

Norwich Union Health Care expects premium income of close to #100 mn
this year.

The only link between Norwich Union's PMI product and other savings
plans is the distribution chain - both are sold largely through
intermediaries.

Mr Cavers sees PMI as an under developed product for the intermediary.
Brokers had not been selling it actively until the last four or five
years, when specialist advisers began to appear.

`Intermediaries have now woken up to the fact that they can sell
medical plans to savings customers,' says Mr Cavers.

The effect of such competition has been to make heavy inroads into the
market share of the leading companies, BUPA and PPP, with BUPA down
from 80 per cent of the market to less than 50 per cent over the last
five years.

Continental firms enter the UK market

The most recent development in the PMI market has been the link-up
between the French healthcare mutual Strasbourgeoise and Clinicare, the
UK specialist health insurer.

Strasbourgeoise entered the British market in 1990 with a plan offering
a number of features not available in standard UK plans, but probably
because of its high cost the plan did not attract a large market share.

A standard view of the PMI market is that in the current economic and
political climate, it is bound to grow.

But in practice, the market has disappointed expectations in recent
years.

About seven million persons in the United Kingdom currently have health
insurance.  The industry hopes to see 18 million insured by the end of
the century.

But rising claim rates and rising medical costs have hit insurers hard,
and premiums have had to be increased by more than 10 per cent a year
for several years.

In 1992, so far from growing, the market is estimated to have
contracted by between 6 and 10 per cent.

In spite of this, more companies are entering the market.  The Dutch
PMI company OHRA entered the United Kingdom market in March.

A new joint venture between Cornhill Insurance and Deutsche
Krankenversicherung AG is in the process of development, and its launch
is expected in the next few months
with a full range of products specialising in the hospital sector.

No more major UK insurers are expected to launch PMI products, though
it is thought that both Royal Life and the Prudential have been looking
at the market.

UNITED KINGDOM:  SCOTTISH EQUITABLE GOES DUTCH

Policyholders of Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based life assurance
company, will vote at the end of this month on a deal whereby the Dutch
insurer Aegon will buy a 40 per cent share of Scottish Equitable's unit-
linked business.

With-profits policyholders with Scottish Equitable will continue to own
100 per cent of their fund.

Scottish Equitable's rise has been meteoric in the independent
financial adviser pensions market.

In 1981, premium income was #105 mn.  By 1992 it had grown to #1,004
mn.

Recent comment suggests that Scottish Equitable has been a victim of
its own success: further expansion will be difficult without an
injection of capital, which is made more difficult by the company's
mutual structure.

Aegon - one of the top ten insurance groups in Europe, with 1992
revenues equivalent to more than Ecu7.5 bn (nearly two-thirds of it
related to life assurance) - will pay #200 mn into the Scottish
company's with-profits fund, and a further #40 mn to capitalise the new
holding company, which will be 60 per cent owned by the with-profits
fund and 40 per cent by Aegon.

This arrangement has been arrived at because it is estimated that full
demutualisation would have cost Aegon as much as #700 mn.

Scottish Equitable and Aegon are waiting for confirmation from the EC
Commission that the proposed deal is not anti-competitive, as well as
for the approval of policyholders.

UNITED KINGDOM:  SECOND-HAND DEALERS FLOURISH

Policy Portfolio, the North London-based market maker in second-hand
with-profits endowment policies, announced last week its intention to
seek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange.

The move will make it the only second-hand policy market maker to be
listed in its own right.

Recession in the United Kingdom has seen a surge in the fortunes of
dealers in second-hand policies.

According to the managing director of Policy Portfolio, Mr Isaac Rubin,
more than 50 per cent of with-profits policies taken out in the United
Kingdom are surrendered before they reach maturity.

Owing to clawback of commission and other effects of policy charges,
surrender values can be poor, even after the policy has been in force
for several years.

Policyholders can get a better return by selling the policy on to
another investor, who then collects the final policy value on maturity
or the death of the original owner.

Policies `overvalued'

Several market makers are now in business in Great Britain.  One
investment trust has been set up by Kleinwort to hold second-hand
policies, and two further investment trusts are planned, one from
Barclays de Zoete Wedd market maker Beale Dobie, and the other from
market maker Gerald Edelman.

Insurance companies offering the original policies fear that they may
be overvalued and that the market is not big enough to support all the
players at present in it.

The Kleinwort fund, launched in July 1992, raised #30 mn, of which less
than half has so far been invested, because of a shortage of suitable
policies.

The Financial Intermediaries', Managers' and Brokers' Association
(FIMBRA), one of the United Kingdom's self-regulating organisations,
recently introduced a ruling to make market makers modify their claims
for the projected values of the policies being sold.

The leading with-profits company Standard Life has also caused
controversy recently by writing to holders of second-hand policies to
say that only the normal policy benefits will accrue to such policies.

The company has been quoted as saying that prices `have been bid up
beyond reasonable levels'.

FRANCE:  BIG GROUPS TO BE PRIVATISED

Whereas some 50 conservative deputies either abstained or voted against
the law to give the Bank of France greater independence, the unveiling
of the list of state enterprises that are candidates for privatisation
caused far less contention among the government's supporters.

Most commercial and industrial companies are considered privatisable,
and it appears that the government has no intention of holding on to
either the three state-controlled insurance giants (AGF, GAN and UAP
which between them account for about 28 per cent of new life assurance
business in France) or banks like Banque Nationale de Paris - BNP and
Credit Lyonnais, which do not look particularly attractive buys at the
moment owing to their exposure to small companies, entertainment and
property.

FRANCE:  PUBLICITY DRIVE FOR POSTE AVENIR

La Poste, the French post office, is giving a huge publicity spin
(television ads in prime time and inserts in every TV listings
magazine) to its already established Poste Avenir savings and life
assurance contract.

Managed by the state-controlled Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance (CNP),
France's leading life assurer, Poste Avenir is guaranteeing 8 per cent
net of management fees for sums (minimum FF3,000) invested before June
30.

As this is a life-related product, it also gives rise to useful tax
breaks - reductions of FF1,000 per adult and FF250 per dependent child
in the family.

INSURERS LOSE OUT TO BANKS

The longer institutions are involved in bancassurance, the wider the
scope of products and services they aim for, with banks getting the
most benefit from integration.

This is one of the key findings of a paneuropean survey, Making
bancassurance work, published  by Coopers&Lybrand and based on
interviews with senior management of 54 leading players in
bancassurance in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the
United Kingdom.

As an example of what they mean by `integration` the authors of the
survey cite a move from a marketing agreement between a bank and an
insurance company to an exclusive arrangement involving joint training,
product and sales development.

Similarly, a merging of a bank's insurance subsidiary's marketing or
investment management department into one group-led department also
represents more integration.

According to Mr Angus Hislop, a consultant with C&L's financial
services group, banks have gained much more from bancassurance than
insurers. With life products in particular, they have succeeded in
reaching many more of their own customers.

UK institutions the exception

While over two-thirds of all the institutions interviewed for the C&L
survey stated that a major integration had either already been applied
or was planned for at least one of five business functions (sales
force/distribution channels; marketing; service departments;
administration; and senior management), seven out of the 11 UK
institutions were not planning any integration at all.

In other words, the UK institutions show the inverse of the trend among
the continental institutions surveyed.

This, suggest C&L, may be due to a traditionally more short-term
orientation; greater opportunities for early reduction of the unusually
high distribution costs without integration; and a more sceptical
attitude towards the achievement of economies of scale in distribution
and operational functions.

In contrast to the continental institutions, half of the UK
institutions do not plan to realise scale effects in sales and
distribution.

But 30 out of the 43 continental institutions plan to integrate their
distribution channels and sales forces, and 32 of them plan to
integrate marketing functions.

The reasons for developing bancassurance cited most often by the
survey's respondents were factors such as recognising changes in
clients' needs, such as, for example, the demand for more personal
wealth management; building closer ties with clients; and serving them
at all stages of their lives.

This last factor was singled out by all the institutions planning or
applying major integration of business functions as a driving impulse
behind bancassurance.

Defensive and offensive strategy

Defending their customer base is another major driving factor,
especially for institutions integrating their market approaches and
structure.

The survey cites the example of a large French institution whose
primary goal is to sell life assurance.  If the client does not want to
buy at a particular moment, savings products are used to maintain the
relationship with the customer.

A few years later this client will be approached again for life
assurance, and bancassurance is therefore implemented to protect the
core insurance business.  (We might add, however, that the distinction
between life and savings products is not so clear in France as in other
EC countries).

A similar approach has been used by French banks that have successfully
offered money funds to their clients to discourage them from
transferring to other institutions.

In Italy, more than one institution indicated that life assurance, with
a link to a current account, is an effective way to tie the client in
for the medium term.

Seen in this light, bancassurance is as much a defensive strategy to
ward off threats to an institution's client base as an offensive one to
exploit opportunities made possible by integration of business
functions.

GERMANY:  BUSINESS BOOMS AT  MORTGAGE BANKS

German mortgage banks (Hypothekenbanken) recorded a surge in new
commitments to lend in the first four months of this year.

Compared with the January-April period in 1992, new commitments to the
private sector (including loans for house and flat purchase or
conversion; loans for the construction of new dwellings; and loans to
the private commercial sector) rose 46.6 per cent to DM25.4 bn.

Commitments to lend to local authorities rose 51.7 per cent in the
first four months of this year, compared with the corresponding period
of 1992.

The volume of mortgage bonds issued by the Hypothekenbanken rose by
more than 72 per cent to DM68.8 bn.

In spite of the current recession in the German construction industry,
and tightening of the laws governing property rental, a spokesman for
the mortgage banks claimed that their longer-term prospects were
bright, in view of the great housing shortage in west Germany, the need
to raise housing standards in the new federal states, and the extensive
requirements for financing of local authorities.

Since the legal restraints on the conduct by the mortgage banks of
business outside Germany were relaxed in 1991, the banks have granted
more loans in other EC member states.  These loans now amount to close
to DM3 bn, equivalent to 1 per cent of the banks' domestic mortgage
loans.

Most of the credit granted abroad has been to German clients, and the
United Kingdom, France and Netherlands are the main countries
concerned.

The mortgage banks have loans to foreign local authorities to a total
of DM7.5 bn on their balance sheets, equivalent to 2.4 per cent of
total local authority loans.

GERMANY:  LIFE INDUSTRY PYRAMID SALESMEN UNDER ATTACK

New life assurance contracts to the tune of DM 400 billion were written
in Germany in 1992, and pyramid sales companies probably accounted for
more than one-fifth of that colossal total.

The Strukturvertriebe, to give them a name which they do not always
acknowledge, have been the German life industry's success story of the
last decade.

They first appeared on the scene in the aftermath of the IOS debacle,
and after a comparatively slow start could still claim only about 8 per
cent of total new life business by 1985.

But their share of the market more than doubled in the next five years,
and although its rate of growth has slowed down, it is still expanding,
and by the end of the decade on present form could well be nudging 25
per cent of the total.

A hierarchy of eight levels

Not only have the Struckis - as the pyramid salesmen are colloquially
known in Germany -  been capturing a rapidly increasing share of the
market, but the total market is itself growing apace.

To take one indicator, since 1980 life assurance gross premium income
has increased at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 9 per cent,
and in 1992 amounted to a massive DM69.4 billion.

More recently, however, the rate of growth has been accelerating, and
in the last three years it has averaged more than 12 per cent.

In part this acceleration is due to the accession in October 1990 of
the former East German Lander, where a population of 16 million could
not boast a single life assurance policy between them before
reunification.

Significantly enough, the Struckis have been particularly active in
these Lander, where it is claimed they may have as much as 30 per cent
of the market.

A Strukturvertrieb consists of a number  of teams reporting upwards
through a hierarchy of as many as seven or eight levels.

Senior managers (typically known as regional directors) owe their
position entirely to the constant generation of sales income by those
below them in the structure.

Recruits are usually drawn from outside the financial services sector
but, prompted by their companies, they tend to call themselves
Finanzberater or Vermogensberater (literally, wealth or assets
advisers).

And if these self-styled advisers often prefer not to be known as
insurance salesmen, the companies, too, would rather be known to the
public as Allfinanzvertriebe, and like to get the word Beratung
(`consultation') into their registered name.

Officially, indeed, such a company is likely to be registered as an
independent sales force (eigenstandige Aussendienst), while being
wholly or partly owned by an insurance company.

But a Strukturvertrieb's independence may be genuine to the extent that
it does not sell exclusively own-house products, but a fairly wide
range of insurance and investment products from a number of suppliers.

In the former East Germany, one product that has been particularly
popular is a short-term savings contract taking advantage of a State
incentive and designed to release capital for house purchase or
renovation.

Companies selling their products through Struckis have to pay higher
commissions than they offer to brokers or to their own tied agents
(considerably higher in the latter case).

An excessively high lapse rate for policies sold by Struckis - reported
to be as high for some as 18 per cent, or four times the rate
experienced on average by other sales methods - adds significantly to
the acquisition costs of pyramid sales.

Salesmen thoroughly trained

A necessary feature of the system is that commissions received by the
Struckis are never passed on intact to the salesmen..

As much as one-third may be deducted immediately for company overheads,
and the balance then percolates through the structure in ever
decreasing percentages, so that a junior salesman usually receives
between 1 and 1.5 per cent.

An established insurance company agent, by comparison, receives a
commission of 3.5 per cent.

The Strukturvertriebe give new salesmen a thorough training not only in
selling financial products, but in recruiting new potential salesmen.

One of the leading Strukturvertriebe, Bonn Finanz Vermogensberatung AG
(100 per cent owned by the insurance company Deutscher Herold, recently
bought by Deutsche Bank), mounts a 12-week training course.

This consists of three five-day residential seminars backed by work
experience, for which the aspiring salesman has to pay DM2,500.

In general, however, the demands of a system that requires the new
recruit to force through as many sales as he can in the shortest
possible time and to persuade other people to work for him lead to an
exceptionally high dropout rate.

In fact, it is claimed by critics of the pyramid sales  system that
only about one recruit in five survives the first year of selling.

But that is probably the mildest criticism levelled against the
Strukturvertriebe.

The main objections are raised against the Struckis' high pressure
selling methods.

Legally obliged to give good advice

Brokers belonging to medium and small firms, particularly (the large
firms not usually being concerned with mass personal lines insurance)
feel themselves at a disadvantage, because unlike the Struckis they are
legally obliged to give their clients good advice (not yet `best
advice'!) about the growth prospects of investments and protection
against risks.

The Struckis benefit from the fact that in Germany the emphasis in the
supervision of insurance is on products, the design and pricing of
which have to conform to strict guidelines.

Distribution of products, on the other hand, is comparatively
unregulated.  There is, for instance, no provision under law for the
licensing or testing of insurance intermediaries, whether they work as
company tied agents or in the independent sector.

One man who has mounted a vigorous campaign to have tougher rules
applied to independent financial intermediaries is Hans-Wolff Graf, the
chairman and chief executive of the Munich-based financial services
company efv-AG (Erste Finanz- und Vermogensberater Aktiengesellschaft
in Deutschland).

Mr Graf began his own career with IOS and then continued with two of
the largest Allfinanzvertriebe before setting up his own company, and
he brings the missionary zeal of a religious convert to his  campaign.

`To sell a pork cutlet in Germany,' he says, `you have to study for
three years and then work constantly under the vigilant eye of the law.

`Nothing like this is required from anyone selling financial contracts,
including life assurance policies.'

Mr Graf has submitted a draft law governing independent financial
intermediaries to the authorities and has set up a registered
association to pursue his cause.

Embarrassed by sales techniques

One of his more startling claims is that unqualified salesmen, or
`pseudo-consultants' as he calls them will have received more than DM
10 billion in commission last year from new contracts that will sooner
or later be cancelled prematurely.

So far Mr Graf has received little encouragement from Bonn, but the
Berlin-based supervisory authority, the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das
Versicherungswesen, is said to be embarrassed by the Struckis'
aggressive sales techniques and the flamboyant public image of some of
the leading figures in the sector.

But while these misgivings may be shared by the life assurance industry
in general, many insurance companies have lost members of their tied
agent force to the independent sector, and in the process have become
heavily dependent on Struckis for their new business

Some companies have bought majority or even total share holdings in a
Strukturvertrieb, and although stricter requirements may one day be
imposed on the training and professional standards of the pyramid
salesmen, a system bringing as much as DM 15 billion a year in premium
income is bound to have some keen champions even among the older German
life assurance companies.

PYRAMID POWER ON THE WANE?

While the authorities may be slow to tighten their supervision of the
pyramid salesmen, the Strukturvertriebe may become the victims of their
own excesses.

According to a recent article in manager magazin (published in Hamburg)
, Germany's second largest Allfinanz- or Strukturvertrieb is faced with
a number of problems.

Objektive Vermogensberatung GmbH (OVB) was founded in 1970 by Otto
Wittschier, one of the most senior former IOS salesmen still active in
Germany.  The company's principal shareholder is Deutscher Ring, but
OVB sells a variety of insurance and savings products on behalf of as
many as 18 companies, including Equity & Law, American Express, and
Deutsche Bank's DWS investment fund company.

Data for such items as sales forces are always given in suspiciously
round figures for Strukturvertriebe, but a figure of 15,000 salesmen
(nearly one-third of them recruited in the former DDR) is frequently
quoted for OVB.  But many of these salesmen are reported to be
currently doing little or no business.

Selling mainly life assurance, investment funds, and house purchase
contracts, OVB's salespersons raised the company's turnover from DM4.4
bn in 1989 to DM12.7 bn in 1990, and then to DM15.4 bn in 1991.  But in
1992, turnover plummeted by an ominous 19 per cent to DM12.5 bn.

One reason for the fall in new business appears to be a drying up of
the east German market, where OVB had scored some of its most striking
successes.  But there are also difficulties between Mr Wittschier and
his two co-founders and the parent company.

Under a contentious agreement between the two, Deutscher Ring has to
buy the founders out if they so demand, but Deutscher Ring is reported
to be unwilling to do this.

Further problems are being created by the departure of key personnel at
the top of the company's hierarchy.  One former OVB salesman, Mr
Carsten Maschmeyer, left while still in his 20s in to found his own
company, Allgemeiner Wirtschaftsdienst, in 1988, and the possibility of
new rivals (one's own former star salesmen, as likely as not) appearing
in such an unregulated field must always threaten the established
companies.

One casualty of OVB's present plight is its ambitious plan to extend
operations to other European countries.  After, according to manager
magazin, spending half a million marks on studies and analysis, it has
put its intended Italian operation on the back burner.  In Austria,
where OVB established itself in 1991, the level of business has been
decidedly modest, and in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, only
the legal formalities have been completed.  OVB was also reported to
have had plans to start up in the United Kingdom, but if there ever
really were such plans, they seem to have been dropped.

A NEW GENERATION OF INVESTORS

Apart from demographic changes, the single factor to have most impact
on future savings trends in Germany will be the growth of personal
incomes. This will affect both the volume of savings and the way they
are allocated between the various available vehicles.

Over the next two decades, for the first time since 1945, a whole
generation of German citizens will come into substantial inherited
wealth. According to estimates made by banks, this generation of
Germans will have aggregate assets of DM 2,500 bn, and their attitudes
towards investments will be vastly different from that of previous
generations who experienced hyper-inflation coupled with economic and
political turmoil. Banks believe they will be more receptive towards
new savings products..

Some market researchers claim that there is a new generation of jungen
Aufstiegsorientierten, akin to yuppies, who demand a wider range of
financial products more finely tuned to the individual's requirements.

COMING OF AGE IN PRAGUE

THE focus of attention this year  in the Czech Republic will inevitably
be on the parliamentary elections in the summer. Political
considerations have already hit an ambitious plan to sell minority
stakes in the country's 16 gas and electricity distribution companies
(eight of each), which has been postponed indefinitely. In the week
before Christmas Roman Ceska, head of the National Property Fund, the
state holding company, said there would be no further strategic
privatizations before the election.

The action, however, is likely to be elsewhere. The last quarter of
1995 saw what many feel could be the start of a new trend - a series of
takeovers, some of them hostile, and large investments by foreign
investors. Among the most notable are Bankers Trust's $250 million
purchase of stakes in two investment funds from Ceska Sporitelna (see
page 4), and the acquisition of stakes in seven leading industrial
companies by Stratton Investments in partnership with Viktor Kozeny's
Harvard fund management group.

Michael Dingman, the Bahamas-based US millionaire who owns Stratton,
has made much of the ground-breaking aspect of his investment company,
with some justification. Stratton's alliance with Harvard allows a
powerful and rich entrepreneur to team up with an equally powerful
entrepreneur with a good reputation for innovation but with little
financial firepower.

Stratton's strategy appears so far to be paying off. Daniel Arbess, a
senior Dingman associate, acknowledges that its original investment is
greater than the $140 million initially mentioned, and is "closer to
$200 million". But he says the stakes, before recent increases in two
of them, are now worth $240 million. Stratton and Harvard have also
gained control of Sepap, the paper group, and the glass holding company
Sklo Union, through boardroom reshuffles.

Bankers Trust's acquisition is the biggest deal yet on the Prague
capital markets. Although the opportunity was relatively rare - Ceska
Sporitelna was under pressure from the Czech National Bank and its
auditors to reduce the stakes it owns in the funds it runs - fund
managers are increasingly taking the view that this type of development
is both inevitable and desirable.

As an investor, Dingman says he sees less risk in the Czech market than
in a Dow Jones index above 5,000. Whether other investors feel that way
will depend on several issues that should be clarified in 1996.

The first is whether an amendment to the securities law is approved.
Tomas Jezek, author of the amendment and a proposed chairman of the PSE
from next summer, is proposing substantial reform of the market that
should offer greater protection to small investors, establish clear
rules for takeovers, and make the stock market more transparent.

But Jezek's proposal is ground down in parliament, which is not likely
to debate it until February, at the earliest. It is facing opposition
from fund managers anxious to preserve the secrecy that currently
surrounds share-dealing. Stratton and Harvard were able to exploit this
secrecy and lack of disclosure to the hilt in developing their alliance
and short term strategy for the companies they targeted. Jezek says he
is confident of having his amendment approved but does not yet know
when that is likely to happen.

The second crucial influence will be the attitude of the bank-run and
independent investment funds to the new wave of foreign money coming
into the market. Ales Barabas, director of capital markets at
Zivnostenska Banka, says fund managers have no objection in principle
to ceding control of their funds to new managers. But he doubts whether
the market is mature enough to ensure that the process is orderly.

He cites the example of Motoinvest, a financial conglomerate that
emerged in November when it made hostile takeovers for some bank-run
funds. Motoinvest's campaign was characterized by secrecy and elements
of greenmail, and its intentions are still not entirely clear.
Executives at the financial group strongly deny greenmail charges and
point out that the promise of more active management they offer has
simply caused larger fund managers to freeze them out.

Barabas says recent developments suggest that, far from being ready for
the next phase of development as a more mature market, recent
developments show the PSE still in "a privatization phase", where banks
are still keen to exert control of assets. There is the potential for
the so-called "third wave" of privatization, he believes, but not the
will among the main shareholders in the market.

Further pressure on the shareholding structure inherited from mass
privatization is likely to be exerted by a third factor that will come
into play in 1996 - Czech membership of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Analysts suggest that one of the first
results of membership will be a re-rating of the country as an
investment location, which could spark a fresh wave of capital for
longer term investment. Both Stratton and Bankers Trust are being
touted as examples of this development.

This in turn leads to a fourth consideration - of what action the Czech
National Bank takes on the koruna's exchange rate against the dollar
and deutschemark. Economists say they expect a move early in the New
Year to widen the band against which the koruna fluctuates - currently
half a percentage point either side of parity - to perhaps five points
either side. This could lead to an early but temporary revaluation, to
be followed by a more gradual move towards devaluation, perhaps
encouraged by the monetary authorities ahead of the election to boost
exports.

The Czech market is clearly at a turning point, with pressure building
on several fronts for more consolidation, a freer currency, and greater
transparency in its operations. Policy makers will have to play a
delicate balancing act between the demands of the market on the one
hand and political considerations on the other in what will be a true
test of the country's maturity as a grown-up member of the club of rich
nations.

ANALYSTS BULLISH ON 1996 PROSPECTS

Central Europe watchers think the Czech economy is poised to surge
ahead this year, building on the dynamic growth of 1995.

Industry has boomed, pushing third quarter 1995 GDP 6.3 per cent higher
year-on-year, mostly on the back of strong home demand. Analysts are
confident of further gains in 1996. "We should see growth of 4.7 per
cent in the light of the [1995] third quarter results, and [in 1996] it
will probably be between 5.0 and 6.0 per cent," says Pavel Sobisek of
Zivnostenska Banka. Real GDP for the first nine months of 1995 stood at
4.8 per cent, according to the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU).

Scott Riedel, treasurer of Citibank in Prague, also expects strong 1996
growth but says the country is far from emulating levels seen in the
Asian Tiger economies. "We're looking at around the five per cent level
of 1996 and that's probably conservative. But this economy is quite
young still, and it's a long way behind Far East countries like
Malaysia in terms of sustainable high growth," says Riedel.

While the Czech Republic stands at the higher end of the East European
growth table, it has yet to attract the sort of huge foreign investment
that sparked rapid growth in Southeast Asia. To close the gap with the
rich Western economies more rapidly - something that many in Eastern
and Central Europe see as a primary goal - investment must accelerate,
analysts say. "It is necessary, but I'm just wondering whether we'll
see sustainable increases," says Riedel. The Asian tigers continue to
devour much of the foreign direct investment (FDI) earmarked for
emerging markets.

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus hopes the feel-good factor arising from the
booming economy will win his centre-right coalition government another
term in office in this summer's elections. The Czech reform process has
been considerably more stable than in other former Soviet bloc
countries, with year-on-year inflation at eight per cent in November
and unemployment standing at 2.8 per cent. But official figures
compiled by the EBRD in its transition report for 1995 showed sharp
falls in real GDP in the first years of reform.

The EBRD recorded a 14.2 per cent drop in real GDP in 1991 followed by
further, but less spectacular, declines in the next two years, before
an upturn in 1994 when growth hit 2.6 per cent. Even with EBRD-
projected growth of five per cent in 1995, the organization put 1995
real Czech GDP at just 85 per cent of the level before the fall of
communism in 1989. It warned, however, that such comparisons should be
treated with caution because of conceptual and data collection problems
when comparing market and planned economies.

STRATTON MOVES INTO MEDIA

Stratton Investments, owned by the Bahamas-based investor Michael
Dingman, has made a further push into the Czech market with an
agreement in principle to buy a 15 per cent stake in Premiera TV, a
commercial television station.

Stratton said on December 6 it would buy the stake from Investicni a
Postovni Banka (IPB), one of the main commercial banks. If the purchase
is approved by the state broadcasting council IPB's stake in Premiera
will fall to 30 per cent. The bank has been seeking a buyer for the
stake for several months.

"The deal launches Stratton's investment in the media industry in
Central Europe and CIS countries. We look forward to working together
with IPB on this and hopefully other investments in the future,"
Stratton said. Terms were not disclosed.

It is also a departure for Dingman, who stormed into the market in
October, buying stakes in seven industrial companies from Viktor
Kozeny's Harvard fund management group. Premiera is the first
acquisition from a local investor other than Harvard.

Stratton said it was ready to provide Premiera access to "all world-
wide programming resources" and with "foreign experts with a high level
of broadcasting knowledge." Premiera currently reaches less than half
the nationwide audience and is seeking to expand in the teeth of fierce
competition from Nova TV.

Nova, majority-owned by Central European Media Enterprises, which is in
turn controlled by cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, became eastern
Europe's first commercial TV station in early 1993. It has captured a
huge slice of the local advertising market with a successful mix of
imported mass-market series.

Earlier this year IPB was reportedly in talks with companies connected
to Turner Broadcasting and Capital Cities/ABC, the US media giants.
Scandinavian Broadcasting System, which is partially owned by Cap
Cities, has also been mooted as a buyer.

Separately, Stratton bought additional stakes in two of its original
seven investments from the fund management arm of Ceska Sporitelna, the
savings bank. These transactions took its stakes in Prazska
Telparenska, the heating utility for Prague, and in glass industry
holding company Sklo Union to 43 per cent and 66.5 per cent
respectively. The stakes are held jointly by Stratton and Harvard.

Stratton and Harvard have also taken control of the entire management
board of Sklo Union, appointing seven representatives of Harvard at a
shareholder meeting on December 5. The move is similar to the takeover
of the board of Sepap, the paper group now controlled by both
investment companies.

EBRD SELLS COKOLADOVNY STAKE

The EBRD has sold its 12.07 per cent stake in the confectionery company
Cokoladovny to Copart, a joint venture between Nestle of Switzerland
and Danone of France that already owns 56 per cent of the chocolate and
biscuit maker.

Terms were not disclosed but the EBRD said in a statement on December 6
that the sale and price of the shares to Copart was agreed at the time
of the privatization of Cokoladovny in 1992, when the EBRD first
acquired its stake. The stake has a market value currently of about $35
million.

Guy de Selliers, deputy vice president of banking at the EBRD, said in
the statement that the Cokoladovny stake represented the bank's most
mature investment in the country, and was also its first divestment.

Describing Cokoladovny as a successfully transformed company able to
compete and succeed in its markets, de Selliers said the sale was "a
natural departure for the EBRD." The bank expects the proceeds of the
sale to be used for other investment purposes in the Czech Republic as
its focus shifts to investing in post-privatization industry.

LIST OF BIDDERS FOR GSM GROWS

TeleDanmark and Telenor, of Denmark and Norway respectively, are to
make a joint bid for a 49 per cent stake in a GSM mobile telephone
licence, one of two being awarded by the government. The companies said
on December 20 that they would be "equal partners" in their joint
venture but that TeleDanmark would have a majority stake to abide by
rules of a tender for the stake.

Separately, the electricity generator CEZ said it would be making a
joint bid for the licence stake with RWE Telliance of Germany. A third
partner may join that consortium, but TeleDanmark and Telenor said they
would not be seeking a local partner.

The two alliances join a growing list of domestic and international
bidders seeking to win the stake in the licence. The domestic
technology group Ceske Radiokomunikace, which operates television and
radio signal transmission in the country, will own 51 per cent of the
licence.

The licence will cost about $15 million but developing a nationwide GSM
network is set to cost "several hundred million dollars," said Harald
Grytten of Telenor, the dominant Norwegian telecoms provider. Industry
analysts have put the cost of a new network at between $300 million and
$500 million. Most of the finance to develop it will be provided by the
selected partner.

A second GSM licence is being awarded to EuroTel, a joint venture
between the national operator SPT Telecom and the US groups Bell
Atlantic and US West. EuroTel was the first Czech/foreign joint venture
created after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and has been providing
mobile services since 1990 using low-frequency NMT technology
throughout former Czechoslovakia.

Other groups and consortiums bidding for the stake in the licence
include AirTouch of the US, France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom,
Mannesmann of Germany in partnership with the engineering group Skoda
Plzen, and a consortium of domestic energy distribution companies in a
probable alliance with Telecom Finland.

Bids for the stake, setting out development plans and a timetable for
creating the GSM network, are expected to be sought by the end of
January. A partner for Ceske Radiokomunikace should be chosen by next
March.

BANKERS TRUST BUYS INTO FUNDS

Bankers Trust has bought stakes of 40 per cent in two investment funds
owned and run by Ceska Sporitelna, the savings bank, in the biggest one-
off deal ever on Prague's fledgling capital markets.

The US bank is paying Kc 6.7 billion for the stakes and has said it
will seek to sell them on to other Western investors. It will pay for
the stakes by issuing five-year zero-coupon notes to the savings bank.
During the life of the notes Sporitelna will retain all dividends on
the shares and retain the voting rights on three quarters of each
stake.

Bankers Trust will repay the notes in cash or shares or a combination
of both, depending on whether it has been able to sell the shares in
the funds on to new investors. If it retains any shares in the funds
after five years these shares will be returned to Sporitelna to pay off
the notes.

Sporitelna has been under pressure from its auditors and the Czech
National Bank for some time to reduce the stakes it holds in its own
investment funds.  Under current legislation a bank cannot own more
than 10 per cent of any non-banking asset, including investment funds.

The bank acquired the shares when thousands of its clients defaulted on
loans it issued using individual shareholdings in its funds as
collateral following a slide on the Prague stock exchange during 1994.

Bankers Trust has been developing a relationship with Sporitelna for
several years and is understood to be planning an issue of global
depository shares for the savings bank as part of a long-term strategy.
But Sporitelna is regarded as the weakest of the big four Czech banks
because of its failure to diversify sufficiently away from its core
savings business.

Sporitelna is the biggest lender on the Prague interbank market and has
been hit hard by the instability of some of the country's smaller
banks. It has been exposed to two recent collapses; those of AB Banka -
which it subsequently acquired - and Ceska Banka, which is in
liquidation after collapsing in the autumn. The disposal of the stakes
in its investment funds should enable it to strengthen its balance
sheet.

POLITICAL JITTERS FOR STOCK EXCHANGE

Recent political events have taken their toll on the Warsaw Stock
Exchange. Its main WIG indicator has slipped by 7 per cent since the
last session on November 17, when investors were still confident that
Lech Walesa would win the presidential election.

The news that former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski had won by a
narrow majority took 3.8 per cent off the WIG and the market's slow
recovery in the weeks following was ended by another 3.5 per cent fall
on December 20 in the wake of a public accusation that prime minister
Jozef Oleksy was a Russian agent.

The setback, against the background of low morale on the stock exchange
dating back to before the summer, has caused companies hoping to profit
from stock exchange listings to have second thoughts. Examples include
Forte, a Polish-German furniture producer, which delayed its initial
public offer sine die, and chemicals producer  Boryszew, due to open
its IPO of 600,000 shares priced at Zl 15 at the end of November, but
which has now postponed it until January 10.

January will also see the public offer of 3 million shares in the Ocean
Company, a fledgling retail chain, and Lodzka Drukarnia Akcydensowa,
which specializes in printing for packaging, will be offering between
625,000 and 1.7 million shares priced at Zl 5. The issue by the
company, which has been owned by its management and employees since
1991, has been underwritten by Polish Development Bank (PBR) and the
Lodz-based Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy (PBG), which have agreed to take
300,000 shares for a 5 per cent fee.

Polisa, the private insurance company which came to prominence during
the presidential campaign when it transpired that the wives of both
Kwasniewski and Oleksy hold its shares (see FEE 5:23) has seen the
placement of 1.2 million of its shares in a public offer of between
800,000 and 3.2 million shares priced at Zl 8. Reportedly the
purchasers of around 60 per cent of the shares placed were Bel Leasing
and Forin, two companies controlled by Bank IG, which seems to be
planning to add an insurance arm to its group.

In another development Bank Handlowy has taken a 13.1 per cent stake in
the Wolczanka shirt producer. The stake comes from the bankrupt Bank
Przemyslowo Handlowy (BHK) in Katowice, which is currently being wound
up. The securities commission has given Heineken permission to purchase
BHK's stake in the Zywiec brewery, increasing its stake from its
present 24.9 per cent to 31.8 per cent. The Zywiec stock price has
fallen by 10 per cent recently in the wake of an announcement by Adam
Loewe, the brewery's chief executive, that he would be resigning in the
new year.

Bank Handlowy's move in taking a larger stake in Wolczanka reflects
part of a wider strategy towards the textile sector. Recently the BH
announced that it would be part of a consortium including Wolczanka,
Prochnik and Vistula which aims to bid for the DT Centrum chain of city
centre department stores which are to be privatized this year. Handlowy
has also taken a stake in the Poltex textile mill in Lodz, in exchange
for the company's debts. Meanwhile Wolczanka  is to purchase half of
Handlowy's Poltex equity and is to act as the bank's partner in the
venture.

MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUES PLANNED

Several cities were planning to issue bonds to finance infrastructural
developments as the year closed. Gdansk, which wants to raise Zl 90
million this way and has shortlisted three advisers, is the furthest
along the path.

Gdansk, which wants to help fund the construction of a wholesale goods
distribution centre for the city as well as improve its road link with
its local airport at Rembiechowo has shortlisted ING, the Bank PKO BP
and a group composed of Merrill Lynch, Bank Handlowy and Bank Gdanski
as potential advisers for the project.

Meanwhile Gdynia is considering giving a mandate to ING to raise Zl 28
million through bonds to finance the purchase of 50 Mercedes buses for
the city's transportation system. Lodz, which has yet to take final
decisions on the issue, is also talking of raising Zl 50 million for
new bus purchases.

Other cities considering bond issues are Krakow, which has pencilled in
the sum of Zl 5 million as an initial placement and Warsaw which has
said it would like to finance the construction of a new bridge across
the Vistula river through bonds. Meanwhile Wroclaw has appointed Bank
Handlowy as its financial adviser without specifying whether bonds or
loans will be used to finance its municipal needs. Ostrow Wielkopolski
is another potential bond player with a planned Zl 7.5 million issue.

Most cities are planning a private issue to avoid the costs and delay
accompanying a public placement.

ING, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan appear to be the foreign investment
banks which have targeted this sector of Poland's financial services
market as a speciality while locally Bank Handlowy and Bank IG are
hoping to serve municipal needs.

MPP GAINING MOMENTUM

The Mass Privatization Programme (MPP) is moving ahead as equity in a
further 99 state sector companies has been allocated to the 15 national
investment funds and coupons entitling people to shares in the funds
are trading at over double their initial price.

Some 2.5 million of the 28 million  people eligible have so far picked
up their coupons, which have been available since November 22. The
coupons, priced at Zl 20, are currently trading at between Zl 50 and Zl
60 and have even been reported as being accepted as common currency
(notoriously in one example by a "social agency", a local euphemism for
a brothel).

The allocations of the equity in the new companies brings the number
now involved up to 513 and the new tranche include valuable assets such
as the Nowiny cement works, the Gryf confectionery producer as well as
the successful Morliny meat processing works in Ostroda near Olsztyn.

Meanwhile the Solidarity-led opposition is keeping up a drum beat of
criticism of the scheme ahead of a referendum planned for February 19.
Poles are to be asked whether they are in favour of "enfranchisement",
Solidarity's word for Czech-style coupon privatization which the trade
union movement argues spread ownership more democratically than the
modes favoured by successive governments in Poland. Critics say Polish
privatization has so far supported efforts by the former Communist
nomenklatura in gaining control over the economy. This argument has now
gained some credibility after President Walesa's electoral defeat.

Deputies from the governing Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) have however
voted through parliament a number of additional questions to be asked
in the referendum. These include a query on the extension of the MPP by
adding more companies (the SLD's coalition partner the Polish Peasant
Party (PSL) was opposed on the grounds that the scheme should be given
time to prove itself before it is expanded). Other new questions dwell
on whether state assets now worth an estimated Zl 75 billion should be
used to capitalize pension funds envisaged under welfare spending
reforms as well as to compensate government employees and pensioners
who suffered unlawful wage cuts at the hands of the administration in
1991 and 1992. Finally the opposition Freedom Union (UW) managed to
force through an amendment which specified that privatization could
include "coupons", which helped to define the enfranchisement question
originally put forward by Solidarity and backed by Lech Walesa.

BUDGET LOOKS FOR $720M OF STATE ASSET DISPOSALS

Disposals of state-owned corporate assets in 1996 are expected to raise
Zl 1.8 billion ($720 million) according to the draft budget for the
year. This is slightly more than the Zl 1.7 billion raised last year
from sales of treasury-owned companies or 13 per cent more than the
figure written into the 1995 budget target.

At the same time the government intends to continue to squeeze
privatization advisory costs which ran to 5 per cent of revenues last
year down to 4 per cent of this year's inflows. This suggests that the
privatization ministry will continue to favour local companies in
tenders for advisory work.

However it can be expected that the sale of a minority stake in the
giant copper producer KGHM Polska Miedz SA will see the appointment of
a foreign adviser. A tender has been announced and bids have to be in
by January 23 for what could be the largest sale of the year through
both GDRs and the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

Other major sales will be DT Centrum, the state-owned chain of
department stores which controls a series of city centre sites in the
country's largest towns and Ruch, once the all powerful newspaper
distribution network. PHS, which is what remains of the state's
wholesale network is to be another "infrastructural" sale in 1996.

In all privatization minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek hopes to dispose of
around 90 companies to local and foreign investors. These will include
breweries in Tychy and Zabrze in southern Poland and Lezajsk in the
south east. A start is also to be made on the heavy chemical sector,
with three bidders shortlisted for two chemical producers,  Janikosody
and Soda Matwy. These are RhOne Poulenc, Brunner Mond and state-owned
chemicals and pharmaceuticals trader Ciech. Other sectors which will
see disposals according to Kaczmarek are cement, furniture and meat
processing.

The minister has also outlined a number of possible public offers which
could include the Celuloza paper works in Swiecie, three fertilizer
producers in Pulawy, Tarnow and Kedzierzyn Kozle. Also included are
Zelmer, a white goods producer in Rzeszow and Polar, which specializes
in washing machines and cookers in Wroclaw.

The list could be supplemented by any one of the three tobacco
producers in Krakow, Poznan or Lodz which the ministry still has on
offer after receiving unsatisfactory bids from investors who include
Philip Morris and Reemstma.

Impexmetal, the still state-owned metals trader which has purchased the
Konin aluminium mill and has plans to swap its debts for equity in the
Zawiercie steel mill, is also expected to be listed this year.

BANK GDANSKI IPO A SUCCESS

Bank Gdanski's privatization, which saw the first use in Poland of
GDRs, drew to a successful conclusion just before Christmas with 60.06
per cent of the equity in private hands and a slight upward trend on
the Warsaw Stock Exchange following the bank's listing at its initial
public offer price of Zl 24.

However the sale was only saved thanks to Bank IG, which took two-
thirds of the domestic tranche and ended up with a 24.07 per cent share
of Gdanski's equity. It was the first time that one of the new small
banks has forged a strategic link with one of the, larger, regional
banks hived off from the National Bank of Poland (NBP) in 1989.
Hitherto private sector banks have concentrated on buying up smaller
institutions to extend their branch network.

Bank IG's move, initiated by its founder and chairman Boguslaw Kott, a
46 year-old former finance ministry official, meant that 527,518 shares
were moved from the foreign to the domestic tranche leaving 7 million
shares or 35.7 per cent of Bank Gdanski's equity in local hands
alongside the treasury's 37 per cent stake.

The reduction in the foreign tranche which HSBC Investment Services,
the government's adviser for the sale, had originally set at between
5.9 million to 6.5 million shares (30 per cent to 33 per cent of the
equity) still saw foreign demand for the BG shares falling short of
supply. In the end HSBC and Daiwa Europe, who acted as joint lead
managers, and were backed by Schroders and Creditanstalt acting
together with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, SBC Warburg and MC Securities,
guaranteed a mere 4.8 million shares, which ended up with Bank of New
York as the security for the GDRs.

The underwriters took a 4 per cent fee for the service and have
reportedly placed the stock with institutions in Europe and North
America. The GDRs are currently traded at the issue price of $9.48 in
London through the SEAQ international trading system.

GSM AUCTION REMAINS TROUBLED

On January 3 the telecommunications ministry confirmed that three
consortia, all including both domestic and foreign firms, had placed
bids  for the controversial tender for two digital GSM mobile telephone
operating licences.

Telecoms and power equipment trader Elektrim heads one consortium, with
US West as the chief foreign partner, while state-owned chemicals
trader Ciech has teamed up with Stet of Italy in the second group. The
most domestic-ally oriented consortium seems to be the third, led by
the Petrochemia Plock oil refinery and includes KGHM, the domestic
copper conglomerate, PSE, the Polish Power Grid Company, and Tele
Danmark. Foreign partners are limited by the terms of the tender to no
more than 49 per cent of the equity in each group.

But problems and recriminations remain. France Telecom Mobile looks
likely to take the government to court, joining Ameritech, which has
already gone to arbitration to wrest one of the licences from the
authorities. Both companies are basing their claim on a letter written
by the government in 1991, when they won a tender to develop an NMT
mobile telephone system, promising them the GSM licence when the
requisite frequencies became available.

Under the conditions of the tender winning consortia will have to pay
an initial ECU 100 million licence fee augmented by annual payments for
a set period thereafter. The total investment costs of each project are
estimated at $1.2 billion. One factor which is worrying prospective
bidders is that the tender documents do not specify the size of the
interconnect fee the mobile operator will have to pay TP SA, the state-
owned land system operator, for connections with land-based
subscribers. This, according to the tender, will be negotiated with TP
SA once the winners of the bid have been chosen.

LUCCHINI IN MODERNIZATION PROJECT FOR HUTA WARSZAWA

Lucchini, the Italian private steel maker, which took over the Huta
Warszawa steelworks in Warsaw three years ago, has embarked on a three-
stage ECU 161.1 million modernization project for the works.

Lucchini's modernization project, which is financed by the IFC, the
EBRD and a consortium of Italian banks, has been delayed by problems
with establishing the tenure of the land on which the Huta Warszawa is
located. However the group expects to report an around Zl 20 million
net profit for the plant for 1995 following a Zl 1.5 million net profit
in 1994 and a Zl 2.7 million loss the year before. The ECU 65.2 million
first stage will see the steel mill refurbished using equipment from
Danieli of Italy.

In all the modernization programme which will be completed in the
autumn of 1998 will increase the plant's capacity to 1 million tonnes
of steel a year. Last year Huta Lucchini Warszawa produced 380,000
tonnes of steel products and this will rise to 400,000 tonnes this
year.

Meanwhile Stalexport, the listed steel trader, which was forced last
October to withdraw a new share issue which would have raised between
Zl 30 million and Zl 150 million, has completed the construction of a
Zl 155 million modern mini mill at its Labedy works in Silesia. This
will give the mill $30 per tonne savings in energy costs on an annual
output of 350,000 tonnes of semi finished castings. Labedy, which
Stalexport plans to take over when the steel sector is privatized,
specializes in supplies for the Polish coal mining industry.

The equipment for the mini mill was supplied by Mannesman-Demag as well
as Concast Standard from Switzerland and was 28 per cent paid for with
supplier credits as well as a loan amounting to 40 per cent of the cost
from Poland's Environmental Protection Fund (NFOS). The remaining 32
per cent came from Stalexport and the Labedy works.

Stalexport's prospects for a return to its planned new share issue
remain dim. Major existing shareholders like Bank Handlowy and the
Pioneer investment fund who paid Zl 34 per share at the initial public
offer are insisting that any new issues should be priced at around this
level. Meanwhile the company's current share price is languishing
around the Zl 24 per share mark and shows little sign of rising in the
near term. The share issue was to have included a placement abroad
through GDRs with HSBC Investment Services acting as an adviser to
Stalexport.

FRENCH PURCHASER FOR TOBACCO WORKS

The state-owned Radom tobacco works, which control around 13 per cent
of the domestic market, has been sold to Seita, the recently privatized
French cigarette producer. The sale follows the purchase of the
Augustow works by BAT Industries and leaves the government with a
further three companies in Krakow, Lodz and Poznan still on offer.

Seita has agreed to pay $64 million for a 33 per cent stake in Radom
with the option to purchase a further 32 per cent of the equity for a
nominal fee after completing a $40 million investment programme over
three years. Earlier BAT agreed to pay $88 million for a similar stake
in Augustow, which controls 12 per cent of the market and promised to
invest $70 million in the plant.

Market shares however are changing following a pre-privatization
government decision to have the country's cheaper brands, which were
once made throughout the industry, located in Radom and Krakow. Plants
in Krakow, Poznan and Lodz are the other three producers currently on
offer.

This decision means that Radom's market share will rise to around 24
per cent, according to a text in the Rzeczpospolita newspaper written
by the head of Burston Marsteller, a PR company retained by Philip
Morris which is bidding for Krakow. Krakow will also see its pre
allocation share of 35 per cent rise slightly although its expected net
profit of $26 million for 1995 is expected to fall to $24 million as a
result of the decision. The greatest loser, however, is Poznan whose
28.5 per cent market share will be hit and whose pre-allocation net
profit of $9.2 million will fall to around $6.4 million. Reemstma of
Germany is thought to be interested in taking Poznan over.

So far the government has judged offers for the three remaining plants
from bidders such as Philip Morris and Reemstma to be inadequate.
However the Burston Marsteller text would suggest that Philip Morris
values the Krakow works at between $286 million and $327 million and
thus would be willing to pay around $200 million for a 65 per cent
stake. The same text, written before the Radom deal was struck with
Seita, valued the Radom works at between $83 million and $78 million
while the price Seita paid valued the works at $98 million. This
suggests that the government will try to hold out to get PM to improve
its offer by around 10 to 15 per cent.

IMF DEAL IN SIGHT, BUDGET PASSED

Hungary reached the basis of an IMF agreement on a much-delayed 18-
month stand-by loan at the end of a mission in mid-December.

However - much to the anger of the trade unions and social security
officials - the agreement is conditional on parliament's passing
satisfactory budgets for the two state social security funds which
handle health and pensions payments. Parliament is not expected to pass
the budgets of the semi-independent funds before late February.

The unions and fund administrators say they are being blackmailed into
agreeing with finance ministry suggestions for the 1996 fund budgets as
otherwise they will be blamed for scuppering the IMF deal. Economists
say the IMF's condition should at least encourage an early solution to
what has been a highly contentious issue. The funds and the finance
ministry have been locked in discussions over spending plans for 1996
for some time.

Leslie Lipsitz, head of the mission, said the government and IMF had
agreed on the key economic targets until end-1997 and that he was very
hopeful an agreement could be reached and approved early next year. He
said another mission would not be necessary and that the loan could go
to board approval within a couple of weeks of parliament passing the
social security budgets.

Ever since a Socialist-led coalition took office in July 1994, Hungary
has been keen to secure an IMF stand-by to boost its standing on
international markets and with foreign investors. Central banks
officials have said that Hungary, which recently repaid some of its
earlier IMF loans ahead of schedule, may not even draw on the present
planned stand-by likely to be worth $300 million.

Lipsitz said Hungary aimed to bring down inflation to 20 per cent by
the end of 1996 and to 15 per cent by late 1997. GDP is forecasted to
rise by 2-3 per cent this year and by more than 3 per cent from 1997
onwards, up from an estimated 2 per cent in 1995. The budget deficit
for this year is put at 4 per cent and is due to fall to 3 per cent
next year. The target current account for this year is $2 billion and
is due to fall to $1.5 billion in 1997, down from more than $2.5
billion in 1995 and $3.9 billion in 1994.

MATAV RAISES A FURTHER $852M

After months of often difficult negotiations, Ameritech, the US
regional operator, and Deutsche Telekom have succeeded in their quest
to purchase a majority stake in Matav, Hungary's telecoms operator in
which they had held a minority cent stake since 1993. Matav becomes the
first national telecoms operator in the region to pass to majority
foreign ownership.

In late December, Magyarcom, the consortium formed by the two companies
two years ago, agreed to pay $852 million for a further 37 per cent of
Matav, bringing their total stake to around 67 per cent. The sale,
together with the US-German consortium's purchase of a 30.3 per cent
stake for $875 million in December 1993, is the region's largest
privatization to date and the largest foreign investment in Hungary.

However, the deal - the culmination of a spate of year-end sales by APV
Rt, the state privatization agency - nearly fell through at the last
minute. Ron Sommer, chairman of Deutsche Telekom's management board,
and Walter Catlow, Ameritech vice-president, flew into Budapest to sign
the purchase contract only to run into an eleventh-hour hitch requiring
further negotiations. The deal was finally clinched after delays of
several hours.

Sources said the Hungarian side failed to include all the consortium's
contractual rights in the purchase document and also sought guarantees
that Magyarcom would not exit its investment within a fixed period of
time.

APV Rt said the consortium, in which Ameritech and Deutsche Telekom
have equal shares, had undertaken to float the company and reduce its
stake from 67 per cent to 50 per cent plus one vote by the end of the
century.

The state is due to retain a 25 per cent plus one stake in Matav, one
of Hungary's leading blue chip companies, while management and
employees are to be offered up to 2.7 per cent. Hungary was advised on
the sale by CS First Boston.

In the summer, when Hungary appointed CSFB as adviser, most analysts
doubted Hungary would sell a majority stake to Magyarcom. State
officials also indicated they would prefer to bring in institutional
investors and float the company in line with a government policy to
boost the Budapest Stock Exchange through privatization when possible.

But the consortium consistently argued against an early public offer on
the grounds that the company would fetch more once it had completed a
three-year Ft 210 billion ($1.5 billion) investment and restructuring
plan begun last year. An offer at a lower price than the consortium
paid would also have forced Ameritech and Deutsche Telekom to write
down their investments at a loss.

Magyarcom also wished to have full control of the company. Although it
gained significant management control in 1993, including a power of
veto over some decisions, it frequently had to spend much time
negotiating issues with its Hungarian partners. It took several months,
for example, for the two sides to agree on a new managing director in
early 1995.

At the signing ceremony, Sommer said the consortium was committed to
developing further Hungary's telecoms infrastructure and to making
Matav, the region's leading telecoms company. As part of its successful
bid in 1993, the consortium agreed to make Matav an international
telecoms hub and to increase the number of telephone lines by 15.5 per
cent annually - a target it exceeded by some eight percentage points in
1995.

Matav has a monopoly on national long-distance and international calls
until 2001 and will also be the exclusive operator in 39 out of 54
local network regions during this time. In addition, it has majority
stakes in two out of three local mobile telephone companies.

Catlow said the company had decided to increase its stake in Matav as
the Hungarian telecoms sector was the most attractive for investment in
the region. Ameritech is in dispute with the Polish government which it
alleges has reneged on a promise to grant it a digital mobile telephone
licence.

SERVIER ACQUIRES MAJORITY OF EGIS

Servier, the privately-held French pharmaceuticals company, formed a
strategic alliance with and acquired a 51 per cent stake in Egis, one
of Hungary's leading pharmaceuticals producers, in late December.
Servier, France's third largest pharmaceutical supplier, acquired 30
per cent of the company from the EBRD and the balance from NatWest
Securities.

The purchase price was not disclosed. However, the company's market
capitalization at the end of trading on December 15, the last day
before the purchase, was $184 million. Peter Reiniger, joint head of
the EBRD's Hungary team, told FEE  that the bank, which paid $45
million for its stake in late 1993, had made a profit on the
transaction. He said the value of the deal reflected the company's
share price as well as a premium for the purchase of a controlling
stake.

Egis, Hungary's second largest pharmaceutical company after Richter
Gedeon, was the leader on the local market in 1994 with a 13 per cent
market share. Exports accounted for 44 per cent of total sales. The
company, which went public in June 1994, made a profit of Ft3.8 billion
($31 million) on turnover of Ft14.4 billion in the first nine months of
1995.

Last summer the state's remaining 28 per cent stake in Egis was sold to
NatWest Securities at a price of Ft2,550 a share, compared to Ft3,275
in December, making the company the first of the country's large
pharmaceutical companies to become 100 per cent private.

The sale to NatWest, however, caused considerable controversy after it
emerged that the EBRD had urged the government to sell its shares to
NatWest - whose corporate finance division had been appointed to advise
on the sale - rather than to rivals including CS First Boston.

Brokers say the sale to NatWest without a proper tender for the shares
was in contravention of Hungary's new privatization law, passed last
May. However, the EBRD insisted on the sale to a "friendly party" on
the grounds that its 30 per cent stake would be worth less unless sold
in tandem with the government's remaining stake. EBRD officials told
FEE they had initially urged the government to sell its stake later
once a strategic partner had been found but that APV, anxious to raise
privatization revenues, had insisted on divesting its stake in the
summer. Only then had the EBRD stepped in and ensured the two stakes
could still be sold together.

The sale is one of only two "exits" made by the EBRD - earlier in
December it sold on its stake in a Czech chocolate maker. Officials
said the two sales reflected the growing maturity and stability in
Hungary and the Czech Republic and were also textbook examples of the
role the bank was set up to play. In both cases the bank got involved
in the companies' privatizations, acting as a "bridge" between the
state and private buyers.

Analysts said the sale also reflected Hungary's leading role in the
regional pharmaceuticals industry. The deal came only days after the
launch of a $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a medium-sized private
drugs producer (see following article), and just weeks after the sale
of 78 per cent of Biogal, another former state-owned pharmaceutical
company, to Teva of Israel for $26 million (FEE 5:22). Sanofi of France
owns a majority stake in Chinoin while Richter Gedeon has been floated
(FEE 5:22) and is now majority-owned by institutional and local
investors.

The Egis acquisition is Servier's first in central and eastern Europe.
Servier officials said they had negotiated the purchase in just six
weeks and had not yet decided whether they would increase their stake
further.

BRISTOL-MYERS LAUNCHES OFFER FOR PHARMAVIT

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), the US pharmaceuticals giant, has launched
a $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a rapidly expanding local
pharmaceutical company, set up in 1988. The offer, which is for 100 per
cent of the company, is Hungary's first public takeover of a company
listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange and one of the first such
takeovers in the region.

BMS said it had already reached agreement to buy 77 per cent of the
company from its majority owners Dr Imre Somody, Pharmavit chief
executive and founder, and Genericon Pharma, an Austrian
pharmaceuticals company. Its offer to both majority and minority
shareholders is to be at the same price even though Hungary has few
regulations governing takeovers and ensuring minority shareholder
protection.

BMS has offered $62.35 per share or $12.47 per global depository share,
each representing one fifth of a share - a significant premium over the
company's stock market price. GDSs were trading at $7.25 in the London
OTC market the day before the offer was announced in December, down
from an offer price of $57.5 when the company went public in June 1994.

BMS said its offer which closes on January 26 was conditional on it
gaining 90 per cent of Pharmavit and that it intended to withdraw the
company from the BSE. The vast majority of the 23 per cent stake not
owned by the majority shareholders is held by foreign institutional
investors.

BMS is being advised on the sale by Schroders, the UK investment bank,
together with Creditanstalt Securities Budapest - the same team which
this year advised on the flotation of OTP, the national savings bank,
and on the placement of a further tranche of Richter Gedeon, Hungary's
largest pharmaceuticals company.

Pharmavit made pre-tax profit of Ft632 million ($5.7 million) on
turnover of Ft4.1 billion in 1994, up from Ft533 million on turnover of
Ft2.4 billion in 1993. It is Hungary's leading producer of vitamin
pills - mainly through its Plussz effervescent tables. Most of its
sales are in Hungary but the company also has sales subsidiaries in the
Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland.

The company is one of a growing breed of eastern European companies,
set up at the beginning of market-led changes, which are now
sufficiently mature to attract the interest of a multinational company.

Since 1990 the company has also produced generic drugs and over-the-
counter medicines. Its main pharmaceutical product is Diclofenac, an
anti-inflammatory drug developed by Ciba-Geigy.

Before setting up Pharmavit, Somody, 37, was a director at Chinoin, the
local drugs company now owned by Sanofi of France. He will stay on as
head of BSM in Hungary - although Pharmavit is to retain its
independence. BSM intends to use Pharmavit, its first acquisition in
the central and eastern Europe, to expand further in the region.

Somody recommended that minority shareholders accept the offer. He
apologised for the company's change of strategy - Pharmavit had
previously indicated it would not seek a strategic partner - but said
BSM's offer was a good one.

GE CAPITAL, EBRD ACQUIRE BUDAPEST BANK

GE Capital, the financial services division of General Electric of the
US, and the EBRD have together acquired a 60 per cent stake in Budapest
Bank for $87 million, ending the bank's three years on the sale block.

Like Matav, however, the sale suffered a number of last minute hitches
as both sides rushed to meet a December 15 deadline. The deadline was
set in late 1994 when the government agreed to transfer Ft12 billion in
state securities to the bank - to make it more attractive ahead of
privatization - on condition it was sold by December 15 1995. In the
end, the deadline had to be extended for two weeks while the deal was
finalized. Senior GE and EBRD officials, including Christopher
MacKenzie, GE Capital's chief executive in Europe, flew into Budapest
with the expectations that a deal would be signed by the 15th only to
leave empty-handed. A technical hitch appeared which could only be
resolved by finance minister Lajos Bokros, who was away at the time. It
appears that liability for at least one court case involving Budapest
Bank had not been fully resolved in the sales contract, causing a three-
day delay in the signing.

Under the terms of the agreement, GE Capital, which will take a 27.5
per cent stake, will assume operational control of the bank. Together
with the EBRD, which has a 32.5 per cent, GE has an option to increase
its stake by 22 per cent within five and a half years. Until the sale
the state held an 82.6 per cent stake in the bank.

Hungary was advised on the sale jointly by Salomon Brothers and Lehman
Brothers. Salomon initially won the adviser's contract but was obliged
to share it with Lehman after much of its banking team left to join
Lehman.

The sale is a significant boost to government efforts to sell off state
banks, many of which have borne the brunt of the country's difficult
post-communist transition and have proved hard to privatize. The deal
is only Hungary's second sale of a large commercial bank to a Western
strategic partner. It follows the sale of a 25 per cent plus one vote
stake in Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank, the foreign trade bank, to
Bayerische Landesbank in mid-1994.

GE Capital, which is expanding aggressively into Europe through a
string of recent acquisitions, entered the bidding for Budapest Bank,
Hungary's fifth largest commercial bank, relatively late. It was not
one of the three companies which tendered for the bank in late 1994.
Then, Credit Suisse was named preferred bidder ahead of ING and Allied
Irish, only to withdraw abruptly in March after conducting due
diligence.

GE Capital and the EBRD signed a letter of intent to purchase the bank
in October and subsequently conducted due diligence. The buyers are
understood to have initially offered around $100 million but scaled
back their offer to $87 million after due diligence. Like other banks,
Budapest Bank has suffered from bad loans and in the middle of last
year had to make 15 per cent risk provisions. The bank has assets of
around Ft215 billion and 74 branches.

GE Capital, whose parent company is one of the biggest investors in
Hungary, said it would bring in new financial products and modern
technology. It is expected to keep on Bela Singlovics, the bank's chief
executive.

POLITICAL FEARS KEEP INVESTORS AWAY DESPITE BOOMING ECONOMY

For 1995, Slovakia should achieve the second-highest growth rate among
east Europe's emerging markets behind Albania, with gross domestic
product rising by 6 per cent. Economists expect a similar growth rate
in 1996 as key industries such as chemicals and steel continue to
benefit from booming export markets and as domestic demand grows.

Whether this rosy scenario leads to a reassessment of the country by
domestic and foreign investors will depend crucially on whether the
prime minister, Vladimir Meciar, is prepared to settle his damaging
constitutional row with President Michal Kovac. It is this power
struggle more than anything that has caused Slovakia to lag behind its
peers in the Visegrad group of countries - the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland - in the eyes of foreign observers, to the detriment of its
reputation abroad.

There appears to be little likelihood of an early reconciliation, and
diplomats in Bratislava say they can see no way out of the deadlock.
"Meciar must make the first move, and he does not appear willing to do
so," one diplomat said before Christmas. Until he does, the diplomat
adds, Slovakia will remain in limbo.

So far, however, the political row has not had an adverse impact on the
economy. Indeed, there is much progress on all fronts, including
privatization, which has speeded up considerably since the government
abandoned coupon sell-offs early in 1995 and replaced them with an ad
hoc series of sales to a narrow group of owner/managers. The key
question in 1996, as privatization reaches a climax, is: What next?

There were good reasons for abandoning coupon privatization. It is slow
and can be an administrative nightmare. It results in widely dispersed
ownership and to be truly successful it requires the immediate
implementation of rules to protect small investors (which are not yet
forthcoming in, for example, the Czech Republic).

On the other hand, it has a measure of transparency and fairness in
that all adult citizens can participate, making it politically popular.

The government's main argument for abandoning the coupon plan was that
dispersed shareholdings meant there was no clearly identified owner.
There was also the unstated fear among the nationalists that the back
door would be opened to foreign investors to pick up assets on the
cheap.

Critics argued that these were excuses for abandoning privatization
altogether. In fact, the reverse has happened. The adoption of
"standard methods" of privatization has quickened the pace
considerably, with hundreds of sell-offs in the second half of this
year with an estimated book value of $1 billion.  These range from
small factories to a big chunk of the Slovnaft petrochemical group .

The speed of the sell-offs is admirable. About 65 per cent of gross
domestic product is now generated by the private sector, according to
official estimates. The vast majority of these sales have been made to
executives and workers at the enterprises involved.

Meciar defends the methods used to reduce state ownership: "Various
lobbies say our methods are undemocratic. We think they are necessary
and inevitable," he says.

Yet there are clear signs of a wider agenda in the current bout of
privatization fever. Assets are often sold at knock-down prices and
buyers have 10 years to pay for them. If the enterprise is deemed
important enough, a controversial and ambiguous law on strategic
enterprises enables the state to retain a golden share that allows it
to wield influence long after the stake has been sold.

Most contentiously, critics say assets are sold only to those deemed
loyal to Meciar's all-embracing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.

Eugen Jurzyca of the Centre for Economic Development, a think tank,
doubts the wisdom of what he terms "family circle privatization".
Selling companies on the cheap throws away money that could be used for
social spending and the relief of bad debts. It also promotes
inequality by concentrating potentially valuable assets among a narrow
group who can then sell them on at great profit to themselves.

There is also growing concern about how these assets are being paid
for, in a country chronically short of capital. Those managers who buy
the stakes will owe substantial sums to the state holding company, the
National Property Fund (NPF), over the 10-year period of the payment.
The fear is that company cash flow will be diverted in the form of
dividends to owners to make those payments.

Few Slovak companies have the cash flow to afford this. "The company is
paying for its own acquisition in the end," notes Jean-Christophe Ganz,
manager of ING Bank in Bratislava.

Economists play down the political dimension of privatization. For the
National Bank of Slovakia the important thing is that it is continuing,
says Elena Kohutikova, head of the independent central bank's monetary
policy unit. "It is difficult to decide which privatization policy is
the best one," she says.

So far the government's policy has not had an adverse impact on
inflation, but nor has it enabled substantial inflows of fresh capital
and know-how. This raises two further questions. The first is how the
cost of the bond issue will be met.

Each coupon holder is to receive a nominal Sk 10,000 ($345) bond backed
by the assets of the NPF. The bonds can be used for things like paying
for an apartment or contributing to a private pension scheme, requiring
early redemption, and they are also likely to be transferable.

The bonds are due to mature in 2001, requiring the NPF to have up to Sk
35 billion ($1.2 billion) available to pay out. Meantime there is
annual interest based on the discount rate (currently 9.75 per cent).
Although not all holders are expected to retain the bonds to maturity,
economists warn that the potential cost of the scheme could be as high
as Sk 50 billion ($1.7 billion). This is a giant mortgage on the NPF
that it must be able to discharge.

The second question is how industry will be restructured. Key companies
like Slovnaft and the big VSZ steel plant have largely modernized and
are helping to fuel economic growth. Many others await the kiss of
life.

Foreign investment is one obvious solution, and some observers expect a
push to attract it in 1996. This would be a volte face for the
government, but one that Meciar may be pragmatic enough to pull off.

POWER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURED

The EBRD is backing Ukraine's power sector with a loan of $61.9 million
to support the restructuring of the country's power sector. Following
an EU and UK Know-How-Fund commissioned study on Ukraine's power
industry, the government is set to re-organize the thermal power
sector, to include the creation of thermal generating companies,
broadly following the pattern established during the privatization of
Britain's power industry.

The loan will go to the country's four newly created thermal generating
companies to finance repair and maintenance at the largest thermal
power plants in order to improve the reliability of power generation.
The loan will also pay for more accurate meters, investments required
to start a wholesale electricity market, which is to be set up soon.
Funds will also pay for managerial assistance to provide modern
accountancy measures and financial management techniques.

The loan was signed during President Leonid Kuchma's official visit to
London in December, when the EBRD signed a total of $75 million in
funding to Ukrainian enterprises. In view of the continued operation of
the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which Western experts unanimously
want closed down, it is a top priority to help provide a more reliable
power industry to replace the Chernobyl plant.

"Perhaps the most urgent issue for Ukraine today concerns the country's
energy sector," said Kuchma during his London visit. "With the EBRD's
loan we can strengthen our existing resources, in this case thermal
power plants."

In the longer term, the project will include a "twinning" programme for
management with a Western power company. The actual company has yet to
be chosen.

$50M AGREEMENT SIGNED

President Kuchma's London visit saw the signing of an important project
aimed to grease the wheels of trade in Ukraine. The EBRD has signed a
$50 million trade finance agreement under which it will guarantee the
payments of participating Ukrainian banks to their foreign
correspondent banks. The Ukrainian Innovation Bank (Ukrinbank), a
private bank, is the first to sign up to the programme. Other banks are
expected to join the programme shortly.

The programme was first started in Russian and Macedonia. Day-to-day
trade is stifled by a chronic shortage of trade finance, covering both
exports and imports from the East European countries. Under the
programme, the EBRD guarantees six-month letters of credit issued by
selected financial institutions. This guarantee allows banks to
establish reliable reputations with Western financial institutions,
enabling them to adopt normal correspondent relations with banks in
Eastern Europe. The programme may be expanded later to cover banks in
Eastern Europe and in "lost" markets, such as India, where Ukrainian
enterprises used to export five years ago.

Under the programme, the Ukrainian bank informs the EBRD which foreign
bank it wants to deal with and pays the EBRD a fee to cover the
guarantee. The EBRD guarantees up to 80 per cent of the letter of
credit thus allowing importers and exporters to get out of the current
stalemate and re-establish trade on a normal footing.

EBRD INCREASES UKRAINE FUND CAPITAL

The EBRD is backing equity funding by increasing the capital base of
the Ukraine Fund, the first private venture funds to be established in
Ukraine. Set up two years ago, the fund has lent $5 million to 18
companies. The EBRD will now increase its capital base by a further
$6.5 million. Equity funding has been provided to companies
manufacturing medical equipment, construction materials and food
processing and distribution.

The fund was established with a group of international investors,
including Bank of Boston and Claflin Capital Management. Despite the
difficult economic conditions, the Fund was oversubscribed and
initially raised $12 million as against a target of $10 million.

The EBRD is backing further infrastructure investment with an
investment of $5 million to assist in the construction of a fertilizer
terminal, Transinvestservice at Odessa. The terminal is part-owned by
the Ukrainian State Property Fund, the Norwegian company, Norsk Hydro
as well as local investors. The terminal will be used mainly for the
export of fertilizers from Ukraine and other CIS countries to Latin
America and Asia.

These investments bring the value of signed commitments to a total of
about $312 million for this year. EBRD president Jacques de LarosiAre
noted that the bank is able to achieve this due to the improved macro-
economic situation in the country and the growth of the private sector.
This total compares favourably with the EBRD projects approved in 1994,
when Ecu 153.9 million was committed in only three projects.

TACIS FUNDS THREATENED

Technical assistance programmes to the CIS countries are under threat
following a top-level move to block funding from the European Union.
Spain is demanding tougher controls and greater participation in
awarding contracts under the TACIS programme, which funds technical
assistance programmes to the 12 CIS member countries.

No agreement has been reached to authorize the TACIS budget of Ecu 500
million for 1996. While this dispute will not stop the programme in its
tracks, unless there is a resolution soon, the effects will be felt in
the future.

"We have the legal base to operate by extending the present regulations
for one year, but the budget is unclear," said EU official, Per Winter.

Although TACIS officials agree on financial commitments within each
budgetary year, which runs to December 31, the drawdown period can
extend for up to three years. Winter added that there is always a rush
to complete commitments by the end of the year in order to spend the
full annual allocation. If there is agreement within the first few
months of 1996, then officials are confident that the programme will be
able to fulfil commitments for the year. Funding for the programme will
be discussed again early in 1996, when it is hoped that Spain and other
possible allies might be persuaded to authorize a budget.

Spain is objecting to the way TACIS is run, mainly because so far
Spanish companies have only won 2 per cent of the programme's
contracts. EU officials claim they have tried to interest Spanish
companies in the programme, but with little success. They point out
that Spain scoops the pool in Latin America, but have little experience
or language skills in Eastern Europe. Spain wants to introduce a new
system of monitoring contracts and reduce the financial threshold for
contracts that are tendered, proposals resisted by other Member States,
who fear it would create a larger bureaucracy and lead to delays.

The TACIS programme had earlier been attacked by the European Court of
Auditors for inefficiency and poor targeting of funds, criticism that
the PHARE programme, aimed at the Central European countries had
earlier suffered. PHARE has been re-drafted, changed its bureaucratic
structure and focus to enable it to prepare the Central European
countries for joining the EU.

At the Cannes meeting in June, the EU decided to change the funding
mechanism for PHARE from an annual budget system to a five-year budget
of Ecu 6.7 billion, to avoid the annual scramble to commit funds by the
end of the year. The civil service oversight was also changed from a
sectoral to a country basis. There are now country desks and these
officials hold monthly meetings in the countries' capitals to determine
the future programmes in agreement with the individual governments.

Contracts under the PHARE programme have also changed from a series of
technical assistance contracts to a cohesive pre-accession strategy.
There are three main strands of the PHARE strategy.

The primary aim is devoted to helping the countries prepare for
membership of the EU. Each country has to work out a programme of
action that includes passing new legislation, preparing and ensuring
its enforcement and introducing European technical norms and standards.
While the programmes are driven by the individual countries, if EU
officials feel that the programmes do not make a realistic contribution
to EU integration, then they can reduce the funds available.

The second priority for PHARE funding is for infrastructure in areas
such as telecommunications, environment, gass and electricity networks
and road and rail transport. In transport, the EU has designated Trans-
European Networks, which integrate Central Europe's roads and railways
with existing networks in Western Europe and in particular easing
bottlenecks at border crossings.

 PHARE has now expanded into also providing finance in order to
catalyse foreign investments. Typically this might take the form of
putting up the government's share in an investment programme. The first
time this was done was two years ago, when the World Bank and the
European Investment Bank were looking to the Polish government to kick
in 10 per cent of the money needed to upgrade the E20 railway line from
Berlin to Warsaw. The Polish government re-drafted its proposed PHARE
programme to allow the money available to be spent on the railway
project.

EU officials are confident that the accession of the Central European
countries will be the best prepared of any new Member States. The
timing of their entry remains in the air, and it is also undecided
whether they will come in singly or in groups. What is certain is that
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary will be the first, with
officials speculating that the likely entry date is the year 2000.
Meanwhile, Slovenia, which would also qualify for early entry, has not
signed an Association Agreement yet, because of a dispute with Italy,
while Macedonia, having solved its dispute with Greece, now qualifies
for PHARE assistance. The eligibility of the other former Yugoslav
republics remains in limbo.

FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT

The UK Securities and Investments Board (SIB), under its chairman,
Andrew Large, is entering a new phase in its attempt to police London's
financial markets.

The SIB's early years were mainly taken up with detailed rule-setting;
subsequently there was a shift away from detailed rules in favour of
broader principles which the self-regulating organizations (SROs) could
then apply; and now, following some spectacular financial scandals, the
emphasis is on enforcement.

The background to this problem is the fragmentation of responsibility
for tackling market abuse. The multifinance enforcement agencies
involved include the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury,
the Crown Prosecution Service, the Services Fraud Office, the
Securities and Futures Authority, the Stock Exchange - and, of course,
the SIB.

The SIB Chairman is now proposing a much more centralised and effective
enforcement regime, based partly on US experience. Firstly, he wants to
see the development of a central transaction database covering on-
exchange and off-exchange transactions in both cash and derivatives
markets, so that abuse can be better detected. Secondly, the
investigation of abuse needs to be strengthened, particularly where
misconduct is of a criminal nature. And, finally, there should be more
effective enforcement action to deal with cases where abuse has been
established - as already reflected in the SIB's willingness to use its
powers under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act to ban people
from the investment industry.

In the areas of investigation and enforcement the SIB is now focusing
its efforts on more rigorous monitoring of the performance of the SROs
that come under its wing. This is being done through on-site
supervisory reviews of both the SROs themselves and (more
controversially) individual regulated firms. However, the SIB believes
that it is handicapped through insufficient statutory powers:
specifically, powers relating to the appointment of officers of SROs
and the imposition of monetary penalties on SROs where there is a
failure to comply with regulations.

In addition, the SIB would like to possess punitive powers over
authorised firms (eg the power to impose fines). The belief is that
fallback enforcement powers of this kind would encourage more decisive
action by SROs who would wish to avoid any need for the SIB to
intervene.

But the most radical new ideas on enforcement concern the interface
between the civil and criminal law. Mr Large has pointed out that in
the US, market abuse may be dealt with both under the criminal law and
as an administrative "offence", for which the SEC may impose penalties
of three times the profit made. The most serious cases are dealt with
by criminal prosecutors but in many other cases the civil route is
preferred, the public interest being served by the payment of financial
penalties to the SEC, which passes them to the US Treasury. This regime
is further buttressed by a plea-bargaining system which often avoids
the need for protracted legal proceedings.

Mr Large evidently sees much to be admired in the US enforcement
regime, and on the particular issue of plea-bargaining he expressed his
views forcefully earlier this month:

"I believe it cannot be beyond the wit of man, and certainly not beyond
the combined brain power of our best legal minds, to devise a fair and
open system of plea-negotiations which respects the role of the
judiciary in sentencing, a guilty defendant's desire to own up quickly
and on all fronts, and the needs of our criminal and regulatory-
enforcement agencies to secure their respective objectives without
wasting valuable resources - that could command real public
confidence."

The fact is that the law, and the law enforcement agencies, have
fallen into disrepute following a succession of failed prosecutions
involving allegations of financial fraud and market abuse. The public
perception is that the UK legal/ regulatory system is simply incapable
of dealing with serious misconduct based on sophisticated exploitation
of London's increasingly complex financial markets. The SIB chairman
clearly wants to do something about this, but it will require the co-
operation of Parliament and, above all, the legal profession, if
financial law and order is to be restored.

SEC REPROPOSES "LARGE TRADER" REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

In reply to an unusually large volume of negative comments, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has modified its earlier
proposed rule requiring reporting by "large traders" both inside and
outside the US on transactions effected in "publicly traded securities"
using US market facilities. (For a description of the originally
proposed rule, see FT-FRR January 1992.)

As re-proposed, Rule 13h-1 would require large traders to identify
themselves to the SEC, and require their brokers to maintain records of
the large traders' activity, to be provided to the SEC upon request. A
large trader is a person who, for an account he owns or controls,
effects transactions, during a calendar day where the account is
located, in publicly traded securities, aggregating at least the lesser
of (a) 200,000 shares with a fair market value of $2 million, or (b)
$10 million fair market value, or that constitute "program trading."
("Program trading" is either index arbitrage or any trading strategy
involving the related purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more
publicly traded securities with fair market value of at least
$1,000,000.)

The modifications are designed to reduce the number of traders
affected, as well as the burdens and costs of the proposed system on
both large traders and their brokers. This is accomplished through:
clarifying the definition of a large trader; increasing the minimum
level of trading that requires reporting; reducing the amount of
information required for filing; streamlining the filing itself, as
well as providing for an inactive status; improving the instructions
for filing; reducing record keeping requirements; providing special
reporting requirements for execution times; and defining a safe harbour
for the broker's duty to supervise his large trader clients.

The large trader reporting system, if approved as re-proposed, will
require large traders to file Form 13H with the SEC to obtain a large
trader identification number (LTID). Each trader is then responsible
for advising his brokers of his LTID and all accounts to which it
applies. These brokers must maintain records of the trades for the
accounts, which they will be required to provide to the SEC upon
request. The brokers must also supervise their clients' compliance with
the rule. The large traders themselves are required to update Form 13H
annually.

In the re-proposal, the large trader definition has been clarified to
include a person who effects transactions "for an account that he owns
or controls" in place of the original "for his own account or an
account for which he exercises investment discretion." According to the
SEC, this change is merely a clarification and does not change the
functional meaning of the definition. The re-proposal includes similar
clarifications with regard to the definitions of "person," "account,"
"ownership," "control," and "transaction." The revisions are designed
to limit the reach of the large trader definition by limiting the
number of accounts that are deemed to be owned or controlled
indirectly.

Probably the most important modification is that of the increase in the
level of activity which identifies one as a large trader. The
identifying activity level for any 24-hour period would increase from
activity involving 100,000 shares or a fair market value of $4 million
to 200,000 shares or a fair market value of $10 million. In addition,
those 200,000 shares must have a fair market value of $2 million, in
effect excluding from large trader status many who trade in large
volumes of lower priced securities. The re-proposed activity levels are
also intended to minimise the impact of the rule on natural persons who
infrequently trade large amounts of securities.

To simplify the identification of activity which requires reporting,
the SEC has proposed to change the 24-hour period to "a calendar day
where the account is located." The change will preclude the need to
aggregate trades occurring on different days, or to "correct" for time
zone differences. An account is deemed to be located at the principal
place of business of the broker, not where the client is located.

The re-proposal narrows the scope of the rules for aggregation of
accounts and transactions. This is accomplished partly through the
modifications to the definitions of "ownership" and "control." In
addition, aggregation of accounts will not be required where the
aggregation would include accounts of a person who would independently
qualify as a large trader. On the other hand, aggregation will be
required to include accounts of any other person who would not
independently qualify as a large trader. Further, under no
circumstances shall a person or group acting in concert toward a common
investment objective be allowed to disaggregate where that
disaggregation would permit them to avoid large trader identification.

Modifications to the filing requirements provide that a large trader
must file its original Form 13H within 10 days after it initially
reaches the identifying activity level; and within 60 days after the
end of each year thereafter. The re-proposal has rejected the original
requirement that large traders submit a new Form 13H each time the
"information contained therein becomes inaccurate for any reason," in
favour of the single annual update. In addition, the new form provides
for "inactive status" filing, by which a trader is exempt from annual
filing requirements until and unless it subsequently reaches the
identifying activity level. At that point, the trader again has 10 days
to "reactivate" by filing Form 13H.

Form 13H and its schedules and instructions have been modified to
reflect the changes in the Rule and have been generally simplified. The
re-proposed Form 13H allows for incorporation by reference of
information already on file with the SEC. The requirement for detailed
information regarding persons who own or control large trader
organizations has been largely eliminated. The schedules for listing
new accounts have also been revised, corresponding to the large
trader's status as owner, controller or custodian/ nominee of the
accounts.

With regard to the duties of broker-dealers, the rule requires that
they report electronically transactions that reach a certain level for
persons who they know or have reason to know are large traders. The
level of trading activity that must be reported is increased in the re-
proposed rule from 1,000 shares or a fair market value of $40,000 to
2,000 shares or a fair market value of $100,000. This change also
incorporates the change from a 24-hour period to a "calendar day." The
SEC recommends that brokers inform persons they have reason to know are
large traders of their obligations to identify themselves to the SEC.
Although the principal responsibility for compliance in placed on large
traders, brokers have a duty to identify large traders. The re-proposal
provides "a safe harbour" for brokers in this regard, provided they
adopt and follow reasonable procedures to identify large traders.

Finally, the SEC maintains that the burdens imposed by the proposed
rule on foreign entities are "necessary and appropriate" and "not
unduly burdensome," given their uniform application to foreign and
domestic entities. The re-proposal points out that, through the
redefinitions of identifying activity level as well as the concepts of
"ownership" and "control," the effect of the rule on foreign entities
is greatly reduced.

PROGRESS IN INTERSTATE BANKING LEGISLATION

Both the Senate and House Banking Committees have now passed their
versions of interstate banking legislation, and prospects are good that
both Bills will pass the respective Houses of Congress before the July
4 holidays. That will provide time before the end of the Congressional
year for a conference between the Houses to resolve differences between
the two Bills, and passage of a landmark interstate banking Bill this
Congress.

House
The House Banking Committee passed HR 3841, the "Interstate Banking
Efficiency Act of 1994", by a vote of 50-1, and it should be reported
to the full House of Representatives within the next 30-60 days. Senior
members of the Committee are considering placing it on the portion of
the agenda of the House known as the suspension calendar, usually
reserved for non-controversial Bills. While that may not succeed, since
two-thirds of those voting are required to pass such a Bill, the mere
fact that it is being considered shows that the Bill has solid strength
and will very likely pass the full House.

The Bill is similar to the Bill passed by the Financial Institutions
Subcommittee, changed only by modest amendments related to branch
closing requirements, statistical data collection, and inter-affiliate
agency activities. Efforts to impose crippling amendments sought by con-
sumer activists were soundly defeated.

The House Bill would permit acquisitions of banks across state lines
one year after passage of the Bill with no authority for states to
prohibit such acquisitions. Consolidation of interstate banks within a
holding company into a single branch network could take place 18 months
after passage. States would be able to prohibit branching by passing
legislation any time within three years after passage of the Bill, and
if a bank holding company had consolidated its subsidiary banks within
such states into an interstate branch network before the passage of
three years, it would be required to convert them back into banks as
they existed prior to the consolidation.

De novo interstate branching, as opposed to acquisitions and
consolidations, could take place only if a state expressly permits it
by statute. States would also be able, during a three-year period
following passage of the Bill, to prohibit interstate branching through
acquisitions.

Branches of national banks would be subject to the laws of the host
state with respect to con-sumer protection, fair lending, and community
re-investment as though they were branches of a state bank chartered in
that state. Branches of state banks would be subject to the laws of the
host state as though they were branches of a state bank chartered in
that state.

Foreign banks would be free to branch interstate with wholesale
branches and would not have to establish a subsidiary bank to do so,
but no change is made in the current law which requires establishment
of a subsidiary bank for conducting retail banking activity, whether
such activity be conducted through a branch or a bank. In other words,
if a foreign bank wished to engage in interstate retail banking
activity, it would have to do so through a US subsidiary bank.

Senate
The Senate Banking Committee passed its interstate banking Bill,
currently unnumbered and known as the "Interstate Banking and Branching
Act of 1994", by unanimous vote, and it is expected to pass the full
Senate before the Easter recess. It differs from the House Banking
Committee Bill in some key respects.

Interstate acquisition authority mirrors the House Bill, and no
significant differences need be debated in conference on that part of
the Bill. In the Senate Banking Committee Bill, interstate
consolidation, however, may not occur until two years after passage, as
opposed to 18 months in the House Banking Committee Bill.

Under the Senate Banking Committee Bill branches of national banks
would be treated in a host state as though they were branches of a
national bank chartered in that state. Branches of state banks would be
treated as though they were branches of state banks chartered in that
state.

Foreign branches do not fare as well under the Senate Banking Committee
Bill as under the House Banking Committee Bill. While a foreign bank
which had established a subsidiary bank to engage in retail banking
would be permitted to branch (as would any other US bank) it appears
that it would not be permitted to establish interstate wholesale
branches without first establishing a subsidiary bank, unless the state
law expressly permitted such activity. It appears, however, that it
would continue to be able to have representative offices, agencies, and
loan production offices in all states not specifically prohibited by
state laws, as long as those entities only conducted wholesale banking
activities.

Under both the Senate and House Banking Committee Bills there are
limits on the aggregate amount of deposits which can be retained in a
firm which expands by acquisition, although those limits differ
slightly.

Prognosis
Interstate banking seems to be alive and doing well in this Congress.
While passage of onerous provisions urged by consumer activists may
still derail final passage in the House, the prospects now are good
that an interstate Bill will pass this year.

The conference between the two Houses on the Bill will be difficult.
Significant differences exist on a wide range of subjects such as
determination of applicable law governing interstate branches, timing
and effect of state actions vis-e-vis branching, effect on foreign
branch activity, concentration limits, and the effective date for the
conduct of activities permitted by the Bills.

Similarly, the shadow of serious disruption of Congressional activity
which might be occasioned by hearings into the "Whitewater" affair are
beginning to build, and what Bills that might retard or scuttle are
unpredictable.

Still, for the first time since the McFadden Act was passed in 1927,
Congress appears to be prepared to liberalise laws governing interstate
banking and branching activity.

FEDERAL RESERVE PROPOSES REVISIONS TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS

The Federal Reserve Board ("the Board") has proposed revisions to
existing risk-based capital standards as part of the implementation of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).

In line with the Basle Accord, US banks currently calculate their
regulatory capital requirement on the basis of credit risks associated
with broad categories of assets and off-balance-sheet instruments.
Institutions are required to maintain a level of capital equal to at
least eight per cent of their risk weighted assets.

The proposed modifications would seek to adjust capital standards so as
to take into account the following factors:

1 The degree concentration of credit risk in a bank's loan portfolio.

2 An institution's ability to manage credit risk.

3 An institution's ability to manage the risks posed by involvement in
non-traditional activities.

Although the Board recognises that there is no generally accepted
approach to identifying and quantifying the risks associated with
concentration, it proposes that institutions with significant levels of
credit-risk concentration should hold additional capital. They note
that the information to achieve this is already available. Banks can
identify and track loans by industry, geographical location, country,
and loan type. This information would form the basis for the new
standard.

While the Board recognises that there are potential gains in risk
reduction through portfolio diversification, it is aware that there are
also potential pitfalls. For example, it is concerned that a bank
should not seek to achieve diversification by "lending in unfamiliar
market areas to out-of-territory borrowers or by rapid expansion of new
loan products for which the situation does not have adequate
expertise." They are anxious that any new regulations will not create
false incentives for management that will unintentionally decrease the
soundness of the banking industry.

The proposal does not identify specific categories of non-traditional
activities that it proposed to monitor. The Federal Reserve recognises
that new developments in technology and financial instruments have led
banks to become involved in activities that have not been associated
with their traditional business. They are aware of claims that any new
regulations could limit the ability of institutions to compete with non-
bank competitors. However, they are concerned that the risks associated
with any new activities should be promptly analysed and that capital
should be increased appropriately. The ability of an institution to
manage such risks will be taken into account.

The Federal Reserve notes that "the final supervisory judgement on a
bank's capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions that
might be drawn solely from the level of its risk-based capital ratio".
In addition to those factors which influence portfolio diversification
and a bank's management skills, they will also be looking at factors
such as interest-rate exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks;
and the quality and level of earnings.

SEC PROPOSES RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTOMATED TRADING SYSTEMS

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently proposed Rule 17a-
23 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act")
requiring brokers and dealers that operate automatic trading systems
(broker-dealer trading systems or BDTSs) to maintain participant,
volume and transaction records to be reported periodically to the SEC.

Under the 1934 Act, sponsors of BDTSs must register as broker-dealers
and are subject to its normal record keeping and reporting
requirements; they are not, however, required to identify separately
those transactions effected through the BDTSs, nor to summarise the
volume or type of activity occurring through the automated systems.
Additionally, numerous automated trading systems operate pursuant to no-
action letters obtained from the SEC at the commencement of their
operation.

In 1989, the SEC proposed a rule that would have required sponsors of
BDTSs to comply with a number of procedural and substantive
specifications. The SEC now believes, in light of the favourable
findings of its Market 2000 Study (See FT-FRR February, 1994 for a
description of that study), that enhanced record keeping and reporting
will be sufficient for purposes of detecting potentially or actual
fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative practices and protecting the
public interest in the automated trading arena.

The rule is intended to assist the SEC in evaluating the role of
computerisation and automation in the securities industry, with an eye
toward the goals of the national market system, to monitor the effect
of BDTSs on competition, and to reassess whether broker-dealer
regulation remains the appropriate method for monitoring these systems.

The proposed rule would apply only to those systems through which
actual execution or at least matching of orders occurs automatically,
excluding those systems which merely automate the collection of orders
or the routing of orders but do not provide for automated matching of
buy and sell orders within the system. BDTS sponsors will be required
to maintain records of daily summaries of trading; time-sequenced
records of all trades; information regarding system participants as
well as applicants who have been denied participation; and all notices
sent by the sponsor to the participants. The sponsors will be required
to file with the SEC an initial description of their system and its
operation; quarterly summaries of activity; and notification of
material changes or cessation of operations. The proposed rule
specifies no particular format for these submissions, in recognition of
the variance in internal procedures already established by BDTSs.

The SEC stated in its proposal that the anticipated costs to sponsors
in order to comply with these requirements "do not appear to be
significant," as many sponsors already maintain their own records and
the automated nature of the systems facilitates accurate and timely
data collection.

STOCK EXCHANGE FINALISES DISSEMINATION OF PRICE-SENSITIVE INFORMATION

More than 70 organizations responded to the Stock Exchange's
Consultative Document on the dissemination of price-sensitive
information (see FT-FRR November 1993 pp 7-8).

The following points raised have resulted in changes:

False market. Several respondents indicated that they were unclear
about the scope of the obligation in the Listing Rules to avoid the
creation of a false market in their shares. Are they obliged to correct
any errors in market perception which lead them to feel that their
shares are wrongly valued? Many companies consider that their
responsibility to correct errors in market perception should only arise
when the cause of the error originates - or appears to originate - from
the company or its agents.

Companies should not have to be "incessantly concerned" with comments
on their performance, their sector or their competitors. The Exchange
will be examining, in consultation with the Treasury and market
participants, possible changes to its Official Listing Rules to clarify
that a company which is keeping the market properly informed only has a
regulatory obligation to correct misconceptions in the market when the
source of the error is itself or its agents. Factual correction of
inaccurate information from a third party should be a matter of
sensible judgement and good practice by the company.

There will have to be further consultation by the Exchange on the basis
of the text of the revised rule. The present text of the guidance
reflects existing Listing Rules.

Confidential. Concern had been expressed that the draft guidance does
not fully reflect the situation where a company should not make an
announcement. There may be occasions when a company's duties to its
shareholders, employees and creditors conflict with any duty of prompt
disclosure to the market as a whole. In response to this, the Working
Party has included a new paragraph on the handling of confidential
information. The Working Party did not intend this guidance to imply
that companies could not keep commercially sensitive information
confidential until the appropriate moment for its announcement.

Responsibility for issuing information. The revised guidance makes it
clear that in the Working Party's opinion, policies concerning the
handling of price-sensitive information must be set by the Board of a
company, though the implementation of the policy may be delegated.

Annual General Meeting. Some commented that public occasions such as
Annual General Meetings were unsuitable for intelligent discussion
between directors and shareholders because they were so sparsely
attended.

The Working Party would "deplore" a situation where the public
proceedings at the AGMs remain anodyne, whilst influential audiences
are briefed privately on sensitive matters. Companies must remember
their obligation to announce formally - either before or at the time of
the meeting - any price-sensitive information which is to be given at
the meeting.

Significance. Some consultees have suggested that the guidance, if
taken to extremes, would require a company to monitor constantly all
comments about itself, its competitors and its marketplace to see if
they created the need for some statement of clarification. The guidance
has been amplified to stress that an assessment must always be made of
the significance of information. The guidance is not intended to lead
to a stream of inconsequential announcements.

Status of guidance. The Working Party was strongly urged to clarify the
status of the guidance in proceedings either in a court or as a result
of action by the Exchange as Competent Authority. The guidance cannot
constrain any regulatory body and compliance with it will not
necessarily constitute a defence in the event of regulatory action
being taken. However, the Board of the Stock Exchange has agreed that
the Exchange will take into account judgements made by companies in
accordance with the guidance.

List of what constitutes price-sensitive information. No respondent
believed that price-sensitive information should be defined by
reference to a given percentage movement in share price, but a few
suggested that a list of likely price-sensitive events might be
helpful. The Working Party has gone some way to meeting this request
but has emphasised that any list is inevitably deficient in those grey
areas where companies may be most anxious for guidance.

Making people insiders. Some respondents suggested that the very act of
asking a shareholder if he consents to become an insider will convey
price-sensitive information to him, in that he may well have a shrewd
idea of what he is likely to be told. If shareholders wish to avoid
being placed in this position and are reluctant to lose their ability
to trade, even for a short period, they should make this policy known.

Quarterly statements. In general, respondents did not wish this part of
the guidance to become prescriptive and endorsed the tone of the
consultative paper. Some thought that it was inappropriate for the
market to be given figures which had not been externally verified. The
Working Party disagrees that the market will be misled by such
information provided that its status is made completely clear at the
time of the announcement.

Analysts. The guidance now contains some observations on how analysts
should behave in the conduct of their relationships with companies.
Many analysts are employed by firms which are members of the Exchange
and, even if the Exchange has no statutory responsibility for their
conduct, it feels it should encourage best practice, especially as
companies are expected to handle their side of these contacts with
great care.

Small companies. The guidance is applicable to every size of company.
It is acknowledged that companies whose progress is followed by only a
few analysts will have particular problems if those analysts are wildly
wrong in their forecasts and may well need to consider whether they
need to make a correcting announcement.

SIB PUBLISHES CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON COMPENSATION FUNDING

The Securities and Investment Board has announced proposals to end
cross-contributions for SFA and IMRO members with regard to the
Investors Compensation Scheme.

The proposals have been drawn up in the light of comments which the SIB
has received in response to its Discussion Paper, "Financing Investors
Compensation", published in October 1993.

The proposals are as follows:

* to end cross-contributions, as of April 1 1994 for SFA and IMRO
members, and on recognition of PIA for members of FIMBRA, LAUTRO and
SIBRO;

* to set up separate contribution arrangements for SFA, IMRO and, if
recognised, PIA, with a cap of #100 million for each SRO;

* to treat SIBRO firms as belonging to the relevant SRO for
compensation purposes;

* to continue with a unitary scheme, administered, as now, by ICS, with
separate SRO funds;

* to change the basis for allocating management costs to an activity-
related basis, as far as possible;

* to give SROs increased control over, and responsibility for, looking
after their own arrangements for financing their own compensation
liabilities.

Cross-contribution
There was unanimous support for the proposed ending of cross-
contribution and the SIB proposes to set up separate contribution
arrangements for individual SROs, with no cross contribution between
them. However, there was concern about the proposal that there should
be caps of #100 million for each of SFA, IMRO and PIA.

The fact that an SRO has a cap of #100 million does not necessarily
mean that it has to levy the full #100 million on its membership in any
one year. It would be open to an SRO to avoid having to do this by
borrowing on its own credit.

Treatment of "SIBRO" firms
The ending of cross-contribution raises the question of how SIBRO firms
should be treated. The SIB last year indicated its preference that
direct regulation should be available only as a last resort. The
Discussion Paper proposed that, instead of remaining a separate
constituency with its own cap, SIBRO firms should be treated, for
compensation purposes, as belonging to the relevant SRO.

This was the only other proposal in the Discussion Paper which aroused
significant comment. Concern related to: the inappropriateness of
breaking the link between compensation and regulation; the requirement
in s54(3) that so far as practicable an SRO's contribution to ICS
should reflect claims experience in its own constituency; and the
practicalities of identifying the appropriate SRO.

However, the SIB did not find these arguments persuasive and remains
convinced that the original proposal is the most appropriate way
forward. Rather than breaking the link between compensation and
regulation, the SIB sees the proposed approach as emphasising the value
of community of interest as between investment firms in the three
eventual groups (SFA, IIRO and PIA) in effective regulation. Apart from
SIBRO members who are applicants for membership of a SRO, who will be
treated as belonging to that SRO's group, the presumption is that the
relevant SRO will be PIA (if recognised) unless a firm is predominantly
engaged in dealing (in which case, it will be SFA) or managing (in
which case, it will be IMRO).

Separate SRO funds
or separate schemes?
There was very little support for the idea of entirely separate SRO
schemes, each with their own administration. Accordingly, the SIB
proposes to proceed on the basis of a unitary scheme, administered by
ICS, but with separate SRO funds.

Management costs
The SIB proposes that the first #300,000 of management costs should be
treated as fixed costs and that these should be divided equally between
SROs. The SIB proposes that the variable costs element should be
allocated on an experience-related basis according to a 3-year rolling
index which takes account of the number of defaults occurring in each
constituency and the number of claims related to each constituency
handled by the Scheme in that three-year period.

Methods of financing
SRO members' liabilities
Under the present arrangements, SROs are given the status of
administrators of the Scheme for the purpose of the levy procedure
only. In other respects, they act as agents of ICS and it is the SRO
members, rather than the SRO, which owe the liability to the Scheme.

The SIB proposes to change the rules so that the SROs will be
constituted as the administrators of the Scheme for the purposes of
raising the amount required - whether by levy or otherwise - from their
members. The initial liability to pay ICS will thus fall on the
individual SRO, but ICS will retain a right over the SRO's members in
the event of a failure by the SRO to pay or collect and pay over the
sums due to ICS.

The SIB also proposes to enable an SRO to defer - at least, in part -
its members' obligation to pay for compensation liabilities by means of
borrowing.

Representations in respect of the proposals should reach the SIB by
March 25 1994.

THE TRADED SECURITIES (DISCLOSURE) REGULATIONS 1994

On March 1 1994, The Traded Securities (Disclosure) Regulations 1994
came into force, to give effect to Article 7 of the European
Community's Council Directive (89/592/EEC) of November 13 1989 which
sought to co-ordinate regulations on insider dealing.

Article 7 requires that:

"all companies and undertakings, the transferable securities of which
are, whatever their nature, admitted to trading on a market which is
regulated and supervised by bodies recognised by public bodies,
operates regularly and is accessible directly or indirectly to the
public, should be under an obligation to inform the public as soon as
possible of any major new developments in the issuer's sphere of
activity which are not public knowledge and which may, by virtue of
their effect on the issuer's assets and liabilities or financial
position or on the general course of its business, lead to substantial
movements in the price of the securities admitted to trading".


The regulations stipulate that the above will apply to securities
traded on any regulated market in the United Kingdom, except where the
recognised investment exchange, which regulates and supervises the
regulated market on which an issuer's securities are admitted to
trading, exempts the issuer from this obligation.  It may do so if
satisfied that the disclosure of the particular information would
prejudice the legitimate interests of that issuer.

The regulations go on to state that in the event of failure on the part
of an issuer to comply with such disclosure of information, the rules
of the recognised investment exchange (on which those securities are
traded) must:

* discontinue the admission of the securities to trading; and/or

* suspend trading in the securities; and/or

* publish the fact that the issuer has failed to comply with the
obligation; and/or

* itself make public any information which the issuer has failed to
publish.


The Regulations thus impose important reporting requirements on issuers
of securities traded on regulated markets, although those listed on the
Stock Exchange are already subject to similar rules set out in Chapter
9 of the Yellow Book entitled - Continuing Obligations.

THE VALIDITY OF CLOSE-OUT NETTING UNDER JAPANESE LAW

On December 27 1993, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
notified banks that there was no need to refrain from entering into
close-out netting agreements. It was said that the MoF had consulted
with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the MoJ had come to the
conclusion that close-out netting provisions would be held valid in the
existing framework under the Bankruptcy Act, the Corporate
Rehabilitation Act and the Civil Code. Strictly speaking, however, even
though Japanese banks are now allowed to enter into close-out netting
agreements with foreign counterparts, the question of validity will
ultimately have to be decided by the Japanese courts, this point being
acknowledged by both ministries.

There has been some substantial discussion among Japanese lawyers on
this issue. The main question appears to be whether a contractual
agreement entered into with a view to setting off, under certain
circumstances such as insolvency of one party, debts which are not due
and payable and are denominated in different currencies will be held
valid under the Japanese insolvency law. Two main points at issue are:

* whether a set-off will work on a cross-currency basis (the "currency
point"); and

* whether an agreement to set-off debts which are not due and payable
will stand under the Japanese insolvency law (the "timing point").

As to the currency point, Article 403 of the Civil Code provides:

"Any debt denominated in a foreign currency may be paid by the debtor
in Japanese currency, the amount of which shall be determined in
accordance with the exchange rate available in the place of payment."

There is also a rule established in a Supreme Court decision that, in
connection with a debt denominated in a foreign currency, the creditor
(not the debtor) may require the debtor to pay in Japanese currency.
The combined effect of these is that one of the parties to a swap
agreement will be able to convert all the outstanding foreign currency
debts into those in Japanese currency, thus enabling such party to
effect set-off as if they were in the same currency. Since this happens
by operation of law, it is argued that there is no reason why an
agreement to set-off on a cross-currency basis should be held invalid
under Japanese law.

As regards the timing point, there is a well established Supreme Court
authority which states that an agreement made between a bank and a
customer to set-off debts which are not due and payable will defeat the
claim of the customer's creditor who obtains a garnishee order over a
deposit which the customer has made with the bank. It is generally
understood that the above rule will apply where a liquidator is
appointed for the customer.

On the basis of these observations, there does not appear to be any
difficulty in affirming the validity of a close-out netting agreement
under the Japanese insolvency law. Such an argument has been advanced
by a leading academic lawyer in Japan and it appears that there has
been an implicit consensus of opinion on these lines among Japanese
lawyers.

Insofar as there are remaining objections, they are likely to relate to
the argument that, while a right to convert currencies is available
under ordinary circumstances, it would be quite another matter for it
to be available in an insolvency situation. The reason behind this is
that to allow creditors who have multi-currency mutual debts to
exercise such a right in an insolvency situation, would give them
further priority over those creditors who do not have such a right,
such as depositors (although the contrary argument can be that since
the right of set-off is firmly established and those creditors having a
right of set-off are given priority over other creditors, it will be
regarded as a relatively minor step to expand the scope to multi-
currency mutual debts). Another problem with the above argument is
that, since the argument is based on Article 403 of the Civil Code,
there is some uncertainty as to a close-out netting agreement embodied
in a contract governed by a legal system other than Japanese law.

It should be noted that the Supreme Court decision referred to with
respect to the timing point took a substantial approach, in which it is
considered that the majority opinion upheld the validity of contractual
set-off against the claim of the garnisher on the basis that such a
function of set-off would enhance convenience in trading and be of
benefit to society as a whole. Although the said Supreme Court decision
dealt only with the timing point, the basic idea may well apply to the
currency point. Such a consideration would probably strengthen the
conclusion reached by Japanese lawyers and would be useful to overcome
the difficulties pointed out above.

It is worth noting that in the Supreme Court decision referred to
above, one of the respected judges added, that if such a right of
contractual set-off was widely acknowledged in a business community,
its validity should be upheld in that business community. It is
interesting that the judge intimated that there could be a special
legal system which would govern a business community. Such an idea has
not been discussed in detail among Japanese lawyers, but would be
useful in this context.

If there is any concern about upholding the validity of close-out
netting, it would be that creditors will be able to erode the principle
of pari passu distribution easily by an agreement with the debtor.
According to the above intimation, however, the validity of close-out
netting will be limited to financial institutions active in the market
(if "business community" may be translated as "market"). It is true
that to protect those financial institutions in such manner would have
a negative impact on other creditors (such as depositors) when a
financial institution goes into liquidation. However, other creditors
(in particular, depositors) would be protected more properly by the
capital adequacy requirements, the deposit insurance scheme and other
regulatory measures.

Although it may still be arguable as to how the validity of close-out
netting should be substantiated, it must be emphasised that almost all
lawyers (including the officials of the MoF and the MoJ) who have
focused on this issue recently have come to the conclusion that a close-
out netting agreement should stand up under Japanese insolvency law. In
order to minimise or even remove the risk, however, it is advisable
that some steps should be taken, which now appear to be possible as
Japanese lawyers have almost reached a consensus. It may be considered
that some relevant institution should formalise the Japanese position,
but it is questionable whether there is any institution which would
perform such a function. More importantly, the Japanese courts, as a
matter of policy, resist being influenced by outside opinions. In such
a judicial climate as exists in Japan, it will probably be more
appropriate to introduce recognition of close-out netting by
legislation.

ASAHI BANK WILL BE FIRST CITY BANK TO OPEN SECURITIES SUBSIDIARY

The Ministry of Finance (MoF) has selected Asahi Bank as the first city
bank to establish a securities subsidiary. Asahi will be permitted to
open its subsidiary for business from July this year. Under the
Financial System Reform Act, enacted last April, the MoF removed the
original firewalls between commercial banking, trust banking and
securities industries.

Last July, Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), Long-term Credit Bank of
Japan and Norinchurkin Bank set up securities subsidiaries. However,
the MoF delayed the establishment of subsidiaries by city banks because
of strong opposition from the securities industry. The city banks are
feared for their large financial resources, great influence over many
industries and highly trained staff. Because of these fears the MoF has
restricted the activities of bank subsidiaries to dealing and
underwriting bonds.

From the existing 11 city banks:

In July:

Asahi bank has the green light to commence securities operations
through a subsidiary.

In November:

Six other city banks will commence securities business. Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Sakura Bank and Sanwa
Bank.

In March 1995:

In the near future the MoF is expected to approve this date as the
entry point for Tokai Bank and Takushoku Bank to the securities
business.

Of the two remaining city banks, Daiwa Bank took over its securities
subsidiary "Cosmo Securities" last August in a rescue bid. Finally, the
Bank of Tokyo has no immediate plans to enter the securities business.

The MoF announced that it deliberately spread out the entry times so
that the securities industry would not be too disrupted by the
entrants. According to the MoF, by the end of January 1994, the
subsidiaries had underwritten approximately Y50 billion worth of
domestic corporate straight bonds, approximately Y3 billion worth of
domestic convertible bonds and some Y50 billion of overseas bonds.

Last month Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank came to the rescue of Kankaku
Securities by extending subordinated loans of Y70 billion. The two
firms already have close ties but Kankaku stated that it has no
intention of becoming a subsidiary of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank as a result
of the rescue. In the case of Daiwa Bank's bailout of Cosmo Securities
last August, Cosmo issued new shares that were bought by Daiwa, making
the securities firm its subsidiary.

TSE SENDS MISSIONS TO ASIAN EXCHANGES

The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has sent two teams of delegates on a
fact finding mission, one to China and Hong Kong and the other to the
ASEAN countries (Singapore. Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippeans and
Indonesia).

The teams were to visit the region's bourses, accounting firms, legal
firms, institutional investors and local units of Japan's big four
brokerages. Among the issues investigated were the types of settlement
systems, the types of protection given to shareholders and disclosure
regulations. The TSE's aim is to collect information so as to decide
whether Asian shares are safe for Japanese investors. This is seen as
the first step along the road to listing other Asian shares.

CCPC'S FIRST YEAR

The Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC) was set up in March
1993 as a joint venture between 162 financial institutions. So far 65
city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, life and non-life
insurers have used the CCPC to liquidate troubled debts. The number of
financial institutions using the CCPC is likely to rise in March 1994,
when many companies end their financial year. Estimates of the value of
bad debts that will be sold to the CCPC in March are put in excess of
Y1 trillion.

The banks sell bad debts to the CCPC at a discount, then charge the
loss against their profits, so cutting their tax bills. The CCPC is
then supposed to liquidate the loans by selling the underlying
collateral to private investors. So far it has only been able to sell
Y17 billion of collateral, due to weak demand for real estate. In
contrast the CCPC has bought Y1.33 trillion worth of bad debts with a
face value of Y2.86 trillion.

In the 1993/94 financial year the Ministry of Finance (MoF) restrained
the sales of bad loans to the CCPC, to avoid large tax losses. This
policy has now changed and the MoF wants to accelerate the banks' write-
offs dramatically. The goal of the MoF is to strengthen banks' balance
sheets in the face of unprecedented enormous bad debts.

LISTING RULES TO EFFECT RESTRICTIONS ON MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has announced that changes to the Listing
Rules have been approved, which prohibit multiple applications for
public offerings of securities and which should limit the occurrence of
undetected multiple applications. The new rules came into effect on
March 16 1994.

The new rules require issuers, their sponsors and underwriters to take
responsible steps to ensure multiple or suspected multiple applications
are identified and rejected. In addition, any application form for a
public offering of securities will have to be worded in such a way that
the applicant is required to declare that only one application is being
made by him or for his benefit. The new rules also specify that any
application for more than 100 per cent of the securities on offer will
be deemed to be a multiple application, which will therefore have to be
rejected.

INCREASE IN SFC FEES

The Securities and Futures Commission has announced that as from April
1 1994 some of its fees will be increased. The increases do not affect
the main charges payable by intermediaries such as licensing fees. The
large increases of up to 36 per cent are only expected to affect a
minority of registered persons requesting approval for departure from
the normal requirements of the Securities Ordinance and the Commodities
Trading Ordinance or for the authorisation of immigration-linked
schemes.

HKMA ACCEPTS WIDER DEBT INSTRUMENT RANGE

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has announced that it will now
accept a wider range of Hong Kong dollar debt instruments as security
for repurchase agreements ("repos") for its overnight funds. Repos are
the means by which financial institutions may access the HKMA's
liquidity adjustment facility for short term liquid funds and it is
hoped that the inclusion of more debt securities acceptable for repos
will be helpful to the financial institutions in managing their
liquidity. The HKMA will now accept debt securities issued by the Mass
Transmit Railway Corp, the Provisional Airport Authority, bank issued
debt instruments with ratings of not less than A minus given by
Standard & Poor's or equivalent and other debt instruments with ratings
of not less than A, in addition to the Exchange Fund bills and
government bonds currently acceptable.

PROPOSED CHANGES ANNOUNCED IN ANNUAL BUDGET

On March 2 1994 the Financial Secretary, The Hon. Sir Hamish Macleod,
delivered his 1994 budget speech to the Legislative Council, proposing
the government's revenue and expenditure plans for the 1994/5 fiscal
year. The following proposed changes were announced as part of that
budget:

* Changes are proposed to the Stamp Duty Ordinance to facilitate the
practice of short-selling and stock lending in Hong Kong. The proposals
involve deferring the point at which stamp duty will first become
payable on loaned stocks from two weeks to one year.

* It is proposed that the rate of profits tax on company profits be
reduced by one per cent to 16.5 per cent. There are to be no changes to
the rates of depreciation allowances.

* It was announced that the government plans to introduce anti-
avoidance legislation to combat the use of service companies as tax
saving vehicles.

CONSULTATIVE PAPER ISSUED BY THE HONG KONG STOCK EXCHANGE

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has recently issued a 38-page consultative
paper entitled "The Way Forward" as part of its current project to
develop a strategic plan for the three years up to the hand over of
Hong Kong to China in 1997 and beyond. It has invited comments on the
paper by April 22 and expects the strategic plan to be publicised in
mid-1994.

The consultative paper summarises discussions that have been held with
market participants of issues facing the market and possible ways
forward. It also indicates the Exchange's response to each of the
proposals, which ranges from specific measures, through inviting
further suggestions, to stating that it does not intend to take the
proposals further. The list of market participants with whom the
Exchange held discussions includes as well as issuers, stock brokers
and fund managers, a wide range of interested bodies and individuals
such as The Hong Kong Association of Banks, The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, The Hong Kong Society of Accountants, academics and
information providers. The stated purpose of the paper is to get an
indication of the market's general views. If the market shows support
for a particular course of action, the Exchange may conduct a separate
more detailed consultation at a later stage.

The main emphasis of the consultative paper is on identifying ways in
which the Hong Kong's stock market can maintain its competitiveness in
an international context, as well as facilitating its role as a source
of international funds for the continued economic expansion in China.
The paper identifies certain key issues which are facing the Exchange:
* the maturity of the Hong Kong market in terms of domestic listings
and the need therefore to attract more listings of overseas companies
in order to maintain growth;

* the significance of overseas investors to the recent growth in the
Asian markets and the need to maintain and promote this interest;

* the importance of China's economic development to the future of the
Exchange and the role the Exchange can play in helping to fund that
development;

* the increasing demand for sophisticated derivative products for risk
management purposes or as trading vehicles;

* the need to be up-to-date in the secondary market in terms of market
automation, to facilitate higher trading volumes and meet the
increasingly complex demands of investors;

* the competition from other Asian exchanges, and the need to stay
ahead or at least equal with their development of derivative products
and automated dealing systems; and

* the need to promote the growth of the bond market in Hong Kong,
possibly as an alternative means of raising funds for Chinese companies
rather than equity issues.

Recurring themes in the consultative paper are the need to provide a
market that has the highest level of transparency and efficiency and
the need for a market which attracts investor attention. In this
respect, the Exchange believes that the emphasis must now be on an
"international" rather than local solution, as had been the case in the
past.

The consultative paper outlines options for the development of the
Exchange which should meet the stated aims of transparency, efficiency
and international competitiveness.

Some of the options involve building on existing developments. These
include the introduction last year of the Automatic Order Matching and
Execution System (AMS) and the first direct listings of China
incorporated enterprises in Hong Kong, as well as the ongoing
development of a traded options market, expected to be launched in
early 1995, and improvements to the debt listing regime.

Other options involve establishing a new direction for the Exchange as
part of the search for international solutions. New developments which
the Exchange is considering further include:

* re-orientating the Listing Rules of the primary market towards the
international arena by basing them on a listing philosophy similar to
the US, which would rely on extensive disclosure and self-regulation by
issuers and financial advisors, backed by strong sanctions against non-
compliance;

* relaxing the rules that require overseas entities to provide
shareholders with the same standard of legal protection as under Hong
Kong law. It is suggested that the US approach of requiring compliance
with the overseas entity's domestic corporate governance regime but
with the US accounting disclosure and accounting requirements would be
attractive to overseas entities;

* strengthening the corporate governance regime for listed companies,
for example by making audit committees and properly qualified finance
directors and company secretaries mandatory;

* improving the current disclosure requirements, such as requiring more
detail in the annual report, involving the auditors in interim
announcements and requiring annual asset valuations in the accounts;

* establishing a formal regime for the regulation of sponsors and
financial advisors, which may be backed by legislation;

* including members' internal control systems in the Exchange's
inspection programmes and considering whether further measures are
necessary to improve members' internal control systems;

* improving the automation of the market and considering the
possibility of off-floor trading;

* improving the provision of real-time trading information to the
market and developing a "quality of market" function to monitor and
facilitate improvement in market transparency on a more formal basis;

* introducing appropriate training programmes and allowing the
interface of AMS terminals with members' in house systems to facilitate
the development of sophisticated trading strategies in the secondary
market;

* extending the trading hours of the market which may allow a short
over-lap with the start of trading in London;

* reforming the current disclosure regime arising from the Securities
(Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance, which is thought to be onerous in
some respects and inadequate in others;

* increasing the current requirements for the minimum public float of
securities in a listed issuer and improving monitoring procedures;

* abolishing the board lot system and the rules for spreads, in
conjunction with the full immobilization or de-materialization of share
certificates;

* dissolving the Fidelity Fund or merging it with the clearing house's
guarantee funds and increasing the size of the maximum payment of
compensation by the Compensation Fund in the case of member defaults;

* considering the appropriateness of penalties for misconduct and the
feasibility of establishing arbitration facilities for disputes between
members and between members and their clients;

* enabling listed issuers to include their repurchased shares in their
balance sheets as treasury stock held for subsequent re-sale; and

* reviewing the relationship between the Exchange and the Securities
and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange to ensure
greater co-ordination of responsibilities and resources and
consolidation of the different statutory instruments and non-statutory
codes covering the securities market.

In addition, the paper identifies areas where improvements or new
measures might be welcome and the Exchange specifically invites
suggestions for future developments in these areas. They include:

* developing listed Hong Kong depository receipts on regional blue chip
companies; and

* measures, beyond those for streamlining the listing process currently
being considered by the Exchange, to develop the bond market further.

The paper identifies three proposals which the Exchange does not intend
to take any further. These are marketmaking for stocks, introducing a
second-tier board for smaller companies which do not meet the full
Listing Rules requirements and introducing a trading-only board, with
no compliance requirements for the issuers concerned.

Although in the Foreword to the consultative paper the Exchange
stresses that these are tentative proposals which are open to comment
at this stage, in the body of the paper the Exchange identifies the
direction of the strategy for the years to 1997 and beyond. This
direction is focused on attracting overseas issuers and investors,
possibly by moving towards a US style disclosure-based regulatory
regime, and increasing the role of automation and sophisticated
products in the secondary markets. Press response in Hong Kong to the
proposals has been favourable, although doubts have been raised as to
the feasibility of introducing a US style disclosure regime in the next
three to five years, and the appropriateness of such a regime, which
would include reduced vetting by the Exchange, for new issues in Hong
Kong.

PROBLEMS REMAIN FOR "BANCASSURANCE"

A joint approach to the supervision of "bancassurance" in the European
Union is still a far way off. While there is agreement on some basic
principles such as the need for transparency of group structures, the
exchange of information, the role of auditors and the monitoring of
intra-group exposures, the main point of contention remains the
question of group surveillance of capital.

Consolidation would be the "natural" tendency of bank supervisors;
however, it has not been conclusively shown that this method is
adaptable for the control of insurance groups. Insurance supervisors
propose the "solo-plus" approach, whereby pure solo supervision of each
of the components of a group is extended to include elements of group-
wide risk assessment. The issue was the subject of a "jumbo" meeting of
EU finance supervisors in Brussels on February 23, and discussed during
a seminar held at the Central for European Policy Studies (CEPS) on
March 15.

Financial conglomerates are defined as "group of companies with
specific control relationships or under joint management, and whose
activities consist largely or exclusively of providing services in at
least two of the following financial sectors: banking, securities,
insurance." This refers in practice to many different structures: they
can be horizontal or vertical, headed by a supervised or unsupervised
entity, which may be a financial or a mixed-activity holding. According
to recent data, there are more than 200 financial conglomerates in the
EU. Some Member States already allow consolidated accounts of
conglomerates, although it is far from clear whether this would be
permitted under EC legislation.

While the European Commission does not want to stop the development of
financial conglomerates, which they see as a source of strength for the
Union's financial services sector, Member States' supervisory
authorities disagree on the way to control the capital adequacy of such
conglomerates at the group level. Different regulatory rules and tests
are applied at national and Community level, and wide variations exist
in the accounting treatment. There is however agreement on two basic
propositions, as Patrick Pearson of the Commission's DG XV said at the
CEPS seminar: all solo supervisors should monitor the full risks of the
conglomerate; and sufficient capital should be appropriately
distributed and available in the group to cover risks.

Some "easier" issues regarding financial conglomerates have already
been dealt with in the draft BCCI follow-up Directive. This proposal
sets a 20 per cent participation as the threshold for the inclusion of
a company in a group. It requires group structures to be transparent
and says that the head office should be in the same Member States as
the registered office. It furthermore requires auditors to provide
relevant information to the supervisory authorities. However, the
definition of groups was criticized at the CEPS seminar by an industry
representative as an example of excessive regulation, and it was
questioned whether reporting obligations could be strengthened by law.
But there was agreement that further efforts should be undertaken to
lower the obstacles to the exchange of information among supervisory
authorities, and that a lead supervisor should be designated for the
control of conglomerates. Reference was in this respect made to the
"protocol" model applied by the Dutch authorities.

On the matter of how best to tackle the most striking problem in the
control of financial conglomerates, the prevention of double gearing,
the opinions of regulators diverge. Double gearing is the double use of
regulatory capital in the different entities of the group. Banking and
investment firms supervisors would adopt consolidated supervision to
tackle this problem, but it is not obvious that this is the method to
apply to control bancassurance groups, since it is not proven that the
capital requirement for both parts is identical. The way therefore to
deal with double gearing in the immediate future is the automatic
deduction of participations, or the deduction of a minimum solvency
margin. However, automatic deduction is not required under the EU
banking and insurance Directives.

Other prudential concerns should also be dealt with in the near future.
Capital requirements can be circumvented through the use of unregulated
entities, such as leasing and factoring firms. In the other direction,
the holding company controlling the group can be used to distort the
capital standards. The latter problem was partly addressed in the
amendments to the consolidated supervision Directive (92/30). However,
it thereby only applies to financial holding companies, controlling
credit institutions, and it does not include mixed-activity holding
companies nor insurance companies in the consolidation. One proposal is
to introduce "fit and proper" criteria for the shareholders of a
holding company, but it remains to be seen whether this is feasible. A
further problem is "incestuous capitalisation", whereby own funds
elements are purchased by other intra- or extra-group entities, a
practice which cannot be prohibited by regulators. Limits should also
be set for intra-group loans and large exposures. The latter limits
exist in the banking and investment services sector, but not in
insurance. It might for example bring the banking arm of a conglomerate
to place its large exposures within the insurance undertaking.

As a medium-term solution, it was proposed that the solo-plus approach
should be adopted, whereby extra elements are added to the solo
control, namely the exchange of information, the monitoring of intra-
group transactions and transparency, and a minimum solvency for the
parents' company capital. Banking supervisors will however continue to
push for full consolidation. As Jean-Louis Duplat, President of the
Belgian Banking & Finance Commission and Vice-Chairman of the European
Commission's Banking Advisory Committee, said: "The solo-plus approach
offers a suitable solution for the time being, . . . the principle of
supervision on a consolidated basis, completed with aspects of solo
supervision, and, if necessary, sub-consolidated per pole (banking and
insurance pole), should be the final objective."

CENTRAL BANKS HOLD FIRE OVER HEDGE FUNDS

Despite widespread speculation in late February that market volatility
may have been increased by activities of US hedge funds (in selling
bonds and trading financial derivatives), the central banks governors
decided at their meeting in early March against any immediate moves
towards curbing hedge funds' activities.

Hedge funds are not under the direct control of central banks, since,
although mainly managed in the US, they are normally based offshore.
However, their activities have still caused concern to the regulators
for a number of reasons:

* their activities appear to have added to market volatility;

* heavy losses following unsuccessful speculation (eg on currency
movement) might lead to defaults on loans from banks where a hedge fund
is highly geared;

* failure to settle a contract could lead to a chain of defaults
occurring throughout the financial system.

Any attempt to increase control over hedge funds would, however,
encounter difficulties, whether the chosen approach was one of direct
regulation or an increase of existing indirect control (via supervised
banks). Direct regulation would be difficult, since it would need to
tackle cross-border issues, define "hedge funds" and also try to
isolate the particular activities causing concern (given that short-
term leverage risk is in itself a common investment strategy). The
alternative of an indirect approach by the central banks would instead
focus on loans made by supervised banks to hedge funds for the purchase
of assets. Both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board are
currently studying the implications of the ensuing credit risk
exposure, in light of the banks' common practice of only holding assets
to the value of the cash lent, with a margin of around 5 per cent or
less to cover risks. The concern here is that such margins would not be
large enough to cover sudden changes in hedge funds' positions,
particularly given that the credit risk of hedge funds is hard to
analyse, since they are not credit rated, have complex structures and
holders may also not provide net asset valuations. Additionally, recent
netting and market risk proposals by international supervisors seem
likely to reduce the requirement for banks to set aside capital against
such hedge fund exposures.

For the present therefore, the central banks appear happy simply to
monitor the situation, whilst keeping a closer eye on hedge funds'
activities. Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank and chairman of
the G-10 governors, summarised this approach, saying:

"We are willing to examine closely what is going on with these new
techniques, but we do not think that there is for the time being any
need for specific regulations. We think we have got to live with these
new techniques, but will follow closely what is going on."

REVISED INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The International Accounting Standards Committee ("IASC") has issued a
revised proposed International Accounting Standard on financial
instruments (Exposure Draft E48) for comment. This draft results from a
reconsideration of an earlier proposal (Exposure Draft E40) issued in
September 1991.

The draft covers the accounting for the disclosure, recognition,
measurement and presentation of all types of financial instruments and
sets out the proposed treatment for the financial assets and financial
liabilities so created, in the accounts of the respective enterprises.
A financial instrument in this context is a contract that gives rise to
both a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability or
equity instrument of another enterprise. Financial instruments include
both primary instruments such as cash, receivables and equity
securities, and secondary or derivative instruments, such as options,
futures and forward contracts relating to financial instruments and
interest-rate and currency swaps. Various interests, such as those in
associates and subsidiaries and commodity contracts, were excluded from
E40. The new draft also proposed to exclude from the scope of the
Standard insurance contracts and assets held specifically to provide
funds for satisfying obligations under insurance contracts.

Other significant changes from E40 include:

* the criteria for recognising and subsequently discontinuing
recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability now refers to
the transfer of substantially all of the risks and rewards associated
with the asset or liability;

* a legally enforceable right of set-off must exist before a financial
asset may be offset against a financial liability and the net amount
included in the balance sheet;

* impaired monetary financial assets and impaired non-monetary
financial assets are now treated separately under the Standard ;

* hedge accounting is now permitted for price risk exposure where
expected future positions are highly likely to materialize;

* financial instruments that hedge currency (foreign exchange) risk are
now within the scope of the hedge accounting requirements of the
Standard.

ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATIONS UNDER THE EEA TREATY

The coming into force of the European Economic Area (EEA) Treaty on
January 1 1994 led to substantial changes in the regulation of many
commercial areas in Norway, including the regulation of financial
markets.

The changes relate both to the implementation in Norway of the general
principles of EEA law, like for example non-discrimination of EEA
nationals, and the implementation of the various EC Directives relating
to financial markets. There follows an overview of some of the changes
relating to both banking and investment business.

Banking
The Norwegian regulations contained various provisions regarding
nationality and residence of persons acting as board members of a bank
and the founders of a bank. Originally these persons had to be
Norwegian nationals and resident in Norway. These requirements have
been changed to cover persons who are nationals of an EEA state and
resident in such a state. The restrictions on foreign ownership of
Norwegian banks remain applicable since Norway can, according to the
EEA Treaty, benefit from a transitional period for its investment
controls until January 1 1995 when it has to lift its restrictions in
respect of EEA nationals.

The various EC Banking Directives have been implemented in Norway,
including the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive as a result of
which EEA Member State banks may provide services to, and establish
branches in Norway. The services provided for, relate to the taking of
deposits as well as the services set out in the Annex to the Directive.
The relevant regulations open possibilities for the imposition of
various rules on these branches to the extent that they are necessary
for the public good, as provided for in the Directive.

The Norwegian regulations in respect of banking activities have also
been amended in other respects to comply with the various EC banking
directives including regulations in respect of consumer credits and
money laundering.

Investment
As far as intermediaries are concerned, the rules now provide an
exemption for branches of EEA credit institutions in Norway to conduct
their securities activities through a separate legal entity. Norwegian
banks are under an obligation to organise their securities market
business in a separate legal entity. The activities must also be
separated physically from the other activities of the bank. Branches of
EEA credit institutions do not have to comply with these rules. The
legislation further provides a basis for the adoption of additional
requirements on EEA credit institutions offering securities services
through a branch in Norway.

In addition, the obligation on Norwegian residents to make purchases of
foreign securities through a Norwegian broker has also been amended.
The rules now provide that Norwegian residents can buy and sell
securities which are regularly traded in the EEA without the mediation
of a Norwegian securities broker. In addition, these securities no
longer need to be kept in the securities deposit of a Norwegian bank or
securities broker. Although the exemptions are mainly directed to
securities traded in EEA member states, the regulations also provide
that the exemptions can be made applicable to securities traded in
states which have supervisory standards similar to those of the EEA.

The listing requirements of the Oslo Stock Exchange have been amended
to comply with the various directives in this field, including the
rules in connection with the preparation and recognition of
prospectuses. The Norwegian regulations in connection with the offering
of non-listed securities have also been amended.

If the securities to be issued have a value of more than 5 million
krone and the offer is directed to more than 50 persons, then the
issuer has to prepare a prospectus which complies with detailed
requirements. The prospectus must be sent to the board of the Oslo
Stock Exchange, where the contents of the prospectus will be checked in
order to ensure that they comply with the relevant regulations. If the
securities are listed on an EEA stock exchange, a similar prospectus
needs to be prepared if the value of the issue is more than 300,000
krone or if the offer is directed to more than 50 persons.

Different prospectus requirements apply to issues which are directed to
more than 50 persons and have a value of between 300,000 krone and 5
million krone. In such cases, a less elaborate prospectus will need to
be prepared. The prospectus must also be sent to the board of the Oslo
Stock Exchange, however this is for filing purposes only. There are a
number of exemptions to these prospectus requirements which should also
be considered.

In addition, there are more general rules in connection with
invitations to subscribe or the corresponding acquisition of shares in
connection with the incorporation of a company or capital increases,
founder shares and bonds with a term of more than 12 months. In such
cases a prospectus must be prepared which complies with some basic
requirements. These rules apply only to the extent that a prospectus is
required pursuant to, for example, company law or when a prospectus is
issued in connection with the issue.

The regulations relating to investment institutions have been amended
and now also incorporate the UCITS Directive.

OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS

Since the beginning of March, options on futures contracts have been
quoted on the Milan Stock Exchange for the first time on an
"experimental" basis. The wording of a standard contract for these
instruments is currently being settled by the management committees of
the "Mif" (Government Bond futures exchange) and by the "Mts" (the
Government on-screen trading market). It is expected that regular
trading will commence in earnest sometime in April 1994.

The underlying instruments will be futures contracts on ten-year
Treasury Bonds (BTp decennali) and will be based on the American model
(ie exercisable at any time from the date of purchase to the date of
exercise). There will be nine striking prices, exercisable at fifty
base-point intervals, and the premium will be payable upon maturity of
the option or upon its exercise.

In order to ensure the efficient management of the new instruments, the
Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (the national clearing house) entered
into a contract last August with the Options Clearing Corporation in
Chicago for the supply of specialised software which will also be used
for the other new products which are shortly to be introduced onto the
market, namely three-month Eurolira futures and stock exchange index-
linked futures.

SUPER PRIMARY DEALERS

In March, a Decree Law of the Ministry of Treasury introduced a new
player in the Italian markets namely, the "Super Primary Dealer", who
will operate in both the Italian primary and secondary markets in
Treasury Bonds.

The "Super Primary Dealer" is a Primary Dealer who is able to satisfy
certain strict pre-requisites (in particular, it must have assets worth
at least Lit. 75 billion, and have been awarded a market share
calculated on the basis of a year's trading, equal to at least one per
cent in respect of each category of bonds and no less than three per
cent of the of total volume of Treasury Bonds issued on the primary
market over the same period). Super Primary Dealers are expected to be
effective marketmakers and it is worth noting that they will have
access to certain Treasury Bonds auctions at which only Super Primary
Dealers will be permitted to bid.

BANK OF HAWAII ADDS SERVANTIS CASH MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

     Bank of Hawaii, headquartered in Honolulu, has licensed InfoVue
treasury management software from Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis
Systems Inc.  The bank hopes the system boosts its product offerings
for corporate accounts.   
     InfoVue provides corporate accounts with on-line treasury
management, account balance reporting, stop payments, E-mail and other
financial reporting services.  (Lynn Busing, Servantis Systems Inc.,

INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES FOR BUSTING FRAUD

     Credit card institutions must be more proactive in their fraud-
fighting strategies or risk significant losses from fraud, risk
management experts say. 
     To nip fraud losses in the bud, credit card departments must be
on the lookout for current fraud schemes, such as account boosting,
account takeover and counterfeit cards, say anti-fraud specialists. 
Issuers also should implement new procedures and programs for the
entire lifetime of an account to prevent these new forms of fraud.  
     Increased transactions are translating into an uptick in fraud
losses (Visa estimates that for 1994, it had $409 million in fraud
losses in the United States out of $290 billion total sales;
MasterCard's fraud figures are believed to be similar to Visa's).  

Reactive vs. Proactive

     The banking and credit card industries have, historically, had
more of a "reactive stance" to fraud, taking action only once the
cardholder alerts the bank to some fraudulent activity, such as a
stolen card or a charge-back item on a bill, said one consultant.  
     The more effective way to keep fraud losses down, however, is to
identify fraud schemes before they reach the individual cardholder. 
"Don't wait until the cow is out of the barn," advised Larry Hay, vice
president of risk management at Plainview, N.Y.-based Cardholder
Management Services, a firm specializing in card marketing, processing
and consulting.
     How can you become more proactive instead of reactive about
fraud?  Consider these strategies, offered by credit card fraud
experts:

Beware of Account Boosting

     Card executives need to be attuned to every kind of new fraud
scheme because they're faddish -- one form of fraud may be popular
today and virtually non-existent tomorrow, card industry observers
say.  Fraud schemes change 
frequently as law enforcement groups, card associations and financial
institutions devote attention to one type.  Subsequently, criminals
will look for new methods.
     Visa has begun to alert its member institutions about "account
boosting," a scheme where criminals obtain legitimate credit cards,
accrue balances, then send issuers, via overnight courier services,
stolen or counterfeit checks 
that exceed the balance amount, "boosting" the account's credit line. 
Federal law requires banks to post credit payments before checks
clear, so, the next day, the fraud perpetrators go to an automated
teller machine (ATM) and withdraw the excess amount on that card
account and the check later bounces.
     Visa has been helping the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) track down one large account
boosting case in Los Angeles, which resulted in 41 arrests recently,
said Allan Trosclair, vice president of fraud control for Visa.  
     Some account-boosting cases also are being linked to bankruptcy
fraud -- individuals accrue massive card debt knowing they will file
for bankruptcy and have no intention of repaying the card debt.  

TIP:  Card executives should be wary of any payments coming in through
overnight services, Trosclair warned.  They also should watch for
large payments or payments that exceed what a cardholder owes.  

     "If I send in a $6,000 check, and my credit limit is only $5,000,
there's something wrong," he said.  Banks may also want to monitor for
bankruptcy fraud behavior, by keeping track of accounts that suddenly
have high purchase volumes or uncharacteristically extravagant
purchases.  "There are several systems available which develop a
profile of normal purchasing activity of an individual cardholder and
when that [behavior] is severely changed and warrants some attention,"
said Hay.  

Prevent Account Takeovers

     MasterCard has been alerting its member institutions to watch for
an increase in "account takeover" fraud in which a criminal obtains a
cardholder's basic information (address, phone number, account
number), sometimes through old receipts, records or by stealing the
real cardholder's mail.  
     The criminal calls the card issuer, assuming the cardholder's
identity, and requests that a new card and personal identification
number (PIN) be sent to a new address because the card was lost or
stolen and the cardholder has moved.  "What happens is that the [real]
cardholder may not get a statement for a couple of months, the
criminal may pay off the minimum balance [to avoid detection] and then
start [using the card]," said Nancy Elder, a MasterCard spokesperson.

TIP:  To reduce account takeover fraud, issuers can include a three-
digit code, determined by the bank, on the back of a credit card next
to the account number.  

     Account representatives should be trained to be suspicious for
the three characteristics of account takeover:  a request for a new
card, a new PIN and a change of address.  Representatives should ask
for the three-digit code.  "If they say they don't have the card on
them, respond by saying 'call us back when you have the card in
hand,'" said Elder.

Use Technology, Training To Stop Fakes

    Issuers also must be alert for another kind of fraud: 
counterfeit cards.  These illegal products declined in the early 1990s
with the advent of the hologram; however, fake cards recently have
gained in popularity as holograms have become easier to replicate,
according to James Steel, regional vice president of security and risk
management at MasterCard.  
    To prevent more counterfeit card fraud, both MasterCard and Visa
have implanted secret card validation algorithms in each card's
magnetic stripe.  MasterCard calls it a card validation code (CVC) and
Visa calls it a card verification value (CVV).  
    When a merchant swipes the card through an authorization
terminal, the code enables the issuer to detect if there has been any
alteration of the stripe, and if so, to deny authorization for the
transaction.  
    An increasing number of transactions, however, are suspectable to
counterfeit card fraud because of purchases made at retail locations
that don't have on-line authorization terminals, or by telephone where
cards cannot be checked.

TIP:  One of the best ways to reduce counterfeit card usage is to
ensure that merchants are adequately trained in counterfeit card
detection, fraud experts say.  

    MasterCard's Holiday Fraud Prevention Seminar Program, for
example, helps merchants understand different types of credit card
crime by touring U.S. malls and educating merchants.  Acquiring
institutions also should require that their merchants offer training
to telephone operators, clerks and sales associates to help them learn
how to detect credit card fraud schemes.

Implement a Review Policy

    Issuers can use proactive strategies even after the fraud has
occurred by having a purposeful chargeback review methodology, said
Hay of Cardholder Management Services.  

TIP:  Review a charged-off account for improper authorization codes
and irregular activities, such as major purchases.  

    Improper authorization codes may indicate merchant collusion,
experts say. Irregular activities also may offer leads to criminals --
a purchase of a piece of furniture, for example, may have an address
where the furniture was delivered.  (Nancy Elder, MasterCard, 914/249-
5439; Larry Hay, Cardholder Management Services, 516/576-0404; Gail
Murayama, Visa, 415/432-3645.)

                         Fraud Detection Tool

     Here's just one of the many proactive anti-fraud products
available:

     Wheb Systems Inc. of San Diego, offers FraudAlert as a module to
its Intelligent Forms Processing System (IFPS).  FraudAlert is
designed to reduce errors and fraud before data is entered into
databases.  
     The module, based on technology licensed from Security Software
and S.G. Schoggen and Company, can be updated quarterly or monthly. 
Detection capabilities include:

 *  whether a Social Security number (SSN) has ever been used;
 *  whether the SSN was issued at a time approximating the 
          individual's stated birth date;
 *  if the SSN matches the specified state of birth; and
 *  if the SSN belongs to someone deceased.

     IFPS scans hand-printed or machine-printed forms, extracts the
relevant data and automatically enters it into a database.  Costs of
the system were not disclosed.  (Julie Drake, Wheb Systems, 619-586-

BANK MITIGATES RISK WITH ASSET/LIABILITY SOFTWARE

    U.S. Bancorp of Portland, Ore., says  asset/liability management
software cut in half the time it takes for the bank to run monthly
analyses and simulations, thereby increasing by two weeks the time the
bank has each month for forecasting and strategic analysis.
    The system also allowed the bank to more than double the number
of random interest rate scenarios it can create and reduced the time
needed to meet regulatory reporting requirements, Bancorp executives
say.
    Asset/liability management software uses computer simulations
under random rate scenarios to monitor interest rate sensitivity,
liquidity position and capital adequacy.  Although such services are
offered by banks as part of their corporate services package, some
large companies have purchased asset/liability software for in-house
treasury management, consultants say.
    However, treasurers largely have shown lukewarm interest in the
software as systems can be costly, tough to maintain and difficult to
use, consultants note.

System Reduces Analysis Cycle

    Bancorp installed RADAR, a UNIX-based asset/liability management
application from Risk Management Technologies Inc., of Berkeley,
Calif.
    RADAR simulates up to 100 randomly generated, interest rate
scenarios and presents a statistical and graphical view of each
potential outcome.  Companies can use this data to look at statistical
probabilities and begin to generate strategies for the best balance
sheet mix.
    The system also analyzes product risks.  For example, banks can
use the system to look at commercial lending across their subsidiaries
and provide information to various business managers on optimal fee
structures and interest rates, explained Rick Simpson, asset/liability
manager at Bancorp.
    In addition, RADAR reduced by two weeks Bancorp's time needed to
conduct rate analysis and issue reports for different business lines. 
"Today we are performing the same reporting in two weeks, which gives
us the second half of the month to [plan] how to use the information,"
Simpson explained.
    Although Bancorp hasn't calculated the interest rate savings
RADAR has provided, trimming just one basis point on the spread
between assets and liabilities means an additional $1.8 million to the
corporation, he noted.
    Bancorp also can run a full balance sheet analysis for one of its
banking concerns in two minutes.  Simpson estimated it takes a few
hours for the bank to run a hundred different scenarios. 
    RADAR uses RAM-resident, interactive modeling and supports both
value-at-risk (VAR) and risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)
analytical approaches.

Software Not a Hit with Corporations

    Sumitomo Bank Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, the world's fourth largest
bank, plans to implement a RADAR system for asset-liability
management, interest rate risk management, transfer pricing, strategic
and product planning and product and customer-service performance
management, its executives say.  
    Sumitomo will create a bank-wide data warehouse for use by the
system.
    National Computer Systems of Minneapolis offers DataWriter,
another software application for asset/liability management.  
    The Windows-based system generates detailed reports on any aspect
of an asset management operation, including specialized asset
management.  Treasurers can use DataWriter to produce multiple reports
simultaneously. 
    In addition, the system allows treasurers to use point-and-click
features to define data and maintain libraries for storing and
indexing reports.
    Asset/liability software is not widely used by corporate treasury
managers, notes consultant Jim Sagner of Sagner-Marks in West Orange,
N.J.  
    "Even the most popular software which does account analysis has
been purchased by only a few corporations.  Many of them use their
systems just once or twice a year, and probably are sorry they spent
the money," he said.
    Most treasurers use asset/liability software provided by banks as
part of their information systems and balancing and reporting
services, Sagner said.  He believes treasurers are reluctant to buy
custom asset/liability systems because banks are providing adequate
services at competitive prices.  "Banks usually cut deals on these
services to win other business with corporations," he explained.
    However, only banks with sophisticated treasury workstation
products offer asset/liability services as part of their standard
software package for corporations, notes Henry Waszkowski, head of
treasury consulting at Wachovia Corp. in Atlanta.  The packages
generally feature debt modules, funds need forecasting and investment
modules, which do little analysis, Waszkowski said.  
    He said corporations often have to buy asset/liability modules
from vendors to implement on existing treasury workstations.  Many
other companies gather rate forecasting information from consulting
firms or by polling banks they do business with and subscribing to
economic services, Waszkowski noted.
    "Full-blown" workstations that include asset/liability management
software make the most financial sense for corporations with more than
$1 billion in sales annually and operations expanding overseas,
Waszkowski said. 

Treasurers Scared Off by Price of Software

    Sagner said another reason asset/liability software gets a
lukewarm reception from corporations is that treasurers are afraid
vendors won't be able to provide long-term support for the systems. 
He also believes treasurers are turned off by the $10,000 to more than
$100,000 price tag for the software.  
    "The little bit of money treasurers have as discretionary budget
is used for industry conferences or visits to vendor or bank sites,"
he noted.
    Sagner recommended treasurers avoid asset/liability systems that
are not bank-supported.  Otherwise, there is a chance that the
software vendor will go out of business and its system will become
obsolete and tough to maintain.
    TIP:  If you are keen on buying custom software, get a handle on
vendor
installation costs, which inflate greatly the price of off-the-shelf
software.

Look for Flexible Asset/Liability Software

    Jeffrey Wallace of Greenwich Treasury Advisors in Greenwich,
Conn., suggests treasurers also avoid asset/liability systems that use
static gapping models, which compute debt-equity ratios without
factoring in the yield curve.  "The real issue is how the yield curve
impacts bucket limits," Wallace said.
    "[Treasurers] won't care if they are long on the three-month side
and short on the six-month side if the yield curve is relatively
flat," he said.  "But if the curve is inverted, they might be
concerned about their gap restrictions." 
    Wallace suggested treasurers look for asset/liability software
management software that allows them to simulate a variety of interest
rate scenarios.
    TIP:  Keep in mind that PC-based asset/liability packages are
limited by the PC's processing capacity, memory and storage capacity. 
To compensate, they use aggregated data, which is not as accurate,
Simpson cautioned.  (Jeffrey Wallace, Greenwich Treasury Advisors,

MECA SOFTWARE GAINS MORE FINANCIAL BACKERS

    Banks looking to support personal financial management (PFM)
software may have to consider another major player.
    Competition in the PFM software business continued to heat up
last week as three new bank-investors pledged their moneys to
Fairfield, Conn.-based Meca Software's Managing Your Money PFM
product.
     FirstBank Systems, Fleet Financial Services and the Royal Bank of
Canada all bought stakes in Meca, which is co-owned by San Francisco-
based BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank Corp..  Each of the five
institutions will own a 20-percent share of Meca.
     The five Meca partners have a combined customer base of more than
40 million customers and represent more than $655 billion in assets,
giving Meca -- whose software is used by more than 600,000 consumers
and small businesses in North America -- a significant competitive
boost, industry analysts say.
     However, some banks do not believe the Meca partners will be able
to work together and create a competitive product.
     The overwhelming market leader for PFM software, with more than 8
million copies sold, is Intuit's Quicken.  Microsoft's Money PFM
product -- launched earlier this year -- is a distant third to Meca.

PFM Maneuvering

     The Meca deal continues a six-month trend, which has seen PFM
manufacturers aggressively seeking out bank partners to offer on-line
home banking.  Both Microsoft and Intuit have struck agreements with
more than 19 banks across the United States.  Many of these
institutions including Chemical Bank, CoreStates Bank and Wells Fargo
Bank will offer both Money and Quicken to its customers.

Advantages

     Meca's owners said the deal gives them an advantage in the PFM
marketplace over the Microsoft and Intuit banks because institutions
now can customize their PFM software packages.  Minneapolis-based
FirstBank, Providence, R.I.-based Fleet and Royal Bank of Toronto all
will create a branded Managing Your Money product with different
functionality.
     "This investment will enable Fleet to develop its own branded PC
[personal computer] product, designed to meet the specific needs of
our customers while providing them convenience and privacy," said
Michael R. Zucchini, vice chairman and chief technology officer at
Fleet.
     Fleet's version of Managing Your Money will provide Fleet
customers with an on-line link to open accounts, check and transfer
balances, apply for loans, track their investments and buy stocks and
mutual funds.

Avoiding Conflict

     Meca critics question whether the five large institutions can
agree on one software product.  
     "I just don't see why these banks, who compete against each
other, would want to join forces," said one Southeast banker.  "The
egos of the executives at these large institutions are bound to cause
problems."
     However, allowing each bank to customize may allow Meca to
sidestep any controversy.
     "I don't see a lot of potential conflict," said Stu Bloom, a
partner at the Hackensack, N.J.-based consultancy, Carmody & Bloom. 
"Banks are going to do what banks do -- offer basic financial products
to their customers.  There should be no great conflict in what will be
developed."
     Royal Bank of Canada will use Meca to launch a PC computer
banking system.  Its customers will connect directly to the bank's
host computer to pay bills, receive account balances, transfer funds
and access account information.  Royal will roll out Managing Your
Money nationally in late 1996 to its 10 million customers at more than
1,600 branches, according to Royal Bank officials.

The Future

    Industry analysts expect the strategical maneuvering of PFM
software providers to continue throughout 1996.
    In fact, Intuit recently announced its plans to provide on-line
banking over the Internet.  This is a change from its recent strategy
of signing up financial institutions.
    Intuit said it is developing a direct connection to the Internet
that will allow consumers to pay bills, check account balances and
transfer funds over the Internet.  Banks working with Intuit will have
the choice of offering customers Internet banking or banking solely
through Quicken.  

PFM Landscape

    The Intuit decision earlier this week proves that the PFM
landscape is changing on a daily basis.  
    PFM manufacturers will most likely continue to strike deals with
financial institutions.  
    However, do not expect banks to support solely one PFM product. 
Industry watchers believe banks want to offer their customers the most 
 choice  and   will   offer any  alternatives on the marketplace.  
    "It wouldn't be surprising for a bank to take an open systems
approach to these types of [PFM products]," said Bloom.  "In some
ways, it would be advantageous.  It won't surprise me [if some Meca
institutions offer Quicken or Money] even though they have taken an
equity position in Meca."  (Stu Bloom, Carmody & Bloom, 201/671-1700;

FIRST INTERSTATE BANK TAPS IMAGE-LOCKBOX PROCESSING

     First Interstate Bank, of Los Angeles, says it's the first bank
in the Western United States to offer image-based retail lockbox
processing.  It also claims to be the only bank to fully exploit the
opportunity to initiate true interstate banking.
     "We have installed a common lockbox image platform at all of our
banks which gives our customers the same consistent functionality,"
said Julie Stephens, product manager at the $56 billion asset-bank.
     A common platform allows First Interstate to offer same-day
automated clearing house settlement (ACH) across its Western state
affiliates or same-day cash concentration for customers who require
separate accounts, officials say.
     The bank's image-retail lockbox provides customers with
streamlined workflow, higher quality processing and improved customer
service, she said.       In addition, the system includes intelligent
character recognition (ICR), which allows matching payments and
coupons to be read by the system and processed without keying.  This
improves the speed and quality of processing.  
     Phase 2 of First Interstate's image-retail lockbox project will
include the ability to provide transaction images to customers for
receivables posting.
     The image system is expected to capture about 11 million items
per month.     

First Interstate Offers Common Platform  

     First Interstate also completed recently a multimillion-dollar
project to install common cash management systems across the bank's
13-state domain.  
     A provision of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act allows
affiliated banks to act as "agent" for one another, and act as an
agent itself.
     First Interstate offers common direct demand accounts (DDA),
account reconciliation processing (ARP) and account analysis
capabilities.  Customers can use the products to make same-day
deposits to a single account from deposit acceptance points in 13
Western states.  With fewer accounts to manage, customers can
determine cash positions faster and easier, bank officials say.
     "Many companies with multi-state operations will no longer have
to concentrate or reconcile funds," said Jan Cloyde, the bank's
executive vice president and manager of cash management.  She claimed
that competitor banks are well behind First Interstate in developing
multiple interstate banking options.

MAXWELL STIRS UP TROUBLE

The decision by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) (UK) to go ahead with
further Maxwell trials provoked as much reaction as the verdicts in the
first trial. The gasps that were heard in court as the defendants in
the Maxwell trial were acquitted on all charges were soon followed by
cries outside the court. Whether the shouts in court were of joy,
shock, or surprise, the comments outside were of a predictable nature:
critics slammed the use of juries in fraud trials and the record of the
Serious Fraud Office in prosecuting complex fraud.

Whenever a fraud case goes wrong - in other words, when defendants are
acquitted or those convicted receive light sentences - the reaction is
always the same. We were not disappointed in the case of the Maxwell
trial.

In contrast to the cries of 'abolish the jury' or 'scrap the SFO', one
of the most pertinent and sane comments came from George Staples,
director of the SFO. Although presumably bitterly disappointed by the
verdict of the jury, he said: 'It is our job to conduct a thorough
investigation and ensure that defendants are prosecuted fairly, and
that has happened. The jury has considered the verdict for many days
and has reached its verdict. The criminal justice system has functioned
in the way that it was designed to do.'

The truth - reinforced by the announcement of further trials - is that
at the moment the SFO is being forced to conduct political show trials
rather than trying to solve the serious problems of corporate fraud and
illegal acts in the City and elsewhere.

If there is trouble in prosecuting serious frauds, then creating
another agency or removing the people in charge will not solve the
problem. The law is a mess. In its report of July 1993, the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice said: 'Those giving evidence to us have
suggested that fraud trials would be simpler to determine if the
substantive law of fraud were reformed. Apart from the common law
offence of conspiracy to defraud, there is no specific offence of fraud
in England and Wales, and fraudulent conduct has therefore to be bought
under the ambit of various offences.'

Pension law has been reformed as a result of the Maxwell trial - so
now, should the law on fraud.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FRAUD CASES UP 16% - VALUE BY 25%

Fraud in central government has increased by 16% in the last year,
according to the Treasury's own figures. The 1994-95 Fraud Report - an
analysis of reported fraud in government departments - the Treasury
revealed that government departments reported a total of 408 cases of
department staff fraud, an increase of 16% over 1993-94 and 35% over
1992-93. The total sum involved was #2.12m compared with #1.69m in 1993-
94 and #2.11m in 1992-93, although the report says that in a number of
cases the amount involved had not been identified or could not be
assessed.

The report was published in January 1996 just two months after the 1993-
94 report (see The Fraud Report, November 1995) which was released only
after a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner under the Code of
Practice on open government. The Treasury refused to speculate on the
growth of fraud in central government. It said: 'Whether the increase
in the number of fraud cases reported reflects a real trend is
impossible to say. It may be that greater fraud awareness and better
fraud reporting procedures in departments leads to more cases being
reported. What is undeniable is that the risk of fraud is not
diminishing. Staff at all levels need to be alert to these risks.'

Strangely out of the 58 central government bodies, including all
government departments, which submitted annual returns in 1994-95, 30
of them - just over half - submitted a 'nil return' saying there had
been no cases of fraud.

'CONCERTED ATTACK ON FRAUD IS REQUIRED,' CLAIMS AUDIT FACULTY

More concerted action by management, regulators, auditors and the
Government is needed to fight fraud effectively, according to a booklet
published by the Audit Faculty of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England & Wales (ICAEW). Peter Williams reports on a
recent initiative by accountants.

In a new booklet, Taking Fraud Seriously, authors Tony Bingham of
Coopers & Lybrand, Ian Huntingdon of KPMG and Martyn Jones of Touche
Ross, wrote: 'Crime and crime prevention evolve together and there is
no shortage of effective measures with which to counter the fraudster.
The real challenge is not a technical but an attitudinal one, the will
to make fraud prevention a priority.'

The role of directors and management

A company can minimise the risk of fraud if directors and senior
managers take a positive lead and set the tone from the top,
communicating clearly that fraud, corruption and dishonesty is not
tolerated. According to the booklet, directors and managers should seek
to establish a clear anti-fraud culture by:

- Leading from the top. Senior management must demonstrate commitment
to an anti-fraud culture and be seen to be subject to the same
procedural guidelines and investigation as the rest of the work-force.

- Implementing and communicating an anti-fraud policy, covering such
matters as giving and receiving inducements, reporting channels,
investigation of suspected fraud and dealing with perpetrators. There
should be a public pledge that allegations of fraud or other wrong
doing by employees or by a third party will be properly investigated;

- Developing a fraud contingency plan, setting out what is done and by
whom in the event of the discovery of fraud.

The booklet also calls for quoted companies to comment in their annual
report on their efforts to prevent fraud and, in particular, to discuss
their policies on the areas outlined above. This suggestion has been
opposed by some finance directors.

Taking Fraud Seriously also discusses the role of non-executive
directors suggesting that they should:

- be alert to the risk of fraud in a business, particularly top level
management fraud;

- be satisfied that internal control measures are given the right
emphasis within the organisation;

- be satisfied with the integrity of the organisation's public company
reporting;

- establish open lines of communication with internal and external
auditors and be prepared to spend time discussing the auditor's
concerns.

The authors also call on directors to consider their wider public
duties when deciding whether to report alleged fraudsters to the
public. At present, many directors feel it is in the best interests of
their organisation not to report fraud to the police but to quietly
deal with the matter themselves, often leaving the fraudster to strike
again.

Reform of the law

As well as calling for a change in attitude towards fraud, the authors -
 all of whom are auditors - suggest that legal changes are required.
Alongside wider legal questions - such as an examination of the pros
and cons of creating a legal responsibility for officers and employees
of public companies to report prima facie fraud to the police - the
booklet calls for enforcing and extending section 389A of the Companies
Act 1985. This section gives auditors rights of access to the company's
records and requires its officers to provide such explanations or
information as the auditors need to perform their duties. It also
contains the offence of misleading an auditor, which the report says is
useful but that it does not carry a stiff enough penalty to encourage
prosecutors to use it.

The report wants the maximum custodial sentence increased from two
years to five, and for the offence to be extended to any employee and
any organisation.

The role of the regulators

Regulators play a key part in the fight against corporate fraud.
According to the report, they need to guard against two main dangers.
First, increasing the length and complexity of their rule book imposes
a burden on the majority of members with well-run business and, second,
more complex legislation can damage the effectiveness of inspection
teams.

Regulators could increase their effectiveness by:

- reviewing their rule books to ensure emphasis on the prevention and
detection of management fraud rather than on minor offences

- making greater effort to cooperate with overseas and international
regulators

- passing on important information promptly to auditors. The authors
want the law changed to impose a duty on regulators to tell auditors
when a client is suspected of fraud. They say that auditors can often
be left in the dark about such suspicions. At the moment, auditors are
under a legal obligation to report their suspicions. Regulators have
opposed the opening up of a two-way street saying that, where possible,
information is often already passed on.

The Government's role

Taking Fraud Seriously calls on the Government to establish an
independent standing body - The Fraud Advisory Panel - with
responsibility for:

- providing a forum for discussion and improved cooperation between
Government, law enforcement, the private sector and other interested
parties;

- increasing the overall awareness of the problem of fraud.

The Panel's membership would be drawn from the legal and accounting
professions, law enforcement, regulatory agencies, business and
academia.

Secondly, the Government should designate a lead department for the
coordination of the its anti-fraud strategy. At the moment
responsibility for anti-fraud policy is scattered around various
Whitehall departments.

Audit Faculty, The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &

FFIN WORKING FINE ON FRAUD

Mike Feltham, head of the London Stock Exchange surveillance
department, told the Taking Fraud Seriously conference (see opposite)
that great efforts have been made to ensure that information is
exchanged relating to any fraud or market abuse.

He said that one of the ways the Stock Exchange passed on and received
information was through membership of the Financial Fraud Information
Network (FFIN). Feltham said: 'FFIN was formed as a result of a
recommendation in a study commissioned by HM Treasury, as part of a
Government response to such cases as BCCI and Maxwell.'

Supervisors, regulators, investigators, law enforcers and Government
meet on a regular basis to exchange information and pool knowledge
about actual or suspected serious financial fraud.

Feltham said: 'FFIN has around 20 members but its feeder contacts go a
lot wider. The primary objective is to provide a framework for pooling
and disseminating information about financial fraud and other serious
criminal activity which pass through, and make use of, the UK financial
system.'

FFIN has no operational responsibilities as these remain with the
individual members. He added: 'There are three stages in the fight
against financial fraud: detection, investigation and enforcement.
FFIN's role is to assist principally with detection but it also helps
the transition of cases from the detection to the investigation stage.
FFIN tries to put together the different pieces of a jigsaw spread
around several players where the picture that emerges can be far more
significant than the individual pieces taken in isolation.'

Although each member has its own constitution and rules on
confidentiality there is normally a legitimate way in which to transmit
information within the membership when the need arises. Feltham said:
'To my mind, FFIN has already assisted the exchange by enabling it to
pass cases to the appropriate investigatory and prosecution agencies,
which has resulted in action being taken which would not have
otherwise.'

The London Stock Exchange and a number of other London regulators also
belong to an international inter-market surveillance group, ISG, which
provides a framework for the sharing of information and the
coordination of regulatory matters among market centres. Formed in
1983, ISG now has 22 North American, European and Australasian
organisations with a common interest in fraud prevention. Feltham said:
'Membership of ISG has assisted us in being able to track movements of
security trading and has allowed us to produce a much more broader
picture than was previously possible.'

FRAUD RISES ALONG WITH STANDARDS

Reported fraud has increased because expected standards of commercial
behaviour have risen, according to Ian Hay Davison, who was deputy
chairman and chief executive of Lloyd's from 1983-86. Davison said that
times change: acts once condoned are now regarded as fraudulent.

He said: 'That was the problem of the underwriters at Lloyd's: they
really had no idea that the ways of their fathers are today regarded as
not only unacceptable but as criminal. When I started in the City, the
provision of undisclosed benefits in kind to directors, the use of
insider information to deal before company news was made public, the
development of schemes solely designed to avoid personal taxation
rates, and what we would today regard as false or misleading accounting
practices, were rife. Year-by-year, case-by-case, statute-by-statute,
standards have been raised and offences created.'

But he added: 'Fraud is a serious problem. It has always been and there
is no point in raising standards if the new higher standards are not
enforced. There can be no doubt that the enforcement of law in the area
of fraud has been and continues to be lamentable.'

Davison also pointed to other reasons, such as more complex markets,
greater opportunities through the abolition of exchange controls, a
greater spread of wealth providing more smaller savers to be gulled,
and especially the greater power of computers.

He added: 'British white-collar crime has the quality that too often
its perpetrators persistently refuse to concede that what they have
done is wrong. One attractive quality of the Chinese, as I found in my
term as chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Review Committee, was that
while culprits at Lloyd's if caught red-handed consistently failed to
concede the enormity of what they had done, the Chinese accepted the
justice of the prosecutor's actions.'

THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE?

The Government watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) (UK), has
expressed concern over the need for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) (UK)
to keep under review more effective arrangements to prevent and detect
fraud. In this article Rachael Church looks at the lessons to be
learned by the MoD and others.

The MoD spends #23bn a year on the nation's behalf, including #9bn on
procurement, yet it reckons that it is relatively free from fraud and
corruption. It has identified only #22m possible fraud in 1993-94 - a
mere 0.1% of its total expenditure, and a much smaller figure than many
private-sector organisations.

Three recent cases involving the corruption of former MoD officials
raises a number of issues of wider relevance, according to the PAC.
Since November 1993, three individuals previously employed by the
Department - Gordon Foxley, James Taylor and Bernard Trevelyan - have
been convicted of receiving corrupt sums. The Foxley case is the most
significant of the three and concerns the receipt of corrupt payments
from overseas contractors. The Department says that not all the corrupt
funds in the Foxley case have yet been identified - although he was
convicted of 12 offences totalling #1.36m. Much of the money is locked
away in Swiss bank accounts. Despite civil action the PAC said: 'The
Department could not give us any grounds for hope that they would
succeed in gaining access to these accounts, but told us they would
pursue every possible avenue.'

Three overseas companies involved in the Foxley case have been
blacklisted, and the MoD is taking steps to recover the corrupt
payments. It has demanded a public apology and a clear assurance that
they will not involve themselves in corruption again, as well as more
onerous oversight arrangements if contracts are placed with them in
future.

Rotating duties

The PAC says that the Foxley case illustrates the risks of fraud and
corruption where staff are in post for a long time and have influence
over contracts. The National Audit Office (NAO) identified cases where
staff had been in post at the same location for over 12 years. The MoD
says that the Foxley case was exceptional in its longevity. It now has
a firm policy of moving staff every five years, but could not say that
everyone who had served in a post for five years would be moved. In
these cases there was a balance between the benefit of long experience
and deep knowledge and the risk of someone knowing all the tricks of
the trade and therefore increasing the risk of fraud.

The MoD's vetting arrangements failed to identify Foxley's lavish
lifestyle which included nine properties in England. The Department
said Foxley had a good cover story that his wife was a medical
practitioner 'who was known to have money in her background'. It is now
considering adopting vetting arrangements similar to those used for
national security purposes to identify individuals who present a fraud
risk.

Gifts and hospitality

As a result of the Foxley case, the Department's rules concerning the
acceptance of gifts and hospitality have been strengthened, by
providing more specific guidance on their interpretation. It says that
large-scale, expensive and exclusive hospitality has now been largely
eliminated, and that hospitality books are now properly maintained and
scrutinised. Rules have also been tightened where officials leave to
work for defence contractors and the Department looks carefully at
precisely what individuals have been doing and who they have been
dealing with - although it still considers this an area of potential
risk. In the US there is a five-year blanket ban on such a switch, but
the MoD says that the UK would not be able to afford the loss of brains
that might be transferred in to income-earning, export-earning
activities.

The MoD has also set up a fraud unit, promulgated fraud indicators,
runs fraud-awareness courses, and has a 'hotline', so that people can
report frauds anonymously.

OTHER PROCUREMENT AREAS AT RISK..

The scope for fraud is higher where control systems are less
comprehensive or where changes in management arrangements have altered
the circumstances in which the controls operate. In the MoD's case
areas identified by the NAO include:

- computer systems

- non-competitive contracts

- local purchase units and

- the control of assets held by contractors.

As a result of NAO work, the MoD has drawn up an action plan to reduce
the risk of fraud.

Computer systems. The MoD increasingly relies on computer systems. A
review by the NAO of the payment systems at Liverpool had identified a
number of concerns which the MoD is addressing through risk assessment.

Local purchase units. Around 400 local purchase units account for about
#270m a year but the MoD acknowledges that it is harder to exercise
control over small local contracts than it is for large procurement
contracts. In some cases there was no separation of duties and the
MoD's internal audit team visited fewer than 1% of them each year. It
plans to extend auditing in this area.

Non-competitive contracting. In 'cost-plus' non-competitive contracts
the risk that costs may be overstated is obvious. The MoD says it has
reduced the level of non-competitive contracting and started
initiatives such as 'No acceptable price, no contract' and the Equality
of Information Statement, which aims to reduce the risk of poor value
for money, including fraud.

Control of assets held by contractors. Government equipment and spares
are held by contractors to enable them to carry out repairs and
maintenance contracts. Controls in this area are often poor with often
an absence of separation of duty, supervisory checks, stocktaking and
exit-gate checks. The MoD's response is that less and less equipment is
held in this way so the risk should diminish over time.

LOSING OUT IN THE NUMBERS GAME

'Calling cards' allow calls to be made on the move. They are a
necessary and valuable product for many businesses and individuals. But
the increased flexibility they offer comes at the price of increased
risk. Dean Smith of Fraud Management Limited outlines the problem.

Everyone knows of the most common mobile product - the cellular
telephone - but fewer people are aware of the increasingly popular
'calling card' - a product now supplied by most major
telecommunications companies across the globe. In the UK, major
operators such as BT, Mercury and Energis all offer card-based services
operating alongside other international players such as AT&T, MCI and
Sprint. The card's basic function is to allow a call to be placed, from
virtually any telephone, and charged to the account holder for that
card - ie a no-cash call. Billing may be to the user or, in a corporate
environment, to a cost-centre manager responsible for the telecoms
spending of a team of people. There are a number of flexible billing
options available which vary by supplier.

Calling cards offer a good means of cost control over telecoms spending
when users are away from home or office. Increasingly, such products
are being combined with payment cards as value-add features, American
Express being a good example. This evolution is sure to continue,
reducing the amount of plastic in the pocket and enhancing existing
card services. But increased usage means increased risk.

No flights of fancy

Picture this: you are on business in New York and about to catch a
flight to Los Angeles from JFK International Airport, when a delay of
two hours is announced because of bad weather. You decide to call the
person you are meeting to advise of your delay and find a suite of
payphones nearby from which to call. From your pocket, you pull out
your calling card and lift the telephone handset. As you do so, you are
aware of someone just behind and to the side of you, apparently waiting
to use the phone. You dial the free access number which connects you to
the automated operator of the service you use. Following a prompt, you
enter the card number, reading from the card in your hand. Following
another prompt, you enter your secret PIN followed by the telephone
number you are calling. As you enter these last digits, you notice that
the person behind you moves off to use a telephone just a little down
the line. 'Hello Jim, it's Phil here - just calling to say I'll be a
little late ...' As you end your call and move back towards the coffee
shop, you see the person who was behind you with a group of others, all
busily scribbling away in a huddle.

Three weeks later, back in London, your telecoms manager calls you and
asks why your calling card bill is so large. 'Nonsense, I only used it
a dozen or so times to call home and for business'. But on inspection,
you find the normal #200 bill has risen to #10,000. Calls to Mexico,
Columbia, Europe, the Far East and other destinations you know nothing
of. Even more surprisingly, calls were made from other countries while
you (and your card) were in the United States.

Another victim of 'shoulder-surfing'

The person behind you when you made that call at JFK was noting your
card and PIN details. When he went to another payphone, he called his
colleague in Amsterdam to test the card and pass on the numbers. Your
card details were then put onto the Internet as part of a well-
organised distribution network. What do they get out of it? A few
dollars per card number, free calls, and a few more dollars when they
sell the numbers to others waiting around the payphones to make calls
or obtain card numbers themselves.

This is one of the less sophisticated methods of obtaining card
details. High-powered binoculars, video equipment and sound-recording
devices (useful when speaking your numbers to a human operator) have
all been used in similar environments.

Similarly, there are risks when using calling cards from hotels or
other businesses that use call-logging equipment. Card numbers may be
captured in soft or hard copy for reference by prying eyes. Calling
cards might also be used for data transmission from portable PC
equipment, in which case card details may be stored within. And what of
that 'last number redial' button on the telephone you have just used?

It is fortunate, however, that the UK has to date suffered relatively
little from this type of fraud. The US remains the telecoms fraud
capital of the world, but trends in other countries are definitely on
the up. It makes sense, therefore, to take care when using a calling
card anywhere in the world, not just the US.

Shopping around for security

Most telecoms providers are aware of the risks involved with calling-
card products. As such, most have developed a degree of fraud
prevention and detection within the product configuration, operation
and call monitoring. Security features vary widely from operator to
operator and so it is worth exploring these with their agent during the
sales process. It is also worth establishing who would be responsible
for the bill should you be hit by fraud. On the whole, service
suppliers in the UK are reasonably good at fraud detection and should
be able to contact you if fraud is suspected.

The following checklist will help reduce the fraud risk. Take the time
to deliver these messages to appropriate personnel within your
organisation; users, telecoms managers and those responsible for paying
the bills. It could help reduce the trauma, wasted time and possible
expense of a fraud incident.

PIN security

- Once you have memorised the PIN, destroy the original PIN
notification.

- Avoid writing your PIN down. If you have to, note it so that it could
not be identified as a PIN.

- Never write the PIN on the calling card or anywhere that might be
associated with the card eg on any related literature.

- Do not disclose your card number or PIN to anyone except the calling
card operator when you need to make a call. You will never be contacted
and asked for your PIN (or password if one is used) by the service
supplier.

- If you think that someone might have noted your card and PIN numbers,
contact the service supplier to change them immediately.

- Avoid PINs (or passwords) that would be easy to guess - those running
sequentially (1234, 9876 etc) or with repeated digits (1111 etc). Also
avoid obvious keypad sequences like 1397 (clockwise) or 2580 (down the
middle), and your year of birth.

Card security

- Never leave your calling card lying around. Treat it as you would a
credit card.

- If your card is lost or stolen, report it immediately to the service
supplier - and always carry the supplier's emergency phone number.

- To prevent others noting your card number, never use your card as a
proof of identity.

Usage precautions

- Take appropriate precautions when using your card to avoid anyone
seeing the digits you dial (if using direct-dial via tone telephones)
or overhearing the numbers you speak (if calling via the operator).
Shielding the keypad from prying eyes will help significantly. When
passing your card details to the operator, make sure nobody is
eavesdropping. It is perhaps worth cupping your hand over the telephone
mouthpiece.

- If using telephones that display the digits you enter, ensure that
the numbers are not visible to others and that they are cleared after
use. Numbers can be cleared by lifting the telephone handset after your
calls are complete and entering a random digit. This will also help
avoid problems with the last number redial function available on many
telephones.

- Some hotels or organisations use call-logging equipment to help
manage or account for their telephone usage. These could record your
calling card details which may then be visible to others. This only
happens if you direct-dial calls using a tone telephone connected to
the logger. This risk can be avoided by making calls via the calling
card operator or using a telephone not connected to the logger.

- If using your card to make calls from a computer (eg data
transmissions), ensure that your computer is protected against
unauthorised access - your card details may be visible within the
system. If possible, do not enter your PIN as a default setting - enter
it manually for each call made.

- Never loan your card unless you are prepared to pay for the calls
made (which may be a lot more than the ones you know of).

HOW FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS FACE GREATER LIABILITY EXPOSURE

Roger Parker, partner in the Commercial Litigation department of City
solicitors Richards Butler, considers accountants' increasing liability
exposure - and offers some remedies.

The Fraud Report has referred in recent editions to surveys suggesting
that fraud is on the increase - or at least that detection rates are.
The number of situations where forensic accountants are called in to
assist companies results in greater liability exposure for the
accountant - albeit with greater fee income as well.

This article summarises the basis of such liability exposure and
highlights certain practices which have led to a degree of concern
about risk-management techniques deployed by accountants. On the basis
that any litigation is symptomatic of a breakdown in communication this
should interest companies as well as accountants.

Common threads

A number of claims, across the professions, have common features:

- Complexity. The more complex the case the more for the development of
problems, be they caused by lack of appropriate communication,
expertise, diligence or resource.

- Late instruction. The forensic accountant will often be instructed
after a fraud has been committed. What is less understandable is if
there is an instruction given unnecessarily late, as happens from time
to time. If there is belated instruction in pressurised circumstances a
proper investigation is less likely to result.

- Fiscal control. Proper financial control of any consultant is
essential, but the thin line between budgetary control and imprudent
management should not be crossed.

- Access to the client. For a company this tends to be less of a
problem because of the proximity of the in-house lawyer to client. It
can be more of a problem where the client is further removed - for
example when the accountant is instructed by a solicitor. It is for the
accountant to ensure that he has all proper and necessary access to lay
clients and to those who may have direct access to material
information.

- Trends. Increasingly, disgruntled clients are 'having a go' at
professionals, sometimes because of their own deep pockets, sometimes
because of their insurers. Also, it is increasingly common for the
dissatisfied to seek to apportion responsibility. Somebody 'must' be to
blame - a human reaction that many (particularly US) courts have over-
indulged.

Sorting out communication

One of the fundamental principles of English and US contract law is the
rule that vague wording in a contract will generally be construed
against the writer (contra proferentem). Not surprisingly therefore,
professional liability cases in both jurisdictions have tended to give
clients the benefit of the doubt when liability is based on
misunderstanding. It is incumbent on the professional proactively to
seek out areas where clients may not have sufficient understanding.
This issue is the biggest single source of claims and is therefore
regularly of concern to professional firms. It is increasingly
important in complex fraud cases because:

- Investigations can be labour intensive involving many hours. Hours
are money. The client will not necessarily be well-placed to assess the
volume of hours or the complexity of the task. That is why he or she
instructs the accountant.

- Explanation of the substance of the problem can be complex and
results may only come toward the end of an investigation. This means
the patience of the client may be sorely tested as hours are spent and
fees incurred with no result until completion. It can be harder in
fraud cases for clients to know whether their decision to invest is
worthwhile. It may be even harder to explain to the client's commercial
management.

Contracts as reference points

Claims will sometimes be based on a retainer letter. The latter is
under-utilised. A perfectly adequate contract between client and
professional on a major instruction can be contained within a couple of
pages. It should be the reference point for identifying responsibility
for the purposes of both contract and negligence. Very few of the major
English legal authorities revolve around the retainer letter because
not enough attention has been given to defining the scope of services
that should be contained in it. More time has been spent in drafting
limitation clauses or costs schedules. There are important matters, but
there need not be an exclusion of the scope. This may seem a bit basic,
but how often have you seen a professional spell out precisely what he
or she is doing? What sources will the accountant be checking for signs
of malpractice? When will the accountant cease to follow a line of
enquiry? What if that line would have produced the answer?

The absence of at least a basic pointer to the scope of work is
inconsistent with the practice adopted by a number of other
professionals. Part of the historical reason for this is linked to the
absence of fixed fee in certain investigatory work. A fixed fee tends
to lead to a fixed definition of what is to be done with the
flexibility of additional services being provided upon request - for an
additional cost. An open-ended and potentially vague assignment is more
likely to lead to a vague brief. It is not suggested that vagueness can
be eliminated, but focus on the 'greyer' areas at least enables a more
accurate assessment of where the parties' risk exposure is.

Resisting negligence

It is clear from recent leading authority in England that if the
professional escapes liability in contract he or she may not
necessarily be so lucky in resisting a claim in negligence. To limit
the danger there should be, possibly to the advantage of both parties
to the arrangement, synonimity between contractual and tortuous
obligations. This can be done simply, by a statement to the effect that
the parties do not agree to there being any tortuous liability over and
above their contractual responsibilities as defined. What many will see
as unacceptable on policy grounds is the possibility of spending time
and money negotiating a retainer letter/contract only to find that some
other, judicially imposed, criteria determines responsibility.

Conclusion

It is easy with hindsight to apportion blame for conduct. It is not so
easy to think positively how to implement procedures to reduce the risk
of dispute. Perhaps predictably, one answer is to do with training, in
the basics - communication skills, drafting and straight thinking of
what each party to the arrangement is expecting to achieve and how they
are going to achieve it.

ADVANCE FEE AND PBI FRAUD - ALWAYS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE

Advance fee and PBI fraud continues to be a dramatically successful
form of fraud, despite warnings issued in recent years by bodies such
as the Bank of England, the Law Society and the Federal Reserve. Andrew
Keltie, a partner in Baker & McKenzie, London and a member of Baker &
McKenzie's Civil Fraud Group, reports.

With hindsight, advance fee and prime bank instrument (PBI) frauds seem
so obviously dishonest that it is hard to understand how anyone could
be deceived. But the combination of ostensibly authentic documentation,
and the skillful use of psychology, has led to many sophisticated
business people being defrauded of substantial sums. A recent example
is the loss (and subsequent recovery) of more than #6m by the Salvation
Army in 1992. In May 1992 the Army had been persuaded to pay $10m to a
Belgian bank for investment in 'prime bank instruments' which the
Salvation Army was duped into believing could be bought as a discount
and sold at a profit. In fact, PBIs do not exist and there is no market
in them, other than that conjured up by plausible fraudsters.

Advance fee fraud

This involves tricking the victim into believing that participating in
a transaction (the participation being dependent on payment of an
advance fee or 'commission') will give access to a low-interest or
interest-free loan, or the receipt of some other financial benefit. The
advance fee is usually a small percentage of the finance apparently
being provided. It may be suggested that the source of the finance is
'oil money', or that the funding is by means of a 'self-liquidating
loan'. Fraudsters will go to considerable lengths to compile a dossier
of correspondence and legalistic documents, purportedly authenticating
the availability of the funds and the credentials of the participants.
This will often involve the use of headed notepaper obtained from
banks, accountants and firms of solicitors. The growth (and increasing
acceptability) of fax documents means that genuine letterheads can be
used to create bogus documents which are difficult to detect if sent by
fax.

Once the victim is persuaded of the genuine nature of the transaction,
and the availability of low-cost or free finance, the next stage is
payment of the advance fee, often expressed to be the agent's
commission, the victim having been convinced that payment is the final
stage in obtaining the promised funds. In most cases as soon as it is
paid the fee will disappear along with the fraudster.

Prime bank instrument fraud

Advance fee fraud is still committed but its more sophisticated
exponents have moved on to PBI fraud, which rests on the use of bogus
financial instruments as being the source of the alleged loan or
profit.

PBI fraud is based on the mythical existence of a secret market in
which the world's largest ('prime') banks deal with each other, reaping
huge profits. The victim is enticed with a promise that he can share in
those profits, for a modest investment. PBIs are usually referred to as
'prime bank guarantees', 'prime bank promissory notes (or paper)',
'master collateral commitments' or 'discounted standby letters of
credit'.

The story is that the 'prime' banks lend huge sums to each other all
the time, and that there is a market in PBIs which the victim will be
able to tap into via a smaller bank at which the fraudster has a
contact. Unsurprisingly, the smaller bank will often appear to be
incorporated in Panama or Liechtenstein, and will rarely be found in
any banker's almanac or directory.

Although standby letters of credit do exist and are issued by banks,
they are a form of collateral security or performance bond. They are
not negotiable and there is no market in them. Prime bank guarantees,
prime bank notes and the like do not exist.

A veneer of respectability

Both advance fee and PBI frauds are invariably dressed up with a
variety of complicated legalistic (but incomprehensible) documentation,
all of which the victim is solemnly asked to read carefully and sign.
These usually include a confidentiality agreement and a 'certificate of
origin of funds', confirming that the victim's investment is of 'good,
clean funds of non-criminal origin'.

Another key feature is secrecy. It is frequently claimed that the
source of finance in advance fee fraud is the Middle East, because of
religious restrictions on earning interest on loans; or that disclosure
of the covert market in PBIs would lead to the market breaking down,
because it would no longer be confined to the elite few. The real
purpose of such secrecy is, of course, to prevent or dissuade the
victim from carrying out any form of due diligence and to explain why
the victim cannot meet the lender. It can also make action to attempt
to recover lost funds far more difficult.

Other devices used to reassure a victim include:

- returning a portion of the fee at the end of a week or month,
representing it as a form of profit, the aim being to persuade the
victim that the investment is profitable, and to commit more funds

- spurious references to organisations such as the World Bank, the
United Nations, and the International Chamber of Commerce

- the apparent involvement of professionals, particularly lawyers'
client or trust accounts

- supposed absolute security.

It is often said that transactions are on a 'bank-to-bank' basis and
the investment is as secure as the bank itself. As in the Salvation
Army case, a common device is to persuade the investor to open an
account at a foreign bank into which the profits to be earned from the
transaction will be paid. Before receiving any profit, however, the
investor must pay sufficient funds into the account to show that he is
in a position to participate in the investment - a so-called 'proof of
funds' transaction. Although the account will purportedly be interest-
bearing and under the control of the investor, fraudsters will ensure
that they have signing powers over the account to enable the funds to
be removed and normally routed quickly through several other
jurisdictions to make tracing and recovery more difficult.

Providing powerful remedies

The English courts are able to provide powerful assistance to victims,
such as orders which freeze asset and permit the search of premises,
the seizure of incriminating evidence, and the disclosure of
information (and in many cases a combination of all of these elements).
In addition, such frauds will invariably involve criminal offences and
the police in England and elsewhere now have considerable experience in
investigating these frauds, although the international nature of most
of them can cause difficulties for the police in piecing together
exactly what has happened.

Awareness heightened

Increasing awareness of advance fee and PBI frauds, particularly among
professionals responding to warnings from their professional or
regulatory bodies, has helped to reduce some of the most blatant
examples. Another improvement has been the introduction of anti-money
laundering legislation in many countries. However, it remains the case
that it is possible in some jurisdictions for corporations to be
established and call themselves banks. And the ingenuity and
imagination of sophisticated fraudsters has responded to the increasing
challenges posed to them by growing awareness and more rigorous
legislation. This type of fraud is still a real problem which continues
to claim victims.

CURRENCY SCAM INVESTIGATORS WITH A YEN FOR KNOWLEDGE

Farleigh Projects International, part of Group 4, specialises in
investigating complex, organised fraud for clients which include large
corporates and Government organisations. Managing director John Davis
and manager of investigations, Tony Ockmore - both former policemen -
talk to Peter Williams about Farleigh's role in investigating the
dollar-yen swap scam.

International fraudsters have netted at least $250m and maybe as much
as $500m over the last four or five years in the dollar-yen scam. The
victims of the fraud are rich individuals some of whom allegedly
obtained their millions in the first place through tax-evasion schemes.

The fraudster persuaded wealthy individuals to give them this 'black
money' on the promise that it would produce fantastic results and would
be 'white money'. Farleigh knows of one individual who invested $25m in
one tranche.

The fraud is simple: investors are told that their dollars will be sold
for Japanese yen and then sold back again. The promised return on this
arbitrage was fantastic - from $4m to $8m over a four-week rolling
period.

The documentation produced by the fraudsters was of a very high
standard and the names of banks and brokers used for the transactions
were reputable and legitimate. But there was no dollar-yen swap
programme - the money was simply stolen.

Dubious provenance protected fraudster

The fraudsters reckoned that many of the investors would not kick up
too much of a fuss because of the dubious nature of the origins of
their cash. Those that did protest were either given a first tranche of
a dividend or interest payment - stolen from other investors - or shown
a false statement of the profits to date. Others were dealt with more
simply - they were threatened.

Farleigh Projects now believes that this scam has been closed down, but
John Davis believes it has some important lessons for prosecuting
authorities, regulators and financial institutions. Farleigh became
involved when it was hired to trace funds and people by an Austrian
bank which was being sued by some of those defrauded. One of its
managers was corrupted by the fraudsters and over a number of years had
provided them with the banking and money transmission facilities they
needed.

This international scam started in the bank guarantee fraud in the late
1980s and moved into the dollar-yen programme as a sort of natural
progression in the early 1990s. The heat was put on the bank guarantee
fraud and they had to find a new outlet. They saw this as the perfect
follow on and in many ways they were right. The fraudsters got away
with so much for so long because different regulators and different
prosecuting authorities simply do not talk to or cooperate with each
other. Farleigh has managed to get authorities across Europe to talk to
each other, acting as a clearing house for information. It even had to
persuade three state prosecutors in different parts of Germany to pool
their knowledge.

Farleigh also believes the fraud has shown up weaknesses in UK
legislation. Money which is invested on the currency market or on other
spot markets is not regulated by the Financial Services Act. The
Securities and Investments Board is studying whether the FSA should be
extended to cover these activities.

Banks could do more

Some observers privately believe that criticism could also be levelled
at banks which still seem to welcome accounts which receive vast sums
of money from peculiar sources without asking too many questions,
although the banks would claim they have now tightened up considerably
following the introduction of money laundering regulations.

The other element that has made the fraud difficult to track down was
the way in which it was organised. Although Farleigh believes it knows
the prime mover in the fraud it was never masterminded in one place.
Instead different pockets of copy-cat frauds sprang up all over the
world - three operated separately out of Germany through Austria into
the UK, and others were based in Australia, Spain, France, Sweden and
Switzerland. Farleigh proved that they were connected because they have
traced at least one money flow between the various different
operations. Davis said: 'It is probably the most organised and biggest
fraud that I have ever come across in my life. The way it split itself
up has caused the police and the prosecutors major problems.'

Although not all of the alleged fraudsters involved are facing trial,
one person has already been sentenced to seven years by a German court,
two people are due to appear in court in the UK later this year, and
several other people have been charged in Germany and Austria - one of
whom committed suicide while in police custody.

THE FRAUD REPORT STATISTICS PAGE

The analysis of fraud in Government departments places frauds into
various categories - but in reality details are often complicated and
may cross boundaries, as this month's statistics show.

As in the previous two years, the largest category of frauds reported
in 1994-95 is travel and subsistence. These 105 cases represented for
over a quarter in volume but only 6% in value.

The second largest category involves theft of assets such as office
equipment, protective clothing and building materials. The number of
cases represent 15% of the total, while the value of the assets
represent a quarter of the total monetary loss. One case accounted for
#400,000. It involved the alleged theft of equipment due for sale or
disposal, by a staff member who is suspected of exploiting weaknesses
in receipt and stock control procedures. Collusion with outside
accomplices is suspected and investigations are continuing.

Misappropriation of cash came to #832,500, 39% of the total value of
frauds in the year. Two cases accounted for over half the loss in this
category. Enquiries are continuing in one case - value #298,000 - where
a new member of staff noticed irregularities in the accounts. The
suspect was arrested following a suspected arson attack on the office
containing the records in question. Cash books and other records were
allegedly found in the suspect's possession. A prosecution is pending.

In one case the actual loss to the public funds is estimated at
#41,000, whereas the gain to the perpetrators is believed to be between
#600,000 and #700,000. Over a number of years an embassy official
allegedly exploited currency exchange rates by manipulating the
difference between the local official market exchange rate and the
unofficial, parallel market rate, retaining the difference. The fraud
was carried out in collusion with a locally engaged accountant and the
officers are believed to have falsified embassy accounts by recording
only the lower, official exchange rate. The official is also alleged to
have been responsible for rigging local building contracts. He was due
to be charged with theft, deception and corruption but committed
suicide while on police bail.

The Treasury has warned departments to increase controls of access to
personal and sensitive data held on computer. It reports that
unauthorised staff access is on the increase.

Overall, in 38% of the cases, perpetrators were prosecuted, or were
awaiting prosecution or had been dismissed without prosecution. In a
further 22% of cases, the perpetrators were subject to internal
disciplinary action ranging from a reduction in grade through to a
formal reprimand. The lesser penalties were applied in cases such as
misuse of sick leave, official vehicle or telephones for personal
calls.

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FRAUDSTERS?

The Government says that it takes all cases of fraud very seriously.
Set out below is what actually happened to perpetrators of fraud in
1994-95.

BY DEFINITION, A BIG PROBLEM

The rules concerning Government accounting requires departments to make
an annual return to the Treasury of all cases of suspected or proven
fraud - including attempted fraud - affecting their departments
including their agencies, within the following categories:

- Fraud perpetrated within the department by its own staff, including
the theft of assets and cases of collusion outside the department.

- Computer frauds, whether perpetrated by members of staff or members
of the public. A computer fraud is defined as one where IT equipment
has been used to manipulate computer programs or data dishonestly (for
example to alter or substitute records; to destroy or suppress records;
or to duplicate or create spurious records); or where the existence of
an IT system was a material factor in the perpetration of fraud (ie
where the fraud was unlikely to have occurred there had been no IT
system.) Departments are also asked to report any cases involving the
theft or fraudulent use of computer time and resources.

- Frauds by contractors arising in connection with contracts placed by
departments for the supply of goods and services.

- Any other frauds which reveal potentially significant system
weaknesses or exposures to loss of a nature which other departments
might face.

Data is not collected on external frauds perpetrated upon departments
by outside parties, such as tax or benefit frauds or those involving
grants or subsidies. Nor does the report include frauds occurring in
non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). Frauds in NDPBs are reported to
their sponsoring body rather than to the Treasury.

THREADNEEDLE SET FOR MAJOR EXPANSION OF OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT EUROPE

THREADNEEDLE Asset Management, the fund management subsidiary of BAT
Industries, is gearing up for a major expansion of its European
activities in 1996 and 1997. It is revamping its existing product
range, expanding its distribution network and embarking on a major
recruitment campaign that will result in the appointment of 20 business
development, client relationship and marketing executives to supplement
its existing Luxembourg operation.

At present Threadneedle's European activities are based primarily
around the Global Assets Fund (GAF), a Luxembourg-domiciled Sicav with
$500 million invested in 20 subfunds. This is distributed in Belgium,
the Netherlands and the UK, although a small amount of business also
comes from Germany.

The European venture is the first significant business outcome
following BAT's decision to consolidate the fund management operations
of Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, its two life, pensions and investment
products subsidiaries, into a separate company in June 1994.
Threadneedle currently has around #30 billion ($45 billion) of assets
under management.

The European thrust will initially be based around a revamped GAF,
which was originally offered under the Eagle Star name. "We are
relaunching GAF in Belgium and the Netherlands during March 1996," said
Alan J Ainsworth, Threadneedle's managing director (retail). "The
relaunch will incorporate a number of significant changes. We shall
also be offering Belgian investors a new guaranteed equity Sicav."

Threadneedle currently distributes GAF through two Belgian banks,
Banque Commerciale Bruxelles and Bank Unie. It has recently signed a
third - and as yet unnamed - bank distributor. In the Netherlands it
relies primarily on independent brokers for distribution, a distinction
which will be reflected in a new pricing structure for the relaunched
umbrella fund. IFAs, together with Eagle Star, have also been used in
the UK to market the fund, although Threadneedle hopes to focus
increasingly on direct media.

The German market will be targeted later in 1996. "We have a major new
product initiative for the German market," said Ainsworth. As in the
Netherlands, Threadneedle currently relies on IFAs to distribute GAF.

Other markets earmarked for development are Spain - where Threadneedle
hopes to capitalise on its links with SAFEL, a Spanish retail
investment group in which BAT owns part of the equity - and France.

The new initiative is certainly well-timed. Global stockmarkets have
been extremely buoyant during the first few weeks of 1996, and the
omens for the rest of the year are propitious. The prospect of further
drops in interest rates and greater liquidity are expected to power
markets upwards, and this should help boost demand for the product.

In addition the relaunch is likely to benefit from the momentum
achieved during 1995. "Last year we grew the Global Assets Fund by
around $100 million," said Ainsworth."We also added three new
portfolios: a Latin American fund, a Japanese smaller companies fund
and a global bond fund."

Threadneedle has already made a number of key appointments to support
its European initiative. Robin Threadgold, previously at Fidelity, has
been made head of European Business. Tina Wilkinson joined the company
in January from Gartmore Indosuez in Paris to head European Marketing.
Another major appointment is expected in the next few weeks.

UK FUND MANAGERS CHASE RETAIL INVESTORS

THE PERIOD between January 1 and April 5, the end of the fiscal year,
is open season for new - or revamped - mutual fund product launches, as
fund managers attempt to take full advantage of the opportunities
presented by the UK's Personal Equity Plan (PEP) legislation.

This enables investors each fiscal year to shelter up to #6,000
($10,000) worth of equity and qualifying mutual fund investments from
the taxman in a "general PEP", plus an additional #3,000 in a"single
company" PEP.

This year investment companies have an additional incentive to increase
their marketing efforts. During January and February an estimated #12
billion of household savings will be seeking a new home as the first
Tax Exempt Special Savings Plans (TESSAs) mature. With interest rates
falling and the UK stockmarket generating total returns of around 20
percent in 1995, compared to around 6 percent on bank deposits, mutual
funds should be well placed to increase their share of the savings
market.

So far there has been no shortage of new product announcements. Two of
the largest players in the UK market - Perpetual and M&G - have
announced their intention of launching two new low-cost investment
trusts aimed firmly at the PEP market.

M&G is launching M&G Equity Investment Trust, a split capital
investment trust offering a number of classes of share, in February. A
unique feature of this trust is that it will be completely load free,
although at 1.25 percent the annual management fee is rather high and
this, on normal criteria, would pre-empt its sale to the non-PEP
investor.

On February 20, Perpetual will launch Perpetual Income and Growth
Investment Trust plc. Managed by Neil Woodford, whose other funds have
enjoyed outstanding performance, the trust has a lower annual
management fee (0.75 percent per annum) than M&G but imposes a 0.5
percent plus VAT charge for the PEP wrapper.

Low costs are clearly seen as an important marketing tool by many
companies. Fidelity has launched a range of four no-load funds,
including an index tracker, clearly aimed at the PEP market.

The Fidelity MoneyBuilder Index carries an annual management fee of 0.5
percent, which briefly was second to only River & Mercantile in the
low-cost tracker fund stakes. One of its rivals, Legal & General,
retaliated immediately by reducing the fees on its UK tracker to
exactly the same level.

Among other companies who have announced new product launches to cash

PRIVATISATION SHARES INDEX PUBLISHED

NM ROTHSCHILD, a UK-based investment bank, and Privatisation
International, a specialist magazine, have launched a new Global Index
of Privatisation shares. This will enable investors to track in a
systematic way the performance of privatised companies on stock markets
around the world.

The index encapsulates around 175 different shares, and includes most
of the large privatisations initiated by way of initial public offer
since 1980. Denominated in US dollars and weighted by market
capitalisation, it will be added to as new privatisations occur.

Calculated back to 1990, the index shows that over the medium term
privatisation shares have significantly out-performed markets
generally.

Total privatisations in 1995 amounted to $73.2 billion, a record
according to Privatisation International, with at least 45 countries
engaged in active privatisation programmes. Total proceeds were about
15 percent higher than in 1994 and were split equally between public
offers and private sales to strategic investors.

ALL CHANGE AT M&G, PRUDENTIAL AND SCHRODERS

A NUMBER of prominent figures within the UK fund management sector have
either resigned their positions, retired or announced their impending
retirement during late December and January.

At M&G, there have been two significant departures. Tony Shearer, the
company's chief operating officer, resigned following "personality
clashes" with the managing director David Morgan. The failure to
consummate a joint venture with Hong Kong-based Dah Sing would appear
to have sealed A J Oddie's fate. His post of business development
officer has been phased out, so precipitating his departure from the
company.

With events at Dunedin still fresh in the memory there is inevitable
speculation that these departures might be followed by others. There is
also mounting concern that these departures could be symptomatic of
more wide-ranging problems at the company, which pioneered unit trusts
in the UK and is the largest provider of general PEPs.

Critics have pointed to the sharp fall-off in the company's investment
performance. There is concern that M&G is increasingly being driven by
marketing as opposed to performance criteria.

These claims are countered by assertions that recent market conditions
have not been conducive to the company's investment style, which is
value-driven and focuses on small-to-medium-sized companies. Taken on a
medium-term view M&G's is still above trend.

Prudential Portfolio Managers (PPM) is searching for a new chief
executive following the departure of Hugh Jenkins, who retired on new
year's eve. Prudential, with more than #75 billion ($110 billion) of
assets under management, is one of the largest UK fund managers.

Rodney Dennis, who currently manages PPM's UK and European operations
and chairs the company's asset allocation committee, will assume
control until a successor is found.

It could be some time before a new appointment is made."We will take
whatever time is needed to ensure that the right candidate is selected
for what is a vitally important job within the group," said a
Prudential spokesman.

Schroder's long-serving Ed Mercer, one of the pioneers of investment in
Japan, is seeking pastures new at Atlantis Investment Managers. Mercer,
who managed Schroder's Japan Smaller Companies and Japan Growth
Investment Trust, is succeeded by Andrew Ross.

WHO WILL BE NEXT IN THE UK FUND MANAGEMENT AUCTION?

There was no shortage of M&A activity in UK fund management in 1995.
Given the speculation and rumours surrounding the sector, the new year
could generate substantial further activity

THE MOST intriguing - and longest running - saga in the UK fund
management industry concerns the future of Hill Samuel following the
merger of its parent TSB Group with Lloyds Bank, which became effective
on December 28.

The long-term future of Hill Samuel, a UK-based merchant banking and
asset management group, has been a subject of debate ever since it was
acquired by TSB shortly before the stockmarket crash of 1987.

Encouraged by its new owners, Hill Samuel went on a commercial
property-lending binge at the time the market broke. Bad debts were so
large that in 1992, TSB had to establish a special loans administration
unit to manage them. More significantly, Hill Samuel's debts
compromised the profitability of TSB Group during the early 1990s.

Hill Samuel, however, has important and profitable fund management
interests. Hill Samuel Asset Management and Financial Services
currently claims to manage #28 billion ($42 billion) from its London
offices and a further #10 billion in the US, where it has two
subsidiaries. It also trying to expand in the far east. Fund management
activities contributed #21 million to group profits in 1994.

These interests dwarf Lloyds's asset management activities. Lloyds
Investment Managers, the bank's main asset management vehicle, only has
around #12 billion of funds under management.

Given the emphasis which Lloyds chief executive Sir Brian Pitman is
allegedly placing on the sale of investment products within the bank,
as well as improving earnings quality generally, both units should have
a future within the enlarged group, although it is not beyond the
bounds of possibility that the merchant banking interests will be sold
off. To all intents and purposes, Lloyds has exited from this sector of
the banking market.

Some commentators are not convinced, however. A former fund manager was
very critical about Lloyds's stewardship of Lloyds Investment Managers.
"Lloyds Investment Managers was very profitable. It had to be to remain
in the Lloyds Group," he told FI. "We were set a target ROE of 20
percent which was only achieved by squeezing costs and investment. Our
performance definitely suffered as a consequence."

For the moment both investment groups will operate as separate
entities, as will the other components of the TSB-Lloyds merger.
"Everything is in the melting pot. No decisions have yet been made
concerning the future and structure of the group," said a Lloyds
spokesman. A Hill Samuel spokesman was more cryptic. "We are constantly
getting enquiries about our future from the media. We just don't know."

At the moment all options would appear to be open. The two fund
management groups could be combined to create a large integrated group.
Alternatively, one of the units could be sold off. Given the length of
time taken to dispose of John Govett (see FI 14) and uncertainties over
the sale of Gartmore, the market for UK-based asset managers may no
longer be quite so buoyant.

In the mean time, Hill Samuel Asset Management's chief executive
Richard Bernays has decided to leave the company. He is joining Jupiter
Tyndall where he will replace Leonard Licht as vice chairman, following
the latter's retirement. Jupiter Tyndall was acquired by Commerzbank in
1995.

Bernays will be replaced by Peter Axten. Axten, who is a former Hill
Samuel employee, is currently chief executive of LIM. For the moment,
at least, it looks as if the merger option is being taken but, as
usual, time will tell.

Meanwhile there has been little progress made in resolving the future
of Gartmore, following Banque Indosuez's decision to sell its 75
percent stake in the company. The bank released a statement in January
to confirm that the sale would still go ahead and that a number of
parties were still interested in acquiring the shares. There had been
speculation that the sale could have been called off following
personnel changes at Indosuez.

It is understood, however, that a number of potential purchasers, such
as BAT, NatWest and Prudential, are no longer interested in the company
which is valued at around #370 million. Bankgesellschaft from Berlin
and NationsBank from the US are apparently still interested.
NationsBank already has what is essentially a call option on part of
Gartmore's equity.

Following the fall-out at Dunedin Fund Managers (see FI 12 and 13) Bank
of Scotland, the company's majority shareholder, is rumoured to be
ready to put its stake onto the market. An announcement is expected
shortly. Before the management defections, Dunedin was thought to be
worth around #100 million.

As usual there is no shortage of potential purchasers. All the large UK
fund managers are thought to be interested in the company. In practice,
however, it may be difficult to bring the shares to market. Despite
Standard Life owning a significant proportion of the minority shares,
as well as 34 percent of the Bank of Scotland, the investment trusts
managed by Dunedin also retain significant holdings. This could yet
constitute an effective poisonous pill.

One acquisition which has been completed was the purchase of CIN
Management (CINMan) by Friends Provident, a UK mutual life company. The
purchase will make Friends Provident the tenth-largest UK fund manager,
with total funds under management of #32 billion.

"The acquisition will take Friends Provident quantum leaps forward to
its long-term goal of becoming one of the small band of financial
services companies which will dominate the sector in the new
millennium," said its chief executive Michael Doerr.

CINMan's main business focus is the management of the UK coal
industry's pension schemes. The sale of the company to a private
institution was almost a logical consequence of the UK government's
decision to privatise the coal sector. CINMan currently has around #17
billion under management.

AGROBANKA TO BUY CREDITANSTALT INVESTMENT

AUSTRIAN bank Creditanstalt is to sell Creditanstalt Investment, its
Prague-based fund management business, to Agrobanka, a privately-owned
Czech bank.

Agrobanka has also made an offer to acquire Creditanstalt Czech
Investment Fund (CCIF), one of the two funds which Creditanstalt
established in the wake of the Czech privatisation programmes.
Agrobanka is making an offer of CK780 ($25) per share to CCIF's foreign
shareholders, which own around 14 percent of the fund.

Agrobanka's initiative is the latest in a series of changes in the
Czech fund management sector which has seen local banks assume a much
greater role. (See next month's FI for a full analysis.)

FRENCH TAX CHANGES

IN CONTRAST to other European markets, where governments are trying to
encourage long-term savings, the French government is attempting to
reverse the process. Capital gains realised throughout 1996 on the sale
of Sicav monetaires - or money market funds - will be exempted from
inclusion in newly introduced tax allowances, provided the proceeds are
invested in residential property.

Until the end of June capital gains will also be exempt from tax,
provided that a minimum of Fr3,000 ($600) of the proceeds is spent on
household appliances and electrical goods. Penalty and tax regimes on
other forms of long-term saving are also being changed to encourage
greater spending.

These measures reflect the attempts being made by the government to
reboot an ailing economy through boosting consumer spending. With
confidence low about future prospects, consumers have been reluctant to
spend. Whether the strategy works - much less results in an increase in
expenditure on French manufactured goods - remains to be seen.

TAX EXEMPTION EXTENDED

FOLLOWING an amendment to the Companies Act 1990, the range of tax
exempt investment vehicles has been extended to cover closed-end
investment companies. Although closed-end unit trusts have been
available within Dublin's International Financial Services Centre
(IFSC) since 1992, the closed-ended investment company permits for the
first time the establishment in a corporate form of certain types of
funds that are generally unsuitable for open-ended vehicles.

ITALY:  MUTUAL FUND MARKET

THE MUTUAL fund sector experienced a net inflow of funds in December
1995, according to Assogestioni, an industry trade association. This
reversed a year-long trend of net outflows.

Commentators claim that this marks a change in investor sentiment. The
prospect of falling interest rates, the recognition of real value in
the stockmarket, and the hope that things cannot get any worse are all
generating greater optimism about prospects for the new year.

At year-end, despite the launch of 103 new funds, the value of funds
under management in mutual funds was 3 percent below the figure for
December 1994. Overall, the 457 mutual funds operating within the
country closed the year with L124 billion under management.

ROBECO 1995 RESULTS

ROBECO Group benefited from a more benign market environment during
1995 to increase assets under management from $39.5 billion to $46.4
billion.

Bond markets around the world recovered from the falls sustained in
1994. This was reflected in the performance of the group's bond and
fixed-income funds, which all achieved solid gains. Rorento, the
group's tax-exempt global bond fund, achieved the best return - its
share price rising by 23.1 percent. Overall, Robeco's bond funds had
total assets under management of $11.5 billion.

Although equity market behaviour was less consistent, the Netherlands
market performed strongly, and this was reflected in the performance of
the group's equity funds. RG Hollands Bezit turned in a pre-tax
(dollar) return of 25.2 percent. Robeco and Rolinco, the group's
flagship funds, which invest on a global basis, generated total returns
of 15.7 percent and 17.3 percent respectively.

Regional funds, however, especially those with an emerging market
slant, performed poorly. Equity funds accounted for $11.2 billion of
funds under management.

RUSSIA:  BARINGS OPTIMISTIC

THE SUCCESS achieved by the Communists in the December Duma elections
had largely been discounted in advance by the markets, according to
Barings Asset Management, which manages the London-listed Barings
Emerging Europe Investment Trust.

Despite President Yeltsin's response, which has seen him replace
members of his government with hardliners, Barings is still optimistic
about the future, pointing out that this strategy may enhance the
chances of a reformist victory in the June presidential elections. As a
consequence, they remain overweight in Russian securities.

STAFF CHANGES AT CREDIS AND INTRAG

CHANGES may be afoot in the way mutual funds are distributed, following
the defection of prominent marketing executives from two of the major
banks to non-bank institutions. At present, as is the case in most
mainland European markets, distribution is almost monopolised by the
banks.

At Credis, the fund management arm of Credit Suisse, Andereas Spahni
has left to join an independent fund brokerage called AWF. Spahni
played a key role in establishing Credis as an independent business.
Prior to his departure he was working on a long-term distribution plan
for the company.

Meanwhile over at Intrag, the fund management arm of UBS, Reto Diezi
has left to join Zurich Insurance, where he is expected to establish a
mutual fund distribution company. At Intrag, Diezi had responsibilities
for strategy and marketing third-party products.

NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR GERMAN FUNDS

The Third Financial Markets Promotion Law is one of a number of new
laws which are slowly transforming the Germany's financial marketplace.
Laura Covill reports

GREATER flexibility for their domestic funds industry will be the main
thrust of Germany's Third Financial Markets Promotion Law, the latest
in a series of deregulatory reforms.

Juergen Stark, state secretary in the Ministry of Finance, has promised
that the law will provide new opportunities for mutual fund companies
in Germany, especially as far as new products are concerned.
Anticipating the proposals, many German fund companies are already
working on new products which will be unveiled as soon as the
provisions become law in the spring of 1997.

In response to a long list of demands presented by the Association of
German Investment Companies (BVI), the industry's main representative
body, the finance ministry has already pledged that draft legislation
will include the following innovations.

The opportunity for German investment companies to provide custody
services to third parties. At present, German investment companies can
only offer custody services to purchasers of their funds. This can
cause problems for investors who deal with several companies who must
open - and pay fees on - several custody accounts. Some investors have
circumvented this by going to a Luxembourg-based bank, so helping to
undermine German-based business. "The German investors who went to
Luxembourg to get custody services would be able to think about coming
back," said Manfred Laux, managing director of BVI. The change would
also open a new source of earnings for the fund companies.

Greater opportunities for mutual funds to invest in liquid instruments,
especially money market funds. The range of liquid assets in which
funds can invest is still restricted to bank deposits, certificates of
deposit and certain classes of short-term paper issued by public sector
institutions. The money-market fund sector, which has grown to around
DM100 billion ($66 billion) in the 18 months since its introduction,
offers an alternative with the same high degree of liquidity and
yields.

Equal rights for closed-end funds on depreciation, so that they can
benefit from the special depreciation rates available in eastern
Germany and real-estate markets. There would also be tax advantages for
retail investors.

Approval for open-ended real estate funds to purchase shares in
property companies and thus invest more easily in non-German
real-estate markets. This would reflect a growing willingness on the
part of real estate companies to invest in the London and Netherlands
property markets, which offer relatively low currency risks and provide
better yields than the German market. This change would also allow
German mutual funds to avoid higher taxes on foreign investment through
acquiring property holdings indirectly.

Fixed-term equity funds, with guaranteed returns. One of the finance
ministry's objectives is to encourage share ownership by individuals in
Germany. Fixed-term equity funds may encourage private investors to
invest in equities as part of a retirement savings plan. Banks have
begun to market equity funds for this purpose. Commerzbank, for
example, recently launched an advertising campaign which described
equity funds as the "fourth pillar" of an optimal retirement plan
(after the state pension, company pension, and life assurance).
Investment companies contend that the idea would be more attractive if
there was a definite wind-up date and some form of guaranteed returns.

Laux points out that fixed-term bond funds were an immediate success
when they were introduced to the German market in 1985. "There appears
to be no pressing reason for the concept to be restricted to bond
funds," he said. "On the contrary, fixed equity funds would surely be
appropriate vehicles in which to attract a large number of new
investors because - given the right hedging instruments - the investor
will get at the very least his own investment back."

Approval for funds to invest in OTC options. This is a prerequisite for
fixed-term equity funds. "The indications are that OTC options will be
allowed and thus we expect limited-term equity funds to come too," Laux
said.

However, Laux is less optimistic about the prospects for a "general
licence" which would allow mutual funds to invest across the range of
derivatives. Under the current system, each type of derivative
instrument has to be approved separately.

"The existing legislation is too inflexible and sometimes
inappropriate, so that some of the more recent innovations are not
covered, thus frustrating the introduction of many interesting fund
structures," Laux said. "If new instruments have to be expressly
sanctioned by law, then there is always the possibility of a long-time
lag between their introduction and when they can by used by mutual
funds."

But Laux has been told by the finance ministry that the "general
licence" will probably not be granted until the Fourth Financial
Markets Promotion Act, which is due in about 1998. The same goes for
the BVI's final demand of approval for feeder funds. "I can't rule out
that feeder funds won't be passed until the Fourth Act, but they are
not our highest priority, he said. "I think the ministry wants to wait
for further discussion (of this) at European level. It doesn't want to
anticipate European law."

Nevertheless, Laux is not unhappy with the results achieved from his
lobbying efforts. "We know that the Finance Ministry has problems
because of a lack of qualified personnel. You can't get everything done
at once."

The BVI chief is in no doubt about Bonn's"strong political will to help
Germany become one of Europe's leading investment centres. The Finance
Ministry is going to great lengths to promote Germany as a financial
marketplace," he said.

Though German investment companies are already creating new products in
anticipation of the new legislation, delays are likely. The Third
Financial Promotion Act will also encapsulate EU directives on
securities and bank capital adequacy, and they must be implemented by
the end of the year if Germany is to avoid sanction.

Moreover, securities and capital adequacy take priority at the finance
ministry as well as with the regulators. So while the Third Act will be
passed in the autumn, the sections relating to mutual funds will
probably not reach the statute book until the spring of 1997.

FEDERATED'S OFFSHORE DRIVE

The US's eleventh-largest fund provider, Federated Investors, has
recruited a "dream team" to aggressively target international markets.
Sterett Pope reports

FEDERATED Investors of Pittsburgh has launched an ambitious global
investment strategy designed to catapult Federated to the top ranks of
US international fund investors. The firm will launch five new
international equity funds this quarter, which it will market to both
US and European investors. It will also introduce a convertible
currency product for its three off-shore money market funds, which are
primarily marketed to institutions in Europe.

The eleventh-largest US fund provider, with some $65 billion in total
assets in over 250 funds, Federated now has just under $400 million in
international assets. In the last five years, international assets have
grown from 1 percent to 5 percent at Federated, but the firm hopes that
figure will move to 20 percent by the end of the decade.

Given the recent US boom in international investing, and the imperative
of diversification, Federated sees its new global push as a necessary
step toward its goal of controlling 5 percent of the $3 trillion to $4
trillion US fund industry by the year 2000. At the end of November,
Federated had $63.8 billion in assets, or 2.3 percent of the $2.78
trillion US fund market, according to the Investment Company Institute
in Washington.

Federated now manages two international funds and a global utility
fund, but in December, Federated registered five equity funds with the
US Securities and Exchange Commission. It expects them to be approved
by February. The new funds include a European growth fund, an
Asia-Pacific growth fund, a Latin America growth fund, an emerging
markets fund and an international small company fund. The new products
will bring Federated's total global offerings to eight and its
international equity funds to six.

Last April, Federated created a new unit, Federated Global Research
Corp., in New York, under the direction of international fund pioneer
Henry Frantzen. Frantzen, 52, who brings 25 years' experience in
international fund investing to Federated, previously worked for Brown
Brothers Harriman, Oppenheimer Management and Yamaichi Capital
Management.

Frantzen began his money management career in 1971 at the $30 billion
College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF). He built CREF's international
department from scratch, increasing the fund's international assets to
$6 billion between 1978 and 1987. During that period, he achieved
annual returns of nearly 23 percent, beating the Lipper international
fund average by almost 3 percentage points.

At Federated Global, Frantzen received a mandate to recruit a "dream
team" of international managers. The idea was to create an investment
management capability that could launch and manage any and all
international funds demanded by Federated clients.

In September, the new unit began by replacing Fiduciary Trust as
adviser for Federated's International Fund, which had $196 million in
assets under management at the end of 1995. (Federated also manages an
International Income Fund with $184 million and a Global Utility Fund
with $11 million in international assets.)

In the seven months following Federated Global's launch last April,
Frantzen hired 25 staff for his New York office, including 12 portfolio
managers, several coming from CREF.

To give his new team full international flexibility, Frantzen has
organised Federated Global along lines of geographic specialisation:
for Asia and Latin America, Federated Global hired Alexandre de
Bethman, 33, away from CREF; Mark Kopinski, 39, from Twentieth Century
Mutual Funds for Asia Pacific investing; Frank Semack, 43, from Omega
Advisors for European equities; John Kowit, 50, from John Hancock
Advisors for international fixed-income securities; Tracy Stouffer from
CREF for small-mid cap international equities; and Jolanta Wysocka from
Parametric Portfolio Associates/PIMCO Advisors LP for emerging market
securities.

Given the collapse of the peso in late 1994, early 1995 might have
seemed like an inappropriate time to launch Federated Global in New
York. But nine months later, following an excellent year on the US
stock market and two lacklustre years for international equities, US
investors are looking overseas for investment opportunities, and
Frantzen believes he is launching his new line of international equity
products at just the right time.

"The general overlay for the entire investment world today is low
inflation, particularly in Latin America," Frantzen explained. "The
trend is being driven by the entry into the world market of 900 million
Indians who have become capitalists and 1.2 billion Chinese. The
opening of Russia and its extraordinary natural resources is another
factor."

Frantzen's enthusiasm is so global that he is hard-pressed to isolate
particularly promising regional investing opportunities for 1996. Latin
America looks very good, with inflation down from 428 percent in 1993
to an estimated 33 percent in 1995 and a projected 19 percent in 1996.
The regional as a whole is reaping the rewards of democratisation and
the continuing reduction of import barriers. Brazil's import tariffs
fell from 70 percent in 1989 to 14 percent in 1995, for example.

"In Latin America, we believe the markets are presenting us exactly
with a buying opportunity," Frantzen declared. He expects Latin
America's two recessionary economies, Mexico and Argentina, to recover
by 1997. He also projects regional GDP growth at over 4 percent in
1997, up from an estimated 1996 figure of 1.3 percent.

In the Asia Pacific region, Frantzen foresees a major turnaround for
Japan, which has suffered four consecutive years of falling earnings.
But he projects these to increase by 75 percent in the fiscal year
ending in March 1996, and another 50 percent in the following fiscal
year. One of the first investment decisions Frantzen made when he took
control of the Federated International Equity Fund in September was to
shift its weighting of Japanese stocks from 18 percent to 37 percent.

Following several poor years, Frantzen believes that Asian stocks are
now relatively cheaply priced. Growth and savings rates remain
extremely robust, and continuing deregulation "in almost every country"
augurs very well for the region as a whole. But Frantzen stressed
that"we have a healthy scepticism of some of the numbers you see coming
out of China, although it is certainly a big growth area". Frantzen
expects to place major investments in India, where Federated has not
placed money so far.

Frantzen is also bullish on the European Union, where he thinks falling
interest rates, relatively high unemployment and low inflation, will
drive growth in the coming phase. He appears less enthusiastic about
eastern Europe and the Russian Federation, at least in the short term,
however.

In the US, Federated will market its five new equity offerings through
its traditional client network of broker dealers and other financial
intermediaries. The company has no direct marketing arm and relies
solely on its client network for sales. The firm will pursue a similar
strategy in Europe, where it will push its international equity
products, and particularly its Latin American investment expertise, as
European institutions generally view Latin America as the strong suit
of US international managers.

While it sees equity investing, especially in the context of
defined-contribution savings plans, as the biggest long-term
opportunity in Europe, Federated will also stress its convertible
dollar money market products.

In 1987, Federated registered two dollar-denominated money funds in the
Cayman Islands, and then redomiciled them in Dublin, after it
established an office there in 1990. It has now registered three money
market funds (with $300 million in assets) and two long-term bond funds
($100 million), all dollar-denominated, in Dublin, which it sees as a
less expensive and more flexible regulated operating environment than
Luxembourg. Federated has outsourced custody and administration to Bank
of New York's Dublin operation, which has a funds servicing joint
venture with Allied Irish Bank.

This year, Federated hopes to launch a currency product, which will
convert its dollar-denominated money market funds into 22 different
currencies, with State Street Boston handling currency swaps for the
funds.

US-managed money market products are particularly attractive to large
European banks, big US custodian institutions and US multinational
corporations in Europe, given the growing demands for money market
instruments in Germany and the UK, and the lack of fully liquid
commercial paper markets in those countries. Federated now offers
institutions in Germany, for example, an additional 1.25 points of
yield over prevailing interbank rates.

Federated's convertible approach differs from that of Fidelity
Investments, which recently launched three money market funds in
Europe, denominated separately in dollars, pounds sterling and
deutschmarks. Federated believes that its approach offers far greater
flexibility in the 15 European Union markets, combined with advantages
of scale.

As in the US, Federated will rely solely on financial intermediaries
for its retail products. The firm cited the example of Fidelity, which
attempted to market its funds directly in France in 1988, and then
relaunched its funds marketing through a wholesale distribution
strategy last year.

In France, Federated is targeting large domestic banks, which still
control some 50 percent of retail funds distribution, as well as
brokers and insurance firms. In 1994, Federated began to advertise in a
range of French and international financial publications, including
Global Investor, La Tribune des Fosses, and Le Figaro.

MAGELLAN MOVES TO STATE STREET

IN LATE December, Fidelity Investments awarded State Street Boston with
a custody contract for its flagship Magellan fund, which has $53
billion in assets. State Street will replace Brown Brothers Harriman,
which had been Magellan's custodian since the fund's inception in 1963.

State Street had previously administered four small Fidelity funds with
total assets of some $4 billion. The bank's custody clients also
include Alliance Capital, Merrill Lynch, GT Capital and Invesco.

The addition of the largest US equity fund could provide State Street
with up to $10 million in additional fee revenue, where the bank
charges two basis points on assets under custody. The bank is already
the world's largest fund custodian with some $2.3 trillion in assets
under custody at the end of 1995, up 32 percent from the previous year.
(Assets under management in 1995 stood at $226 billion, up 41 percent
from 1994.) State Street reported total 1995 fee revenue of $297
million, or 73 percent of total revenues.

In late December, State Street announced the formation of a new custody
unit, which will unite all of the bank's custody operations, including
line and support areas and State Street's corporate systems and
technology group. The unit will be run by David Spina, whom State
Street promoted to president and chief operating officer in December.

MORE US FUNDS UP FOR SALE

CLAYTON DUBILIER & RICE, a New York leveraged-buyout firm, has hired
investment bank Goldman Sachs to sell Van Kampen/American Capital, an
asset management firm with $55 billion in assets under management,
including $37.8 billion in mutual funds. Analysts said the firm could
fetch up to $1 billion.

In late 1992, Clayton Dubilier bought Van Kampen Merritt of Chicago
from Xerox for $415 million, and later merged the asset manager with
American Capital Management & Research, which it bought in mid-1994
from Travelers for $430 million. The combination of the two groups,
which sell their funds only through broker-dealers, was intended to
complement Van Kampen's bond-heavy product line with American Capital's
stock funds.

But the combined assets of the two firms have lost market share,
falling from 1.52 percent of the US funds market to 1.37 percent in the
two years ending in the third quarter of 1995, according to Financial
Research Corp. in Chicago. While Van Kampen's municipal bond speciality
has lost its appeal due to the global bond correction in 1993 and more
recent expectations of US tax reform, American Capital's equity
offerings have failed to post the high returns that attract
performance-hungry US investors.

Meanwhile, star manager Michael Price has also hired Goldman Sachs for
the purpose of selling his money management firm, Heine Securities of
Short Hills New Jersey, which owns the $13 billion Mutual Series fund
group. Heine, whose accumulation of Chase Manhattan stock in early 1995
pushed the bank to merge with Chemical Banking last year, wants to sell
out so that he can"personally rattle the cages of stodgy companies",
according to sources quoted in Business Week in early January.

But Price's investment savvy is seen as Mutual Series's greatest
strength, and some investment bankers believe his fund group could
fetch $400 million if he continues to manage its assets -as much as
double the price Heine Securities might get if he leaves.

STATE STREET ENTERS BENEFITS OUTSOURCING

IN EARLY December, State Street Boston formed a joint venture with
Washington consultancy Watson Wyman Worldwide to provide "total
benefits outsourcing" to corporate clients.

The move is primarily intended to support State Street's
defined-contribution pension, or 401(k), business, by allowing the bank
to offer its pension clients additional employee services. State
Street's cross-town 401(k) rival Fidelity Investments launched an
in-house employee benefits unit early in 1995.

Whereas defined-contribution pension plans allow corporate clients to
dispense with investment risk and all pension servicing duties, "total
benefits outsourcing" allows them to dispense with health insurance
administration and other employee services. Employees and retirees of
corporations using such a service receive convenient and integrated
service through a single toll-free telephone number.

Through its new venture with Watson Wyatt, State Street hopes to
attract more corporate pension clients and fend off the competition of
insurance firms who are leveraging their mutual fund and 401(k)
operations with integrated health insurance services.

Watson Wyatt has been in the benefits outsourcing business since 1991
and now serves some 3 million employees from US firms such as Nynex,
Rockwell International and Westinghouse. The alliance will also allow
State Street to enter the benefits outsourcing business with a full
benefits technology infrastructure in place.

State Street is now the third-largest 401(k) provider in the US, after
mutual fund giants Fidelity and Vanguard Group (which together account
for some 20 percent of the entire US defined-contribution pension
market). According to Cerulli Associates in Boston, State Street
managed $28.2 billion in 401(k) assets at the end of the third quarter
of 1995, or 4.7 percent of the total market.

GIT POSTS PORTFOLIO ON INTERNET

IN WHAT may be the most detailed disclosure initiative ever by a fund
firm, GIT Investment Funds of Arlington, Virginia has begun posting the
complete portfolios of four of its equity funds on the Internet and
updating them daily.

GIT, which manages some $220 million in stock, bond and money market
funds, plans to post daily portfolios updates for its nine other
no-load funds as well. Investors who wish to follow GIT's portfolio
postings can access the firm's home page on the World Wide Web at
http://www.gitfunds.com.

At present, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires
fund companies to disclose their full portfolios only twice a year. The
agency also requires all funds to report daily changes in their net
asset value, meaning that they must already calculate the value of
their portfolios on a daily basis.

But the SEC is now considering a proposal to require money market funds
to disclose their holdings quarterly, and has asked for industry
comment on whether more frequent portfolio disclosure would help
investors. The advantages of more frequent portfolio disclosure were
highlighted in early December, when managers of Fidelity's flagship
Magellan fund were caught publicly praising securities they were in the
process of selling.

The Investment Company Institute (ICI), a funds trade group in
Washington, has opposed further disclosure on the grounds that it would
harm shareholders by adding a needless expense to fund management and
would reveal trading strategies to competitors. The ICI believes daily
disclosure would be especially burdensome for large fund families and
would hurt firms that must make big trades over a number of days to
avoid market turbulence.

Some fund executives have argued that GIT's daily disclosure policy is
relatively easy for a small firm, and serves primarily as a marketing
tool for attracting investor interest.

But GIT executive vice-president Charles Tennes responded that daily
disclosure serves the interests of his firm's shareholders by allowing
them to scrutinise the company's statements and strategies more closely
by evaluating them against its managers' market moves. Tennes also said
competitors cannot take advantage of disclosures of trades made the
previous day.

FIDELITY LAUNCHES JAPANESE FUND

FIDELITY Investments has launched its first domestic mutual fund for
Japanese investors, the Fidelity Japan Open-End Fund, making Fidelity
the first US firm to offer Japanese investors a yen-denominated
investment trust.

The fund was launched in late November, three weeks after Fidelity
received an investment trust licence from the Japanese government. It
is being marketed to Japanese institutions and individual investors by
Nomura Securities, which raised $400 million for the fund before the
initial offer period closed on December 20.

Fidelity said that over the next several years, it plans to launch a
variety of new Japanese investment trusts with different investment
objectives.

Fidelity's new investment trust will seek to achieve long-term capital
growth, using a bottom-up investment style. The fund's prospectus
requires that 65 percent of assets be invested in Japanese equities.
Fidelity named Shigeki Makino, who has managed the US-based Fidelity
Japan Fund since 1994, as the manager of the new investment trust.

Fidelity is positioning the new fund as a long-term investment vehicle
and has given it an unusual structure: the fund will be closed for the
first year, and will impose a 1 percent fee on redemptions in the
second and third years.

Fidelity is the second US firm to receive a Japanese investment trust
licence, following Morgan Stanley, which got its licence in October and
plans to launch a Japanese investment trust shortly. In addition, four
non-US foreign firms - SBC Warburg, Jardine Fleming, Schroders and
Invesco - have received licences and launched Japanese investment
trusts.

The new launches come at a time when Japanese investors are beginning
to look to foreign firms for superior investment returns, given the
relatively poor performance of domestically managed funds. But the
Japanese market presents foreign fund providers with some distribution
challenges.

Investment trusts are sold in Japan only on commission by
broker-dealers, a highly concentrated channel that forces foreign funds
to compete with the house products of distributors.

SMALL CAN BE BEAUTIFUL

Hong Kong has had a dreadful time since the boom of 1993. For one small
new investment partnership, however, falling markets have provided new
opportunities. Noel Fung reports

VALUE PARTNERS may be just a small Hong Kong-based fund management
boutique. But it beat the rest of the pack by grabbing the award for
best performing Hong Kong equity manager last year.

It managed to lose less money than its competitors in 1994, probably
the worst year experienced by the Hong Kong market since 1982.
According to Micropal, its flagship "A" fund fell by 11.9 percent
compared with the 30 percent sustained by the "average" fund manager
and the 31 percent fall experienced by the Hang Seng Index.

Value Partners has a single mission - value investing in Asia and
especially in Hong Kong. The key to its performance to date has been to
be unconventional. "We typically invest in weird and unpopular stocks
which people despise," said Cheah Cheng Hye, Value Partners's managing
director.

It considers itself an investment company which uses a distinct
bottom-up approach to identify undervalued companies rather than simply
following overall market trends.

Indeed Value Partners sees itself as something of an investment
pawnshop, soaking up stocks which sellers are desperate to dump. Shares
are sometimes disposed of almost discriminately by "top-down" and
"momentum" players desperate to exit the market at almost any price.
Value Partners will be only too happy to buy these stocks at bargain
basement prices and wait for the recovery, both in earnings and from
the recovery of stock prices.

Cheah Cheng Hye, a former financial journalist, has also been the Asia
head of research for Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank now owned
by Deutsche Bank. He quit the bank early in 1993 to establish a fund
management company with Yeh V-Nee, an executive director of Hsin Chong
International, a Hong Kong-listed construction company. Value Partners
was the result.

The ownership of the company is split three ways between Cheah Cheng
Hye, Yeh V-Nee and Holding Capital Group, a US-based association
comprised of businessmen, professionals and corporations, with offices
in New York and Florida.

Currently Value Partners operates with just six staff, including Cheah
and two analysts. "We rely exclusively on our own research to generate
stock selections," said Cheah. It searches for "bombed out stocks",
that is stocks where all the bad news has been fully discounted by the
market.

Investors in the "A" fund are typically US and Switzerland-based
investment professionals. The minimum investment is $100,000. To date
the fund has $32 million under management.

In addition to the "A" fund, Value Partners manages a number of
segregated portfolios for institutional investors and high net worth
individuals mainly drawn from the US.

The company's non-conformist style runs further than stockpicking,
however. Its own capital is also invested in the"A" fund. If its
clients lose, it will lose twice over. Not only will its fees - which
are performance-related - suffer. It will also lose its own capital.

JAPAN:  YEAR OF THE RAT

YATAKA NAKAI, an analyst at Daiwa Securities, is using more
unconventional criteria to predict Japanese market sentiment. He claims
that the start of the Chinese new year on February 19 is particularly
auspicious as it will usher in the Year of the Rat.

Mr Nakai has studied the links between the Japanese stock market and
the 12 animal symbols of the Chinese Zodiac. The average increase
sustained in the Nikkei Index during the Year of the Rat, which has
occurred three times since the end of World War 2, has been 54.6
percent. This tops the performance league table. The pig, rabbit, snake
and monkey years follow, with the ox right at the bottom of the heap.

TAIWAN:  TAX CHANGES

THE TAIWAN stockmarket, which performed poorly during 1995 as a result
of political worries, has been hit further by the government's decision
to reimpose capital gains tax on stocks and shares. A 14 percent tax
will be on imposed on capital gains realised by institutional, retail
and foreign investors. To encourage long-term investment, however, the
plan offers a preferential tax rate on capital gains realised on stocks
held for more than one year.

The re-introduction of capital gains tax, which was abolished in 1990,
has stunned many observers. Although the tax was first proposed by the
Ministry of Finance in January 1994, it was expected that no action
would be taken until after the presidential election in March.

FRANCE'S DISCOUNT BROKER PIONEER

Discount brokering is still something of a novelty within the French
market, but Cortal has found it profitable line of business, even
through difficult times. Jean Claude Broustra reports

THOUGH 1995 was not the most auspicious year for French fund managers,
this did not prevent Cortal, a bank, brokerage and investment house
which distributes exclusively through direct media, from making further
progress.

During the course of the year it increased funds under management by
Fr1.1 billion ($220 million) to Fr17.5 billion, as well as expanding
its customer base. At the end of 1995 it was servicing 171,000
customers, a 10 percent increase on the previous year. Of this total
136,000 were "exclusive" to Cortal. The remainder were introduced by
its business partners elsewhere within the Paribas and Compagnie
Bancaire groups, which it is part of.

Cortal's vigorous expansion over the last 18 months is mainly due to
the speed at which it has espoused discount broking, still something of
a novelty within the French market. Its discount broking service, or
"Centrale des Placements", which was introduced in mid-1994, enables
Cortal customers to buy directly any shares or bonds listed on the
Paris stock exchange. They can also purchase Sicavs (open-end funds)
managed by any French bank, insurance company or investment house.
Overall, dealing costs and commissions are substantially lower than
those offered by conventional brokers.

The remarkable success of the Centrale des Placements shows a clear
demand for this type of facility. In just a year, the volume of funds
Cortal manages through this service almost doubled and now accounts for
Fr2.6 billion in total. Of this Fr1.8 billion emanates from securities
(shares and bonds), and Fr0.8 billion from Sicavs managed by other
asset management institutions.

But the true extent of Centrale des Placements's popularity is
illustrated by the fact that it currently accounts for almost 70
percent of all new investments purchased through Cortal. 0f these the
vast majority are for stocks and shares. These account for 50 percent
of the 70 percent. The remainder come from external Sicavs.

The main reason for the success of discount brokerage is its fee and
commission structure. Unlike other bank brokerage operations such as
Credit Lyonnais (Fr63) and Societe Generale (Fr108), Centrale des
Placements doesn't impose a fixed minimum brokerage charge. Although
the minimum fee per order charged by Cortal (Fr46) is higher than that
of Societe Generale (Fr30) - though still lower than that of Credit
Lyonnais (Fr52.28) - commission rates (exclusive of tax) are
considerably less at Cortal, especially where large transactions are
involved.

Societe Generale charges a standard 1.3 percent on all transactions,
with Credit Lyonnais charging 1.22 percent for transactions below
Fr10,000, and 1.01 percent for anything above this figure. Cortal's
customers have to pay 1.15 percent on transactions up to Fr100,000,
0.75 percent on the part between Fr100,000 and Fr500,000, and only 0.1
percent on anything above this. This "sliding" fee scale was introduced
quite recently to attract big clients.

Custody fees are also lower at Cortal than at other brokerages. The
annual fixed commission per stock (including tax) is Fr38.18 at Societe
Generale, Fr33.56 at Credit Lyonnais, but only Fr15 at Cortal. Societe
Generale charges commission of just over 0.2 percent (including tax) on
the value of each portfolio held and Credit Lyonnais 0.19 percent.
Cortal only charges 0.15 percent.

In addition to the Centrale des Placements, Cortal offers its customers
a range of other investment services. These include Sicavs, managed on
its behalf by Credit du Nord, by Cardif, another Paribas subsidiary,
and by Paribas itself.

Cortal offers a range of fund money market, bond and equity Sicavs
which incorporate the entire maturity spectrum: short-term (investments
of less than two years); medium-term (between three and five years);
and long-term (more than five years).

Short-term consists of: the Compte Optimal and the Compte a Terme.
Medium-term consists of: Obligations Convertibles, France Rendement,
Mone 40, Interets Trimestries, Eurocap, France 40, Parfrance and
Objectif Monde. Long-term consists of: Cortal Pierre, Cortal
Capitalisation, Cortal Croissance Garantie and Contrat Majeur.

Among the new services which Cortal has introduced to its customers
since is Service Optimal Placements. This keeps customers informed,
through diagrams, graphs and pie charts, about the composition and
performance of their investment portfolios. The system used is known as
the "tableau de bord de l'epargne". It also provides customers with
expert personal advice, a regular assessment of the performance of
their Sicavs, and advice about establishing a personalised savings and
investment strategy of their own.

Another service called Contrat Majeur Independant Retraite, which also
dates from 1994, is targeted at members of the liberal professions and
other groups to build up a complementary tax-free retirement pension
within the framework of the Madelin law on social protection.

A third, known as the Compte a Terme Cortal, which was launched in
1995, offers guaranteed returns to investors. The return becomes
progressively higher in proportion to the size of the investment and
the length of time it is held for.

At its inception the Compte a Terme entitled the holders to a tax
allowance of Fr8,000. This has been withdrawn for 1996, but investors
still benefit from a more favourable tax regime. Nonetheless, with
interest rates beginning to fall in France, this option is less
attractive than before.

The most recent product launch was France Rendement, a Sicav that
invests exclusively in French government securities. It replaced a
similar product called Rendement Trimestriel. A major difference
between this and the new product is that Rendement Trimestriel provided
only one distribution option - a straightforward payment of dividends.
The new product allows dividends to be reinvested or capitalised.

Cortal also has operations in France and Luxembourg. Cortal Bank
Luxembourg is a subsidiary of the Cortal and Paribas Luxembourg banks.
It was established two years ago and offers a wide range of investment
products. Its main service is the Compte Optimal International. This
offers deposit accounts in a variety of currencies, and personalised
portfolio management.

Since 1992, Cortal has also had a 49 percent minority share in the
Cortal Bank Belgium. This also offers a wide range of investment and
financial services at very low prices. The majority shareholder is
Paribas.

WHY VALUE BEATS GROWTH

Fund managers seeking consistent above-average returns should adopt a
value-focused investment strategy, according to research carried out by
David Umstead of Boston International Advisors. Ian Orton reports

THE RELATIVE merits of value and growth-orientated investment styles
have generated considerable debate among both academics and
professionals. For the moment, at least, it would appear that
proponents of the value-orientated school would appear to hold the
advantage, especially in the US.

Apart from the impressionistic evidence provided by well-known value
investors such as Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch, there is also a
substantial body of statistical evidence to confirm the view that a
value strategy will outperform a growth-orientated strategy over the
medium to long term. The value-growth spread associated with the S&P
500 index, for example, has averaged 320 basis points per year over the
last 20 years.

According to David Umstead, managing director of Boston International
Advisors, similar results can be obtained in non-US markets. He has
developed a set of value and growth indices for 20 equity markets in
Europe and the Pacific Rim and tracked their performance over the
period 1974 to 1994. The system is known as the BIA Europe/Pacific
Value, Growth and Market Indexes.

The results, which he presented at the recent Global Investment
Management '95 Conference, are emphatic. "A dollar invested in the BIA
Europe/Pacific Value Index on December 31 1974 would have grown to
$24.96 by December 31 1994 - an unhedged annualised rate of return of
17.5 per year over the 20-year period. By contrast, a dollar invested
in the BIA Europe/Pacific Growth Index grew to only $11.11, an average
return of 12.8 percent. The value index outperforms the growth index by
an average of 470 basis points per year. Furthermore the spread is
quite consistent."

Examining the year-by-year performance of the two indices, Umstead
found that the value index outperformed the growth index in 16 years
out of 20 and produced lower volatility. The value index standard
deviation is 17.61 percent compared with 18.14 for the growth index.

The largest positive value-growth spread is 17.22 percentage points in
1988, and the largest negative is 7.13 points in 1980. The other years
with negative spreads occurred in 1984, 1986 and 1991. There is no
obvious pattern to the negative spread years. One occurred in a year
with phenomenal returns (1986), two in average years (1980 and 1991)
and one in a below-average year (1984).

To provide greater insight, Umstead has divided the geographical
components of his indices into three sub-groups: Europe; Japan; and
Pacific-ex-Japan. He found that the value-growth spread is quite
uncorrelated from region to region. Value-growth spreads are, however
much greater in Japan and the Pacific than in Europe.

The end value of 3.77 for Japan meant that the value half of the
Japanese market outperformed the growth half by nearly four to one. The
value half of the Japanese market delivered a return of 20.2 percent a
year over the last 20 years, compared with 12.5 percent achieved by the
growth half.

Umstead has identified five reasons why value beats growth. The first
two are consistent with rational behaviour and simply maintain that
investors may be concerned with attributes other than pre-tax risk and
return.

"1. Value stocks have an inferior tax status. Because of this, taxable
investors demand a higher return for value stocks.

2. Value stocks have an inferior comfort-level. This also leads to the
need for value stocks to offer a higher return."

The last three relate to various types of behavioural errors which stem
from the fact that value stocks tend to be from companies with weak
balance sheets and income statements. "3. This leads to pessimistic
extrapolations of future earnings and dividends which in turn leads to
pleasant earnings surprises.

4. The weak financial statements also lead to the conclusion that the
company is a bad company and therefore the stock is a bad investment.
This in turn also leads to pleasant surprises.

5. And finally this real financial record makes value stocks much more
susceptible to Monday morning quarterbacking, It is more difficult to
externalise blame if value stocks perform poorly."

But how do active investors identify value stocks? Umstead uses an
extremely straightforward approach when it comes to constructing his
indices. The key variables are the price-to-book ratio and market
capitalisation. Companies are ranked in ascending price-to-book ratio
until their combined capitalisation amounts to half of total market
capitalisation. These are value stocks. The remainder are growth
stocks. The process is repeated annually and the indices are
reconstructed accordingly.

Within the BIA Europe/Pacific Indices, countries are
capitalisation-weighted, as are the stocks within countries.

Europe/Pacific Growth Indexes. The Value Index wins over every
five-year period

INDIA BECKONS

India is becoming increasingly popular as a destination for both direct
and portfolio investment. Dr Shanta Acharya reviews the government's
progress in making the country more investor-friendly

THE STRUCTURAL adjustment programme begun in July 1991 by the
government of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has been successful in
stimulating the scope of the private sector, as well as expanding trade
and attracting foreign investment in India.

The economic liberalisation of India was initiated partly in response
to structural problems in the economy. The Indian government faced
serious fiscal and external imbalances which had generated double-digit
inflation at the beginning of the decade. Despite significant
assistance from multilateral and bilateral agreements, foreign exchange
reserves had fallen to $1 billion - or two weeks of imports - by June
1991, pushing the country to the verge of defaulting on its external
debt obligations.

The reform programme precipitated by this crisis focused on the capital
intensity of India's historical growth process and was aimed at
curtailing its dependence on the unsustainable and unproductive
expansion of the public sector. The country's relatively high
investment rate had failed to show a matching, much less a sustainable,
growth in output and employment.

The aim of India's new economic reform agenda is to reverse this
vicious cycle by policies that will usher in a virtuous cycle of growth
through higher productivity and investment.

Over the past four years, we have seen a commendable improvement in
India's current and capital external accounts, accompanied by
structural reforms. To sustain the momentum of this process requires a
concerted effort to strengthen public finances, improve investment in
infrastructure, and encourage private investment to flow into crucial
areas of the economy.

It is also of crucial importance that the reform agenda filters down to
state government level. In the next stage of reform, fiscal prudence at
the centre needs to be complemented by individual states. In this
respect the forthcoming general election will be crucial in
consolidating the success of the government's initiatives to date. The
government's consensus-building approach in instituting economic
reforms will ensure that the liberalisation process, though slow, is
also irreversible.

Capital market reforms

Mr Narasimha Rao's Congress government started to liberalise the Indian
economy with an agenda for reform that attempted to address the
structural inefficiencies that militated against investment. This
focused on trade policies, the financial sector, taxation and public
enterprises.

This has resulted in a planned transformation of the Indian capital
market to enable it to assume an integral role in the allocation of
capital within the nation's growth plans for the future. Though
frustratingly slow, change is discernible.

Policy reforms covering the free pricing of new issues, the flotation
of Euroissues, foreign institutional investment in Indian companies,
the establishment of private sector mutual funds and the privatisation
of state-owned companies are starting to have a discernible impact on
the capital market and the investment environment.

The key issue of setting up a central depository to facilitate a smooth
transfer of the ownership of shares will have a dramatic impact on
trading when it is put in place. A high level of poor delivery,
issuance of duplicate shares and problems relating to share transfer
and registration, particularly after a stock market scam in 1992,
continues to plague the market. This limits confidence in the market
mechanism.

Long-standing troubles in India regarding stockmarket infrastructure
continue to thwart portfolio investment. This has made it difficult for
foreign direct investment to flow into the country.

It is inevitable that in this process of transformation of the economy,
there have been more losers than winners. Nonetheless, it is expected
that over the next five years, the newly elected government will be
more able to address the vital issue of infrastructural constraints to
facilitate the smooth flow of capital within the economy.

Any investment decision, however, is ultimately linked to the
risk-reward ratio that the individual investor determines for himself
or is prepared to tolerate over a stipulated period. This is partly
influenced by rational expectations within an economic framework that
enables the investor to identify the opportunity early enough to use it
advantageously. The need to distinguish between the performance of the
economy and that of the stockmarket requires a high level of
discipline.

While a long-term investment horizon is always desirable, it is
especially prudent to take into account the overall valuation of the
market when swimming in the rough seas of emerging markets. Overheated
markets are best avoided. Market fundamentals are often distorted by
short-term money flows. With the increasingly international nature of
capital flows, it is vital to understand the various cycles in the
movement of funds flowing into the real economy as distinct from the
stock markets.

Volatility can provide opportunities. In illiquid markets, active
trading may not prove to be such a winning strategy, however. For those
fund managers, asset allocation strategists and individuals interested
in investing in India, the critical task is understanding the economic
opportunity and timing one's entry into the market accordingly.

Poor stock market performance

While the fundamental resilience of the Indian economy is reflected in
a series of economic data - from industrial output growth, export
performance to corporate earnings - the stockmarket has been in the
doldrums due to a lack of liquidity.

The Bombay Stock Exchange 30 Index declined about 30.7 percent in
dollar terms in 1995 but at the current level is offering investors
good value. Valuations are reasonable at 12 times March 1996 earnings,
with EPS growth of 20 percent estimated for the year to March 1997. The
impending general election, which is expected to take place in April
1996 will continue to restrain market sentiment but will also provide
good buying opportunities for the long-term investor.

The economy has responded positively to the structural adjustment
programme but macroeconomic stresses pose fresh challenges to policy.

Real GDP growth recovered from 1 percent in 1991-92 to 4.3 percent
between 1992 and 1994, and over the next two years is expected to
maintain the 6 percent achieved last year. Industrial production, after
remaining stagnant in 1991-92, recovered to grow by a modest 2.3
percent in 1992-93 before surging by 8.5 percent in 1994-95. It is
expected to rise to around 9 percent to 10 percent over the next two
years.

Exports, having declined marginally in 1991-92, rose by 20 percent in
1993-94 and by 18 percent in 1994-95, and are also expected to sustain
this pace over the next two years. Imports were severely hit by
recession and the structural adjustment plan in 1991-92. Both impacted
adversely on industrial captilisation rates, leading to a contraction
of 18.8 percent. They recovered quickly to grow by 11.9 percent in 1992-
93 and by 6.5 percent in 1993-94, before surging by a further 21.3
percent in 1994-95. Imports continue to show a strong rising trend,
reflecting the recovery of demand in the economy and are expected to
rise by 25 percent in 1995-96.

India's current account deficit also improved substantially to a mere
0.1 percent of GDP in 1993-94 and 0.7 percent of GDP in 1994-95. The
deficit is expected to rise to 1.5 percent of GDP in 1995-96 but then
recover marginally in 1996-97.

At $4.1 billion, foreign investment (of which portfolio investment was
$3.13 billion) rose sharply, resulting in a rise in the foreign
exchange reserves to $15 billion by March 1994 and $20 billion by March
1995. The subsequent slow-down in foreign investment may have been a
blessing in disguise for India's policymakers, as management of foreign
exchange reserves was posing a serious challenge.

External competitiveness was beginning to be compromised. The rupee had
been virtually pegged at 31.37 to the dollar until mid-September 1995
when the authorities allowed it to rise to 33.7. The rupee rate
currently stands at 34.5.

The monetisation of reserves has produced a sharp expansion in the
money supply. This resulted in a growth rate of 22.2 percent between
March 1993 and March 1993. Coupled with increases in administered
prices, the inflation rate rose from a low of 7 percent in mid-1993 to
10 percent in March 1994. As a consequence the real exchange rate
appreciated. With industrial recovery in place, non-oil imports started
picking up at a faster rate, and the larger current account deficit put
downward pressure on the currency, leading to the devaluation of the
rupee.

The current trade and current account deficits do not pose any real
concern as foreign exchange reserves remain high at $17.5 billion in
December 1995 or approximately six months of imports. Money supply has
been running higher than planned for some time, however. It increased
by 17.5 percent during 1994-95 but the slow-down in foreign exchange
inflows helped in restraining subsequent growth. Money supply growth is
expected to amount to 16 percent for 1995-96.

Inflationary pressures have abated in the short term. Inflation is
unlikely to rise above the 10 percent level.

While the government is vigilant and the Reserve Bank of India has
responded by maintaining tighter liquidity conditions at present, the
inflationary battle can only be won by streamlining the financial
position of the states and the public sector enterprises. The
politically sensitive reforms required to address restrictive labour
laws, formulating bankruptcy laws etc can only be dealt with after the
elections.

Increased spending in an election year has forced the government to
issue ad hoc treasury bills to fund the budget deficit, however,
despite an agreement concluded with the central bank in September 1994
to end the government's automatic access to such a form of financing by
March 1997.

The planned phasing out would have significantly enhanced monetary
control and severed the link between the expansion of bank credit and
the budget deficit. This reversal of government policy implies that the
fiscal adjustment process will take much longer than anticipated.

Stabilisation policy

In July 1991 the prime objective of the government was to stabilise the
economy. This was achieved primarily through cuts on subsidies,
defence, capital expenditure and loans to states and public
enterprises. The government deficit was reduced from 8.4 percent of GDP
in 1990-91 to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1992-93.

Much of this progress was lost in 1993-94 as the fiscal deficit
escalated to 7.7 percent of GDP against a target of 4.7 percent, as a
result of revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns. The gross fiscal
deficit stood at 6.6 percent of GDP in 1994-95 and is unlikely to
improve significantly over the next year.

The worse-than-expected fiscal performance could undermine the
credibility of the economic programme. Interest payments claim about
half of the central government's revenues. The financial sector
reforms, as well as the declared intention of the government to reduce
its borrowing from the central bank over the next three years, will
increase the rates of interest currently being paid on government debt,
further aggravating the situation.

While the reneging of its commitment to reduce its dependency on the
central bank for cheap credit for deficit financing during this
financial year may help in the short term, it does not inspire
confidence in the government's ability to contain its fiscal imbalance.
More importantly, it tends to crowd out private sector borrowing,
investment and the subsequent growth of the real economy. In addition,
a limited fiscal adjustment has passed the burden of economic
stabilisation onto monetary policy.

The government's ability to curb expenditure is seriously hampered by
the fact that interest payments, defence, wages and grants and loans
account for almost 70 percent of non-plan government expenditure.
Furthermore, these are mandated by the constitution.

The government's expectation of economic recovery in its last budget
seems to be paying off; the fiscal deficit will be lower than last
year's level. Lower excise duties and interest rates have resulted in
recovery in household consumption as is evident from a lower savings
ratio and healthy sales in consumer durables. A rise in imports
similarly signals a recovery in private sector investment. If, however,
equity-raising by companies continues to be thwarted by market
conditions, the tide of investment into the real economy may not gather
sufficient momentum over the medium term.

Taking into account the infrastructural constraints of the economy,
however, this may not be such a problem in the short term. Besides,
constant fundraising by companies via issuance of shares not only leads
to EPS dilution but investor fatigue as well.

Boosting private investment

The fiscal deficit continues to be the government's main challenge and
a real threat to India's economic prospects. The 1996-97 budget will be
Manmohan Singh's sixth. While continuing with the structural adjustment
process, his last budget emphasised a shift towards stimulating
investment so that economic recovery would help consolidate the
government's fiscal position.

To lower the user cost of capital, import tariffs on capital goods were
significantly reduced, corporate taxes were lowered and the excise duty
regime was reformed. The removal of barriers to private sector entry in
areas previously reserved for the public sector was also initiated,
although the progress achieved has been limited.

The irony is that what has withheld private investment is not so much
the high cost of capital but high idle capacity in sectors where
private investment could have been used, such as manufacturing.

Meanwhile in areas where there is mounting urgency to expand capacity
(this is particularly the case in relation to infrastructure), a policy
and institutional framework supportive of private investment has yet to
fully evolve. While Indian firms have raised capital through GDR
issuance and convertibles, not all the amounts raised have found their
way back into the real economy to stimulate output and employment.

As these funds get invested slowly, the recovery of the economy to the
6 percent to 7 percent GDP growth level is sustainable only as long as
policy continues to attract and stimulate investment. There is little
scope for the Finance Minister to accelerate the pace of reform until
after the election.

While the budget in February will provide an excellent forum for the
Congress to highlight its achievements since 1991, politically
sensitive policy decisions cannot be taken in an election year.

Although India's saving rate is running at around 20 percent of GDP,
the heavily regulated financial system has meant that savings have not
necessarily flown into the most productive sectors. The government has
taken steps to address this issue by reducing the extent to which
commercial banks are forced to hold government debt, rationing
subsidised credit to priority sectors
- so bringing it more in line with market rates - and relaxing controls
over banks' lending decisions.

The inflationary impact of the fiscal deficit is the key issue for the
government. Thus any savings made by the central and state governments,
together with nationalised industries, will not only help contain
fiscal imbalance but reverse the anti-investment bias of the fiscal
adjustment programme. This has produced a declining trend in public
investment since 1991-92, the year in which the programme commenced.

As a result, the generation of employment opportunities by the public
sector has not been feasible and, as mentioned earlier, the private
sector has not been investing as a result of excess capacity in
industry. Gross domestic capital formation declined from 24 percent of
GDP in 1991-92 to 20.4 percent of GDP in 1993-94.

While the annual growth rate between 1981 and 1991 was 16.3 percent per
annum, gross domestic capital formation grew at only 4 percent per
annum between 1992 and 1994. The whole question of labour reform can
only be addressed seriously when the government is in a position to
generate greater investment and employment.

Investing in India

A country's economic performance is usually judged over decades rather
than the over latest business cycle. A nation's economic strength is
gauged not only by its macroeconomic performance and the profitability
of its corporations but by the overall prosperity of its people. With
population growth at 2 percent and an annualised real growth in
national income of around 4 percent since independence, growth in
Indian per-capita income has lagged behind that of other East Asian
countries.

In the Indian context, the investment case rests on the fact that past
performance provides no true guide to future prospects. India is poised
to enter a phase of sustainable GDP growth of around 6 percent to 7
percent a year. With population growth expected to decline further from
the current 1.9 percent per annum, per capita income should rise
substantially over the next decade.

With 20 percent of the world population and the sixth-largest economy,
India cannot be ignored. Her democratic ideology, the availability of
existing legal and accounting infrastructure along with the prevalence
of English as a common language provides for a level of investor
comfort not to be found in either China or Russia, for example.

No shortage of funds

THERE IS no shortage of investment funds which provide foreign
investors with equity exposure to India. According to Micropal, there
are 37 funds which invest in India and nine which invest in the Indian
sub-continent. Within the last six months these have been joined by
another six funds. With one or two exceptions most funds are
denominated in dollars.

Indian funds have benefited from the emerging markets boom of 1993.
Prior to 1993 there were only four specialist India funds, two of which
- India Fund A and India Growth Fund Inc - were managed by Unit Trust
of India, the largest domestic investment manager owned by the Indian
government. Morgan Stanley and ANZ Bank were the other institutions
which managed India funds with the India Magnum Fund and Second India
Investment Fund respectively.

Batterymarch (Commonwealth Equity Fund), Indosuez (Himalayan Fund) and
Jardine Fleming (Jardine Fleming) offered Indian Subcontinent Regional
funds.

Most management companies with global investment management pretensions
either offer India funds or are set to offer them in the near future,
although both Fidelity Investments and Templeton are currently notable
by their absence from the listings.

The largest players currently active in the market include Advantage
Advisors (India Fund Inc.), Morgan Stanley (MS India Investment Fund,
India MagnumFund and India Investment AG (with Bank Julius Baer),
Foreign & Colonial Emerging Markets (Indian Investment Company),
Indosuez (Himalayan Fund) and Jardine Fleming (JF India Fund Inc. and
JF India).

As a result of poor Indian stockmarket performance none of the funds
has provided outstanding returns, especially over the last 12 months.
The two GT funds which concentrate on the smaller company sector have
provided the best - albeit negative - returns.

TREASURY REPORT SAYS BYE-BYE TO INSURED BICS

The U.S. Treasury's report on modernizing the financial system calls
for the elimination of deposit insurance coverage for bank investment
contracts.
    The Treasury's report says BICs are an example of how "pass-through"
insurance can create competitive inequities.
    "In recent years, banks have begun to offer a product similar to GICs
(guaranteed investment contracts), called bank investment contracts, or
BICs, which explicitly take advantage of pass-through deposit insurance as
a marketing tool," the report said.
   The report acknowledges that banks can effectively manage the greater
degree of interest rate risk from BICs through contract limitations and
hedging strategies.
    The problem remains, however, that BICs are fully insured by the
government.
    "This provides banks with a new opportunity to attract large deposits
by expanding the use of the government's guarantee," the Treasury said.
    "Meanwhile, insurance companies offering GICs totally outside of the
safety net do not have this competitive advantage," it said.
   The Treasury report also said banking organizations should be permitted
to offer BICs to pension fund managers, but without extending to them
federal deposit insurance.

U.K. REGULATOR MAY WIDEN MORTGAGE-BACKED MARKET

Britain's building societies and mortgage lenders are confident that
the Building Societies Commission will reverse its proposals for the
continued exclusion of sterling mortgage-backed securities from the list
of instruments that thrifts can hold as liquid assets.
    A favorable decision will provide considerable new support for the
mortgage-backed securities market in Britain, giving greater placement
depth to the market and increasing overall market liquidity,
securitization specialists say. The ban was originally proposed in a
consultation paper issued by the Commission, the industry regulator for
thrifts, late last year. It proposed several amendments to the Building
Societies (Liquid Assets) Regulations of 1987, which sets the assets that
building societies may hold as liquid, easily divested assets.
    Mortgage-backeds were among the securities it ruled were not suitable
to be classed as liquid holdings. It said the mortgage-backed market in
Britain was not sufficiently developed to provide "an appropriate" medium
for thrifts' liquidity management.
    The Commission determined that assets must provide maximum capital
certainty and must be fully marketable. It said this must be achieved by
the assets having daily quoted, freely available prices and should be
traded on a recognized money market or stock exchange.
    Mortgage-backed securities tend to be held by institutional investors
to maturity, resulting in relatively low levels of trading and, therefore,
limited market liquidity, specialists say. When the mortgage market was in
its early stages in the mid-1980s, it was easy to understand why the
product should not be included as a liquid asset. But the market now
totals 9.5 billion pounds ($18 billion) in outstanding issues and is
considered well established, its promoters say. The Commission has asked
its members to give their views on the liquidity issue and these responses
are now being studied. An official announcement is expected within three
months.
    The Council of Mortgage Lenders, keen to see the development of
mortgage-backed securities, has previously voiced concern over the
Commission's ruling. Council members believe that mortgage bonds should
fully qualify as liquid assets, as Class-1 securities which carry the
highest rating.
    "Given the depth, quality, trading activity and number of market
making brokers in mortgage-backed securities, there seems no reason why
they should not be treated as first-class assets," a source at one
mortgage lender said. When the Commission was reviewing last year whether
mortgage-backeds should be reclassified as Class-1 assets, thrifts and
other mortgage lenders were convinced the regulator would decide to
include the securities. A substantial amount of lobbying has been taken
place on the issue, which should result in the Commission agreeing to
overturn the proposal, specialists say.

SWISS BANK GROUP BACKS $500 MILLION MICHIGAN NOTES

Karen Pierog
Michigan last week sold $500 million of general obligation notes that
featured an unconditional standby note purchase agreement provided by a
consortium of three Swiss banks.
    The standby agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp.
and Credit Suisse obligates the banks to provide funds for the principal
and interest payments on the notes in the event that money in the state's
set-aside fund for the issue are insufficient. The banks' participation in
the note issue is split into thirds.
    Susan Kish, a vice president at UBS, said that unlike a normal standby
purchase agreement, the pact between the banks and Michigan is
unconditional.
    "In a normal standby purchase agreement, there are usually conditions
that have to be satisfied before the facility can be drawn, such as no
event of default or bankruptcy," she explained. "In this agreement,
neither of those is applicable."
    Kish said the only conditions the state must meet are legal ones
involving the state's obligation to repay the banks.
    The notes were priced last week by a Prudential Securities Inc. group
to yield 4.60% to the Sept. 31, 1991 maturity. The were originally priced
to yield 4.65%, but strong investor demand for the notes enabled the
underwriters to trim the yield by five basis points.
    State officials made the decision to place a credit enhancement on the
issue about two weeks ago. The state had originally planned to sell the
note issue unenhanced last month but delayed the pricing because of a Feb.
6 state appellate court decision that called into question $450 million a
year of the state's single-business tax revenues, according to Nick
Khouri, the state's deputy treasurer.
    Khouri said when Gov. John Engler, on March 5, proposed a revenue
neutral amendment to the tax that would counter the fiscal effects of the
court ruling, the state decided to proceed with a credit-enhanced cash
flow borrowing to speed up the process.
    "We wanted to do the deal as quickly as possible at the highest
rating," he explained, adding that arbitrage considerations, which would
earn the state $25,000 a day, were also a factor in moving quickly on the
deal.
    The state also had to contend with the fact that on January 23,
Standard & Poor's Corp. placed $3.14 billion of state debt on CreditWatch
with negative implications, after the state Legislature and the Engler
administration reached an impasse over dealing with a current year budget
deficit.
    "We believe the use of this credit enhancement should negate that
impact in the market," said Wayne Workman, a senior vice president at
Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day Inc., the financial adviser on the deal.
    And the state - with a credit enhancement mechanism from the Swiss
banks that resembles a hybrid between a direct-pay letter of credit and a
standard standby purchase agreement - received the highest short-term
ratings of SP-1-plus from Standard & Poor's, MIG-1 from Moody's Investors
Service, and F-1-plus from Fitch Investors Service Inc.
    "The whole gist of the deal is that it walks and talks like a letter
of credit, but it's not," said Kevin Burke, a public finance director at
Prudential Securities Inc., the senior manager on the deal.

HOW MOODY'S ANALYZES BOND INSURANCE FIRMS

The following is excerpted from Moody's Investors Service's Global
Credit Analysis, published by IFR Books in London. In this excerpt,
Moody's describes some of its credit analysis methods for rating
individual corporate guarantors.

Organizational Structure

    A corporate financial guarantor's overall structure is an important
consideration in determining its ultimate ability and willingness to meet
policyholder obligations. As a starting point, Moody's analysts review all
of the company's operating units on a consolidated basis and examine any
intercompany reinsurance that may be in effect.
    To understand the true economic risk profile of the operation, the
company's reinsurance assumptions and cessions and the expense allocations
of individual companies are reviewed on a consolidated basis. This
analysis recognizes that most insurers have sufficient financial
flexibility to move corporate resources to individual subsidiaries, giving
them the ability to support weak units. Despite company-specific
restrictions which may be in effect, the confidence/sensitive nature of
the public debt market provides the insurer with a major incentive to make
good on claims of all its affiliated operating corporations.
    The activities of non-operating insurance units are also reviewed. For
example, the debt-to-equity ratios of holding companies or other
subsidiaries that have issued debt are examined, as are their debt service
capabilities. Potential demands under expected and stress conditions
should permit the company to meet its obligations and still allow adequate
subsidiary capital growth for business expansion. The key objective of
this analysis is to determine the insurer's true economic costs; amount
and type of affiliated reinsurance; and amount and holders of any debt.
Management has sufficient discretion within the regulatory structure to
permit the obligations or resources of affiliates to affect the insurer's
own ability to perform on policyholder obligations.
    While asset quality has primacy over other financial factors, earnings
are critical to a bond insurer's long-term creditworthiness because they
will dictate the company's ability to generate sufficient capital
internally or to maintain access to external sources of capital to meet
future needs.
    Corporate bond insurers do not generally have a standard premium
structure dictated by regulations. The starting point in analyzing the
quality of earnings is an assessment of the company's statutory accounting
compared with existing practices elsewhere in the financial markets. In
the U.S. markets, bond insurance premiums are typically priced in relation
to their value in reducing the debt issuer's total debt service cost.
Accordingly, while large up-front premiums are common in the municipal
bond insurance market, the predominance of shorter-term and amortizing
debt service in the corporate markets has meant that more premiums are
received annually. In essence, premiums represent a contractually agreed
rate multiplied by the periodic balance of principal (or debt service)
outstanding. It is not uncommon for corporate bond insurers to charge a
larger first-year premium with subsequent renewals at lower rates.

Capital Adequacy

    This key factor is best measured by relating the insurer's loss
potential to total capital (surplus plus contingency reserves). New York
State has established standards for the maximum risk-to-capital ratio;
risk is defined as aggregate policyholder limits or insured par. For most
bond insurers, this equals total debt service, or the entire amount of
debt issued. These regulations differentiate various types of underlying
insured obligations, with capital requirements varying between $300 of
risk to $1 of capital (municipal), to $100 of risk to $1 of capital
(corporate). Note, however, that from the credit analyst's point of view,
this gross measurement of risk has several major shortcomings.
    First, reported statutory risk for partial bond coverage versus 100%
coverage need not be consistent with true loss potential. This risk
measurement problem is similar to that experienced by first-loss letters
of credit or subordinated securities; although the dollar volume of the
obligation is important, it does not necessarily reflect the likely losses
on a pool of assets in the event of default.
    Second, the loss potentials of transactions, even within a particular
category defined by regulators, can vary dramatically. Third, neither
repayment sources nor temporal, geographic or originator diversification
is captured by the statutory risk measurement.
    Many other factors can vary significantly among companies and should
be considered within the unique context of a particular management
strategy, including the size of the unearned premium reserve, composition
of revenue between renewal and up-front premiums, the term of existing
insured exposures, and the quality of investment assets. Because of the
interactive nature of portfolio losses, revenue generation and the
historical position of a company, the impact of these factors frequently
can be clarified through computer simulation. Simulations are viewed as
only one of many tools necessary to assess the risk profile of a company
even when transaction quality estimates are available.
    Moody's model for corporate bond insurers incorporates historical
statutory balance sheet and income statements for an individual company,
company specific insured portfolio characteristics related to sector, and
the quality and contractual elements of reinsurance. The model can also
project a variety of outcomes depending on assumptions on key variables
such as premium rates, volume of business written, loss development and
quality, seasoning, and sector characteristics unique to the company.

FDIC INSURANCE STUDY OUT

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released a study on bank deposit
insurance that includes sections on how the private sector might
participate in the program in the future, according to George E. French,
chief of the financial markets section in the FDIC's research department.
    "The private insurer would set the premium rate and the FDIC would
base its premium level on the private insurer's risk estimates," French
said. He added that the full premium might not be downstreamed to the
private reinsurer.
    The FDIC has met with the staff of Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., who has
proposed legislation to reform deposit insurance, French said.
    The FDIC's report does not contain an extensive discussion of state
insurance systems or moving to a purely private insurance system, French
stressed. Moreover, the technical aspects of how contracts should be
written has not begun.
    The Treasury report's suggestion for the FDIC to do a pilot project,
which would include several banks and insurance companies, was favorably
received, French said. "We've already met with members of the municipal
bond insurance industry and their ideas are very useful," he said.
    Financial guaranty industry executives interested in receiving a copy
of the report can contact French at 202-898-3929. Industry representatives
interested in participating in any pilot projects can contact FDIC
chairman L. William Seidman or W. Roger Watson, director of research.
    "We're presented with an opportunity to become a part of history by
cooperating with the U.S. government and helping form policies that will
guide the financial services industry into the 21st century," a senior
executive of a financial guaranty company said. "I think the industry may
shake its head in disbelief, years from now, if we miss this opportunity."

QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY, STRESSED BY ENHANCE UNIT

Guaranty Risk Services Inc. acted as financial adviser on about $58
million taxable and tax-exempt principal and interest last year that was
insured by Asset Guaranty Reinsurance Co., according to Kenneth C.
Sherman, GRS senior vice president in charge of originations.
    While GRS acknowledges the dollar amount is not large compared to the
amounts insured by the major monoline financial guarantors, the firm is
pleased with the high quality of the deals it did. "Given the real estate
markets, we could have done a ton of deals, but not with the same credit
quality," said a GRS spokesman.
    GRS, a subsidiary of Enhance Financial Services Group, was formed last
year to originate and underwrite deals that are subsequently insured by
Asset Guaranty. That insurance is rated triple-A by Duff & Phelps Inc.
    "The differential between unenhanced and Asset Guaranty enhanced
transactions has been roughly 200 basis points," Sherman added.
    To date, deals originated and underwritten by GRS have all been real
estate related. GRS is interested in smaller, middle-market transactions
that have a high credit quality.
    "We do not originate deals that primary insurance companies would
insure," Sherman said.
    Currently, GRS has about $60 million in deals in its underwriting
pipeline and several should appear in the market during April. GRS'
average deal size is between $3 million and $10 million.
    Most of GRS' deals have been multifamily housing transactions that
refund or restructure existing debt.
    "GRS will not accept construction, lease-up or refurbishing risks,"
Sherman stressed. Issues can be structured with these risks if an approved
third party is willing to take the risk instead of GRS, he said.
   GRS is finding its business growing at a fast pace because regional
investment banks around the nation are trying to find credit enhancers
following the pullback by banks and savings and loans in providing letters
of credit. Additionally, the government enhancement programs are moving at
a "sluggish" pace, Sherman reported.
    Not only are regional investment banks welcoming GRS, Sherman said,
but the investment community is referring deals to it.
    "Investors are doing their due diligence, and the depth and level of
GRS' underwriting has prompted some investors to send deals to us," he
explained.
    GRS' underwriting department has several criteria that must be met.
First, underwriters look at the cash flow and demand debt coverage of
greater than 1.25 times. Additionally, the loan to value ratio must not
exceed 75%. "These two criteria work together because a deal with a 90%
loan to value is not going to have 1.25 times the coverage," he said.
    Finally, GRS requires an equity contribution from the developer,
typically at least 10%, Sherman said. This equity contribution makes it
harder for a developer to walk away from any deal. GRS-approved
transactions usually have a maturity of 10 to 12 years.
    During 1990, GRS acted as financial advisor to Asset Guaranty, which
insured the following transactions:
    * $9.36 million multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds for
Mankato, Minnesota. The placement agent was Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc.,
and the underlying credit support was provided by the Highland Hills of
Mankato Limited Partnership Project.
    * $1.7-million industrial development revenue bonds for the
Development Authority of Cartersville, Georgia. The sole underwriter for
the transaction was Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. The bonds are
supported by the Nantucket Industries Inc. project and are subject to a
mandatory tender for purchase on April 1, 2001.
    * $8.9-million industrial development refunding revenue bonds for the
Illinois Development Finance Authority. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. and Young Capital Corp. were co-underwriters. The $8.5
million tax-exempt series-A refunding bonds and $400,000 series-B revenue
bonds are supported by the Orleans-Institute Place Associates Project.
    * $6.78 million of multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds for the
North Dakota Housing Finance Agency. The deal was managed by Dain Bosworth
Inc.
     * $6.8-million Series-1 commercial development revenue refunding
bonds and $470,000 Series-2 taxable commercial development revenue
refunding bonds for the Port Authority of St. Paul, Minn. Dain Bosworth
was sole manager. Fort Road Medical/Irvine Park Towers Project provided
the underlying credit support.

FSA-BACKED PROGRAM BOOSTS AUSSIE SECURITIZATION

    An Australian special-purpose corporation that carries credit
insurance from Financial Security Assurance is planning to sell its second
and third offerings of asset-backed securities.
    The corporation, known by its acronym, SAFE - for Secured Asset
Funding Entity Ltd. - was set up last year by Bankers Trust Australia Ltd.
to offer a quicker way for issuers to securitize both mortgage and non
mortgage assets through a standardized format.
    Securities issued through SAFE are backed by FSA and the State
Government Insurance Commission of South Australia. FSA is the senior
guarantor of the pro-gram, and securities issued through it are triple-A
rated. South Australia is rated double-A-plus.
    So far, one issue has been done through SAFE - last November, a $100
million (Australian) offering by Town & Country W.A. Building Society was
backed by residential and commercial mortgages. That deal consisted of
five-year fixed bullet bonds.
    In the latest transactions, retailer David Jones is planning to
securitize credit card receivables, and the St. George Building Society is
offering mortgage-backed bonds. FSA would not confirm that either deal is
in the works.
    The Jones securitization is a resurfacing of a financing plan that
France's Societe Generale was putting together last year. Originally
planned to be launched internationally out of Hong Kong, the A$180 million
transaction will be now be issued through SAFE in the Australian domestic
market.
    A dealer group of seven banks is participating in the transaction,
with Societe Generale acting as arranger.
    St. George is pressing ahead with a mortgage-backed transaction,
totaling about A$200 million. When the SAFE concept was first announced,
it was expected that St. George and Beneficial Finance would launch issues
early in 1991. But Beneficial's plans are on hold, apparently due to loan
loss problems among affiliates in the Australian banking system.
    Sources say the new transactions will help popularize the concept of
securitization after some recent setbacks in Australia, including doubts
over a special vehicle devised by Schroders Australia Ltd., which would
have been Australia's first internationally rated vehicle for securitized
mortgages. The entity was named PUMA, for Pooled Unlisted Mortgage Assets.
Schroders initially hoped to raise A$50 million through it by the end of
1990. But the difficulties in the Australian bond market prompted
Schroders last month to cancel its plans to enter the secondary mortgage
market.

MOODY'S COVERS THE SECONDARY

Moody's Investors Service has begun a new publication that tracks bond
insurance activity on a weekly basis, publicly divulging, for the first
time, the par amounts of specific secondary market deals.
    Secondary market insurance data have proved elusive because financial
guarantors felt publication would give their competition an unnecessarily
frank glimpse of single-risk capacity limits.
    Complete capacity information will remain a mystery, but the data in
Perspective on Bond Insurance will help round out the industry's yearly
assumption of risk.

SHORT TAKES ON HIGH YIELDS

Rickel Home Centers filed with the U.S Bankruptcy Court in
Delaware to restructure its outstanding 13.5% senior notes through a
Chapter 11 proceeding. The proposal called for the exchange of its $126.5
million in outstanding senior notes due 2001 for $63.25 million in new
13.5% notes, roughly 84% of the reorganized company's common stock and cash
equaling approximately 7% of the original notes' principal balance. Over
two-thirds of the noteholders had agreed to the swap, company officials
said.
     The plan, which also provided for the payment of vendors
and other unsecured creditors, must now receive the approval of the
company's creditor committee and the bankruptcy court`

     Moody's Investor Service placed Spreckels Industries'
senior secured notes under review for possible upgrade. Any ratings change
would affect $70 million in 11.5% securities due 2002 which currently carry
B2 ratings. The issuer recently announced the imminent sale of its
unprofitable sugar unit to Imperial Holly for $24 million and will
concentrate on its material handling equipment business, Moody's said. The
notes were rated B+/developing by S&P.
     Separately, Spreckels rejected an unsolicited acquisition
offer from American Enterprise LLC`

     Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc. will augment its real
estate portfolio with the acquisition of the Taj Mahal casino from Taj
Mahal Holding Corp. The purchase will result in the retirement of $726.4
million in outstanding Trump Taj Mahal 11.35% first mortgage bonds due in
1999 at par plus accrued interest. Bondholders will also be able to redeem
780,242 shares of Class B common stock at $0.50 per share. A debt offering
of up to $750 million would generate the funds necessary for the merger and
retirement of outstanding debt, the company said.
     In addition to the Taj Mahal casino, Trump Hotels & Casino
Resorts operates the Trump Plaza Hotel in New York and the Trump Indiana
riverboat, which is scheduled to open in Michigan in April. Trump Castle
stands as the last remaining Trump property outstanding and is widely
expected to be folded into the public company in the near future.
     Despite the combination of the various facilities within a
single corporate structure, several market players expected the fortunes of
the underlying properties would continue to drive credit perceptions.
"Investors will continue to look through to the fundamentals of each
subsidiary, so they'll still trade like separate non-recourse entities,"
said John Barnes, assistant vice president at Prudential Securities`

     Standard & Poor's withdrew Maxtor Corp.'s B corporate
rating and CCC+ rating of the company's $100 million in outstanding
subordinated debt. The moves resulted from Maxtor's ongoing discussions
with unrated Hyundai Electronics of America concerning the purchase of all
of Maxtor's outstanding stock, the rating agency said`

     The U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Louisiana
approved the sale of Crescent City Capital Development Corp. to Mirage
Resorts. Parent company Capital Gaming International, Inc. sold its
bankrupt Louisiana subsidiary to the Mirage for $55 million plus the
assumption of $6.5 million in equipment debt`

     Moody's also assigned a B3 rating to Alvey Systems Inc.'s
first public issue. Due in 2002, the $100 million in senior subordinated
notes will be used to fund a buyout/acquisition of the company by a portion
of its current management. The notes will be subordinated to a $30 million
secured bank facility and future senior debt`

     Primeco Inc. reached an agreement to purchase fellow
equipment rental and sales company Vibroplant U.S. for approximately $67.5
million. The transaction will be funded by Primeco's credit facility as
well as an additional $10 million equity investment from shareholders
including Investcorp S.A. Primeco currently has $100 million in senior debt
outstanding carrying BB- ratings from S&P`

     Benton Oil and Gas Co. agreed to sell the bulk of its
domestic properties to Shell Offshore Inc. The Shell Oil Co. subsidiary
will purchase the stock of Benton's wholly-owned subsidiary Benton Oil and
Gas Company of Louisiana for $35.4 million.
     Benton will devote the subsequent pre-tax gain of roughly
$10 million to the development of its Venezuelan operations and de-
leveraging roughly $10 million in debt, according to company officials. The
transaction was expected to close before the end of the first quarter.

JOHN HANCOCK CONSTRUCTIVE DESPITE CREDIT CONCERNS

Flush with cash from retail investors, John Hancock
Advisers has accelerated its high yield purchasing while jockeying to guard
against declining credit fundamentals.
     Indeed, the Boston-based mutual fund has kept pace with
increased cash inflows even as senior vice president Fred Cavanaugh has
scaled back high yield holdings as a percentage of the firm's Strategic
Income Fund.
     "The technicals are in fantastic shape," said Cavanaugh,
who manages the Strategic Income fund and oversees all of John Hancock's
junk purchases. "There's a lot of interest [in high yield bonds] from
cross-over buyers from the high-quality corporate sector and we've seen a
tremendous amount of interest from retail investors."
     Faced with looming credit concerns, however, Cavanaugh has
reduced the diversified portfolio's high yield allocation to roughly 40%
from the "high to mid-40's" a year ago. Beyond some $200 million in
domestic high yield securities, the Strategic Income fund also contains
international debt, governments and preferred stock.
     John Hancock holds nearly $1 billion in high yield bonds
among its Strategic Income, High Yield and High-Grade Bond funds, the
latter of which currently holds some 15%-20% in junk bonds. All told, the
firm manages pver $16 billion in assets for retail  and private investors.
Bullish Near Term
     Despite rising default rates and the reduction of exposure
levels, John Hancock's expectations for the coming year in the high yield
market aren't especially dire. Cavanaugh remains "constructive" on credit
fundamentals for the first half of 1996 and is "more cautiously optimistic"
regarding the latter portion of the year.
     "We should see sufficient economic activity to support cash
flows, even in the cyclicals" during the first portion of the year,
Cavanaugh said.
     This view has been bolstered by the recent price increases
posted by several steel and paper issuers. "A little bit of inflation can
be good" because it indicates healthy demand and bolsters short-term
profitability, Cavanaugh said.
     Away from cyclical issues, Cavanaugh looked for each sector
of the telecommunications market including cable and paging to continue
posting strong performances as their product offerings and user markets
steadily mature.
     Despite this generally positive outlook, Cavanaugh has
taken several moderate steps to reduce credit risk by shortening high yield
maturities and turning to higher coupons.
Reining In Credit Risk
     "Higher coupons tend to temper the pricing change needed to
get a particular yield," Cavanaugh said. "But if you run into a distress
situation, [the security] will begin trading strictly on a price basis, so
it offers little or no protection" in a default scenario.
     Otherwise, the firm has gravitated toward the stronger
names and more senior paper in the cyclical sectors. Hancock hasn't pushed
credit quality above the single-B level since cross-over buying has
inflated double-B pricing and driven down yields, Cavanaugh said.
     Hancock has also rotated into overseas debt, which has
risen from roughly 30% to 40% of the Strategic Income fund. International
purchases have included some sovereign issues from Western Europe and high
yield corporates such as the UK cable offerings.
     "It's in a growth stage comparable to where we were eight
or nine years ago, and there are some fairly well-heeled investors
involved," Cavanaugh said of the set of UK cable deals.
     Meanwhile, Cavanaugh has avoided the retailing and
restaurant sectors of the domestic high yield market, where he predicted a
difficult operating environment going forward.
     "I would want to see the fourth quarter numbers,
particularly for the retailers, before I'd change my view," Cavanaugh said.
"I'm not expecting robust results out of any of them, so it could be a
sector to avoid this year."

PUERTO RICAN BANK TAPS MARKET VIA 144A OFFERING

After eyeing the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of
Puerto Rico became the second bank from the island to issue subordinated
debt last December.
     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100
million offering of 10-year subordinated notes with a coupon of 7.625% at
99.277 to yield 7.730%, or 200 basis points over Treasuries.
     The bank's first independent bond offering carried a split
rating of BB+/Baa3 and was packaged as a Rule 144A transaction, enabling a
public-style execution of the offering without SEC registration.
     Lead Jefferies & Co. teamed with co-manager Smith Barney to
place the deal with roughly 15 insurance companies.
     The transaction closely followed the initial subordinate
offering from fellow Puerto Rican bank BanPonce Corp., which placed $125
million in BBB/Baa2 securities through lead CS First Boston. o

KCS Cues 144A Deal
     KCS Energy Inc. began marketing a $150 million Rule 144A
transaction through lead Smith Barney with pricing expected late this week.
     Rated B1 by Moody's Investor Service, the senior notes will
carry a four-year non-call period with a seven-year maturity and a $35
million equity carve-out, sources said. Pricing information was
unavailable.
     The rating reflects KCS' long-standing gas contract

litigation with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Moody's said. Moreover,
the above-market contract had contributed to the KCS' steady growth in
earnings, the rating agency added.
     KCS will use roughly $120 million of the proceeds to repay
outstanding debt and an additional $25 million to repay a bridge loan from
Nomura Securities, sources said. Bqsed in Edison, N.J., KCS explores for,
develops, markets, and transports natural gas and crude oil.

CHEMICAL RAISES $2.2 BILLION FOR RIVERWOOD PURCHASE

Chemical Securities has arranged a $2.2 billion financing
for the purchase of Riverwood International by a group of investors led by
leveraged buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CDR).
     The funds will be raised through the issuance of $650
million of debt and $1.55 billion in bank loans slated for the syndicated
market, sources said. Officials at both Riverwood and CDR couldn't be
reached by press time while Chemical declined comment.
     Currently a subsidiary of 81% shareholder Manville Corp.,
Atlanta-based Riverwood is involved in the packaging and manufacture of
packaging equipment for the beverage industry. The transaction was
originally announced in October and is expected to close by the end of the
first quarter, Manville officials said.

UPGRADE RATIOS IMPROVE, BUOYING '96 CREDIT OUTLOOK

The ratio of high yield rating upgrades relative to
downgrades improved during 1995, suggesting that credit deterioration
should remain relatively muted during the coming year.
     Standard & Poor's lowered its marks for 126 domestic
speculative grade issues totaling $93.8 billion and upgraded 142 series
worth $108.5 billion during 1995. Moody's Investor Service, meanwhile,
downgraded 123 speculative grade securities equaling $25.3 billion while
granting higher marks to 100 issues of $37.26 billion.
     The figures compared favorably with those seen at the end
of the last economic expansion and should bode well for delinquency rates
during 1996, several analysts said.
     "Further deterioration seems likely. However, the magnitude
of the losses should fall well short of the numbers seen in 1989 and 1990,"
said Moody's senior economist John Lonski. During that period, downgrades
more than doubled upgrades in dollar terms, Lonski said.
     S&P's 1995 results reversed the previous year's totals, in
which downgrades outpaced upgrades in terms of both number and dollar
volumes. Although the number of Moody's downgrades exceeded upgrades in
1995, the ratio of upgrades relative to downgrades improved on a dollar
basis and reached its highest level in 12 years. (See table, page 3.)
     "If it weren't for the retailers and the manufacturers of
non-durable consumer goods, we would have had many more upgrades than
downgrades" in 1995, Lonski said. Indeed, Moody's downgraded 70 such issues
totaling $23.6 billion while uprgrading 24 issues worth $16.4 billion last
year.
     Moreover, the dollar amount of fallen angels dropped to
$9.83 billion from $12.9 billion even though the number of issues increased
to 12 from a record-low nine in 1994, according to Moody's. The rating
agency promoted 24 issues totaling $10.8 billion from speculative to
investment grade, compared to 17 issues representing $10.8 billion in 1994.
     These high yield numbers coincided with an overall
improvement of corporate credit quality during 1995, according to S&P.
Overall, the rating agency upgraded $210 billion in industrial debt and
downgraded $118 billion. Upgrades were concentrated in automotive,
chemical, health care and high tech industries while media and
entertainment, consumer products and retailers bore the brunt of the rating
reductions.

Gradual Credit Decline?
     Despite these encouraging numbers, both agencies registered
a higher number of speculative grade downgrades for the third straight
year. Moreover, the dollar amount of S&P high yield downgrades climbed for
the fourth time since 1991.
     While these trends have more recently coincided with higher
default rates, most observers linked the increased downgrade activity to
the issuance of smaller parcels of riskier debt.
     "You have had a significant increase in single-B debt, so
that would contribute to the higher numbers," said Diane Vazza, director of
fixed-income research at S&P. Vazza added that the abundance of first-time
issuers over the past several years also contributed to the accelerated
downgrade activity.

MARKET SURVIVES TOUGH WEEK;  GROWING CALENDAR NEXT OBSTACLE

The high yield market survived yet another week largely
unscathed despite the fact that the long bond jumped from 6.04% to 6.15%
and the Dow skidded by over 100 points by Thursday's close.
     Replete with fresh insurance allocations and new inflows
from mutual fund buyers, the high yield sector welcomed its first issuance
of the year and once again weathered downturns in other capital markets and
the continuing budget standoff.
     "Most people have a lot of money to put to work right now,
so they're buying yield first and credit second," one high yield trader
said. Indeed, several dealers reportedly lightened their positions in
anticipation of rougher market conditions later month.
     Following light trading earlier in the week due to the
blizzard conditions along the entire East Coast, secondary volumes reached
moderate levels by mid-week. Aggregate high yield prices lost roughly a
quarter point on Wednesday as the 30-year bond widened to yield 6.19%
before tightening on Thursday following a slight comeback by both the stock
and Treasury markets to finish essentially unchanged for the week.
     Typical January favorites casinos and steel continued to
lead the gainers, although several market players questioned the latter
trend given recent declines in auto sales. "People bulled up [on steel]
with the price increases, but the demand for autos will determine whether
that sticks or not," one trader said.

Issuance Resumes
     The continued strength of the high yield sector relative to
other markets could be short-lived with upwards of $5 billion in issuance
expected during the coming weeks.
     Merrill Lynch priced the first deal of the year, launching
$125 million for Young Broadcasting with co-manager JP Morgan. Originally
sized at $100 million, the offering bore a 9% variable-price coupon and
comes due in January 2006.
     Further issuance failed to materialize, although deal flow
was expected to begin in earnest this week with 21 road shows totaling over
$5.2 billion reportedly underway or scheduled before the end of the month.
     "That's a lot of issuance for this market to get through,
so I wouldn't be surprised to see a correction," one high yield trader
said. "The second half of this month should be a lot tougher than the
first."
     Heavy deal flow could stretch into February and even March,
several market players said, as issuers rush to lock in the cheaper funding
afforded by low rates.
     Moreover, the rumored closing of the SEC due to the budget
impasse could spur issuers to crowd the market during the next six weeks,
several traders added.

Deals, Deals, Deals
     Salomon Brothers will burst from the blocks with a full
slate including $100 million from APS, $450 million from MFS
Communications, an $800 million multi-tranche offering from Sprint Cellular
and a $175 million transaction from Miami-based Telemundo, several sources
said.
     Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette should also post a big January
with a jumbo $1.1 billion, six-tranche offering from El Paso Electric Co.
The Texas utility will issue five series of BB-/Ba3 first mortgage bonds
and a sixth level of preferred stock to finance its reorganization
following bankruptcy, sources said. DLJ will also reportedly lead $120
million in nine-year senior subordinates from Doane Products with a five-
year non-call period.
     Merrill Lynch was expected to return with a $150 million
offering from Rogers  Communications that was originally slated for last
week but pushed back to Friday or early this week by the blizzard.
     Otherwise, the underwriter also reportedly held the books for
three Rule 144A offerings: a $115 million deal from steel producer Bar
Technology, a $200 million offering for Hollinger Publishing and $75
million from BE Aerospace.
     Hotel issuers expected before the end of the month included
Prime Hospitality with $120 million through Smith Barney, a $127 million
deal from Courtyard Marriott via Lehman Brothers and a $165 million
offering from Coast Hotel & Casino lead by Bear Stearns.
     Smith Barney also held the reins on a $100 million offering
from financial company First Nationwide, sources said.
     The issuance calendar will apparently be rounded out with a
$100 million offering from Chancellors via Bankers Trust, a $120 million
deal from Dynacare through Citicorp, $150 million from InterCel through
Morgan Stanley and $650 million in Riverwood International debt led by
Chemical Securities. (See related article, page 3.). Viking Star subsidiary
Teekay Shipping Corp. was also in line with $225 million in shipping
mortgage bonds through Goldman Sachs.

DTTI TO SPLIT ACCOUNTING AND CONSULTING INTO SEPARATE ENTITIES

DELOITTE TOUCHE Tohmatsu International looks set to split its
accounting and consulting businesses into two new, distinct legal
entities along the same lines that Arthur Andersen did in 1989.

The consulting arm will be called Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group,
while the accounting practice will be known as Deloitte & Touche. The
process will begin in 1996 and over time, it is intended that the new
structure will comprise all of the national practices around the world.

The aim is for the consulting group to be a unified global entity with
its own profit centre, owned by all of the group's consulting partners.
However, the accounting practices will continue to organise their
profit centres along national lines.

Late last year, DTTI announced that the UK and US consulting practices
were to join forces as the first stage in the creation of the new
consulting group (IAB 175). Last September, D&T's US member formally
announced the establishment of Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, and
the UK firm will make a similar announcement in London on February 1.

A spokesman for DTTI said that "delicate ongoing" negotiations are
taking place with other European members but it could be two years or
more before those firms sign up to the global entity. Other
geographical regions are having similar talks, he said, although all of
the areas are at "different stages" of negotiation.

Both Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group and Deloitte & Touche will
continue to operate under the international administrative umbrella of
DTTI.

Serge Audouin, DTTI's head of management consultancy for Europe, said:
"Initially, this is a management integration; the financial split will
come later. This is driven by the need to globalise our practice in
line with the way clients are operating." The move depends on the
approval of the partnerships in some countries, including the US.

Meanwhile, Touche Ross, DTTI's UK member, is considering following the
lead of Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young by converting to a limited
liability partnership (LLP) with its legal base in Jersey (IAB 177),
sources within the firm said.

But, since the necessary changes to Jersey law have yet to be enacted,
the firm is unwilling to make any public announcement. The sources said
Touche is hoping the prospect of seeing accounting firms set up
offshore will prompt the UK Government into changing UK law to allow
LLPs, preventing the need for a move to Jersey.

Touche is also set to change its name. The firm will be known as
Deloitte & Touche. Until now, the Deloitte name in the UK has belonged
to Coopers & Lybrand after the worldwide merger of Deloitte Haskins &
Sells and Touche Ross fell through in the UK in 1990, and the DH&S
practice was snapped up by C&L.

Originally, the Deloitte name was not to be available to Touche until
the end of 1996, but C&L agreed to an earlier date.

ACCA TO CHANGE NAME

READERS WILL recall that the UK's Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants (ACCA) sought to change its name to the Association of
Chartered Public Accountants so members could use the coveted
"chartered" title.

Well, the ACCA's best plans were partially scuttled when the Privy
Council, which oversees bodies with a royal charter, refused it
permission to use the word public. Members, however, were given the
go-ahead to use the chartered title.

The ACCA spent the Christmas holiday chewing it over and duly announced
that it is changing its name to the Association of Chartered Certified
Accountants, or ACCA for short.

Following the Privy Council's decision, the ACCA hierarchy decided that
it would be best for members to be known as Chartered Certified
Accountants, hence the new corporate name. The proposal goes to members
at the AGM in May, after which Privy Council approval will again be
sought.

Is it any wonder the public has problems distinguishing between the
various qualifications?

COOPERS & LYBRAND

PARTNERS AT Coopers & Lybrand in the UK will no doubt have taken notice
of a small ad which appeared in the Financial Times on January 8.

The ad read:"Do you have an outstanding claim against Coopers &
Lybrand? Do you have a Paramount claim against Cork Gully [C&L's former
insolvency arm]? Would you be prepared to appear in a TV documentary
about Paramount claims? If so, please send brief details initially to
Box B4181, Financial Times . . ."

It should be interesting viewing.

HONG KONG TO CONSIDER IMMUNITY FOR AUDITORS REPORTING FRAUD

A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY working party is being set up in Hong Kong to
consider a controversial government proposal to give statutory
protection to auditors who report fraud at client companies.

Formation of the working party was announced at the annual general
meeting of the Hong Kong Society of Accountants (HKSA) in December.

The group will include representatives from government, market
regulators, law enforcement agencies, the business community and other
interest groups. It will also consider the wider issue of combatting
corporate fraud.

The government first proposed giving statutory immunity to auditors who
report suspected fraud in 1994. The immunity, which would be similar to
that currently enjoyed by auditors of banks and securities houses,
would enable auditors to report their suspicions to the authorities
without fear of being sued by their clients.

Originally, the law was to have applied to both listed and non-listed
companies. But, in a progress report issued last autumn, the government
said it would narrow the scope of the legislation because of the
"highly complicated issues" involved.

According to Louis Wong, HKSA executive director and registrar, the
government has now decided that the law should apply to quoted
companies only.

Wong stressed that the new law will not put auditors under any
obligation to report fraud. "It only applies in the event that they
report it," he said.

But accountants are still worried that the immunity will create
problems for their relations with clients.

"We are concerned that an expectation might be created to seek out
fraud and that it might unfavourably affect the trust between the
client and the auditor," outgoing HKSA president Nicholas Etches told
the AGM.

A survey conducted by KPMG last year shows that fraud is a growing
problem in Hong Kong. The firm found that 80 percent of responding
companies thought the incidence of fraud would increase, compared with
70 percent a year earlier. Some 77 percent said fraud is a"serious
problem", up from 62 percent in 1994.

BKR SIGNS UP MEMBER FIRM IN TURKEY

BKR INTERNATIONAL has expanded its global coverage by signing up a
member firm in Turkey. The firm, ISIK Yeminli Mali Musavirlik, which
was previously unaffiliated, provides BKR with Turkish representation
for the first time.

ISIK, which joined the BKR network towards the end of last year, posted
fiscal 1995 revenues of TL16 billion ($270,000), an increase of just
over 52 percent on 1994.

The six-partner firm operates out of one office in Istanbul and employs
12 professionals and three support staff. Fifty-five percent of fee
income comprises audit and accountancy work, with tax contributing 30
percent and other work the remaining 15 percent.

BKR targeted Turkey because of the steady growth in its economy as well
as its growing links with the European Union. "Turkey has developed
close links with the European Union and may one day be a full member,"
said Charles Tucker, BKR's London-based secretary.

There was a growing demand among BKR's European members, particularly
in Germany, for representation in Turkey.

BKR's search for a suitable firm took 12 months, according to Tucker,
who said ISIK was selected from a short list of two. The firm was
chosen because of its size and profile, and the fact that it
has"definite expansion plans" outside Istanbul played a key role in the
final decision. It is also longer established than the other firms
which were under consideration.

Many of ISIK's clients are in the textiles, shipping and consumer
products industries. Work for multi-national clients currently accounts
for about 25 percent of its revenues. No list of clients is available.

In IAB's annual world survey last month, BKR ranked 20th with revenues
of $341 million, an increase of 10.7 percent on 1994.

NEXIA TO RECRUIT TWO MEMBER FIRMS IN SOUTH AFRICA

NEXIA INTERNATIONAL is set to recruit its first member firms in South
Africa following several months of negotiations. The group has all but
formalised arrangements with Levitt Kirson, the CKL (now known as AGN
International) member firm, and Josman & Seidel, one of three HLB
affiliates there.

The two firms, which will give Nexia coverage in Johannesburg, Durban
and Cape Town, are forming an association of independent firms with a
third member likely to be added in Port Elizabeth later this year.

The combined fee income of the firm will add about R13 million ($3.6
million) to Nexia's global revenues. Levitt Kirson's Johannesburg
operation, which has eight partners and around 45 staff, had 1995
revenues of roughly R6 million, according to managing partner Lennie
Furman, while the firm's Durban office, which has two partners and
around 12 staff, had revenues of between R1.5 million and R1.8 million.
The two are separate profit centres.

Josman & Seidel, meanwhile, has revenues of roughly R5.5 million. The
firm has eight partners and a total staff of around 50.

Each of the firms will use the Nexia name in conjunction with their own
- the first time that Nexia has allowed its affiliates to use its name.
Previously, the Amsterdam-based group prohibited the use of its title
so as to shield the network from any possible litigation.

Nigel Hodges, Nexia's executive director, said the change of heart
followed legal advice. "We have taken legal advice both from the US and
the UK and the lawyers said there would be very little extra exposure
by having a link name used by members," he explained. "We just have to
make it clear that we are an international firm of separate independent
accountants."

Nexia's board of directors will meet in South Africa on March 10 and 11
to rubberstamp the use of the Nexia name, and to formally approve both
firms' applications.

Initially, the local firms will operate independently of each other.
According to Furman, the firms will have a common staff training
policy, undertake joint marketing campaigns and tender jointly for
certain work.

Furman cited dissatisfaction with CKL as its reason for quitting. "We
were unhappy with the CKL situation," he said. AGN, into which CKL has
merged, has "still got a long way to go to reach the size of Nexia", he
added.

Nick Blake, AGN's chief executive, said he was "disappointed" at the
news of Levitt Kirson's departure although it was not "totally
unexpected". He has arranged a meeting on January 18 with an
unaffiliated firm in Cape Town in the hope that it may fill the gap.

Sonny Josman, Josman & Seidel's managing partner, said the local firms
may eventually merge."I would think we will make a decision on that
within the next three years," he said. According to Josman, the
federation may expand into Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe if suitable
firms can be found.

HLB's chief executive, Peter Frost, said incompatibilities between
Josman & Seidel and its Johannesburg member, Freedman Scher, resulted
in the split of its federation.

In addition to losing Josman & Seidel, Alleson & Company, HLB's Durban
affiliate, has also given notice to quit. Frost said replacements in
Cape Town and Durban have already been lined up, although he declined
to name them. He was planning to meet with at least one of the
prospective firms on January 15 in Johannesburg.

Nexia has never had a presence in South Africa, although one of its
predecessors, Spicer & Oppenheim, was represented by Fischer Hoffman
Stride until 1990 when the local firm switched to Pannell Kerr Forster.

US BILL ELIMINATING FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS IS PASSED

THE PRIVATE Securities Litigation Reform Act, which among other things
will eliminate frivolous lawsuits against accounting firms, has been
passed into law despite being vetoed by President Clinton.

The passing of the bill has been welcomed by the US accounting
profession. Ernst & Young chairman Philip Laskawy said: "Frivolous
lawsuits in the past have drained resources from economic activities
such as research and development and new investment that fuel business
growth. Those with legitimate securities claims still have recourse
through our legal system. By eliminating meritless lawsuits, the new
bill will make the American economy more productive and efficient."

A statement from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
said: "The passage of this legislation is testament to the widely-held
belief that the tide of frivolous securities litigation in this country
must be stopped and sanity restored to a legal system clearly out of
balance.

"This bill is a fair balance between the rights of truly- defrauded
investors and those start-up companies and outside professionals who
have become victims of a small group of entrepreneurial lawyers abusing
the legal system."

The bill had been awaiting the signature of the US President when IAB
went to press with the final issue of last year (IAB 177), and
proponents of the reforms were confident that Clinton would sign it
into law.

However, he chose to veto the legislation under enormous pressure from
consumer groups and trial lawyers.

In the end, the veto was too late as both houses of Congress were able
to override his decision. The House of Representatives had backed the
bill by 309 votes to 100 - 29 votes more than needed for the override.
The Senate vote, 68 votes to 30 in favour, eventually proved sufficient
to override the president's decision having originally fallen just
short of the total required.

The new law is designed to eliminate routine filing of class action
lawsuits against public companies with no more evidence than a sharp
drop in stock price. It will also prevent the targeting of defendants
with"deep pockets", without regard to their culpability.

The legislation provides a new safe harbour provision for
forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide
prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those
statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by
meaningful cautionary statements identifying factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those projected.

KPMG STOKES KENNEDY CROWLEY DROPS LOCAL NAMES

KPMG STOKES Kennedy Crowley, Ireland's largest accounting firm, has
altered its identity by dropping the local names from its title.

The change, which took effect on January 1, is part of a worldwide move
by KPMG members to standardise the group's identity. In February of
last year, KPMG's UK affiliate dropped the Peat Marwick name from its
logo (IAB 157).

"Our new name will provide us with a single strong identity worldwide
and help us to assist our clients to compete even more effectively in
both the Irish market and overseas," said managing partner Jerome
Kennedy.

The SKC partnership was founded in 1972, although the firm's roots can
be traced back to 1876 when Stokes Brothers was formed. It became the
Irish member of Peat Marwick International in 1980, and became the
Irish representative of KPMG in 1987 following the global merger with
KMG.

SKC operates as one partnership in Ireland, unlike most of its Big Six
rivals which have separate entities north and south. The firm operates
out of four offices, employs over 800 people, and had fiscal 1995
revenues of IR#36.2 million ($58 million), a drop of just over 1
percent on the previous year.

KPMG's move means that Craig Gardner Price Waterhouse is the only one
of the Big Six in Ireland to retain the local firm's name as part of
its identity.

AGN INTERNATIONAL SELECTS FIRST BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AGN INTERNATIONAL, the new network formed on January 1 from the merger
of CKL International with Intercontinental Accounting Associates, has
appointed a ten-man board of directors, five from each group.

Six of the board members are based in Europe, three in North America
and one in South America. The CKL members are: France's Guillaume de
Saint-Gerand, CKL's last chairman; London-based Leon Nahon; Peter Grote
from Switzerland; German Rainer Schmidt; and Julio Pilon, who is based
in Uruguay.

The IAA contingent comprises: Louis Philips from France; Thomas
Harbrecht, IAA's last president, Raymond Falconetti and Gary Seehoff
all of the US; and Steven Jeffcott from the UK.

CKL's Nick Blake fills the position of chief executive and continues to
be based in CKL's headquarters in London, but no chairman has yet been
chosen. Blake said a decision is unlikely until the board holds its
first full meeting in mid-March in Miami.

DUTCH MEMBER'S LEAD PARTNER MADE ACPA EURO CHAIRMAN

ACPA INTERNATIONAL has appointed a new European chairman. Wiendelt de
Lange, managing partner of ACPA's Dutch member, Eshuis Groep, took on
the role of chairman on January 1. His term of office will last for two
and a half years.

De Lange's aims for his term include increasing the network's coverage
in continental Europe and Africa, which is currently linked to the
firm's European region. Africa will be split into a separate region
when the number of members there is increased.

In Europe, ACPA hopes to extend its coverage into northern Italy,
France and Germany. It is also looking for new members in Norway,
Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

De Lange replaced Daniel Faura, managing partner of ACPA's Spanish
member, Faura Casas. Faura served as chairman for around 18 months.
According to de Lange, Faura's term was cut short because of his
obligations to the Spanish firm. Faura Casas recently formed an
alliance with Audiberia, the Summit International member, in a bid to
maximise services throughout Spain.

ACPA's European secretariat has been based in the offices of Eshuis
Groep since September 1994, following a decade of being located in
London. "Among other reasons, this makes it easier to develop eastern
Europe," de Lange said. ACPA has 29 members in 15 European countries,
while fee income for the region totals more than $50 million.

PW HUNGARY CREATES SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY FOR REAL ESTATE UNIT

PRICE WATERHOUSE in Hungary has spun off its real estate division into
a separate legal entity. The company, Real Partners, was set up on
January 1 following a year of negotiation.

PW holds a 60 percent stake in the company while the other 40 percent
is held by Karoly Flaskay, a local real estate specialist. Profits,
however, will be divided on an equal basis. No predicted fee income for
the new unit has been released.

Real Partners, set up as a limited liability company, resulted from a
need to create an independent unit to cope with demand. "Demand for
asset valuation and real estate was continuous although fluctuating,"
said Andrew Terner, PW's head of corporate finance and co-managing
director of Real Partners. "It is an important area in a market which
is asset rich and cash poor," he added.

The company already has an established list of clients. Some were
clients of PW's real estate division, while others were clients of
Flaskay.

The services provided by the company include evaluation of real estate,
real estate development projects and brokerage services such as
searching for investors. Real Partners' only office is based in
Budapest, where Flaskay is backed up by five professional staff and one
administrator.

FEELING AT HOME

It's been a hard five years, but western accounting firms are starting
to get used to working in Poland. David Porter reports

IT IS more than five years since the Big Six arrived in Poland, and
only now are they beginning to feel at home. Resistance from clients to
western fees seems to be easing, and hitherto frosty relations with the
local Chamber of Auditors may be starting to thaw.

Not that Poland has suddenly become an easy place in which to do
business. Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keeping
control of that growth and turning it into profits is a different
matter.

Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,
the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, with
fiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking even
currently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according to
managing partner Duleep Aluwihare.

"We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some of
our more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage to
continue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,
we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run out
of investment opportunities."

Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one of
the few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although it
plans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice or
Cracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In order
to set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going to
maintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve in
this marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.

This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,
but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticket
items," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basic
work, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.

Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,
Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clients
include Poland's Finance Ministry.

Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.
Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrand
and Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived in
Poland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess when
the firm should start making a profit.

Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking to IAB last July before
returning to the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We're
not just here for a financial return on investment, we're here to make
sure that Coopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."

C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking at
opening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.

Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of the
market, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,
Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firm
has acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bank
and of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successes
include the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which
raised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing group
Okocim.

PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgeted
to start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,
the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After five
years in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-national
company investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growth
is running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.

PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where the
firm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clients
include Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.
One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatised
Bank Gdanski.

Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some time
are KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche.

"We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner Bill
Drysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where we
are largely self-sufficient."

Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at Barents
Group, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of new
clients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firm
recently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run its
German practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have a
fully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said.
"Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."

KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics group
Siemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polish
clients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,
Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurance
companies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices in
Cracow and Poznan during the last year.

At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits gets
short shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm has
always been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financial
support from outside, other than very small amounts. All the other
firms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they have
X amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.
They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."

In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440
employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of its
rivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw and
Szczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is a
headache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line.

"Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It's
difficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated into
a corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standards
right way."

E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as much
business as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when it
hired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &
Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.

Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T.
"These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speak
only with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Often
you'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,
all the rest will follow."

The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in the
Polish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is the
smallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strong
position in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firm
took action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz as
head of the Polish business (IAB 151). Leslaw Paga was head of the
Polish Securities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.

Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is sure
that Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitely
enhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said.
"There've been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."

Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its position
in Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industries
and service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong position
in financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say we
were latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"
he explained.

Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bank
and of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's
64-percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in the
banking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3
million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.

D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk and
Cracow during 1995.

Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.
Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four other
mid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co-ordinating
partner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "the
sort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging with
another firm.

He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name the
prospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to another
network. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we are
looking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with a
heavy UK or English language capability," he said.

Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switched
international affiliations from CKL International to Alliott Peirson
International during 1995 (IAB 171). Baltic Accountants continues to
also represent RSM International and GMN International.

The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issue
for many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firms
like to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to local
clients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing in
Polish equity partners than others.

Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firm
holding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and US
affiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has been
given the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, while
KPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or
"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.

According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managed
firm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly owned by Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent from
the start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the local
practices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."

Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agree
that fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gap
between what western firms are charging and what local clients are
willing to pay is narrowing.

One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment must
pay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet the
market half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper local
firms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it first
arrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.
Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in
"strategic situations".

Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of a
western-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came into
effect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accounting
procedures more into line with International Accounting Standards and
to move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on tax
compliance.

Another area where western accountants are making more encouraging
noises is in relations between the international firms and the local
Chamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when the
chamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.
Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted to
the chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners that
Poland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shutting
new blood out of the profession.

Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences being
mended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciak
said. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of course
there will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.
Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bit
frightening to them."

While the situation regarding audit training and exams remains
unacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamber
will rethink its approach.

Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous in
admitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems to
have gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably be
reviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said.
"And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."

After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all part
of the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make sure
the chamber is a strong and active body."

Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and that
the growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feels
that this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We all
experience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."

CAPTURING THE '90S SPIRIT

Spencer Lanthier, KPMG Canada's chairman and chief executive since
1993, talks to Gundi Jeffrey about the firm's increasing emphasis on
consulting services, as well as the shift to a new corporate culture
that better reflects the spirit of the 1990s

AFTER SEVERAL years of flat and even declining revenues, KPMG in Canada
is poised to regain healthier growth. Much of this is due to a wide
range of new service initiatives - mostly consulting-based - aimed at
meeting the needs of an increasingly- sophisticated and demanding
marketplace.

Spencer Lanthier, 55, has been with the firm since 1960, becoming a
partner in 1972, managing partner of the Toronto office in 1984 and
vice-chairman of the Greater Toronto region and deputy chairman of the
partnership board in 1989. He has also served on various committees of
the Quebec and Ontario institutes and, in 1993, was a member of the
Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' corporate governance task
force. He took on his present role with KPMG in 1993.

IAB: Your revenues in the year to February 1995 were stagnant, but
KPMG's worldwide results were up by more than 13 percent in fiscal
1995. What do you expect your fiscal 1996 results to be like?

Lanthier: We expect our fiscal 1996 top-line to be up about 5 percent.
This is after four years of flat or negative growth, which has been
consistent throughout our business in Canada.

The reasons for this low growth relate to some major shifts in the
market for our services. Regulatory changes to audit requirements
continue to hit all the big firms. Two years ago, for example, the
Canada Business Corporations Act removed the requirement for
privately-owned companies to have audits. And more recently, the
Ontario Government eliminated the audit requirement for companies with
revenues of less than C$100 million ($73.66 million).

Another issue is the high degree of corporate consolidation that has
taken place in Canada. For example, in 1994, one of our major clients,
Rogers Communications, took over the publishing company Maclean Hunter.
I can assure you that the fees for the combined company are a lot less
than what they were separately.

So all in all, the market for large-corporation audit services has
shrunk substantially and continues to decline. In that context, we're
quite pleased with the growth of 5 percent in Canada this year.

A lot of the growth internationally is coming from emerging markets
such as eastern Europe and the Far East. But, in some of the more
mature economies, the growth hasn't been that significant.

IAB: The international firm has started reporting total billings to
clients rather than net revenues. Will Canada follow suit?

Lanthier: Internationally, our firm - and other firms also - is now
reporting our total billings per client. We've moved in that direction
because we believe it more closely reflects the way we do business.

For many years, the majority of our billings were based on the time we
spent on the job. But now, we have more alliances and co-venture
arrangements. Often, we act as prime contractor in projects that
involve various sub-contractors. In the past, we would have treated our
sub-contractors' billings as expense reimbursement and deducted them
from total billings to report our net fee income. We've concluded that
it makes more sense to reflect our total sub-contractors billings as
revenues. In summary, like most other major businesses, KPMG's revenues
simply reflect our total worldwide invoices to clients.

In Canada, however, we'll continue to report on a net fee income basis
for the time being. The reason for this is that the Canadian firms have
agreed for many years on a set of precise guidelines for reporting
income to ensure compatibility.

IAB: KPMG Canada has launched quite a few initiatives and service areas
over the past year. Can you tell me about them and what you are hoping
to achieve with them?

Lanthier: The first is KPMG Investigation and Security Inc. This new
group, headed by the former Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner
and past Interpol president Norman Inkster, offers a full range of
impartial investigative services to businesses in Canada and around the
globe (IAB 176). KPMG ISI assists companies in cases where traditional
policing agencies are no longer able to help.

It's really an extension of the forensic accounting division. We're
continuing to offer traditional forensic accounting services, but we're
also expanding into the corporate security field. We did this because
we knew that most [Canadian] police forces have been forced by cutbacks
to place white collar crime very low on their list of priorities.

Not only do we investigate white collar crime, but we also look at the
whole security arrangements companies have in place, not just the
traditional internal controls. For example, are they protecting their
executives adequately? Are their facilities secure? In the wake of last
year's Oklahoma bombing, we received several inquiries from clients
interested in reviewing their security.

Also, as Canadian companies expand offshore, there is a need for them
to review the viability and integrity of potential joint venture
partners. We can help in this area.

We've been delighted with the results of this division already and
we've hired, at last count, six more former police officers.

Another success story is our ISO 9000 practice, launched in early 1995
in six centres across the country. KPMG Quality Registrar is one of
only 12 accredited ISO 9000 registrars in Canada. And so far, we are
the only Big Six firm that has obtained this accreditation.

We have two major services. First we certify that clients have
processes that comply with ISO standards. Then there is an annual
compliance report, that ensures they continue to be in compliance.

This work is really a natural extension of our audit services and we've
been very successful with it in Canada. In the first full year, our
fees were about C$2 million.

Next, very recently, we established a strategic alliance with MD
Management, the financial services subsidiary of the Canadian Medical
Association. This will allow KPMG to provide physicians and their
families with accounting, tax and business advice. We were the only
national accounting firm to participate in this alliance.

KPMG's benchmarking initiative was launched in 1995, with the firm's
first national benchmark study of the corporate finance function. This
study examines the role of the finance department in large companies -
those with revenues of more than C$150 million - and middle-market
companies, with revenues of C$15 million to C$150 million, in the
manufacturing, retail and distribution sectors.

By focusing on performance measures such as cost, productivity and
quality in finance, the study aims to help our clients better gauge
their relative performance and identify opportunities for improvement.

KPMG's new Centre for Risk Assessment and Control Design was
established to help organisations develop and implement cost-effective
control and risk management systems, and to exchange best practices,
particularly in the area of control and risk assessment.

In February 1995, we rolled out our forest management practice, and it
has grown steadily. Three provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and
Alberta, have in recent years passed new forestry legislation requiring
companies to comply with cutting standards, reforestation, and so on.
We help them ensure that they have the processes in place to comply
with the regulation and help them with their reporting to the
regulatory authorities. It's not a huge practice yet, but one where
there is a real client need that we're trying to meet.

We also have a rapidly-growing SAP and Baan implementation practice.
SAP has really taken off in the industrialised world and has become the
dominant software standard and dominant software platform for financial
management systems. We, together with others, are registered suppliers
and implementers of SAP. Baan is something similar.

I believe our Aboriginal services practice has also been a big success.
More than 20 offices provide a range of financial and management
consulting services to Aboriginal communities across Canada. With
continuing progress in land claim settlements, Aboriginal people are
becoming a major economic force in Canada, so the growth potential for
this service area is significant.

IAB: I understand that KPMG has developed something called"Project
Globe", which has identified 14 service areas for growth. What does
that mean for the Canadian firm?

Lanthier: Project Globe is a framework that gives our consulting
practices around the world a common set of priorities. We adopted it a
year or so ago and it involves our focusing on three broad areas of
service.

The first is enabling technologies, which include services such as
information technology strategy and systems implementation. The
performance improvement area includes human resources and quality
management services, among others. Strategic financial management
includes capital transactions, treasury management and similar
financial consulting services.

IAB: Now to an old favourite that won't go away: professional
liability. What is KPMG doing in terms of risk management strategy to
dampen the threat of legal action?

Lanthier: The number of lawsuits against accounting firms in Canada has
dropped over the past five years. Whether that's a result of improved
risk management or a result of a better economy is hard to say. Most of
the big lawsuits that we've seen in Canada happened as a result of the
real estate melt-down of five or six years ago. They had nothing to do
with audit failure. Since the real estate markets have stabilised,
there haven't been any other major lawsuits coming forward.

We have three simple rules for risk management: be careful about who we
work for; be careful about what we do for them and be careful about
whom we assign to do the work. I think we all pay closer attention to
those rules than we did a few years ago. IAB: What do you see as KPMG
Canada's biggest challenge in the next few years?

Lanthier: I am focusing on two major areas. We have to grow our top
line. You have to grow to be successful in our country. We're obviously
the largest firm, with the largest market share, which makes it more
difficult to grow.

That brings up the question of our core services. The audit is a
declining market. So is tax compliance.

More and more taxpayers are buying tax preparation software for C$100
or so, rather than coming to us. In the future, they could be
downloading tax software from the Internet for free.

However, the total market for consulting services is expanding rapidly.
That's why we've put a big emphasis on developing new,
consulting-oriented services at a fairly rapid rate.

Our second challenge is human resources - our people. Twenty-five years
ago, firms like ours were the employer of choice for a lot of the
people going through business schools and other faculties. But
recently, we've become a less attractive option. Some of our human
resource policies, cultures and practices simply aren't up to date. We
recognise that.

To that end, in June, we brought on board a human resources change
management person at a very senior level. John Ellsworth brings years
of global HR experience, having worked in general management consulting
and with major corporations.

John joined KPMG as a senior partner and a member of our management
committee. He is working closely with me and other people in the firm
to help us change our culture. We want to ensure that we can attract
the best people, that we reward based on competence and not just on
seniority. In the past, we have operated as a rather militaristic
hierarchy. We are determined to break down some of the barriers that
have existed, to move people forward, allow them to progress when they
are ready.

It will take a long time for us to change and upgrade and get away from
the sweatshop mentality that has dominated the accounting profession in
the past. You don't change a culture that's been ingrained for 75 years
over six months or a year, but we're determined to make progress.

These are my two priorities - to change our culture over the next few
years and to grow our top line. The two go hand in hand. If you have
the best people, you'll grow.

DAILY NEW YORK ANALYSIS

The American recovery is proceeding at an uneven pace, according to
the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, led in those regions where the
upturn is most pronounced by industrial production in part driven by
export demand.  The compilation of reports from Fed districts
confirmed the prevailing view of an economy lurching along in low gear
with consumer spending anemic and the housing sector faltering.  The
credit crunch, said the Fed report, is still with us.  The data in the
eight-times-a-year report was collected before September 9 and so
offered a relatively recent snapshot of the US economy.  If it was not
an inspiring view of the economy, it was by the same token not
alarming either, and was consistent with the consensus view of
affairs.  As recent data have suggested, the Fed likewise found
manufacturing to be the strongest sector.  "Industrial production has
provided considerable impetus to recovery, reflecting in part export
demand and a reduced pace of inventory liquidation," the report said.
"As yet, there is little sign of a sizeable rebound in consumer
spending that will contribute to a strengthening business recovery,"
it added.  Bank lending is still soft in most areas, often because of
reduced demand for loans, said the report, which is issued in advance
of meetings of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee.
Although mortgage interest rates are sharply lower, home sales have
slowed in San Francisco, Chicago and elsewhere, and commercial
construction has virtually halted in many of the reporting Fed
districts.

Elsewhere, a small rise in August housing starts gainsaid expectations
on the part of Wall Street economists of a slight decline.
Construction starts on single-family homes and apartments rose 0.6% to
an annual rate of 1.07 million when the consensus among economists had
been for a 1.06 million rate.  That was the fifth straight rise for
the homebuilding industry, feared to be falling back into a slump.
Nevertheless, the 0.6% rise was less vigorous than July's revised 2.4%
gain, itself toned down from an earlier estimated 3.7% rise.
Construction in the first eight months of this year was off 21% from
the 1990 period.

Political events were also driving the markets on Wednesday.  There
was a report from Tass, the Soviet news agency, that Boris Yeltsin,
leader of the ascendant democratic forces in the ex-Soviet Union, had
suffered a slight heart attack.  That gave additional tone to the US
dollar but did not have any noticeable impact on the Treasuries
market.  Markets also were watching a faceoff between President Bush
and Saddam Hussein of Iraq.  Bush said US Air Force units would go to
Saudi Arabia to provide better protection for the kingdom and, if
necessary, to force Iraqi compliance with a UN resolution calling for
inspection of weapons stocks.

US CREDIT MARKETS

The Treasury market, which has become accustomed to having things go
its way, did not like look of the housing starts data and sold off to
a small extent but bounced right back.  That was typical of the
session, during which US government securities prices were mildly
buffeted by a series of factors but showed resilience.  The market
also turned down a bit when the December Treasury bond futures
contract ran into some tough resistance at 99 and fell back to 98
18/32.  Prices also declined on news that US Air Force units will be
sent to Saudi Arabia.  The Beige Book, however, was almost completely
ignored.  The benchmark 30-year bond finished the day about 1/8 point
lower in price to yield 7.92% after 7.91% at the close on Tuesday.
The 10-year note moved up slightly to yield 7.59% compared with 7.60%.
Bills were virtually unchanged.

The worst that could be said for the market right now is that it is
indecisive.  However, sentiment is still positive in the absence of
any data seriously challenging the thesis that the economy is not
making any headway and that inflation thus poses no danger.  As we
said yesterday, the market is unlikely to be perturbed by mildly
positive data.  But the durable goods figure coming out September 25
has it a bit worried.  The last one, for July, rose 10.7%, and a
similar surprise could test the mettle of fixed-income investors.  It
would not surprise us if the market took some profits ahead of that
figure, particularly if the trade and employment figures on Thursday
suggest economic quickening.  Money supply, out late Thursday, will
also be closely watched.  Nonetheless, the bias is towards further
price rises and yield declines.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS

Everyone in the market keeps avowing bearish sentiment, but the
dollar's behavior on Wednesday suggests otherwise.  Short-covering on
Yeltsin's heart trouble and the Bush-Saddam confrontation had
something to do with it.  But from our point of view the news breaks
just amplified the stirring of the dollar.  With many participants out
for the Yom Kippur Jewish holiday the market was thin and volatile,
making it hard to draw firm conclusions.  But the dollar looks more
biddish.  In Europe it was supported at DM1.6650 and capped at
DM1.6775, but in New York the news gave it enough punch to reach
DM1.6940 before falling back to close at DM1.6850 after DM1.6750
Tuesday.  Players will probably sell it again, but may be getting
tired of working the downside.
The reasoning behind bearish sentiment all this week has been that the
Fed is going to ease again, which as we have noted before should not
be taken as a foregone conclusion.  Even if that turns out to be true,
is the market likely to spend its time between now and Thanksgiving
looking for that ease?  More likely it will focus on something else,
and that could be US economic numbers.  The indicators out on
Wednesday were not great news, but they were not bad news either, and
somewhere along the line here the data may swing market sentiment.
For now, though, the numbers are indecisive, and so the market is
likely to work in a range for a while, eventually testing DM1.70 but
probably not cracking it decisively.  Therefore we would modify our
advice to suggest that if the dollar explores the bottom of its range
again, it looks like a good buy, but should not be held too far into
the DM1.6850 area -- unless the market shifts resistance up to DM1.70
sooner than expected.

TURKISH BOT PROJECTS EMERGE DESPITE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES

Financing for Turkey's first two build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes
has been tied up after a decade of delay.

But project and trade financiers are keeping Turkey under tight
scrutiny following the inconclusive general election on 24 December, in
which the pro-Islamic Welfare Party topped the polling with just 21 per
cent of the vote.

Bankers say that signs of a turnaround in the economy was a key
determinant in finally closing the long-awaited limited recourse deals,
which have lingered on the drawing board since the mid-1980s, when they
figured among the first ever blueprints for BOT-style infrastructure
projects.  Other countries have since left Turkey far behind.

ECAs take on risk

Export credit agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks have taken on
substantial risk for the $1.4bn hydroelectric power and dam project at
Birecik on the Euphrates River and the $865m water supply and treatment
plant at Izmit, some 80 miles east of Istanbul.

A new readiness among commercial lenders to take on Turkish risk was
borne out by the oversubscription of unsecured commercial loans, priced
at 225 basis points (bp).

A dozen more BOT projects are awaiting approval, mostly in the power
sector, where the government has forecast growth in demand for
electricity of almost 250 per cent over the next 15 years.  Prior to
her resignation, prime minister Tansu Ciller said that BOT projects
worth $16bn were needed in Turkey over the next decade.

These include the 1,200 MW Ilisu Dam on the Tigris River, expected to
cost some $2.5bn, for which tenders are expected soon.

``It should certainly be quicker to do deals in future as there is now
a reference point for the Turkish market'', says Mr Howard Lack, the
director at London-based Chase Investment Bank, the arranger for
syndicated lending at both Birecik and Izmit.

``Before Birecik, the Treasury had no previous experience of a complex
structure that involved some 40 documents, but they will understand the
issues and the risks that are being asked in the future'', Mr Lack
says.

Banks' analysis

Analysts are examining the conflicting signals coming from Turkey to
weigh the extent of their participation in future operations.

``We are mindful of the election result, and like most banks, are
adopting a wait-and-see approach'', Mr Alan Paton, head of trade and
export finance of Societe Generale's London branch tells ITF.

``These are early days -- it is far from clear how things will go'', Mr
Paton adds.  SocGen took a strong hand in syndicated lending finalised
late in 1995 for Birecik and Izmit.

Adding complexity to western views of an increasingly important market
where the political situation may lay unresolved until February was
Turkey's entry into the EU customs union on 1 January 1996.

``The EC vote was a positive factor, but we are continuing to monitor
the progress of the Turkish economy following the elections'',
Mr Dennis Kennedy, NCM Credit Insurance's underwriter for the Middle
East, North Africa and Turkey tells ITF.

A series of recent economic and financial crises that came to a head in
1994 has drawn comparisons with Mexico from some quarters.

NCM said that Turkey represented ``a market with enduring economic
problems'' in a country summary issued in September.

The ratings agency, Standard & Poors, revised down its country outlook
from ``positive'' to ``stable'' in October.

Recent estimates suggest the budget deficit for the first quarter of
1996 will be greater than for the whole of 1995.

The market fell under close scrutiny in 1994, when massive capital
flight led to plummeting sovereign debt ratings, an inflation level of
126 per cent and currency devaluation of over 50 per cent.

Reserves up

However, the economy began to grow in the first quarter of 1995 and
foreign reserves had risen to $16.3bn by September, compared to $3bn in
April 1994.  Inflation is also seen as less of a danger.

As the macroeconomic situation improves, Turkish borrowers are
returning to the international market to borrow on longer maturities
and narrower margins, which are creeping back to pre-1994 crisis
levels.

Turkiye Garanti Bankasi secured a benchmark two-year $150m facility in
October at 65bp over Libor, marking the first loan over one year for a
Turkish bank in 1995.

ECA support

ECAs took 64 per cent of the risk in the ground-breaking 672MW Birecik
scheme, providing 151/2-year cover that includes a 51/2-year construction
period.

Germany's Hermes insured DM585m (#256m) to support the principal
developer, Philipp Holzmann.

Also involved were Belgian, Austrian and French ECAs, which guaranteed
around DM803m in bank loans to the sponsor Birecik Company, which
provided DM327m in equity towards the 15-year concession.

Eight-year commercial lending worth DM462m made up the senior debt
package.

Co-arrangers were Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, Bayerische
Landesbank, Girokredit, Generale Bank and Societe Generale.

Forty-four banks participated in the two tranches, which were
oversubscribed by 30 per cent.  Margins were 100bp over Libor for the
ECA loan and 225bp for the commercial deal.

Given that aspects of the legal situation attaching to BOT schemes in
Turkey remain unresolved -- all concession-type contracts fall under the
jurisdiction of an administrative court -- lenders have extracted
government guarantees insuring them against force majeure or default by
Birecik Company.

The Birecik Company has protected itself against default on tariff
payments by the offtaker, the state-owned Turkiye Elektrik Uretim
Iletim (TEAS), by obtaining government guarantees.

``Future deals will need less support, with more risk being borne by
the commercial parties and banks'', says Mr Lack.

Water project

The UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has taken the
leading ECA role in Turkey's second BOT scheme: a 15-year concession to
improve the supply of drinking and industrial water to the Turkish city
of Izmit.

ECGD is providing a 100 per cent guarantee for $236m in commercial
lending, which secured about $803m in bank debt.

France's Coface has extended insurance for a $180m tranche, with
Japan's EID/MITI supporting a further $40m in loans over seven years.

The combination reflects ECGD's growing collaboration with its French
and Japanese counterparts (ITF 252/11).

Untied lending worth $180m has been agreed by the Export-Import Bank of
Japan (Jexim).

Banks have provided $167m on an unsecured basis, split into a $116m
seven-year facility and a $51m five-year standby facility.  These were
oversubscribed by 15 per cent.

Co-arrangers were National Westminster Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank
and  SocGen -- the latter lending over $83m.

Repayments to the project company, Izmit Su, are to be made in dollars.

Project security resides in offtake agreements and guarantees provided
by the Municipality of Izmit backed by the Turkish Treasury.

The sponsor -- which has injected some $139m in equity and comprises the
local companies Guris and Gama and the Municipality of Izmit, alongside
the UK's Thames Water and Japan's Mitsui & Co and Sumitomo Corporation
-- will commence its operating period in December 1998.

Breathing space

Most ECAs have taken a watching brief in the immediate post-election
period.
ECGD had planned a cover review in 1995, but this was postponed because
of the December polling.

The UK agency has ``one or two reasonable-sized deals in the
pipeline'', according to a spokesman, ``but, as always, these may take
awhile to come to fruition.  Following Izmit, almost all the cover
available in the market has been committed''.

``The two deals both went well, but took quite a lot of the available
appetite out of the marketplace'', SocGen's Mr Paton observes.  ``There
would be an appetite for the right project, but ECAs form a very
important leverage aspect for commercial banks''.

Private markets

Turkey remains a popular market for forfaiters.

The London-based Standard Bank will look at 360-day paper, principally
for commodity-based short-term deals.  Standard is doing business up to
three years for capital goods transactions.

``Margins have moved slightly upwards due to the uncertainty after the
election, but have otherwise been quite stable since the market
recovered in 1995'', says a spokesman.

Standard will look at paper from a range of banks, including two of the
public sector institutions, TC Ziraat Bankasi and Turkiye Halk Bankasi.

Bankers and insurers are generally agreed that Turkey's private sector
banks may offer more scope for trade finance.

NCM highlighted the local private sector as a much better risk for
exporters in its September report, pointing out that the majority of
foreign exchange reserves are held privately.

``Public sector companies, currently comprising about half the legal
economy, are in the main loss-making and debt-ridden'', said the
report.

NCM's trading terms extend to a maximum 180 days, with open account
business acceptable where buyers, mainly private, can show a good
recent track record or a visible hard currency trading surplus.

Analysts have noted that this is more commonplace as economic
liberalisation has freed companies from political interference.

Most businesses require the security of a letter of credit or bank-
endorsed bills of exchange.

RUSSIAN GOLD FINANCING SET TO TRIGGER MORE PROJECTS?

The completion and disbursement of a ground-breaking $100m gold mine
financing has triggered hopes among western financiers that more
Russian projects will move ahead as the government gradually eases the
regulatory environment.

The move complements activity by western financiers in Russia's
hydrocarbons sector, where protracted manoeuverings have eventually led
to the provision of US export credit guarantees for projects under the
oil and gas framework agreement (OGFA) (ITF 247/6).

The arranger of the limited recourse gold deal, Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell (DMG), took two years to structure and negotiate the
transaction with the Russian authorities and the lenders.

The deal ``sets a precedent for international debt financing for such
projects in Russia'', says a DMG director closely involved with the
project, Mr Andrew Seton.

Funds for the project in the far eastern Magadan region were released
in mid-December, following the signature of loan agreements in June
between the Omolon Gold Mining Company and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the US' Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (Opic) (ITF 240/3).

Opic contributed guarantees worth $52.5m and will also extend $60m in
investment insurance.

Omolon, a joint venture between the Denver-based Cyprus Amax Minerals
Company and Russian (mainly mining) concerns, is the first joint
venture to receive a licence to mine gold in Russia.

The company will use the loan proceeds to develop the Kubaka lode gold
deposit, located some 200 miles off the Arctic Circle.

Repayments from the sale of the mine's output will be channelled
through a licensed offshore account.

Security for the lenders is based on a series of long-term contracts
that have replaced Russian government payment risk with contractual
risk.

In return for mixed hard currency and rouble payments, the Russian
government will be allocated first claim on the mine's output,
anticipated at an annual 300,000 ounces of gold and 200,000 ounces of
silver.

If payments do not ensue, the Russian Foreign Trade Bank, in its role
as agent for the government and the joint venture, will export the
metals to western buyers.

``People were not prepared to lend or invest on the basis where the
government held a monopoly over gold production and exports'', another
banker specialising in CIS minerals tells ITF.  ``Lenders are happy
with this deal -- and the structure is likely to be replicated for other
gold projects''.

DMG's activities in Russia and the former Soviet Union have raised
nearly $4bn in project finance to date.

Further EBRD activity in Russia includes support for short-term trade
finance under its Trade Facilitation Programme (ITF 248/2).

INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES FUND PAKISTAN IPP

A new independent power project (IPP) is going ahead in Pakistan's
Punjab state backed by the Export-Import Bank of Japan (Jexim) and the
World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC).

As its contribution to 12-year Japanese buyer credits worth Y18.2bn
(#115m) for the 365MW Lal Pir II scheme in Muzzafargagh, Jexim is to
provide Y10.9bn as a direct loan on its own account.  Around Y4bn of
this is dollar-denominated.

The remaining Y7.3bn is being co-financed with a syndicate of 15
commercial banks, nine of which are from Japan.  Arranging the
facility, which is priced at 240 basis points (bp) over Libor, is the
scheme's financial advisor, Bank of Tokyo, with Sanwa Bank, Deutsche
Bank, Dresdner Bank and ING Bank.

The political risk in this tranche will be insured by EID/MITI.

The deal was reportedly well over-subscribed, principally reflecting an
appetite from banks that missed Lal Pir I (ITF 234/3).

The proceeds will be deployed by the sponsor, AES Pak Gen Company
(AESPG), to finance the purchase of equipment from Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, to be supplied through the trading house Nichimen
Corporation.

Jexim's security in the project pivots on the government of Pakistan's
guarantees for currency conversion and transfers; the purchase of
generated electricity over 30 years by the Pakistan Water & Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) and the supply of fuel by Pakistan State
Oil Company.

IFC role

The IFC has agreed an A-loan/B-loan structure worth $70m for the $349m
oil-fired scheme, which is to be implemented on a build-own-operate
(BOO) basis.

A $20m A-loan has been extended over 15 years.

The $50m B-facility has a 12-year tenor and a margin of 275bp.  IFC has
also taken a portion of the $95m equity injected by AESPG, which was
created by the US' AES Corporation in June 1995.

The participation of the World Bank's investment arm follows an A-
loan/B-loan facility agreed for a $138m project in Karachi last July
(ITF 242/5).

Jexim and the IFC have worked together in Pakistan's power sector on
Lal Pir I and the country's first limited recourse power financing, the
ground-breaking Hub River scheme (ITF 222/1).

The Lal Pir II project will help to alleviate power shortages in
Pakistan estimated at around 2000MW.  Completion is expected near the
end of 1997.

EXPORT CREDIT INCLUDED IN UKRANIAN PAYMENTS SUPPORT PACKAGE

The Export-Import Bank of Japan has included a Y6bn (#37m) export
financing facility in its new Y24bn economic stabilisation support
package for Ukraine.

The package, signed in late-December, is part of the international
effort to underpin the former Soviet republic where the president,
Mr Leonid Kuchma, remains confronted with daunting problems putting his
reform programme into effect.

``By helping to stabilise the economy, the loan is intended to uphold
the government's intention to dismantle its nuclear weaponry system'',
Jexim said in a statement.  The question of the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant is also high on governments' agendas.

Jexim observed that the G7 and EU nations had agreed in mid-1994 to
provide $4bn or more ``over the next two years'' and remained ``united
in their recognition that the Ukraine's economic stability is important
to world peace, in view of its nuclear capabilities''.

The Y18bn untied loan element of the package -- intended as co-financing
with the World Bank -- is part of the $200m in balance of payments
support, drawn from Jexim's funds for the development initiative,
committed last March by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Japanese prime
minister.

Other governments to commit export credits include the US, Germany,
Italy, Canada and France.

The IMF has approved an SDR1.5bn standby package; the World Bank has
already committed loans worth around $720m; and the EU an Ecu225m loan
for balance of payments support.

During a visit to Kiev last summer, Mr James Wolfensohn, the World Bank
president, said the bank could provide over $1bn in the next three
years.

But these loans could be in jeopardy if a rebellious parliament has its
way over issues such as privatisation and farm reform -- and Mr Kuchma's
reform programme is blocked.

Kiev has secured the first financing from the EBRD/NCM co-operation
agreement on projects in eastern Europe.

The Dutch insurer and the European Bank for Reconstruction &
Development are backing a $20.7m agricultural project in the Myronavka
region, which includes Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.

NCM's participation involves insuring Dutch exports of machinery and
farm vehicles.

ECAS MOBILISE SUPPORT FOR EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI OIL REFINERY

Export credit agencies (ECAs) are preparing to mobilise cover for an
Egyptian/Israeli joint venture scheme, the Middle East Oil Refinery
(MIDOR).

Sponsors have yet to choose between Banque National de Paris (BNP) and
National Westminster Bank to head supplier credit arrangements, but a
financial close is expected by construction start, at the end of
March 1996.

Export credit cover from Israel worth between $100-$150m has been
secured.

Further ECA-backed loans for the scheme will total an anticipated
$600m.  The eventual choice of agencies will depend on the sources of
construction equipment, but agencies from France, Germany, Japan,
Belgium and the UK have expressed interest.

A construction contract has been signed with a European consortium
comprising Italy's Technipetrol and France's Technip, following a hard
fought tender.

Spain's Tecnicas Reunidas has been awarded a large subcontracting deal,
which involves the provision of supplier credit guarantees worth $100m
by Compania Espanola de Seguros de Credito a la Exportacion (CESCE).

Regional banks, including the National Bank of Egypt, Misr Bank and
Israeli General Bank are to provide working capital worth about $370m.

The European Investment Bank has also committed around $300m.

Some $240-$250m of equity is to be injected into the project.  A stake
may be offered to the winner of an imminent contract for management and
operations.

MIDOR's shareholding comprises two 40 per cent stakeholders -- the
Merhav group, owned by Israeli businessman Mr Yosef Malman, and
Egyptian entrepreneur Mr Hussein Salem -- and Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC).

EGPC will supply crude oil and has undertaken to purchase 20 per cent
of MIDOR's production.

The refinery will be built at Alexandria near the Suez-Mediterranean
pipeline terminal, at a site designated as a 40-year renewable free
trade zone by the Egyptian government.

Project processing capacity is slated at 100,000 barrels a day, with a
refined offtake of around five million tonnes annually to be targeted
at markets in Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Palestine and several other
eastern Mediterranean economies.

MIDOR is examining transportation options and the possibilities for
constructing two new regional terminals to receive the refined produce.

WORLD BANK OFFERS POWER PROJECT GUARANTEES

The World Bank has offered to use its revamped guarantee programme to
assist Egypt's plans to build its first three concessionary power
projects.

The bank's partial risk guarantee would offer shelter for commercial
banks in the event of any difficulties relating to contracts, including
fuel supply commitments and payments by the Egyptian Electricity
Authority (EEA).

The EEA is examining bids from six consultants to prepare tender
documents for the build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes, which comprise
a 100MW wind farm at Zaafarana, a 240MW scheme at Ataqa and a 660MW
thermal plant.

BIS TRACKS RISE IN SHORT-TERM TRADE FINANCE FOR EMERGING MARKETS

The growth of short-term trade finance to developing countries is a key
factor fuelling increased commercial bank lending to these markets, the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) says.

Based on January-June 1995 data, the Basle-based BIS reports
significant growth in total lending from the developed world.  This
rose to $25.6bn, up from $19.9bn in the first half of 1994.

Particular note was made of banks' claims up to 360 days, which rose as
a percentage of total claims.  A growing volume of trade finance and
banks' reluctance to expose themselves longer term were among reasons
for this.

The favoured target region for commercial lenders was Asia, where
lending jumped by $33.7bn, compared to $15.6bn in 1994.

The report noted a ``greater selectivity'' in lending to Latin America,
which fell by $4.2bn, although it seemed ``too early to say'' whether
the Mexican crisis had impacted on this trend.

A greater global dependence on short-term capital flows has led
commercial banks to assess their portfolios on a more frequent basis.

GRIFFIN LAUNCHES EXPORT INVOICE DISCOUNTING SERVICE

Griffin Factors has opted to follow its main competitors and launch an
export invoice discounting service to cater for larger export
companies.

Exporters with their solid in-house credit control unit will now be
offered finance, without the obligation to accept a traditional ``full
factoring'' arrangement.

An offshoot of Midland Bank, Griffin was one of the first factors to
offer domestic clients an invoice discounting service (under which
finance is provided against invoices without direct involvement by the
finance house in the process of collection, unless a payment falls
seriously overdue).

But it stood back from the industry-wide move into invoice discounting
of exports, continuing to trust to traditional full factoring -- under
which it retains responsibility for collecting all payments.

And this approach seemed to be justified, because in most recent years,
it managed to remain in second place in the league table of
international business handled by the UK's factors -- last year the
volume of exports it factored was up by 25 per cent at more than #90m.

Griffin management was also concerned about the practical difficulties
of getting involved in collection of overdue invoice-discounted
payments.  A particular worry was a German law that allowed buyers to
refuse to allow their debts to be assigned.

Market pressures

But market pressures on Griffin to follow competitors, such as
International Factors, into the invoice discounting of exports
increased.  There was strong demand for the service from clients and
industry figures showed that the spectacular growth in invoice
discounting was far outstripping the more measured expansion of
traditional factoring.

There was, particularly, an increased number of larger exporters -- who
were not prepared to involve a factor in their routine payment
collection -- seeking trade-based finance.

Last year, Griffin dipped a toe quietly into the water.  It also
equipped itself to cope with a change, recruiting specialist language
staff who could chase up foreign payments.

And, with fortunate timing, the law in Germany was clarified to allow
foreign export suppliers to promise repayment to their financiers.

There was clearly a risk that Griffin could lose clients who wanted
discounted finance, if it continued to stand aside from this trend.
 But it still remains committed to further development of the
traditional factoring operation.  Recently, it set up an EDI service
that will allow clients to send in invoices electronically, without the
need for paper back-up.  Restricted for now to domestic business, this
will eventually be available to exporters.

WOLFENSOHN RINGS ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES AT WORLD BANK

Mr James Wolfensohn, World Bank president, has restructured top
management posts at the bank in a drive to improve efficiency and to
build incentives and accountability into the organisation's culture.

In the first significant management initiative at the bank since he
assumed control last June, Mr Wolfensohn has increased his team of
managing directors from three to five and created a new Executive
Committee.

The changes became operational on 1 January 1996.

In a memo circulated among more than 6,000 World Bank personnel in
December, the president explained the initiative as part of his
overriding aim ``to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the Bank's
work and its objectives'' by providing ``a framework for liberating the
energies and skills of the rest of the organisation''.

The managing directors, who will become directly involved in specific
day-to-day management tasks, have been allocated the following roles:

* Mr Gautam Kaji will be joined by Mr Caio Koch-Weser, former vice-
president for the Middle East and Africa, for a joint controlling role
in charge of the bank's operations, policies and programmes.

Moving into the Middle East and Africa seat is Mr Kemal Dervis, who has
worked before on the Middle East.

Mr Koch-Weser, a Brazilian, was a very familiar face across the region,
including at various stages of the Middle East peace process.

Mr Spiros Voyadzis, another Middle East expert, has been named the
World Bank's special representative to the EU and manager of the bank's
new Brussels office.

* Mr Sven Sandstrom assumes charge of Human and Information Resources
and Management, in addition to Corporate Planning and Budgeting.

Mr Wolfensohn has identified personnel and training as the bank's
greatest problem areas.  According to the memo, Mr Sandstrom has been
given a two-year brief to turn around the bank's traditional ``armlock
of bureaucracy'' -- where task managers are reportedly separated from
upper levels by five management layers -- and to create a ``results
culture''.

* Ms Jessica Einhorn has been promoted to manage activities in finance
and resource mobilisation, supervising vice presidency functions
previously covered by the treasurer, the Controller, Financial Policy
and Risk Management and Cofinancing and Financial Advisory Services.

She will also assume the chairmanship of the bank's Finance Committee.

* Mr Richard Frank is to chair the Private Sector Development Group,
with responsibility for working with senior managers of the Bank Group
and to evolve the bank's overall private sector strategy, which is
making greater use of commercial markets through instruments, such as
its revamped guarantees (ITF 248/10).

Mr Frank has previously been responsible for working on the Bank's
future policy direction.

The moves will ``provide clear lines of authority for the main areas of
our business and to strengthen the Group's ability to address major
strategic issues'', said Mr Wolfensohn.

Committee launch

The five managing directors will form part of a new 10-strong Executive
Committee, which is to hold meetings on a weekly basis.

The Committee includes Mr Mark Malloch Brown, promoted from director to
vice-president of External Relations, and chief economist Mr Michael
Bruno, also elevated to vice presidential status.

Mr Malloch Brown has long links with non-governmental organisations and
the media.  His arrival in 1994 gave the bank a fresh approach to
public relations.

Mr Bruno is a widely respected former governor of the Central Bank of
Israel.

Where matters are related to the larger World Bank Group, the committee
will be enlarged to accommodate the executive vice president of the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), Mr Jannik Lindbaek, and the
executive vice president of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
agency (MIGA), Mr Akira Iida.

This fits a pattern profiled at the October 1995 World Bank/IMF annual
meeting in Washington, where exploratory strategies were announced for
greater co-ordination within the Group.

Further changes in 1996 will involve the uptake by 50 top executives of
management courses and the secondment of executive staff into industry
and private sector banks.

Mr Johannes Linn, whose experience at the bank includes several senior
economics posts, became the World Bank's vice-president for Europe and
Central Asia on 1 January, following the retirement of Mr Wilfred
Thalwitz.

Mr Timothy Thahane, the World Bank vice-president who narrowly missed
out becoming president of the African Development Bank, occupies a new
vice-presidency for United Nations affairs.  This office is intended to
better co-ordinate the World Bank's relations with the UN system.

He is replaced as vice-president and World Bank group secretary by Mr
Shengman Zhang, executive director for China since November 1994.

Mr Wolfensohn stressed in the memo that the goal of the bank continues
to be the promotion of sustainable development ``in the broadest
sense'', in particular the alleviation of poverty and assisting
countries in transition.  ``I have made it clear that I expect the
management to work with me at top pressure'', he concluded.

KLEINWORT TO EXPAND CROSS-BORDER REACH WITH LEASING UNIT ACQUISITION

Kleinwort Benson has moved to extend its cross-border reach through the
purchase of the leasing finance and advisory arm of SBC Warburg for an
undisclosed fee.

The acquisition of S G Warburg & Co (Leasing) comprises Warburg's
leasing portfolio and a ten-strong executive team, led by Mr Michael
Hardwick.

The Warburg team has acted as adviser and arranger to several big
ticket projects, including aircraft transactions involving Boeing,
Cathay Pacific and Air France; and the acquisition of Eurostar trains
for the Channel Tunnel.

Ongoing activities include negotiations with Malaysian Airlines.

``The international side of the business is mainly OECD-based, but is
developing fast in several Asia-Pacific countries'', Mr Hardwick tells
ITF.

Mr Hardwick says that his team's cross-border lease financing
activities have focused strongly on France, Germany, Finland, Denmark
and Japan.

The move adds some $500m to Kleinwort's existing leasing assets.

COFACE LAUNCHES NEW CROSS-BORDER FACILITY

Groupe Coface has initiated an innovative trade credit insurance scheme
in the UK -- and expects to extend the concept across, and possibly
beyond, Europe in response to the growing cross-border requirements of
multinational companies.

The French-based international credit insurer launched the pilot for a
new range of products entitled Globalalliance on 3 January through its
London-based Coface LBF arm.

Coface's pilot Euro Trader policy permits UK-based firms with
subsidiaries in EU countries to provide both domestic and international
cover for their group operations under one, singly worded policy chosen
from Coface LBF's Open Trader or Top Trader range.

``Euro Trader has been made possible by the highly integrated
information technology resources of Coface's Credit Alliance network'',
says Ms Bridget Taxy, head of Coface LBF.

``It enables a finance director, through a single negotiation, and with
a single point of contact, to arrange and manage closely-tailored
international cover backed up by practical local support throughout
Europe''.

Euro Trader makes use of the EU's ``Freedom of Services'' legislation,
which allows for cross-border insurance throughout the Union.  ``We
hope to go outside EU legislation eventually'', Ms Taxy tells ITF.

Innovative reach

Euro Trader's most striking innovation is its facility for operational
documentation in the currency, and often the language, of the local
subsidiary.

The parent company may also select varying degrees of centralisation or
decentralisation.  Choice is offered between a group wide strategy or
terms and conditions that more closely reflect individual subsidiaries'
needs at three different levels:

* rates for premium and service;

* indemnification levels;

* the ``excess'' threshold below which losses are for the account of
the policy holder.

For UK-based multinationals wishing to develop a gradual group wide
credit insurance strategy, the scheme can be initiated through just one
or two subsidiaries and extended at a later date.

Euro Trader is the latest in a series of product developments from
credit insurers battling for UK market share (ITF 251/4).

It also marks a further stage in a trend increasingly discernible in
the single European market whereby intra-EU deals are helping to fuel
the expansion of short-term political risk cover capacity among
insurers (ITF 252/13).

EAST EUROPEAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING ON HOLD

The European Union assistance programme to the CIS countries is
currently on hold, following opposition led by Spain to the way the
contracts are awarded.

The TACIS programme, with funds of about Ecu500m, provides technical
assistance and know-how for economic and reform programmes proposed by
the governments of the 12 former Soviet countries and Mongolia.

Spain has blocked the programme for 1996 because it wants reform of the
way the contracts are tendered and different criteria used in their
allocation.  Privately, officials say Spain is opposed to the programme
because their companies only win about 2 per cent of the contracts.

Last March, officials proposed new guidelines for the TACIS programme
to start this year, which would permit TACIS funds to be invested in
small and medium-sized enterprises and in infrastructure projects.

These funds are intended to be strategic investments that would
catalyse much larger funds from the World Bank, European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and other institutional investors.
Similar investments have been made successfully in Central Europe.

New formula

This new formula, extending the traditional mandate of the TACIS
programme, has already been approved by Parliament, but was blocked in
the Council of Ministers.  Officials plan to put it before the Council
again, but say that an ``educated guess'' would anticipate it being
rejected again.

The most likely outcome, say officials, is that the Council will
eventually approve a continuation of the former programme, restricting
funds to technical assistance and know-how transfer for one more year.
The new programme is likely to be postponed until 1997.

Meanwhile, officials are continuing to work on the programmes approved
using the 1995 budget.  Assuming the Council finally approves the TACIS
funds before the summer, officials are confident that all the funds
could be committed before the end of 1996.

DG BANK SETS UP FORFAITING OPERATION IN LONDON

Deutschegenossenschafts (DG Bank), the central business and investment
unit for Germany's popular and co-operative banks, has set up a trade
finance unit to market trade paper to the London forfaiting community.

Acting as the provider of corporate and international services for
almost 3,000 local institutions, DG Bank should be well placed to feed
a stream of export deals to forfait traders and investors in the
secondary market.

The new operation is being headed by Janine Barber, recruited from
Standard Bank London's forfaiting team.

Ms Barber's specialist knowledge of eastern Europe will be particularly
useful for DG Bank:  many of the small and medium-sized German firms
that form the core client base of the Volksbanks (popular) and
Raiffeisen (co-operative) banks are selling to the former communist
countries that lie across Germany's eastern border.  Indeed, during its
first weeks, DG's London trade finance operation has handled deals for
exports to Russia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia.

The fact that DG felt the need to set up a forfaiting presence in
London -- to supplement the forfaiting service already offered by its
head office in Frankfurt and enhance its ability to take on risks that
it would not want to keep for its own portfolio -- bears witness to the
central role that the UK's capital continues to play in the market for
trade paper.

London hub

Although the biggest users of the technique are probably Italian rather
than UK exporters, London remains the hub of the secondary trading that
has gradually expanded forfaiters' ability to do business over recent
years.  Indeed, the range of country risks that can now be sold on the
market is probably wider than at any previous time.

Confidence seems to have ridden out the shock of Mexico's late 1994
financial crisis;  large volumes of Latin American risk are still
traded.

And there are even signs of a renewed willingness to support deals with
Bulgaria -- whose credibility was shattered several years ago by its
readiness to take on new loans when it was on the verge of default.

During 1995, specialists, such as Hungarian International Bank (HIB)
and London Forfaiting Company (LFC), began to do Bulgarian short-term
deals;  and in recent weeks LFC has actually quoted three year terms,
albeit for a transaction of only DM1m.

What remains to be seen is how the market will evolve following the
announcement that HIB is to close.  The bank has been one of the
leading forces in the market, with a strong reputation in pioneering
the acceptance of deals with the more difficult ex-communist countries,
such as Croatia, or the Baltic states.

HIB will have a successor institution:  the Hungarian national savings
bank OTP is to set up a trade finance company in London -- based in the
same premises and using many of the same staff.  Capitalised at about
#1m and hoping to chalk up #50m or so of deals in the first year, this
should be able to build on the legacy of east European expertise.

All the clearers continue to offer forfaiting services, but at Barclays
and Lloyds these are integrated into the main trade finance operations,
alongside conventional export credit:  the aim is to put forward the
most competitive technique for each particular deal, whether it be
forfaiting or supplier credit (or something else).  Forfaiting is often
combined with export credit, particularly as a means of dealing with
the 15 per cent uninsured ``front end'' component of Export Credits
Guarantee Department deals.

Midland Bank Aval forms an integral part of the HSBC group and was one
of the first to spot the potential for combining forfaiting and export
credit in the same operation -- but it does maintain a large team of
forfaiting specialists in London and the Far East and generates a big
flow of deals from its own exporting customers in the UK, Italy and
elsewhere.  It uses the technique to finance a lot of trade between Far
Eastern countries.

West Merchant Bank is another leading export credit house which offers
forfaiting as an alternative or complementary financing option.

CHINA SECURES ECGD SUPPORT FOR POWER FACILITY, AIRPORT CONTRACT

The UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has agreed a major
new power-related facility for China, the boom market which absorbed
the largest volume of ECGD guarantees for any single country in the
agency's 1994/95 financial year.

ECGD has also backed the commercial portion of a UK mixed credit
package for the new airport at Nanjing, and is gearing up to mobilise
additional cover for a $2bn-plus power complex in Shandong.

ECGD announced on 20 December that it will provide a 15-year repayment
guarantee for a #351.5m commercial loan in support of a contract won by
GEC-Alsthom to design and supply equipment for the Ling Ao power
station, better known as Daya Bay II, in Guangdong province.

GEC-Alsthom was a leading supplier for China's first nuclear power
station at Daya Bay (ITF 249/3).
  At Ling Ao it is responsible this time for the turnkey design, supply
and supervision of commissioning of two 900 MW turbine generator units
and plant, scheduled for completion by 2003.

The commercial lending syndicate is led by West Merchant Bank (WMB),
acting as arranger, principal lender and agent bank.

The borrower is State Development Bank of China (SDB), the specialised
infrastructure financing institution established in early 1994.  ECGD
says it envisages further borrowing by SDB for nuclear power
transactions.

Airport take-off

Concessional funds from the UK's Overseas Development Administration
and ECGD-backed commercial lending have enabled Siemens Plessey to win
a #22.4m contract to design and equip Nanjing's new international
airport, in Jiangsu province.

WMB and Standard Chartered Bank are providing 65 per cent of the Aid &
Trade Provision financing, in a tranche fully guaranteed by ECGD.

The balance will be met by an ODA grant from the #55m Third
Concessional Financing Arrangement signed in September 1994 between the
UK and China.

ECGD is expected to participate in a $2.2bn-$2.5bn power project at
Shandong, for which Industrial Bank of Japan Asia, NatWest Markets and
Societe Generale Asia have been appointed as lead arrangers for the ECA-
backed financing.

Also taking a role is the Export-Import Bank of the US (Eximbank).

Both agencies were considering whether to extend favourable interest
rates for the scheme as ITF went to press.  ECGD and Eximbank had set a
mid-January deadline for a preferential rate of 5.95 per cent already
rolled over previously.  All parties were understood to be anxious to
avoid the proposed new rate of 7 per cent.

The sponsor, China Power Company -- a joint venture involving a 49 per
cent foreign stake from China Light & Power and Electricite de France --
anticipates raising some $800m through international syndication to add
to equity that may total as much as $600m.

The project encompasses four plants.  The international funding will be
channelled to the 1,300 MW Liaocheng and 700 MW Heze complexes.
Equipment is to be supplied by the US' Westinghouse Electric
Corporation and the UK's Babcock Energy.

Remaining funding is likely to be tapped domestically.

ITF COMMENT:  Rapid growth in the huge Chinese market means the country
will remain the most active trade finance market in 1996, especially as
Beijing is expected to relax its credit squeeze, imposed since mid-
1993.

The economy remains mined with problems associated with everything from
a sometimes opaque legislative framework and a commitment to obtaining
rock-bottom pricing to political risk factors, which include the
succession to Mr Deng Xioping and the People's Liberation Army's recent
threatening gestures towards Taiwan.

But the macroeconomic numbers and market's potential still dazzle -- and
ECAs continue to take a positive view in the ``national interest'' to
give companies a chance in the market that everyone wants to crack.

China's foreign trade grew by 18 per cent in 1995 to $280bn, producing
a trade surplus of over $20bn.  This compared to $5.35bn in 1994,
according to preliminary statistics released by Beijing on 5 January.
Foreign exchange reserves were estimated at $70bn at end-1995.  Foreign
investment grew by 11 per cent last year, reaching $37bn.

The pattern of ECGD's business is replicated by other ECAs.  The UK
agency's concentration on the fiercely contested Chinese market was
reflected in its 1994/95 annual report, which showed exposure totalling
#1.54bn (ITF 251/7).

China accounted for over 40 per cent of ECGD's commitments to the so-
called Amber Zone of priority markets in 1994/95.

Exposure is building, but there is more support to come.  ECGD's chief
executive, Mr Brian Willott, has confirmed that further capacity is
available for UK exporters to China.

China will remain a buoyant market provided its political problems do
not get out of control.  But it will be a market whose pitfalls can
upset even the most careful investors for years to come.

One not so happy New Year message came from State Economic & Trade
Commission official Mr Xu Ming, who complained that domestic firms were
being pushed out of joint ventures when profits increase and local
partners cannot match the new investments in equity made by their
foreign partners.

This apparently widespread trend is giving foreign partners majority
holdings -- and, Chinese officials complain, monopolies in some domestic
industrial sectors.

``It is almost unanimous -- when returns become high, foreign parties
will scramble to nudge their Chinese partners out of holding status
with their overwhelming funding power'', Mr Xu said. Local firms should
``stand up against the aggression of foreign partners'', he said.

The language of international capitalism, which investors and creditors
so like to hear, will continue to suffer problems of translation in
China.

BANKS LINE UP CHINESE PROJECT FINANCINGS

International and locally-based banks are lining up a raft of new
Chinese projects.

Standard Chartered Capital Markets is lead arranger for the non-
recourse financing of a gas-fired power plant in Zhabei, Shanghai.

The sponsors, GE Capital Corporation and the Shanghai Municipal
Electric Power Company, are looking to raise around $120m over 10
years.

China International Capital Corporation is seeking to raise around
$750m for an oil project in the north-east.  CICC has been appointed by
Jilin Oil and Gas Development to tap overseas funds over the next five
years to lift annual production at the Jilin field to 2m tonnes.

Official sources have indicated that a project financing, including a
substantial equity stake from a foreign partner, would be looked upon
favourably.

CICC is the country's first joint venture investment bank, involving,
among others, the US' Morgan Stanley.

China is apparently turning towards public/private sector development
even of social infrastructure.

Hong Kong-based commercial lenders, including Hongkong & Shanghai
Banking Corporation, are participating in a $550m private placement to
finance large-scale government subsidised housing projects in Chinese
cities.

The initiative, which has targeted Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing and
Wuhan, marks an innovative tie-up between the private sector and
municipal housing authorities.

Korean venture seeks funds

The South Korean conglomerate Hyundai Group and a local partner plan to
borrow the bulk of the finance for a $450m joint venture petrochemicals
project in China's Shandong province.

A formal contract will be signed in the coming months for the venture
to start work.  Hyundai, which will take 70 per cent of the equity, and
its local partner, Jinan Honghua Group, have already registered capital
of $119m.

The remaining finance, to build a plant to produce 50,000 tonnes of
chemicals for use in the production of nylon, will come from borrowing.

The local partner is a subsidiary of Jinan Petrochemical Bureau, which
has applied to the Chinese State Planning Commission to have the plant
included as a priority project open for foreign borrowing.

Next Challenge: Keep the Data Flowing

   Now that RTC has appeased Congress by publishing its initial real estate
inventory on time, the agency can turn its attention to the more important
task of delivering updated data to investors on a frequent basis.
   In unveiling the nationwide listing of 30,123 properties, RTC Executive
Director David C. Cooke said his agency will soon begin making asset
information available more often than the required semiannual reports.
However, he did not specify whether that meant quarterly or monthly
updates.
   Demand for detailed listings of RTC's holdings seems to be overwhelming,
based on the 22,000 written inquiries received by the agency in recent
months and the heavy order volume for the inventory report last week.
   As a result, entrepreneurs in the technology, publishing and marketing
industries are circling - hoping to help the bailout agency disseminate
fresh data on new properties assumed by RTC, as well as results of recent
sales.
   "The inventory will also be made available through a variety of
computer-compatible media," Cooke said.
   In fact, a consortium of reputable technology companies, not yet willing
to publicize its effort, is working to create a system which would allow
subscribers to use a personal computer to "dial in" to a central database
and conduct sophisticated analysis of RTC assets.
   In addition, the bailout agency has been approached by publishing
ventures that are eager to repackage the property listings to fit specific
needs of various investors.
   Rather than select one or two companies to deliver the information, RTC
will probably make the raw data on properties available to all potential
publishers and let users determine which of the competing services best
meets their needs.
   American Airlines Direct Marketing Corp., a unit of Dallas-base AMR
Corp., has seized one of the first inventory-related assignments. RTC hired
the firm to process orders for the three-volume property listing, which is
priced at $50.
   Later this month, AA Direct Marketing Corp. will begin operating a 900-
number telephone line, which will allow investors to order specialized
property listings for a nominal fee that will be charged on their regular
monthly telephone bill.
   For example, a caller reaching RTC's new asset information center could
request a listing of all single-family homes in the Phoenix area, and the
order would be processed and mailed within 24 hours. The phone number has
not yet been announced.
   Would-be investors and others needing to closely scrutinize each asset
say they hope the agency eventually expands its data collection effort to
include more than just basic information on each property.
   The new report on commercial properties, for instance, provides only an
address, square footage, a one-line description, the property's age, a
contact name and - in some cases - a list price.
   Congress' requirement that the inventory be rushed into print before
Dec. 31 made it impossible for RTC to include information on all of its
holdings. Instead, the report listed only properties with clear titles that
were held by the 283 thrifts under RTC control on Sept. 30. It does not
include assets held by S&L subsidiaries, or assets of institutions placed
in the conservatorship program during the fourth quarter.

Workout Firms Eye Louisiana Portfolios

   RTC's Baton Rouge field office is looking for private-sector help in
managing and disposing of nonperforming loans and real estate left over
from the resolutions of six Louisiana conservatorships.
   "We would like to have the bid packages out this month," said Jay
Hambric, who runs the Baton Rouge operation, one of four consolidated field
offices in RTC's east region. The assignments, which could be awarded
sometime in February, will be one of the first disposition contracts handed
out since RTC opened its doors five months ago.
   Roughly $300 million in assets will be put out for bid after the agency
packages them by type, size and quality. Categories will include real
estate, real estate loans, student loans, second mortgages and other types
of consumer credits. There is also expected to be more than one quality
category, including delinquent unsecured loans.
   Packages will likely be awarded to firms with experience and expertise
in managing assets in those particular categories. RTC officials in
Washington are deciding on the fee structure for the assignment.
   RTC also retained commercial loans from the six resolutions, but Hambric
said his office would concentrate on disposing of the consumer debt first
since there was so much more of it.
   He said his office would contract separately with a firm to conduct due
diligence reviews of the assets before they are packaged.
   By the time bids are invited, RTC expects that most interested parties
will have completed the agency's newly issued registration forms. Bids will
be accepted from only those firms whose registration statements meet RTC's
criteria. RTC still hasn't decided how it will publicize the request for
proposals.
   The targeted assets were on the books of the following six Louisiana
thrifts, whose deposits were transferred to healthy institutions on the
resolution date shown in parentheses:
   * Acadia S&LA FSA of Crowley (Oct. 6). Assets: $108 million.
   * River City FSB of Baton Rouge (Oct. 6). Assets: $73 million.
   * Enterprise FS&LA of Marrero (Sept. 8). Assets: $64 million.
   * Elmwood FS&LA of Harahan (Sept. 8). Assets $58 million.
   * Evangeline FS&LA of Lafayette (Aug. 18). Assets: $37 million.
   * First Savings of Louisiana FSA of La Place (Sept. 15). Assets: $25
million.

Final Blueprint Still Lacks Specifics

   RTC's policymakers last week unveiled a strategic plan that acknowledges
key concerns of real estate and asset management professionals, but in some
ways fails to spell out precisely how the agency will address those
matters.
   Industry and government observers agreed that the three-member Oversight
Board placed the greatest emphasis on disposal of marketable assets as
quickly as possible.
   But the Board, headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, was far
from specific in addressing the need for incentive-based compensation for
contractors. It said contractors could be paid "as a percentage of proceeds
net of expenses, with the percentage increasing as proceeds increase
relative to the estimated market value of assets."
   While that description acknowledges the industry's rejection of fixed
fees, it failed to state exactly whether RTC would be willing to pay base
fees - to cover a management firm's costs - in addition to performance-
based fees.
   The industry's desire to perform the asset management, or general
contractor, role in liquidations was mentioned - but not directly addressed
- in the strategic plan.
   On Capitol Hill, the document drew early applause. Rep. Bruce Vento, a
Minnesota Democrat who heads a House task force monitoring the thrift
bailout, said he was pleased with the Board's decision to quickly dispose
of the assets. "Procrastinating is much more of a risk because you have to
pay to manage [the assets]. The stuff doesn't get better with age," Vento
said in a wire service article.
   Anticipating accusations of dumping, the Board justified its pledge to
move swiftly, saying that "holding properties off the market for an
extended period of time may increase the ultimate costs of asset
disposition because of the expenses associated with managing and financing
the property." It also noted the risks of deterioration if properties are
held in RTC's portfolio for long periods.
   "It is, therefore, important to begin returning assets to the private
sector as soon as feasible," the strategic plan states.
   Oversight Board President Daniel P. Kearney attempted to silence charges
of dumping real estate on depressed markets by explaining that it would
take several years for RTC to complete the "arduous" legal process of
taking clear title to its properties and readying them for the market.
   Christopher Kallivokas, president of Real Estate Recovery Inc., an asset
management firm based in Sterling, Va., agreed that fears of property
dumping were unfounded. Kallivokas argues that the RTC for the most part
won't be delivering new properties to the market. "Virtually every property
in the RTC's inventory has been available [to buyers] for some time under
their former ownership, whether it was a former S&L or FSLIC," he said.

   RTC closed the year by taking over two small thrifts: the $70.9 million-
asset Columbia FSA, Webster, Tex., and the $27.5 million-asset Silver SA
FA, Silver City, N.M.
   During 1989 the agency resolved 37 institutions, as shown in the
breakdown below. Another 11 were advertised for sale in November, and those
transactions should be completed shortly.

Crafting the Rescue Process

   The Oversight Board's strategic plan instructs RTC to take specific
steps to assure that it resolves failed thrift institutions quickly and
inexpensively without threatening local financial and real estate markets.
Those instructions include:
   * Limit any new lending or investments by conservatorships to low-risk
assets.
   * By Jan. 15, develop a prioritization schedule for institutions to be
marketed and resolved.
   * By Jan. 15, develop plans for soliciting bids from all interested
qualified buyers, including procedures for encouraging the participation of
women and minorities in the bidding process.
   * By Jan. 15, develop procedures for making available to all potential
bidders full information on each institution under RTC control and for
notifying rejected bidders within 30 days.
   * By March 30, establish a national sales program to coordinate the
disposition of any financial assets held in conservatorship.
   * By March 30, report to the Oversight Board on the feasibility of
hedging RTC's overall interest rate exposure.
   * By Aug. 31, report to the Oversight Board and Congress on the review
of case resolutions entered into by FSLIC between Jan. 1, 1988, and Aug. 9,
1989.

RTC Fills Key Housing Post

   RTC has named Stephen S. Allen, a veteran of the non-profit housing
community, to serve as director of the agency's low-income housing program.
   Allen takes the helm of RTC's most politically sensitive area after 13
years with the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., where he was an associate
director in charge of neighborhood preservation projects. In that position,
he directed the group's development efforts in designing model
public/private partnerships for affordable housing.
   At his new post, Allen will direct and coordinate the sale of RTC's
residential properties to eligible buyers nationwide. An RTC statement said
he and his staff plan to work closely with state housing finance agencies,
various national non-profit housing organizations and governmental
associations to identify eligible buyers.

RTC Writes a Best Seller

   If only demand was this strong for RTC's real estate...
   The company handling inquiries and orders for the agency's newly
published property listings was flooded with more than 15,000 toll-free
calls in its first two days on the job.
   Those placing orders by phone last week were told by harried operators
that they probably would not receive their books for about a month - quite
a long time considering that RTC's Oversight Board just instructed the
liquidation agency to "avoid deferring the marketing of properties."
   Some calling the 800-number that leads to the Dallas headquarters of
American Airlines Direct Marketing Corp. received the following recorded
message: "Due to the overwhelming response to the Resolution Trust Corp.
program, all of our agents are busy. Please call back later." Others were
simply asked to hold for the next available agent.
   "It's very hectic" said one weary operator, who couldn't offer an
estimate for the number of orders placed by the 15,000 callers during the
first two days.
   Copies of the inventory report may be ordered by calling (800) 431-0600.
    The reports are priced at $10 each for the commercial and land volumes,
and $15 each for the single-family and multi-family residential reports.
The complete set is available for $50. Check, credit card or C.O.D. orders
are accepted.
   The same toll-free number may also be used to inquire about locating the
reports at one of 1,400 depository libraries throughout the country.

GRAPEVINE

   RTC's Dallas staff underwent a growth spurt last week when nearly 50
employees of the defunct Federal Asset Disposition Association joined the
bailout agency's regional office. The new recruits are filling asset
management, contracting and support positions at various levels. Among
those assuming key RTC posts will be former FADA contracting staffer Janie
Thomas, who will serve as senior contracting specialist in Dallas. Many
staffers from FADA's Atlanta office have joined RTC in that city, too.
   Asset managers are hoping RTC will sharpen its definition of "competing
properties" in the agency's conflict-of-interest rules. As currently
worded, the provision could preclude a contractor from managing West Coast
apartment buildings if that firm owned "competing" apartment buildings on
the East Coast. The industry's recommended solution: RTC's conflict rules
should concern themselves only with similar properties in the same
immediate, geographic market.
   Staffers at the RTC Oversight Board are zeroing in on appointees to
chair the national advisory board and each of six regional advisory panels.
The seven, who will comprise the national board, will help select the
remaining regional advisers. After sifting through scores of nominating
letters, the staff will soon eliminate the runners up and ask the Oversight
Board to okay their selections. The seven are expected to be named within
the next month or so.
   It looks like RTC's consolidated office network in the western region
may not be operational until spring, despite what was originally a January
target. The Denver-based operation, which was initially dealt a larger sum
of thrift assets than any other region, has been slow in establishing its
three field offices slated for Denver, Phoenix and somewhere in Orange
County, Calif. By contrast, the east region has already opened its four
field offices, and begun staffing. The Baton Rouge, La. office, for
instance, already employs 55.
   Staffers in the Baton Rouge field office are trying to remove the
mystique from RTC's registration process for aspiring contractors. Agency
officials will spend the next two Monday's conducting educational seminars
for firms in Louisiana and Mississippi.
   New England's real estate lenders took another pounding in the third
quarter. Veribanc Inc., a financial statistics firm in Wakefield, Mass.,
said real estate-related loans and real estate repossessed by New England
banks increased for the thirteenth consecutive quarter. At southwest banks,
however, the situation seems to have stabilized and - by some measures -
improved. Third-quarter figures for the S&L industry are still to come.

RTC's Regional Office Network Takes Shape

   It will take a few more months for RTC to finish staffing its regional
offices, though most key management positions have already been filled at
the four locations.
   Next on the agenda is building a network of consolidated field offices,
where much of the contracting work is expected to take place. The east and
central regions have begun organizing field offices, while the southwest
and west regions have not yet announced sites or managers for their
outposts.
