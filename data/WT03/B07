 ARGENTINA: CAVALLO FINALLY SACKED JUST BEFORE FRESH ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS 
with IMF

 Economy minister Domingo Cavallo should have known that his number was up 
when President Carlos Menem gave him his full backing on 19 July, in the 
face of concerted attacks from the trade unions and deputies of the ruling 
Partido Justicialista (see WR-96-29). The trouble is, it had happened so 
many times before that it was difficult to know when the President no longer 
meant what he said. On 26 July, Menem gave Cavallo the sack.

 The long-serving minister had been at loggerheads with both President and 
party for so long that there seemed no reason to suppose the latest episode 
was any different from earlier ones.

 Only days before he was dismissed, Cavallo had prevailed upon Menem to push 
through, by presidential decree, a new round of unpopular fiscal austerity 
measures. These were in response to figures indicating that tax revenues in 
the first half-year had fallen well short of what was expected, leading to a 
fiscal deficit of US Dollars 2.508bn: slightly more than the total agreed 
with the International Monetary Fund for the whole year.

 Cavallo had been due to begin negotiations with the Fund in mid-August for 
a waiver on the targets set in the earlier agreement. He prepared the way by 
ordering a series of spending cuts and tax increases, designed to cut the 
deficit by up to US Dollars 1bn a year.

 Some 2.4m workers stood to lose benefits when state aid for dependent 
families was cut, and more than 1m may face reductions in food subsidies 
paid by employers as part of the total wage.

 The trade unions grouped in the Confederacion General del Trabajo (CGT), 
traditionally associated with the ruling Peronist party, responded by 
calling a general strike for 8 August, just before talks with the Fund were 
due to begin.

 Unions feel that the workers have been made to carry the can for the 
failures of government economic policies -just as PJ deputies feel the party 
suffered the consequences of their unpopularity in the Buenos Aires mayoral 
elections at the end of June.

 Relations between government and unions have been made even more strained 
by the latest unemployment figures, which put joblessness in the country as 
a whole at 17.1%. The figure last October was an already high 16.4%. The 
situation is considerably worse in Buenos Aires, at 20.4%.

 Menem has promised that the replacement of Cavallo by central bank 
president Roque Fernandez means no changes to economic policy. Foreigners, 
who loved Cavallo, may take some convincing.

 CHILE: COPPER: SUMITOMO SCANDAL CAUSES HEADACHES: CODELCO RECALCULATES 
REVENUE PROJECTIONS

 While the rest of the world has been debating whether or not former 
Sumitomo copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka was a rogue operator out of the Nick 
Leeson mould, Chileans in general and the state-owned Codelco copper 
corporation in particular have been recalculating their projections of 
export earnings for this year.

 Price falls. There seems little doubt that the fall in the world copper 
price in the wake of the Sumitomo debacle will cut Chile's foreign exchange 
revenues and add to the country's swelling current account deficit this year 
(see detailed figures in WR-96-28). There will be longer-term effects, too.

 One of them is that the US Dollars 240m Lomas Bayas mine project is being 
delayed by Gibraltar Mines of Canada, as it has been unable to raise the 
necessary financing. The company had been hoping to bring the mine onstream 
in 1998, with annual output of 60,000-90,000 tonnes per year.

 Chile currently produces about 30% of the world's copper (1.2m tpy), and 
investment plans aim to raise that proportion to 40% by the beginning of the 
new millennium. So any reduction in its revenues, and any delays in 
investment projects, have potentially serious implications.

 By mid-July, Codelco had calculated that its income would fall by about US 
Dollars 500m this year. Profits in 1995 amounted to US Dollars 1.7bn, thanks 
to an average world price of US Dollars 1.34/lb. This year marketing vice-
president Juan Eduardo Herrera puts projected revenues no higher than US 
Dollars 1.2bn, on the assumption that the copper price will be around US 
Dollars 1.05-US Dollars 1.10/lb by the end of the year. Original 
calculations were based on an average price of US Dollars 1.15-US Dollars 
1.20/lb.

 Herrera remains optimistic, however, that the situation might begin to 
improve from September, by which time the depressing effect on prices of 
Sumitomo's desperate unloading of its copper stocks, in an attempt to recoup 
losses of US Dollars 1.8bn, might have begun to work itself out.

 Military share. One contentious proposal put forward by Codelco to offset 
the loss of revenues is to stop paying the armed forces the 10% share of 
gross sales revenues to which they are entitled by law. This idea has 
already been put forward by Codelco executive president Juan Villarzu, 
backed by Herrera. The government, however (and of course the military), are 
not keen.

 Villarzu sees the transfer of all military financing obligations to the 
general state budget as the only way to keep Codelco's investment plans -and 
particularly exploration projects in Peru and Argentina- on track. Codelco 
paid over US Dollars 340m to the military last year.

 The government, however, nipped this idea in the bud. 'It's not on our 
agenda,' said interior minister Carlos Figueroa in mid-June. He added that, 
however reasonable the proposal might seem, and however much support it 
might have across the political spectrum, this was not a good moment to 
suggest it.

 Another possible way forward for Codelco -privatisation of the company, as 
advocated by the right-wing opposition- has also been ruled out by the 
government. It proposes instead a restructuring of the corporation, under 
which each mine would become an autonomous division, making its own business 
decisions.

 Legislation to that effect has been passed by the lower house of congress 
but blocked in the senate, where the opposition argues that it envisages an 
unacceptably subordinate role for private capital. The government retorts 
that private interests are welcome to enter into exploration agreements with 
Codelco, as Cyprus Amax has done for the El Abra project. But the four big 
existing mines -Chuquicamata, El Teniente, Adina and Salvador, plus the new 
Radomiro Tomic project -must remain in state hands.

 CLUES TO CODELCO FRAUD

 One positive side-effect of the Sumitomo affair might be to cast some light 
on the fraud perpetrated against Codelco by one of its traders in 1993. Juan 
Pablo Davila lost US Dollars 175m for Codelco by unsuccessful speculation in 
the futures market over a period of about four years, and was imprisoned for 
his pains. He still faces trial on fraud charges.

 Codelco is anxious to find out if Davila and Hamanaka had the same 
international contacts and used the same methods for concealing their 
operations. The corporation has already suggested that the London Metals 
Exchange should tighten up its regulatory procedures, which it regards as 
inadequate to control the activities of skilful speculators.

 PINOCHET SUCCESSION

 One reason why the government does not want to rock the boat over military 
finances is that the delicate matter of the succession to General Pinochet 
as commander-in-chief of the army is currently under discussion.

 Defence minister Edmundo Perez Yoma confirmed at the beginning of July that 
President Eduardo Frei would use a special law to defer the retirement of 
one of four senior generals for a year to smooth the transition from 
Pinochet when he finally bows out in March 1998.

 The four senior generals due to retire on 30 September this year, who might 
be beneficiaries of the so-called 'Canessa law,' are deputy commander 
Guillermo Garin, chief of staff Ricardo Quas, inspector-general Jaime Concha 
Pantoja and the commander of the first army corps, Ramon Castro Ivanovic.

 ROBOTS IN THE MINES

 Aware that a low level of technological innovation is one of the weak 
points of its development model (see WR-96-27), the Chilean government has 
begun to experiment with automated systems in the copper mines. The El 
Teniente division of Codelco announced at the beginning of July that it 
would use Chilean-developed robots in its new Esmeralda mine, which is 
expected to come onstream in the second half of next year.

 Economy minister Alvaro Garcia has called for a doubling of the present 
level of investment in technological innovation, which is only 0.8% of GDP, 
or US Dollars 480m a year; 23% of that is spent by the private sector.

 CHILE: DRUGS: SEVEN HELD AFTER BIG COCAINE BUST: FORMER COLOMBIAN DIPLOMAT 
AMONG THOSE ARRESTED

 The seizure of 600kg of cocaine in the port of San Antonio, south of 
Santiago, on 10 July focused attention once again on the increasing use of 
Chile as a transit country for drug shipments from Colombia, Peru and 
Bolivia to markets in other parts of the world. It also revived interest in 
a scandal allegedly involving drug-trafficking in the Chilean congress.

 Seven arrests. The interior ministry announced a tightening-up of controls 
at ports, airports and frontier crossings in the wake of the San Antonio 
episode, for which seven people were subsequently arrested, including two 
Colombians.

 One of them, Alberto Botero, was a former diplomat assigned to Santiago who 
had left the Colombian foreign service in 1995 to go into the clothing 
import business in the city. His sister, Constanza, was also detained after 
her arrival from Colombia a few days before the seizure. An examining 
magistrate, Marcos Felzestein, has been put in charge of the case.

 Carabineros General Ruben Olivares, head of the anti-drug directorate, said 
Chile had been selected as a transit country because of the high 
international reputation of its exporters; the mere fact that goods were 
from Chile meant that customs checks in the United States and Europe were 
less rigorous than usual.

 The San Antonio consignment, the biggest ever confiscated in Chile, with an 
estimated street value of US Dollars 14.5m, had been bound for Miami. The 
drugs were concealed in three autoclaves, used for sterilising surgical 
instruments, all of which had false bottoms.

 The merchandise had been unloaded in a container a few days earlier from a 
Colombian-flag merchant ship, belonging to the Flota Mercante 
Grancolombiana. The Chilean customs authorities did not believe the shipping 
line was aware of what was in the container. The gang involved had been 
under surveillance for two months, the police reported.

 The largest previous confiscation of cocaine in Chile was in 1989, when 
500kg of the drug were found in a container in the port of Arica. 

 Enter Investigaciones. Que Pasa magazine claimed in mid-July that 
Carabineros had been dragging their feet over the inquiry into the alleged 
drug-trafficking racket in congress, forcing Valparaiso examining magistrate 
Roberto Contreras to turn to the plain-clothes police (Investigaciones) for 
help with phone-tapping and covert surveillance -operations in which 
Carabineros refused to become involved.

 The right-wing magazine claims that officials of the ruling Christian 
Democrat group in congress were implicated, and at least one of those 
interrogated had agreed to cooperate under a plea-bargaining arrangement. 
The involvement of deputies, it said, had yet to be established. 
Distributors and buyers of the cocaine, which was brought into Chile through 
Arica, appeared to be administrative and security personnel of both 
chambers.

 On 28 June the first arrests were made by Investigaciones, including the 
former secretary of the PDC group in congress, Maria Luisa Espejo.

 Nelson Mery, head of Investigaciones, said at the beginning of the year 
that drug-trafficking was his main target, and that he was in favour of all 
public officials submitting to random drug tests.

 CHILE: ECONOMY: INCOME INEQUALITY JIBE UPSETS ANINAT: MINISTER SAYS HIGH 
GROWTH, LOW INFLATION ARE THE ANSWER

 Even as a remarkable upsurge in economic activity in April caused the 
government to revise upwards its projection for GDP growth this year from 
6.5% to 7%, concern was growing at the persistent poverty and widening 
income disparities that are the downside of Chile's economic success.

 The central bank reported at the end of June that growth in April was 
10.2%, and 9.3% for the first four months of the year. The figure for the 
whole of last year was 8.3%.

 Aninat regrets. Finance minister Eduardo Aninat hailed the performance as a 
guarantee of more jobs and higher wages. But two weeks later Aninat was 
expressing regret that more people wee not benefiting from the economic 
growth. He said better income distribution was desirable, provided it did 
not disturb the macro-economic equilibrium Chile had achieved at such cost.

 The minister was reacting to a World Bank report, released in Washington at 
the end of June, which said Chile had one of the most unequal income 
distributions in the world. He asserted that steady 7% growth and low 
inflation (the target is 6.5% this year) would bring greater equality of 
incomes.

 Aninat took exception to the World Bank's interpretation of Chilean 
statistics, which it said showed that 20% of the population had 61% of the 
national income. The true figure was 56%, Aninat said.

 The Bank gives Chile an income inequality index of 0.56 (on a scale of 0-
1), which is second only to Brazil (0.60) in South America.

 The Chilean government's own surveys suggest that 28% of the population 
live in poverty.

 An opinion poll in mid-July indicated that 55% of Chileans regard the 
current neo-liberal economic model as unfair -compared with 46% a year ago. 
But 55% also approve of the government's performance.

 CHILE: INSIGHT: CHILE SORTS OUT BANKS' SUBORDINATE DEBT: IN THE PROCESS, IT 
LOSES A CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT

 The recent resignation of Chile's central bank president, Roberto Zahler, 
was triggered, in his own words, by 'situations in recent months' -which he 
did not spell out, but which most analysts read as alluding to political 
pressures for a solution to a particular, longstanding problem: the US 
Dollars 4.3bn 'subordinate debt' still owed by several banks to the central 
bank for bailing them out of the crisis of 1982.

 Zahler is said to have adopted a 'tough' stand on this matter, which left 
him in a minority of one in the five-member board of the central bank. The 
precise nature of this stand is not known, but the solutions that the board 
has been approving are.

 Of the five banks who still owed substantial sums of 'subordinate debt' at 
the beginning of this year, one -Banco BHIF- has already repaid its 
obligations with the proceeds of an issue of American Depositary Receipts 
(ADRs). The state of play with the four that remain is as follows:

 Banco Concepcion (which owes US Dollars 669m) and Banco Internacional (US 
Dollars 130m) will be settling their debts soon, with an issue of shares 
which will be given to the central bank in lieu of payment -and will then be 
bought back by the shareholders at a substantial discount (about US Dollars 
182m, or 78% of their joint debt).

 Banco de Chile, which owes US Dollars 1.74bn, has struck a deal which will 
allow it to repay its debt over 40 years, also with a substantial (but as 
yet unspecified) discount.

 Banco de Santiago, which owes US Dollars 1.76bn, still has a year in which 
to reach a settlement -and is also certain to benefit from a hefty discount.

 Valparaiso-based consultant Armen Kouyoumdjian* reckons that the entire 
settlement exercise will cost the central bank about US Dollars 1.6bn.

 Attention will naturally focus on the details of the deals with the two 
last banks mentioned, Santiago and Chile, who jointly account for 81% of the 
'subordinate debt' still outstanding -and which are the two most powerful 
private banks in Chile's financial system.

 Jointly they account for just over 21% of all the lending in the Chilean 
market (11.5% for Chile and 9.6% for Santiago). The only institution with a 
larger market share is the state-owned Banco del Estado, with 12%. They are 
also quite unique in that they seem to disprove an item of common wisdom 
about Latin American banking: that big does not always mean profitable.

 These two banks, the biggest private lenders, are also the two with the 
highest returns on equity -if, that is, the 'subordinate debt' is left out 
of the calculations. (Actually, this holds true for many of the second-tier 
banks: of the next five in market share, four are among the Chilean system's 
10 most profitable banks).

 The accompanying graphs, which illustrate the position of the Chilean 
banking system at the end of June this year, show that private locally-owned 
banks are more profitable, as a group, than state banking, and that the 
latter is more profitable than the foreign-owned banks -the big exception 
being Banco Santander, which ranks both among the big lenders, with a 7% 
share, and among the 10 most profitable in the country.

 It is among the foreign-owned banks that one finds the only three 
lossmakers at mid-year: American Express, Boston and Real.

 *In his privately distributed Occasional Paper No17, The Chilean Financial 
System, of 19 July -which also provided the statistical base for the graphs 
accompanying this article.

 By the way, the appointment of a successor to Zahler may not be announced 
for another month or so. Among the candidates being mentioned are Carlos 
Massad, Jose Pablo Arellano, Manuel Marfan, Joaquin Vial and Juan Andres 
Fontaine. The latter, formerly the bank's head of research, is the candidate 
of the opposition -their contribution to an 'independence' already 
compromised by the incorporation of Pablo Pinera.

 CHILE: FOCUS: SO HOW MUCH DID CHILE INVEST ABROAD?: A LOOK AT WIDELY 
DIVERGENT ESTIMATES

 Chile-watchers are entitled to be somewhat confused. In late June, within 
four days of each other, two institutions came out with calculations of the 
amount invested by Chileans in their main foreign market which differed by a 
factor of four.

 The central bank reported that accumulated Chilean investment in Argentina, 
between 1975 and May 1996, had reached US Dollars 1.3bn -almost 42% of the 
total invested abroad by Chileans in that period.

 The Camara de Comercio put the figure for investment in Argentina at US 
Dollars 5.5bn. It did so in the context of a report noting how Peru was 
growing as the second most important market for Chilean investment, with an 
accumulated total, to end-1995, of US Dollars 2.3bn -more than the central 
bank says was invested abroad in the whole of South America.

 Two reasons have been advanced to explain the huge discrepancy between the 
two estimates. One, mentioned by Chilean entrepreneurs to the Argentine 
business magazine Apertura, is that a large portion of Chilean investment 
abroad was financed from external (non-Chilean) sources, and that the 
central bank, quite appropriately, was only accounting that portion of the 
investment which was an outflow from Chile.

 Another, suggested to us by a veteran Chile-watcher, is that in many cases 
what was being counted as Chilean investment was actually the entire value 
of ventures in which the Chileans had only a share, but had also secured the 
management of the scheme.

 The central bank figures show that in the first five months of this year 
Chileans invested abroad a further US Dollars 433.4m, increasing the total 
stock by 16%.

 The Camara de Comercio predicts that by the end of this year, Chilean 
investment in Peru alone will have reached US Dollars 3bn, increasing the 
stock there by 30%.

 The chamber notes that 110 Chilean firms are now established in Peru. About 
a third of these have acquired interests in state companies privatised by 
the Peruvian government; another 40% have set up subsidiaries of their own.

 Apart from becoming Chile's second-largest investment market, Peru is 
growing in importance as an export market: last year Chile exported US 
Dollars 438m (and imported only US Dollars 147m). Talks on a complementation 
agreement, suspended since last November, are about to be resumed.

 CHILE: ENVIRONMENT: GASANDES CHANGES PIPELINE ROUTE: PRESSURE GROUPS WIN 
PARTIAL VICTORY IN CAJON DEL MAIPO

 The protracted conflict between the communities of the Cajon del Maipo and 
the GasAndes consortium, chronicled in these pages (see RS-96-05, RS-95-07), 
was resolved at the end of June, when the two sides signed an agreement. The 
accord with the villages of San Alfonso and Pirque will enable the Chilean-
Canadian consortium to route through the community the pipeline that will 
carry natural gas 465km from Argentina to Santiago and central Chile. 
GasAndes now expects the project to be completed by May 1977.

 Partial victory. The accord represented a partial victory for the people of 
San Alfonso, as the consortium agreed to change the original route of the 
pipeline, diverting it away from residential areas and the Cascada de las 
Animas nature reserve, and stepping up security -the two main demands of the 
local activists.

 Angel Santander, president of the San Alfonso residents' committee, said he 
would have preferred the pipeline to take another route altogether, but his 
committee felt it had made its point, and accepted the agreement to avoid 
further confrontations.

 The precedent has been established, as far as environmentalists are 
concerned, that a community can negotiate directly with a big consortium and 
win important concessions. Manuel Baquedano, president of the Instituto de 
Ecologia Politica, said an 'unprecedented advance' had been achieved.

 Local improvements fund. San Alfonso will appoint its own technical 
commission to supervise the works, and GasAndes will contribute with US 
Dollars 1m to a special fund for improving local amenities.

 The accord was mediated by the chairman of the chamber of deputies, Jaime 
Estevez, following a clash with police in which several people were injured. 
'This is a debate that is only just getting under way in Chile, which 
basically concerns the contradiction between development projects and living 
standards in a community. The country has been growing for 12 consecutive 
years and these sorts of situations are going to arise again and again,' he 
said.

 'NUCLEAR DUSTBIN' PROTESTS 

 Environmental groups have joined residents of the Palena district, 1,600km 
south of Santiago, in rejecting plans for a nuclear waste site at Gastre, in 
Argentina's Chubut province, 160km from the border. Concern about a project 
that dates back to 1980 has been heightened in Chile by the Menem 
government's plans to privatise the nuclear power industry.

 Chile's Comite Pro Defensa de la Flora y Fauna (Codaff) claims that the 
material to be buried at Gastre is highly radioactive, with a half-life of 
250,000 years. Similar protests have taken place in Argentine Patagonia, and 
the governors of the southern provinces have declared the region a nuclear-
free zone.

 Potential bidders for Argentina's three nuclear power stations (one of 
which, Atucha II, is unfinished) have made availability of a waste disposal 
site a condition for their further interest. Legislation paving the way for 
the sale is making its way through the Argentine congress, in the teeth of 
fierce opposition.

 CHILE: NATIVE WOODLANDS ESTIMATE INCREASED: NEW PULP PROJECT PROVOKES 
VALDIVIA PROTEST

 The Chilean ministry of agriculture has upgraded its estimate of the total 
area of native woodlands from 8m hectares to 11m. The figure emerged from 
the country's first forest census, and was designed to allay the concerns of 
ecological groups, which fear that the country's native forests are 
dwindling fast as a result of commercial forestry. Chile's temperate rain 
forests begin at Valdivia, 830km south of Santiago, and continue to Tierra 
del Fuego.

 Agriculture minister Emiliano Ortega conceded that it was vital to protect 
the resource in the face of rising world demand for timber, wood pulp and 
chips. The pulp of native species such as alerce, trepa, coigue, lenga and 
lingue is regarded as particularly suitable for the manufacture of high-
quality computer paper. Chile's exports of forest products totalled US 
Dollars 2.4bn in 1995.

 Exports down. Exports were, however, 20% down by value and 11.3% by volume 
in the first five months of this year: US Dollars 768.7m against US Dollars 
960.9m, Jose Antonio Prado, director of the Corporacion Nacional Forestal 
(Conaf) reported on 17 July.

 Japan (19.9%), South Korea (11.8%) and the US (11.7%) remained Chile's 
principal customers, but international wood pulp and chips prices have 
fallen sharply in the early months of this year.

 Arauco project. One of the biggest wood pulp plants in the world, a 550,000 
tonnes-per-year facility costing up to US Dollars 1bn, is planned for 
Valdivia. But, taking note of growing concerns about the environmental 
impact of development projects (see RS-96-03), the government, through the 
Comision Nacional del Medio Ambiente (Conama), is withholding the necessary 
permits until environmentalists' objections are addressed.

 Protected wetlands and a bird sanctuary stand to be affected by toxic 
liquid effluent from the plant, which is to be built by Celulosa Arauco, 
Chile's biggest wood pulp exporter. Proposals for a solution from the 
company threaten the livelihoods of a fishing community further up the 
coast.

 Arauco accounted for 18.7% of Chile's total forestry exports in 1995. 
Second was Celulosa del Pacifico with 10.1%. It is owned by Copec, one of 
Chile's biggest economic groups.

 ARGENTINA: POLITICS: PROTEST VOTE IN BUENOS AIRES POLLS: BOTH RADICALS AND 
FREPASO TROUNCE OFFICIAL CANDIDATE

 The first direct elections for mayor of Buenos Aires at the end of June 
were a triumph for the Union Civica Radical (UCR), a good result for Frente 
Pais Solidario (Frepaso), a disaster for the ruling Partido Justicialista 
(PJ) and a wipe-out for the far-left.

 Comeback for UCR. The UCR, an urban party if ever there was one, has had a 
patchy recent history in the capital, losing out badly to Frepaso in the 
last elections. The victory of Fernando de la Rua, who won almost 40% of the 
votes, was a clear return to favour in the party's traditional stronghold. 
He takes over on 6 August.

 'This should not be seen as the end but the beginning,' De la Rua said, 
referring perhaps not just to the Radicals' revived fortunes but to his own 
hopes of securing the party nomination for the 1999 presidential elections.

 Frepaso did better than expected, in view of its recent splits and internal 
tensions. Norberto La Porta won more than a quarter of the votes, leaving 
the incumbent, Jorge Dominguez (PJ) trailing in a distant third, only just 
ahead of Peronist defector Gustavo Beliz (Nueva Dirigencia), who was backed 
by former Frepaso leader Jose Octavio Bordon (see table).

 It was a huge protest vote against the national government, particularly 
against the corruption with which it has become associated in the public 
mind. La Porta also noted that the result was the voice of the 'pauperised 
middle classes' of the capital, who have suffered from President Carlos 
Menem's downsizing of the public sector.

 Menem attempted, however, to make the best of things, denying that the 
result was a plebiscite on his government's performance, and claiming that 
Dominguez had been the best mayor the city had ever had. He promptly 
appointed him defence minister when a vacancy arose a few days later (see 
below).
Any hope that the extreme left and assorted green parties might have had of 
capitalising on the prevailing disenchantment with the government was 
quickly scotched: they won only 1.9% of the votes between them.

 Frepaso also secured a majority in the assembly, the 60-seat Convencion 
Estatuyente, charged with drawing up the statutes under which the capital 
will henceforth be governed. Chairing the assembly will be Frepaso senator 
Graciela Fernandez Meijide, who has been outspokenly critical of the limits 
placed by the federal government on the supposedly autonomous city 
government's powers.

 GRACIELA FERNANDEZ MEIJIDE

 Senator Fernandez, 65, won 34.75% of the votes as head of the Frepaso list, 
and has established her credentials as a serious candidate for Frepaso's 
presidential nomination in 1999, despite a late start in politics. She 
entered the party at the age of 60, and was elected senator for Buenos Aires 
last October, with 45.6% of the votes.

 A teacher of French, she became a human rights activist after her son 
'disappeared' in 1977, and was a member of the 1984 commission, chaired by 
writer Ernesto Sabato, which investigated the abuses of the military regime.

 FERNANDO DE LA RUA

 The new mayor of the capital is a 58-year-old lawyer from Cordoba. He has 
served three terms as senator for Buenos Aires and was the UCR vice-
presidential candidate in 1973. Ten years later he lost out to Raul Alfonsin 
in a competition for the UCR presidential nomination, but in 1991 became 
head of the party's organisation in the capital.

 ARGENTINA: MENEM LETS THREE MINISTERS GO: BARRA AND CAMILION PRECEDE 
CAVALLO AS DISCONTENT GROWS

 The loss of two cabinet ministers in one week may suggest that President 
Menem has grown careless, after years of standing by his lieutenants through 
thick and thin. There are those who believe his willingness to sacrifice 
first justice minister Rodolfo Barra and then defence minister Oscar 
Camilion had something to do with finding sacrificial victims to placate a 
public grown tired of his government.

 Barra ostensibly went because his right-wing nationalist past caught up 
with him -though, as our sister publication, Latin American Weekly Report, 
pointed out at the time, he had also become an inconvenience for economy 
minister Domingo Cavallo (see WR-96-28). Within days, Cavallo had gone, too.

 Camilion's departure, on the other hand, had been on the cards for many 
months. But Menem insisted he would not sack him unless he was charged with 
wrongdoing in connection with the illegal sale of arms to Ecuador during 
last year's border conflict with Peru.

 That moment came when judge Jorge Urso decided there was enough evidence of 
a cover-up by Camilion to justify requesting the lifting of his ministerial 
immunity.

 The air force commander, Brigadier Juan Paulik, said he warned the defence 
ministry that arms apparently bound for Venezuela were probably being

 off-loaded in Guayaquil en route, but the ministry did nothing. And one of 
the suspects in the case, retired army officer Diego Pallares, has,  
according to Clarin, told judge Urso that he bribed people with political 
connections 'at the highest level' to secure permission for the arms to be 
shipped to Ecuador.

 REGION: POSTSCRIPT

 ARGENTINA/ Bombing probe. Judge Juan Jose Galeano, investigating the 1994 
bombing of the Amia Jewish community centre, in which 86 people were killed, 
has ordered the arrest of four former policemen suspected of providing the 
explosive device used in the attack. He has also hinted at the existence of 
a cover-up involving the Buenos Aires police force and Carlos Telleldin, the 
only person so far to have been indicted. Judge Galeano, who says he has 
received death threats, claims to have solved 70% of the case.

 Falklands' oil rush. Six international consortia have bid for oil 
exploration licences in waters off the Malvinas/Falkland Islands. The 
bidders include a Lasmo-led consortium; a joint venture between British Gas 
and Argentina's YPF, and a partnership between Dutch Shell Exploration BV 
and Italy's Agip. Bids have been made for 10 of the 19 tranches representing 
an area of 44,000 sq km surrounding the islands. But industry observers have 
pointed out that the bids have been made on the assumption that Argentina 
and the UK will reach a cooperation agreement over the disputed waters.

 Best quality of life. The level of human development in Argentina remains 
the highest in Latin America, according to the latest UN development 
programme report. It ranks the country 30th in the world, closely followed 
by Costa Rica (31st), Uruguay (32nd) and Chile (33rd). The index takes into 
account education, life expectancy, health and other factors considered 
important for 'quality of life'.  

 Flood alert. Environmental protest groups have criticised the plans to 
build the Parana Medio hydroelectric dam, which they say will cause 
flooding, alter the local climate and provide a breeding ground for new 
diseases. The authorities argue that the project will lead to cheaper 
electricity, create 10,000 jobs and improve communications between Santa Fe 
and Parana, as a result of the construction of a new bridge. The plans for 
the dam have been drawn up by Energy Developers International of the US.

 Patents row. Deputies from across the political divide have rejected 
comments made by US ambassador James Cheek roundly condemning the country's 
record on the protection of intellectual property rights. The government 
insists that the new patents law, which was approved four months ago, is in 
line with GATT rerquirements. 

 UK trade up. Exports to the UK reached US Dollars 155.8m between January 
and May, a year-on-year increase of 29%. During the same period imports from 
the UK increased by 13%, to US Dollars 176.1m.

 CHILE/ Coal strike drags on. The 1,800 striking miners at the Lota coal 
mine have for the fourth time rejected the agreement reached between union 
leaders and the government. The miners, who have been out since 17 May, are 
demanding improved compensation for the 450 workers who would be laid off 
under the government's rationalisation plan. 

 Pension funds. The Magister pension administrator is to invest US Dollars 
12m in a similar fund in Mexico, in alliance with Banco Alianza. The move 
anticipates the creation of a private pension system in Mexico on 1 January 
1997. Magister executives say they are attracted by the potential of the 
Mexican system, given the country's workforce of 22m. The company currently 
controls US Dollars 400m, 1.6% of the total held in AFPs.

 Top wines. The country has become the region's biggest wine producer, 
according to experts from the agronomy faculty of the Universidad Catolica, 
participating at the International Wine Fair of the southern hemisphere, 
recently held in Santiago. In 1995 wine exports totalled US Dollars 181.7m 
compared with US Dollars 12.6m in 1986, and the industry is aiming for US 
Dollars 500m by 2000. The main importers of Chilean wine are the US, Canada, 
the UK, and in Latin America, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and Paraguay.

 PARAGUAY/ Rebel without a clause. The legal defence team for former general 
Lino Cesar Oviedo, who is in prison on charges of rebellion, has renewed its 
efforts to secure the release of its client, despite the decision of Judge 
Jorge Borgaran to turn down an earlier appeal. Oviedo's lawyers argue that 
the charge of rebellion can not apply to only one person. 

 Population growth. The fertility rate stands at 4.5 per woman, the highest 
in Latin America, which has an average of 3.2, according to the Centro 
Paraguayo de Estudios de Poblacion. The survey was carried out among 6,472 
women aged 15-49, between October 1995 and February this year. 

 Welfare weaknesses. Access to social security benefits is denied to 81% of 
the 4.1m population, and the proportion of those excluded is rising, 
according to a study by the planning ministry. Around 70% of the system's 
beneficiaries live in or near to Asuncion.

 URUGUAY/ Binational pipeline. Work will begin in November on the gas 
pipeline from the Argentine province of Entre Rios, according to Eduardo 
Ache, president of the state oil company, Ancap. The gas will be piped to 
the coastal cities of Salto, Paysandu, Fray Bentos and Mercedes.

 Overvalued land. Land in the municipality of Colonia is overvalued by as 
much as US Dollars 3bn as a result of the plans to build the bridge over the 
River Plate, according to the transport and public works ministry. The land 
is at present in private hands, and so will have to be bought by the 
government at a high price. Work on the bridge, which will link the city of 
Colonia with Punta Lara in Argentina, is due to begin towards the end of 
next year.

Privatisation can't cure sickness

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. Disputes relating to availability of land for the
State's industrial growth should be solved amicably, the Chief
Minister, Mr Jyoti Basu said here today.

Some agricultural land must be acquired and this would not hurt the
State's agriculture. The State Government had recently set up a
high-power Cabinet committee to expedite decisions on all matters
relating to industrial promotion, he added.

Speaking at the 109th annual general meeting of the Bengal National
Chamber of Commerce, he said privatization was no panacea for sickness
in industries.

"How is it that as many as 450,000 private companies are sick?" Mr
Basu queried in justification of his contention.

He said that West Bengal would soon become the nation's top industrial
State with 10 per cent industrial growth.

Stating that his State now ranked third in the country, after Delhi
and Maharashtra, in terms of attracting foreign investments, the Chief
Minister said since the economic liberalization began in 1991, a total
of 1,239 proposals with an investment of Rs 27.741 crore came to West
Bengal.

Of this, 188 proposals were from the NRIs envisaging a total
investment of Rs 10,712 crore, he said.

He added that his Government was committed to provide time-bound
escort service through the promotional agencies for the speedy
implementation of the industrial and infrastructural projects.

The Chief Minister said that the State Government had recently formed
a committee of the State Cabinet on industry to provide expeditious
decisions on all matters relating to industrial promotion and
development.

The committee, in the past two meetings had reviewed a number of
on-going projects and taken steps to remove bottlenecks in their
execution, he added.

A high-power committee of Secretaries had also been formed in order to
facilitate and monitor industrial as well as infrastructural projects,
the Chief Minister said.

Calling for better research and development he pointed out that the
Centre had allowed about Rs 30 crore for this purpose. Industry houses
need to improve constantly their productivity and quality for survival,
he added.

Pointing out that West Bengal had achieved higher progress in terms of
the State Domestic Product than the national average in recent years,
Mr Basu said such growth in the past three years was the highest for
any comparable period in the past three decades.

Of the proposals received so far, there were 188 NRI/FDI projects with
an investment of Rs 10,712 crore. In the calendar year 1995, 387
approvals were received for a total investment of Rs 10,261 crore which
was 469 per cent more than the corresponding figure for 1994, Mr Basu
said.

The Chief Minister also said that between 1991-95, 214 industrial
units in the State had begun commercial production involving an
investment of Rs 6,728.34 crore.

At present there are 80 industrial projects under construction having
a total investment of Rs 2,240 crore, he added.

Mr Asim Dasgupta, Minister for Finance, West Bengal, said that the
State was aware of the requirement for infrastructure development.
Regarding the tardy progress of the mega-city project, he said the
State was not to blame.

He pointed out that State had contributed more than Rs 104 crore for
two years where it was supposed to give Rs 100 crore. On the other hand
the Centre had given only Rs 34 crore.

The State Government had allocated Rs 1,500 crore for power and road
development in the recent State Budget.

Reacting to the BNCCI's proposal on SSI units, Mr Dasgupta called for
a more "cost-efficient industrialization and employment generation".

He referred to the proposals in the State Budget by which 30,000 small
units would be set up all over the State.

Editorial comment: TRIUMPH OF PUERILITY

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

AS a duck, Bob Dole is looking more lame by the hour; if things
continue in this fashion, he will be a dead one in November. His
campaign is coming apart at the seams. The latest election ploy his
advisers have thought up in their desperation is to ask for the
President's medical records so that the American public is sure they
are not going to vote an HIV positive or a drug addict into the White
House. Have they collectively taken leave of their senses or are they
rehearsing kindergarten games? The idea seems to be to take some of the
attention away from Dole's advancing years and beat Clinton at the
fitness game: Dole is old but healthy, Clinton is young and degenerate.
Questioned about the 21-point lead his rival has established over him,
Dole takes out a letter written to him by his father after he was
wounded in action in the last World War as proof of his tenacity and
ability to survive. That was 50 years ago; today wars are nowhere as
bad for health as presidential campaigns. If this is the quality of the
advice Dole is getting from his campaign managers, he should sack the
lot. All the big ideas have faded into the background, all the small
ones, commensurate with the candidate's historical size, are appearing
from the closet. His campaign is beginning to smell of frustration,
meanness and mediocrity in other words, of failure.

On the other hand, nothing seems to do any lasting damage to Clinton.
The resignation of Morris and the revelations of the whore in question
did not create even a slight dip in his lead, he remains as strong as
ever. The latest survey shows that the incumbent's position is
unassailable: he leads in 33 States in double figures in about 25 of
them with 408 electoral college votes. That would amount to a
landslide. Clinton is surging ahead even in traditional Republican
pockets in the Mid-West, as well as in California and Florida. As a
bonus, Saddam Hussein became a media opportunity at the right time.
Nobody, of course, is talking about platforms, they hardly seem to
matter. It is a war of images, one ghoulish projection pitted against
the other. What is interesting about the campaign is what it portends
for the future. Under Clinton, the commercialization of politics has
made gigantic strides and very soon American Presidents will be
designed, packaged, advertised and sold like toothpaste. Dole, for all
his old-fashioned conservatism, is a willing partner in the game, for,
being the underdog by a long shot, he is even more dependent on
advisers than his rival. Let Americans sort them out as best as they
can. The world knows or perhaps, does not that the era of traditional
partisan politics is drawing to a close. New political realities will
emerge from the global underground whose advance guard is represented
by the likes of Ted Kaczynski,the suspected Unabomber, Iron Mike Tyson,
Shoko Asahara, fundamentalists, cultists and thugs of all descriptions,
Greens, Vegans and the whole jing-bang lot of loonies crawling just
beneath the surface, to bring down the techno-corporate elite.

Voluntary retirement scheme funds for Jute Corp. of India diverted to pay
salaries, wages

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. The funds earmarked for running the voluntary
retirement scheme in the Jute Corporation of India has been diverted to
meet the normal establishment expenditure like salaries and wages of
JCI employees.

The diversion of VRS funds has also held up the Government's plan to
trim the workforce of JCI by 25 per cent through the VRS route.

Documents show that during the last three years JCI received a total
amount of Rs 2.70 crore from the Government towards VRS operation of
which Rs 1.80 crore have already been utilized by JCI for the purpose.

However, due to non-receipt of funds from the Government for providing
the salaries and wages of its employees, JCI resorted to diversion of
VRS funds to the tune of about Rs 1 crore to meet the expenses towards
payment of wages and salaries to its employees for August 1996.

The documents state that JCI had to take this step in order to check
any deterioration of the law and order situation arising out of
non-payment of wages and salaries to its employees.

Of the Rs 1 crore spent from the VRS fund, only Rs 10 lakhs have been
recovered. The Union Finance Ministry has also inquired with the Union
Textile Ministry on how much of VRS funds have been diverted by JCI to
meet its establishment expenditure.

In another extremely significant development, a part of an amount of
Rs 5 crore paid by National Jute Manufacturers Corporation to JCI
towards part settlement of its outstanding dues to the latter, Rs 1.15
crore has been utilized towards giving the salaries and wages of JCI
employees for August 1996.

This shows that the Government has not disbursed any sum to JCI for
payment of wages and salary of its employees.

Moreover, the Union Textile Ministry has directed the JCI management
to utilize the balance amount of Rs 5 crore towards carrying out the
minimum support price operation in case the price of raw jute falls
below the support price level.

The Ministry also made it clear to JCI that the balance amount (Rs
3.35 crore) should not be spent on clearing old arrears. It may be
pointed out that the Reserve Bank of India provides funds to JCI for
carrying out MSP operation.

Thus it is evident that JCI will not receive any fund from RBI for its
MSP operation and will be derived of its legitimate claim. It may be
pointed out that JCI could not undertake MSP operation for the last
three years due to shortage of funds.

NJMC has a total outstanding of Rs 69 crore to JCI of which it has
repaid only Rs 5 crore after much persuasion by the JCI management and
its employees' association. Moreover, the process of repayment has
started after five years.

The documents also show that between 1980-81 and 1994-95 JCI claimed
Rs 277.36 crore from the Government towards subsidy of which it has
received Rs 216.40 crore so far leaving a balance amount of Rs 60.95
crore.

However, the Government is yet to pay the amount to JCI. The
Government till date has also not agreed to provide guarantee to JCI
for obtaining bank loan to procure jute.

Secretary for Textiles holds talks on jute

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. The Union Textiles Secretary, Mr Prabhat Kumar,
today met a delegation of the employees' association of the National
Textile Corporation, Jute Corporation of India and the Jute
Manufactures Development Council, in the city to discuss various issues
relating to these organizations.

The delegation was led by Mr Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, MLA.

The other members of the delegation included Mr D. K. Guha of JCI, Mr
Santosh Mazumdar of NTC and Mr S. K. Basu of the JMDC.

At the meeting Mr Guha urged the Textiles Secretary to provide a
Government guarantee for credit facilities for raw jute buying and
release of Government dues worth Rs 130 crores.

While the NTC representative, Mr Mazumdar asked Mr Kumar to waive
NTC's loan amounting to Rs 550 crores by the Government as has been
proposed by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, Mr
Basu of JMDC observed that the chairman of development and coordination
committee of JMDC be nominated from Calcutta for smooth functioning of
the organization.

Mr Kumar assured them that their respective problems will be looked
into.

Editorial comment: MON DIEU!

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

SUSSEX stealing a march over Champagne? "Unthinkable"impossible" cry
French connoisseurs in sheer agony. And yet a British "champagne" to
rival the classic grandes marques de France has been "created" in a
Sussex village using traditional French methods, says a report in the
Sunday Times of London. How did this sacrilege come about! Well, says
the report, a British couple spent a whole decade trying to perfect the
champagne process and propose to unveil their first bottle of bubbly,
Chardonnay Blanc de Blancs 1992 (how French can you get!), come next
month.

The French will have none of this effervescent nonsense. A British
vineyard emulating a real champagne? impossible, pronounced the French
way, or better still, "faut pas rigoler" (you must be joking!). But the
French are up against a scientific alibi. According to experts,
Europe's climate is shifting, bringing to the south of England the same
climatic conditions that Champagne enjoyed 50 years ago. So much so
that a wine expert who tasted the British brew described it as a tour
de force with a "steely elegance of the real thing". And to think that
the climate does it! So far the more effervescent variety the weather
has been complained of only by the English.

Tea Board eyeing U.S. market

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

By Bala Murali Krishna

NEW YORK, Sept. 16. The Tea Board of India, which has been eyeing the
rapidly growing demand for iced tea in the USA, is chalking out
strategies to enter the market in a big way.

The Tea Board chairman, Mr S.S. Ahuja, who recently completed a
promotional tour of the USA and Canada, said: "We are currently working
on a strategy to enter the sizable iced tea market in the U.S." The Tea
Board's director in New York, Mr S.K. Sinha, said the U.S. market was
growing rapidly and was maintaining a steady growth rate of more than
20 per cent.

Mr Ahuja said that the Board will be collaborating more closely with
the Tea Council of the USA, which it has rejoined as an observer
member. "We have realized the fruitfulness of the association with the
Tea Council," he said. Mr Ahuja said that the U.S. market had undergone
vast changes in the last decade, but India had positioned i brewing of
iced tea.

"Previously India lacked varieties of tea that were fast in colour, so
they were thought unsuitable for iced tea," he said. "But now we have
developed newer varieties of tea (Nilgiri) which are also suitably
priced." Mr Ahuja said the Tea Board was also considering re-joining
the Tea Council of the USA as a full-fledged member. "In the year since
we have been an observer member, we are extremely satisfied with the
efforts made by the Tea Council," he said.

"So we are definitely thinking of a comeback." The Tea Board
relinquished its membership of the Tea Council in 1991, and then
returned as an observer member last year. India is also working closely
with the Council's Specialty Tea Register (STAR), Mr Ahuja said.

"It is our primary market, and it has been our endeavour to satisfy
this market," he added.

He said the STAR was doing appreciable work in promoting specialty
teas, whose demand "is surging, especially in California where
specialty tea bars (like coffee houses) are gaining popularity."
During his visit, Mr Ahuja met Mr Joseph P. Simrany, president of the
Tea Council, and important buyers like Mr John D. Harney of Harney &
Sons.

He is also scheduled to visit Toronto, Hamburg in Germany and London.

Editorial comment: MORE COMPROMISES

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

WHY did Mr Jyoti Basu leave it to his Home (Police) Minister to
complain that the Gorkhaland issue had been unnecessarily revived by
the Prime Minister's announcement on Uttarakhand? After the virtual
revolt by the CPI(M)'s district committee in Darjeeling, the Chief
Minister is uncertain how to deal with Mr Subash Ghisingh. The hill
leader cannot be taken for granted at any time but the resolution
passed by 25 of the 29 CPI(M) district committees supporting the
Uttarakhand idea and, in effect, endorsing the old demand for
Gorkhaland poses a serious challenge. Mr Basu can hardly wish it away
as an "individual opinion" and proceed to impose Alimuddin Street's
will on the Darjeeling committee. Dissidence is a virtue CPI(M) units
have acquired from new-found allies. The crucial question is whether in
the new climate of revived hopes inspired by Mr Deve Gowda, and
endorsed by Mr V. P. Singh, the CPI(M)'s hill committee can remain
outside the mainstream of popular resurgence. Clearly, it cannot if it
has to protect its rapidly eroding base. Whatever little is left of
Marxist discipline or "democratic centralism" is in head-on collision
with the instinct for survival.

The policy of appeasement was meant not only to check separatist
ambitions but also to restore peace to the hills. The Darjeeling Gorkha
Hill Council looked capable of blending the concept of autonomy with
the fulfilment of local aspirations till extraneous ambitions came in
the way and development went by default. Even now it seems possible to
retrieve lost ground if the Central and State Governments can provide
the funds and the GNLF leader is persuaded to fix his priorities. The
Chief Minister makes every sense when he questions whether Nepalese in
the hills have any reason to look for "heavenly" gifts flowing from
Statehood compared to their compatriots in the plains. He might have
added that they have no reason either to continue to repose faith in
leaders who have used the ethnic platform for personal advantage. Now,
with the Prime Minister's announcement giving a fresh lease to
political tensions that had subsided in the last two years, Darjeeling
looks destined to have more splinter groups aspiring to power, more
leaders, more private battles, more militancy, all of which can do the
people no good. It is a pity that Mr Basu now finds his pragmatism
overshadowed by the need to win votes in Uttar Pradesh. He may be
banking on the somewhat nebulous future of the Uttarakhand proposal
itself. But, in the meantime, he will be obliged to deal with
adventurers and opportunists with the added prospect of fresh violence.
He can simply ask the Prime Minister, did he know what he was doing?

Sukh Ram held on arrival in Delhi

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

NEW DELHI, Sept. 16. The former Communication Minister, Mr Sukh Ram,
was arrested here tonight soon after he arrived from London at 11.40
p.m.

He was immediately taken into custody by the CBI, armed with
non-bailable arrest warrants issued by a Special CBI Court earlier in
the day.

The former Minister was taken to the All-India Institute of Medical
Sciences shortly after midnight after necessary formalities were
completed at the airport. He left in a white ambulance under heavy
escort through the gate next to the Air-India office and not by the
usual route. Mr Sukh Ram was accompanied by his wife, Mrs Rama Devi.

He was intercepted near the immigration counter and his passport
seized. His son, Mr Anil Sharma, a former Minister in the Himachal
Pradesh Government, was also present at the airport.

Scores of reporters and a battery of lensmen joined CBI officers and
the former Minister's family in their anxious wait for flight A.-I.
112, which landed shortly before midnight. The CBI team was accompanied
by doctors from the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and the AIIMS.

Earlier, the Special CBI judge, Mr Ajit Bharihoke, while issuing the
arrest warrants, said, there was "prima facie evidence of Mr Sukh Ram's
involvement in the case and his presence was necessary." The warrants
are returnable on October 1.

The CBI S.P., Mr H.S. Sandhu, in his application said that the former
Union Minister "appears to be deliberately evading the process of law
and was avoiding his arrest by remaining abroad." The agency said fax
messages had been sent to Mr Sukh Ram through the Indian High
Commission in London seeking his presence for the investigation.

The CBI said the accused camping in the residence of his son-in-law,
Dr S.L. Vasisht, in London, appears to be deliberately evading arrest
by remaining abroad.

The agency said Mr Sukh Ram as a public servant in conspiracy with the
Deputy Director (Finance) in the Department of Telecommunications, Ms
Runu Ghosh, misused his official position and caused pecuniary
advantage to Advance Radio Masts Ltd and a loss of about Rs 1.68 crore
to the Government.

The former Minister remained elusive for about a month since the CBI
recovered about Rs 4 crore and other valuables from his residences in
New Delhi and Mandi (Himachal Pradesh).

(Money meant for Cong: Earlier, the former Minister said at Heathrow
Airport before departure that the money seized from his houses belonged
to the Congress and was meant for electioneering in Uttar Pradesh.

"The money was given to me by an important party functionary," he
said, adds PTI.) Meanwhile, Delhi High Court today adjourned a petition
filed by Mr Sukh Ram challenging the jurisdiction of the Special CBI
judge to hear the anticipatory bail application.

The Special CBI judge had earlier dismissed a similar petition and had
posted the anticipatory bail application to September 19.

Pattalu Rao surrenders: Mr Pattalu Rama Rao, who heads ARM Ltd, today
surrendered before the Special CBI judge after the tenure of his
interim bail ended. Delhi High Court earlier this month had granted
interim bail to him for his daughter's marriage.

Maqbool Dar "obeys" Election Commission, returns to Delhi

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

NEW DELHI, Sept. 16. The Union Minister of State for Home, Mr Maqbool
Dar, today "complied" with the Election Commission's directive to
return to Delhi. He also promised not to return to Kashmir during the
counting of votes. The Commission had issued the directive on Saturday.

Mr Dar today called on the two Election Commissioners Mr M.S. Gill and
Mr G.V.G. Krishnamurthy.

Accompanied by a party General Secretary Mr Prabhat Samantray, Mr Dal
told the Election Commissioners that he had not misused official
machinery and security men for enhancing the prospects of his sons or
other party candidates.

No directive issued by E.C.: The Janata Dal claimed that no directive
had been issued by the Election Commission restricting Mr Dar from
campaigning in the next two phases of polls. It also said Mr Dar will
be leaving for a five-day campaign tour of the State tomorrow.

The party general secretary in a letter to the Commission, pointed out
that Mr Dar has been deputed by the party's central leadership to
supervise the poll campaign in the State. He also said during his tour
of the State, Mr Dar had "abstained from using Government machinery."
The Election Commissioners later said the poll panel was happy with the
Minister's "prompt response". "I am sure others in the Government will
not misuse authority during elections," Mr Krishnamurthy said. "We are
pleased to see that Mr Dar appreciated the stand taken by the
Commission," he added.

Mr Krishnamurthy said the poll panel was not only responsible for
ensuring free and fair elections but also to dispel any misgivings in
the mind of the people.

The Commission had reacted to the Kashmir Government's confirmation
that the Minister was in the State for the last ten days and his party
leaders had been canvassing in his official vehicle.

Following this, a communication was sent to the Home Secretary that
the Minister may be "well advised to come back to Delhi and not be
present during the day of polling and counting," Mr Krishnamurthy said.

During Mr Gill's recent visit to the Valley, political parties,
including the National Conference, had complained about the Mr Dar's
presence in his son's constituencies and the alleged misuse of official
machinery.

Cong denies allegation

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

NEW DELHI, Sept. 16. The Congress today claimed that it had never asked
Mr Sukh Ram to collect money on behalf of the party.

It denied that the money recovered from Mr Sukh Ram's residence during
a CBI raid belonged to the party.

The Congress spokesman, Mr V.N. Gadgil, said: "We have never
authorized any Minister to collect money for the party." He said the
AICC treasurer, Mr Sitaram Kesri, had already stated that the money
recovered by the CBI during raids did not belong to the Congress.

Asked to comment on the non-bailable warrant issued against the former
Communications Minister, Mr Gadgil said: "It is not a matter which
requires any comment from us. We have always said let the law take its
own course. And we will cooperate with investigating agencies." On Mr
Sukh Ram's statement that the CBI raids were part of a plot against the
party president, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, the spokesman said, "Only Mr
Sukh Ram can explain what he meant."

BANKS SEEK TO USE FLORIDA AS SHIELD

Draft legislation spurred by the principle of consolidated,
comprehensive supervision has raised a protest from Florida's foreign
bankers, who want the state to protect them from unscrupulous home-country
examiners.
        At issue is a provision being drafted by the Florida Department of
Banking and Finance that would give foreign bank regulators access to the
books and records of foreign bank agencies and representative offices in
the state. The department had hoped to have the measure introduced when the
state legislature convenes in March.
        The language frightened foreign banks, who fear the changes will
enable regulators from abroad to enter a foreign bank in Miami and demand
to see records of individual customers. Attorneys and bankers are writing
alternative language that in effect would require the foreign regulators to
rely on the reports and records collected by state examiners.
        "The question is whether the foreign bank regulator could come in
on a fishing expedition and look at each individual account," said Burton
Landy, general counsel of the Florida International Bankers Association and
an attorney at the Miami law firm of Steel Hector & Davis. "That (practice)
could be subject to abuse."
        Fernando Capablanca, FIBA's president and head of the Extebandes
agency in Miami, said foreign bankers don't dispute the principle that
supervisors and regulators should be able to supervise the activities
worldwide of banks from their country. However, "we don't need to give the
home country regulators any more information than what you give a domestic
regulator."
        Capablanca said one attorney pointed out the problems that could
arise if regulators from a corrupt regime combed the records of a bank in
Miami to see which nationals were rich enough to be shaken down for bribes.
An attorney familiar with the complaints said others pointed out that the
records could be used to find candidates for kidnappings. Other, more
mundane observers noted the records could be used to spot tax evaders.
        Under the language being written by FIBA, home country supervisors
would draw information about foreign banks only by getting reports of
examinations conducted by the state banking department.."It's not an
attempt to limit the supervision or inquiry into the general financial
condition of the bank," Landy said "It's a question of extending it beyond
that point and being able to look at each individual account."
        "We're looking forward to seeing what the industry comes up with,"
said William Douglas Johnson, assistant director of the state banking
department. Florida oversees agencies of 45 banks and rep offices of 21
others, plus a commercial bank owned by a foreign institution. Another 10
foreign bank holdings in the state are federally chartered--one agency, two
commercial banks and seven Edge Act institutions.

SEGMENT ACCOUNTING RULES NEAR RELEASE

Accounting standards-setters in the United States and Canada plan
to follow their global counterpart this week by issuing draft rules
governing when businesses must disclose financial information about their
regional operations and product lines.
        The North Americans' exposure drafts on what are usually referred
to as "segment reporting" or "disaggregated disclosures" are slightly less
onerous than the one released Dec. 20 by the London-based International
Accounting Standards Committee. While the IASC draft could require
disclosures based on certain parameters, the identical drafts to be issued
by America's Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants goes no further than to press for
companies to report segments based on how they break down their operations.
        This difference of opinion has been going for at least a year, and
officials from all three groups are expected to engage in more haggling on
the issue this summer. Comments on all three sets of proposals will be due
June 30.
        Once it becomes a standard, the segment reporting rule promises to
shed more light on how and where banks make their money. And the rule
became even more important last month when Deutsche Bank announced it would
start publishing its group results according to International Accounting
Standards. That will mark the end of the use of so-called hidden reserves
to smooth out balance sheets.
        Under the IASC's exposure draft, companies would provide at least
one breakdown of risks and returns based on business or geographical lines.
In most cases, the actual one used should be whatever way internal
financial reports are sent to the CEO, the IASC said.
        The North American approach also starts with the way a business
views itself, but unlike the IASC it stops there. "IASC ... recognizes the
fact that this information does not always reflect the dominant source and
nature of risks and returns," wrote Paul Pacter, IASC's project manager.
"In certain cases, therefore, information needs to be modified for external
reporting purposes."
        The IASC draft recommends segmented reporting whenever a particular
part of the business accounts for at least 10% of total revenue. The North
American approach doesn't contain a threshold, recommending instead that
segments be reported when they are "material."
        Cally Hunt, assistant direct of accounting standards at the
Canadian Institute, told IBR the IASC's position means in effect that an
outside auditor could claim the right to make a company revise the way it
tells the world about its business.
        "That's a tough argument for auditors to win," she said. o

BRIEFS


Norway's Christiania Bank
Closes Seattle Branch
        Norway's Christiania Bank og Kreditcasse is down to just one
banking outpost in the U.S. following the closure of its ill-starred
Seattle branch. An official at Christiania's New York office said the
Seattle branch was shuttered as of Jan. 1, but the Washington State
Department of Financial Institutions said the branch was shuttered last
Sept. 30.
        There wasn't much left by last fall in any case. As of June 1995,
the Seattle operation reported just $1 million in assets, down from $125
million only six months before. Meanwhile, the New York branch's asset size
jumped to $770 million from $225 million.
        Christiania came to Seattle in large part to lend to the West Coast
fishing industry, mainly fishing trawlers. But by late 1993, roughly 86% of
its $300 million worth of loans to this industry were nonperforming, making
the branch one of Christiania's few foreign outposts that significantly
hurt the bank, according to a December 1994 Salomon Brothers report. o
N.J. Starts Anew
On Banking Bill
        A bill that would have let foreign banks put branches in New Jersey
died with the Jan. 9 adjournment of the state legislature. A newly elected
state Assembly was sworn in the next day for a two-year session, and is
expected to tackle the issue again.
        The foreign bank language was part of legislation designed to help
the Garden State conform with the interstate banking bill passed by
Congress in 1994. The measure failed to pass the last legislature mainly
because of fighting between domestic institutions, but there also were
protests against a provision that would let foreign institutions create de
novo branches, agencies and rep offices.
        New Jersey is the only major industrialized state that restricts
non-U.S. banks from having branch and agency offices. This might seem
strange given the presence of National Westminster Bancorp in the state,
but NatWest has only a commercial bank operation in the state. o
N.Y. Fed's E-Markets Chief: No Crackdown
        The New York Fed's new emerging markets group will be strongly
focused on information gathering and policy recommendation-and wasn't
created to crack down on emerging markets banking and financial practices,
the chief of the effort stresses.
        "I'm not supposed to blow the whistle. I'm not supposed to smack
people in the fingers," says Terrence Checki, who last week was named to
the new post of executive vice president of emerging markets.
        Checki, whose former title was senior vice president in charge of
international banking supervision, has long been the New York Fed's LDC
expert, working closely with both banks and Latin countries during the LDC
debt crisis in the 1980s.
        The way to prevent the a new LDC debt crisis is to secure better
economic information from third world counties, Checki says, echoing the
majority consensus put forth by U.S. policymakers and market players in the
wake of the Mexican peso crisis.
        "I think we need to see that the information is as available as
possible to as many users as we can," he says. While he believes that the
International Monetary Fund "should not be in the business of assembling
information for the private sector," he does think the Fund has an
important role to play in making sure good financial information is
procured from borrowing countries.
--Mary D'Ambrosio
Brazil's Banco Excel
Buys Banco Economico
        The fate of Banco Economico's $36 million New York branch clouded
last week in the wake of the announcement that another Brazilian
institution, Banco Excel, had taken over the failed Economico.
        Excel doesn't have a banking operation in the U.S., and to date the
Fed has yet to determine that Brazil meets its standard for comprehensive
and consolidated supervision of institutions. (Brazil has met the standard
needed to qualify a bank to open a rep office in the U.S.)
        This CCS problem likely means that Excel will have to give up
Economico's New York branch. Indeed, when Excel announced on Jan. 6 that it
would acquire Economico, it promised only to maintain services within
Brazil, particularly in Economico's home base in the northeastern state of
Bahia. No operations outside Brazil were mentioned.
        Economico has been under the Central Bank's control since August.
Details on Excel's acquisition were sketchy last week; one report said
Excel's purchase was fueled in part by support from a Swiss bank and from
some Brazilian pension funds. o
Fuji To Restructure
Asset-Backed CP
        Following a downgrading by Standard & Poor's to A-2 at the end of
December, Fuji Bank is working to restructure all of its asset-backed
commercial paper programs, bank officials have confirmed.
        With around $3 billion in CP outstanding, Fuji Bank is the biggest
sponsor of asset-backed programs among the Japanese banks. It also
participates in a number of CP programs as a liquidity provider, which
means that many other conduit sponsors will have to find a replacement or
"front" bank for Fuji with ratings of A-1 or A-1+.
        The downgrading is also expected to affect the bank's  credit
enhancement  business because some activities will become more expensive.
For example, the rating agencies require that cash collateral loans be kept
on deposit at institutions rated at least A-1/P-1, and a bank with an A-2
rating would have to fund this enhancement in the secondary market at A-2
rates.
        Fuji has not yet decided how it will restructure its five CP
programs, officials said earlier this month. Recently, Sakura Bank, which
was also downgraded to A-2, restructured its CP programs by hiring
Norinchukin Bank to act as the primary enhancement and liquidity bank in
front of Sakura. Fuji is considering such an arrangement among other
options, officials said.
        The bank's fully supported programs, Dynamic Funding Corp. A and B
and Progress Funding Corp. A and B, were already downgraded to A-2 along
with the bank. Its partially supported program, Freedom Asset Funding,
faces downgrading within a month or so if it is not restructured.
--Jeanne Burke
California Awaits Word
On Which Regs To Cut
        California's State Banking Department expects to get word from the
governor's office later this month on which regs it can try to repeal.
        Deputy Superintendent Walt Mix said several regulations affecting
foreign banks are part of package proposed to Gov. Pete Wilson, but Mix
declined to identify them. He said some proposals would require legislative
approval, while other repeals would have to go through under the state's
administrative procedures act. That latter process takes several months,
while legislative action is a much more iffy proposition, given the
turbulence in Sacramento over the past several years. o
N.Y. State Lets Banesto
Sell Extebank Unit
        New York State Banking Superintendent Neil Levin announced Jan. 11
that the state banking board has approved the acquisition of Extebank by
North Fork Bancoporation from Banco Exterior de Espa a.
        Extebank had $959 million in assets as of last June. The
transaction only involves the domestic operations of the Stony Brook, N.Y.,
institution. Its international operations have been transferred to Banco
Exterior's recently opened New York branch. o
IDB Chief To Reveal
Bank's Plans for Miami
        Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank,
will be the guest speaker Jan. 18 at a luncheon sponsored by the Summit of
the Americas Council. He'll talk about Greater Miami's role in the IDB's
future plans. For information, call (305) 539-3079. o
Costello Moves Up,
But Not Out
        Suzanna J. Costello can't say when she's going to leave town.
        Costello was promoted as of Jan. 1 to vice president, international
banking supervision and regulation, at the Atlanta Fed. As such, she's
supposed to move to Atlanta from Miami, where she currently is branch
assistant vice president. But Costello told IBR on Jan. 11 that she hasn't
set a date for moving to Georgia, and in fact hasn't even started looking
for a home.
        "Whether I'm down here or up there, I still have to be in two
places," she said, noting that the majority of the Atlanta Fed region's
foreign banks are in Miami.

OFFSHORE SHELL UNITS GET STUNG AGAIN

Regulators are finding it increasingly easy to justify entertaining
the notion of barring foreign banks' offshore shell branches. The most
recent evidence arrived last week, when the U.S. Customs Service said it
had arrested two vice presidents of Banco Portugues do Atlantico on charges
of using an offshore unit to launder funds from its New York branch.
        An offshore facility also figured in the Daiwa Bank scandal,
prompting the state of New York's chief foreign banking regulator to note
last month that "momentum is building again" among regulators to limit or
eliminate offshore shell branches that are managed or controlled by onshore
offices of foreign banks.
        Assets at those offshore shell branches totaled $317.87 billion as
of Sept. 30, Federal Reserve figures show. While that's down 6.6% from the
$340.38 billion in the branches as of mid-year, it still is roughly equal
to one-third of all the assets at foreign banks' U.S. branches, agencies
and commercial banking subsidiaries. Roughly half that decline during the
third quarter stems from a $12.47 billion slump in claims on U.S.-domiciled
offices of related depository institutions.
        In the Banco Portugues case, revealed Jan. 11, the Customs Service
said that between August 1994 and the present, Antonio Delgado and Fillipo
Valli received in New York more than $1 million from undercover agents that
were handled as deposits in the Cayman Islands. BPA has a branch in the
Caymans.
        "The defendants were told and were aware of the fact that the
various deposits they received from the undercover agents were proceeds of
the illegal importation and sale of counterfeit jeans from the Far East,
and from illegal gambling," the Customs Service said.
        "The undercover 'depositor' was assured that his account would be
maintained offshore in order to protect the client and the nature of his
business, and that no records of the deposits would exist in the United
States. In addition ... the undercover agent was offered investment schemes
to hide assets from the Internal Revenue Service."
        Valli was arraigned Jan. 5, while Delgado will be arraigned this
week. If convicted on all charges, each could be sentenced to 20 years
imprisonment.
        Banco Portugues' New York branch occupies prestigious territory at
the corner of Wall Street and Broadway. It had $447 million in assets as of
last June 30. Banco Portugues also has an $81 million agency in Miami.
        In the Daiwa scandal, offshore branches figured in when it was
learned that the bank's New York trust company lost $97 million in
government bond trading during the mid-1980s--losses concealed by
transferring the bonds to a shell company registered in the Caymans.
        At a Dec. 4 conference in New York on foreign banks, Donald T.
Vangel, senior vice president of the New York Fed, said a committee of bank
policy supervisors is debating what to do about the unusual facilities.
"It's a knotty question," he said. "... If I were king for a day, I'd like
to see them disappear."

FLORIDA NEWS BRIEFS


AFTER BASCOM: Comptroller Robert Milligan could receive by this weekend a
list of five or so names of people nominated to replace Wilbert Bascom as
chief of the state's Office of International Banking. Officials have been
conducting interviews with about 15 people in Chicago, New York, Boston and
Atlanta for the job. Bascom resigned in July to join First Equity
Securities, an investment banking firm owned by Jamaica's Eagle Merchant
Bank.
PANAMA DEAL: The Florida International Bankers Association may decide this
month whether to set up a closer relationship with Panama's bank group.
FIBA President Fernando Capablanca said Panama is interested in more formal
links because many of the events affecting banks in Panama emanate from the
U.S. At the same time, many foreign banks in Florida care about  Panama.
The cooperation agreement would be fairly loose and not involve any
expenditures.
DREAMING IN CUBAN: The Cuban Banking Study Group will culminate three years
of research on Feb. 8 with the presentation of a book called Cuba: Past,
Present and Future of its Banking and Financial System. The book in essence
is a game plan to modernize the nation's financial and banking system
whenever the communist country decides to develop a market-oriented
economy. Among the topics addressed: requirements for a consortium of
private banks during a transition period, the need for a commercial code
and for a Cuban Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and proposed entry
criteria for foreign banks to operate in Cuba. The book costs $15. For
information, call (305) 284-6868.

firm.
        James Capel Inc. became a division of HSBC Securities this month

ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF INVENTIONS

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

The annual exhibition of inventions in Taiwan has always been a
good place to find newly-developed products that haven't yet
appeared in the market-place. This year was no exception.

The 1996 show attracted more than 100,000 people to the exhibition
hall in Taipei's domestic airport from August 22-25. The show moved
to Taichung from August 29-September 1, and closed in Kaohsiung
from September 5-8.

"Many Taiwan inventors are small entrepreneurs that don't know how
to cross the bridge to international markets from the home or
office," said Johnson Huang, an engineer with Gwo Yann Enterprise
Co., and recipient of the China International Invention Award.

"The show tries to match buyers and sellers of products, and
particularly aims to help inventors to get their ideas in to the
market," he said.

The flavor is local as the show guide is in Chinese, and over each
product table is a poster with a photo of the inventor and the
product, a product description, and contact information. The text
is in Chinese, however, and international traders that don't read
or speak Chinese may need a translator.

Many of the products shown have been patented but not yet launched
locally or overseas.

Taichung inventor, Long Yu-chen was showing a model of a
lightweight plastic shaft with a clamp on the bottom that can be
used to pick up shoes.

"It's very useful for pregnant women that find bending over
uncomfortable," she said. It's also suitable for obese individuals
that have trouble bending down, she said.

Mr. Long, who was at the exhibition in search of agents that would
export the product, was taking orders for the product at NT$150
each.

Other inventors present had already launched products in Taiwan and
were looking to expand their overseas channels.

Liou Tian-an, for example, displayed shoes that contain air vents
that allow odors to escape. "I hope to eventually cooperate with
Nike on this," he claimed. Mr. Liou, vice president of Liou Tian An
Trade Co., said that he got the idea from an interest in massage
products, and in search of a way to reduce sweat and odor in his
own shoes.

Machinery products were also displayed. You Lian Machinery Co.
displayed a powered grease applicator. It applies grease quickly
without air compression. It has already been successfully sold in
Taiwan, said W.H. Liu, a sales manager.

Sheng Wu Fu Co. displayed an "autocraft power maximizer," which the
company says boosts mileage by 15 percent in urban driving, by
reducing waste connected to air conditioner use.

Chai Thou Industrial Corp. displayed automatic car cigarette
lighters with music. The product can be plugged into cigarette
lighters in cars. Customers insert the cigarette head and it is lit
automatically.

ISO 14000: CONSIDERABLE BENEFITS, COMPANIES URGED TO JOIN PILOT SCHEME

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

Singapore companies can reap considerable benefits by adopting
environmental controls under the ISO 14000 Environmental Management
System (EMS) standards.

The benefits include:

  Improved operational efficiency;

  Better utilization of materials and resources;

  Reduced costs and wastage;

  Increased access to world markets;

  Improved staff morale and working environment;

  Assurance to customers, stake-holders and regulators;

  Enhanced corporate image.

These benefits would be reflected in companies' "bottom lines,"
said the Minister for Trade and Industry, Yeo Cheow Tong, at the
launch of the Productivity and Standards Board's (PSB) ISO 14000
EMS Certification Scheme.

Mr. Yeo cited as an example an MNC in Singapore, which saved nearly
US$1.5 million a year by recycling its packaging materials.

Urging local companies to join the certification scheme, Mr. Yeo
added: "Apart from material benefits, companies can also gain
goodwill with the community and their customers. Being seen as a
respectable corporate citizen enhances a company's image."

Mr. Yeo announced that the government would provide financial
assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for ISO
14000 consultancy and certification.

Grants to cover 70 percent of consultancy costs (up to a maximum of
US$40,000) and for 50 percent (maximum US$6,000) of certification
costs will be funded through the PSB's Local Enterprise Technical
Assistance Scheme (LETAS).

"Singapore has always been conscious of maintaining a `clean and
green' environment," said Mr. Yeo. "From the early days of
industrialization, the government has been mindful of the need to
protect Singapore's minimal natural resources and ensure that
industry is not developed at the expense of the environment."

He said that with the setup of the Ministry of the Environment in
1972, Singapore became one of the first countries in the world to
create a ministry specifically for environmental protection.

"Our sustained efforts at government, corporate and individual
levels have earned Singapore international recognition as a `clean
and green city' but we cannot be complacent," said Mr. Yeo.

"A growing population and continued economic and industrial
development will impose further demands on our fragile
environment," he said.

Mr. Yeo urged Singapore companies to seriously consider the
adoption of ISO 14000 in view of the many benefits that can be
gained.

Meanwhile, to help Singapore companies to adopt ISO 14000, the PSB
has started a pilot certification program open to all companies
until the end of this year.

So far, seven companies from the manufacturing and service sectors
have joined the pilot program. They will receive feedback on their
EMS implementation, and will undergo trial assessment at no cost
before formal certification by the PSB.

"I would urge more companies to join the pilot program," said Dr.
Steve Lai, PSB general manager for Standards and Technology, when
the PSB ISO 14000 EMS Certification Scheme was launched on May 28.

The objective of the pilot program is to provide a partnership
arrangement between Singapore-based companies and the PSB to ensure
smooth implementation of ISO 14000, he said.

The launch, which was organized jointly by the PSB and the
Singapore Confederation of Industries (SCI), and supported by the
Ministry of the Environment (ENV), was followed by a seminar in
which experts in environmental management and certification from
Japan, the United Kingdom and Singapore shared their experiences
with local industry leaders and executives.

The seminar speakers included Mr. Kimihiro Torisaki, director of
planning and coordination, Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) for
Quality System Registration, Japan; Mr. Clive Mason, deputy
director of the Regional Institute of Environmental Technology
(RIET); and Dr. Glen Sunman, director of Asian business, Aspects
International, U.K.

The local speakers were Mr. One Seng Eng, chief engineer (strategic
planning), Ministry of the Environment; Mr. Wu Tek Ming, director,
Quality Assessment Centre, PSB; and Mr. Jay Rajangam, senior
environmental engineer, Baxter Healthcare Pte Ltd.

Companies can call the PSB's customer service toll free hotline at
1800-7751167 for more information on the pilot program and
certification scheme.

U.S. MACHINE TOOL COMPANIES LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN NEW IDEAS

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY MOIRA NIELD

After realizing that being number one in the machine tool industry
is no longer the easy job it used to be, U.S. manufacturers have
faced up to their competition. Companies like Ingersoll Milling
Machine Co. based in Rockford, IL, were showing off their technical
innovations to the 120,000 visitors of IMTS '96. Its newest
product, the HVM 600, a grinding machine used in the automobile and
aircraft industries, is powered by linear motors. Linear motors are
faster than traditional rotary motors and don't need the bearings,
worm screws and gear boxes that rotary motors require. It is all
magnetic.

U.S. companies are coming up with innovative ideas that are moving
the machine tool industry forward. The average machinist today is a
computer expert and a math wizard. Skilled tool and parts makers
are hard to find in today's job force. Virtually all the machinery
at the IMTS show is computerized and automated. That is the future
of the business.

Most forecasters expected the machine tool market to be off last
year's strong pace, but the Association for Manufacturing
Technology is quite enthusiastic about the first half of 1996.
Orders for U.S. industrial tools rose 18.74 percent in June from
the previous month to reach 2.9 million. Orders dropped slightly in
July down to 2.7 million. The outlook for the rest of the year
continues to show a bright picture, especially for exports.

U.S. machine tool companies realize they have to keep up the good
work and innovative technology to keep up with the competition.

TAIWAN MACHINE TOOL COMPANIES EXCEL AT IMTS '96

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY DAN ANDERSON

Chicago, Illinois  This year's International Machine Tools Show
(IMTS) brought together another diverse and impressive group of
exhibitors from Taiwan. Taiwan companies continue to show why they
are leading players in the machine tools industry with their wide-
range of quality products at competitive prices. The products on
display included: machinery parts and components, ball screws,
grinding machines, milling machines, electric discharge machines
(EDM),  lathes, and machining centers. It is important to note that
almost all of these machines are of the highest CNC control-type.

With these Taiwan manufacturers increasing their penetration into
the European and U.S. markets it is important that they meet the
stringent standards in place, and this is where Taiwan companies
have greatly increased their overall standing. Over 70 percent of
the Taiwan companies exhibiting at this year's show hold ISO 9000
certification or the new European CE standard. These increased
quality standards combined with Taiwan companies' innovation and
entrepreneurial abilities may provide the best answers as to why
Taiwan companies are expected to increase their market share over
the next few years.

Awea Machantronic Co., Ltd. is a perfect example of a Taiwan
company using indigenous Taiwan technology to successfully compete
with the strong competitors from Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and
the United States. Awea has taken technology that was first
developed at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a
Taiwan government sponsored technology institute, and incorporated
this technology into their Double Column Machining Centers. This
product is competitively priced and Awea has already sold over 20
of these machines during the first half of this year. It is also
utilizing a marketing outreach program by advertising in most of
the major machine tool trade publications in order to further
promote the company and its products.

Another strong example comes from Corisma Machine Tool Co., Ltd.
Corisma has only been in business for six years but has already
developed a strong foothold in the machine tools market utilizing
its high technology expertise. The company is a three time winner
of Taiwan's Symbol of Excellence (1993, 1995, 1996) and this year
it was awarded the prize of Outstanding Enterprise in Taiwan.
During this year's IMTS, Corisma is finding positive responses to
its newly developed CNC Wire-Cut EDM. According to a Corisma
representative, it was the first maker in Taiwan of such a product
with almost all of their competitors coming from either Japan or
Switzerland. Though competition is well-based, the company still
expressed optimism that because of its stringent quality standards
(it has CE qualification) and competitive pricing, it will enjoy a
positive penetration into this market segment.

Another area where Taiwan companies are looking to excel is the
development of strategic partnerships. By utilizing Taiwan's
relatively low production costs but still maintaining high-quality
standards, Taiwan companies are increasingly looking to develop
alliances with their Japanese, European and U.S. competitors,
providing both sides with a more competitive product.

For instance, Leadwell CNC Machines Mfg., Corp., a leading Taiwan
machine tools company, has developed, in conjunction with the U.S.
company Wes-tech, Inc., an automatic CNC lathe using robotic gantry
technology. Leadwell is very optimistic about this new product and
has expressed a positive opinion towards its partnership with Wes-
tech. They think it is a good way to utilize each company's
individual strengths to develop a better product. In yet another
example, Yeong Chine Machinery Industrial Company, a maker of
machining centers, CNC lathes, and milling machines, is working
with both Japanese and German companies to sell new machinery to
the global market. By developing alliances they feel confident that
their competitiveness can only get better.

As Taiwan companies continue to achieve better quality and stronger
marketing ties they can expect a better position in the global
machine tools market.

BIG BICYCLE MAKERS SUFFER LOSS IN SALES

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

Several of Taiwan's listed leading bicycle manufacturers suffered
declines in sales in August this year, with some plummeting more
than 20 percent, according to Economic Daily News report.

Giant Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Taiwan's biggest bicycle maker,
netted more than US$15 million in August, a drop of 23.36 percent
compared with the same month of last year. The accumulated revenues
in the Jan.-August period stood at US$118 million, a reduction of
24.68 percent compared with the corresponding period a year
earlier.

The second largest bicycle manufacturer, Merida Industry Co., Ltd.,
suffered a reduction of 22.66 percent in August sales to reach US$9
million. In the first eight months of the year, Merida's sales
decreased 25.39 percent to reach US$59 million.

The two bicycle giants attributed the sales reduction to less
orders this year from the U.S. due to inventory kept from last
year.

KAOHSIUNG LOOKING FOR WAYS TO EXPAND ITS INDUSTRIAL BASE (I)

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

This article is reprinted from the Free China Review. The second
part will be continued in the same column next week.

"You'll find us rough," Pegotty told David Copperfiield, "but
you'll find us ready." Pegotty might have been a Kaohsiung man.
Students of city polarity will recognize the scenario at once.
Paris and Marseilles regularly trade insults. London scoffs at
Liverpool and gets as good as it gives. And New York looks down on
everyone. In the blue corner, a bunch of effete, white-wine-
imbibing nincompoops wearing silly, overpriced clothes who pretend
to run things while messing them up. In the red corner, beer-
swilling urban peasants good only for making steel, or whatever it
is that they make these days in those nasty, smelly factories. On
the one hand, Taipei, Taiwan's center of commerce and culture. On
the other, Kaohsiung, the island's second largest city, an
industrialized behemoth on the southwestern coast that belches
forth smoke, has more container ships than you can shake a stick
at, generates money twenty-four hours a day, and is home to 1.4
million citizens who are not afraid to call a spade a spade.

People who study this power-house for long enough sometimes come to
the conclusion that Kaohsiung may be the island's second city but
it ought to be the first. The industries located within its 153
square kilometers contribute as much to Taiwan's prosperity as
Taipei. It enjoys clear, sunny weather on an average of 270 days a
year, as opposed to about 180 in Taipei. It has mountains, the sea,
great seafood, cheaper rents and real estate, and better traffic
conditions than Taipei. Question: Why, then, do so few people want
to live and work there?

The answers are complex. For all its merits, Kaohsiung still has
serious problems: a lack of cultural facilities, a standard of
living well below Taipei's, and the worst pollution on the island.
"It's not pleasant having your living room invaded by some noxious
chemical stench while you're trying to enjoy a quiet evening at
home," says Chang Tiao, an architect who has lived in Kaohsiung for
eighteen years. Another resident, Wu Chiu-hui, shudders as she
talks about the tap water. "After you boil it you're left with this
white, foamy scum on the inside of the pot," she says. "I don't
know anybody who dares drink the stuff. We all use filters or drink
mineral water." Local burghers hope to make Kaohsiung into an
international city, and with luck and a lot of hard work it might
one day eclipse Taipei as Taiwan's business hub. But, absent some
fairly dramatic changes in living conditions, the odds are that
those who make these dreams come true will want to commute from
afar.

Kaohsiung is one of Taiwan's oldest cities, and its development has
always been inextricably linked to the sea. In the mid-seventeenth
century, fishermen from the mainland recognized the harbor's
potential as a fishing port, offering an ideal shelter from storms,
and began to settle there. During their respective rules over
Taiwan, both the Dutch (1624-1662), and the Japanese (1895-1945),
understood Kaohsiung's potential as a fishing center and fostered
its growth. Today, it is the hub of Taiwan's deep-sea fishing
industry and its fleet brings in more than half the island's annual
catch.

Kaohsiung Harbor is also an ideal deep-water port. Because Taiwan
lacks natural resources, heavy industries that rely on imported raw
materials have tended to establish themselves in Kaohsiung. Chinese
Petroleum set up a refinery there in 1946, and China Steel and
China Shipbuilding both came in the 1970s.

Export processing zones

Export industries also took advantage of the harbor. The Japanese
had developed the city as an export center for Taiwan's sugar
industry, and in the 1960s two export processing zones were set up
to help send goods made in Taiwan to world markets.

This industrial city was not born by chance. It was the policy of
the Japanese colonial government to develop commerce in northern
Taiwan and industry in the south, a policy that was maintained
after Taiwan's return to Chinese control. And it was a policy that
paid off: Kaohsiung's industries fueled Taiwan's transformation
from an island of fishing and farming villages to the world's
third largest container shipping port.

But whether discussing the city with residents or pounding its
wide, relatively uncluttered streets, the visitor always comes back
to pollution. It is a problem that goes well beyond mere
inconvenience. Kaohsiung's pollution positively discourages white-
collar professionals from moving to the city, while driving out
some who are there already. As a result, Kaohsiung has never been
able to develop the kind of service industry base that has helped
Taipei become the island's wealthiest city. Hence Kaohsiung's
reputation as a city populated primarily by blue-collar workers
whose career opportunities are limited to industries such as
shipping, fishing, steel, and petrochemicals.

When Chang Tiao was interviewing architects for a company he used
to work for, he found that very few of them were willing to move to
Kaohsiung. "Young people always opted for Taipei first, then
Taichung or Tainan," he says. "Many Kaohsiung natives wouldn't work
here if they had the choice." The result is a Catch-22: a shortage
of white-collar jobs means a shortage of white-collar
professionals, which discourages service industries from setting up
in Kaohsiung, leading in turn to a shortage of white-collar jobs.
"If we're going to attract the people we need to develop this city,
we have to improve its living environment," Chang Tiao says.
"Cleaning up pollution must be our first priority."

Human nature being what it is, people want to know who to blame for
Kaohsiung's ills. Government is invariably the first to be
fingered. When the R.O.C. took control of Taiwan in 1945. Kaohsiung
was administered from Taipei by the Taiwan High Commissioner's
Office. In 1947, it became a provincial municipality under the
jurisdiction of the provincial government, and in 1979 it was
designated a special municipality, like Taipei. But that didn't do
much for the place. Some people even believe it hindered the city's
development. Architect Chang Tiao explains that, unlike provincial
municipalities whose mayors were popularly elected, mayors for
special municipalities were appointed by the central government, a
practice that ended only in 1994. "The less they did, the less
chance they had of making mistakes, and the brighter their
political future," he says. "So no mayor tried to develop the
city."

But many Kaohsiung residents, including Wu Den-yih, its present,
popularly elected mayor, say it's not fair to put all the blame on
previous city administrations. Central government policies that
focus on the development of northern Taiwan at the expense of the
south are equally guilty. Mayor Wu talks about Taipei as Taiwan's
brain, and Kaohsiung as the island's heart. The brain gives the
orders, but the heart keeps the blood flowing. Since they are of
equal importance, therefore, the central government should treat
them as such. But according to Mayor Wu, while the central
government has taken good care of the brain, it has neglected
Taiwan's heart. He points out that the annual budget allocation
from the central government to Kaohsiung is only a third of
Taipei's.

City officials and residents agree that Kaohsiung has suffered
grievously from this arrangement, particularly in the development
of its infrastructure, service industries, educational system, and
standard of living. "Since there are only two special
municipalities in Taiwan, most people take it for granted that
Taipei is number one and Kaohsiung is number two," Chang Tiao says.
"In terms of population, Kaohsiung is indeed Taiwan's second
largest city, but in terms of family income and standard of public
education, Kaohsiung barely makes the to five."

COMPANY INTRODUCING NEW AUTOPARTS, ACCESSORIES YEARLY

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY SEAN GRIFFIN

When the 30 employee strong Outie Company, Ltd. of Changhua began
as a manufacturer and distributor of auto mirrors in 1993, company
officials had no idea that the company would grow so large, so
fast.

Today, less than three years later, the company is producing more
than 300 types of car parts and accessories, and has earned a
reputation as a company to be reckoned with in this incredibly
competitive business. With plans to introduce nearly a dozen items
yearly, the company's current IDFR brand accessories range from key
chains and car body decorations to mirrors, fog lights, mufflers
and reflectors.

Utilizing PVC, stainless steel, aluminum and woven carbon fiber
combined with chrome, gold, wooden and assorted finishes, Outie
Company is able to produce a host of quality items for its
customers.

The company's latest products include a cigarette lighter adapter
which allows for three sockets to be created from one plug. The
company's walnut-grain veneer manufacturing technology  imported
from Japan  gives this product a unique finish. A newly designed
lightweight car rack has also recently been introduced to the
company's roster of products, as have a variety of finely finished
car interior accessories.

While Taiwan accounts for about 50 percent of the company's current
market, the Middle East and the U.S. are the focus of the company's
export sales and stand at about 30 and 20 percent respectively.

Outie plans to continue introducing new and innovative car
accessories in the future and hopes to expand sales into larger
markets such as Europe and South America. Outie is currently
looking for agents worldwide.

Samples are available from the company upon request. Regular orders
are available within one month and a minimum order of one container
is required.

FANG & FANG INDUSTRY CO., LTD.: FROM GIFTS TO AUTO PARTS, LOCAL FIRM COVERS
IT ALL

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996


BY SEAN GRIFFIN

Starting out specializing in the import and export of hand tools,
the Taichung-based Fang & Fang Industry Company has grown over the
past 25 years to expand operations into six divisions, representing
hundreds of products for a wide range of industries.

Working with nearly 300 Taiwan-based factories, Fang & Fang has
expanded its operations to cover not only hand tools, but also
plumbing supplies, sporting goods, bicycles and bicycle parts,
giftware, and a host of auto parts and accessories.

Among the hand tools available from the firm are socket sets,
wrenches, screwdrivers, and power tools, as well as heavier
equipment such as bench grinders and hydraulic jacks. Giftware
includes ceramic containers, polyresin figurines, ceramic
containers, musical clocks, and music boxes, while plumbing
supplies include faucets, valves, shower heads, and nozzles. And
everything from wiper blades to car mats is available from the
firm's auto accessories division.

Already holding dozens of patents for its finished products, Fang &
Fang is also eager to work in OEM manufacturing.

When asked how the company is able to compete while representing
such a vast array of products, general manager Charles Found
pointed to the extraordinary relationship the company has with its
customers and associates.

"We have been in this business for 25 years, so we know which
factories are producing high quality products and we know we can
depend on them. Because of this special relationship with our
factories, we are able to provide the best products at the best
prices for our customers."

Mr. found added that his company takes pride in building strong,
long-lasting relationships with its customers, and visits all of
its customers twice yearly in order to head off any problems that
may arise.

According to Mr. Found, Fang & Fang grosses US$210 million a year
on average.

With its market covering the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Japan at 50,
20, 20 and 10 percent respectively, Fang & Fang is looking to
expand its sales in Japan, Eastern Europe, and Central America.

ISUZU ENTERS VIETNAM

    Isuzu has received a license to establish an auto assembly plant in 
Ho Chi Minh City. Isuzu of Japan becomes the 11th automaker to enter 
Vietnam; a market with a modest demand for automobiles is already 
crowded with Auto Assembly Joint Ventures. Vietnam bought about 
5,000 cars last year.
    The Joint Venture is a cooperation between two Japanese 
firms -- Itochu Corp. and Isuzu Motors Ltd. -- and two Vietnamese 
firms -- Saigon Motors Company (Samco) and the Import/Export 
Trading Company in Govap district, Ho Chi Minh City.
    The $US 50 million Joint Venture, of which the Japanese side has 
70% interest, Vietnam 30%, will build light trucks and buses from 
imported kits.
    While Japan's automakers are adding more auto Joint Ventures, 
Volkswagen of Germany has recently postponed its decision to establish 
an auto assembly plant in Vietnam. Mercedes-Benz and BMW have 
already formed car Joint Ventures in the country along with other major 
names in auto industry from Japan, South Korea and the U.S.

SANYO PLANS TO PRODUCE WASHERS

    Sanyo of Japan is planing to produce fully automatic washing 
machines for Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) and the Indochina 
market (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia).
    The Joint Venture, Sanyo Home Appliances Vietnam Corp., includes: 
Sanyo holding 70% interest, Sanyo Electric Trading  20%, and 
Sumitomo Corp. 10%.
    Sanyo plans to invest $US 24-30 million to manufacture 200,000 
washers per year by 1997, mostly for consumers in Vietnam.
    The Venture also aims to raise the production level to more than 
500,000 units per year by the year 2000 for Indochina countries and 
Myanmar.
    The washing machines factory will be located in Bien Hoa, some 40 
Km (25 miles) north east of Ho Chi Minh City.
    Brand name Sanyo was well-known in Vietnam for its TVs in the 60's 
and 70's. Sanyo gas cookers have been used by the Vietnamese for the 
past few years.

BANKING UPDATE

    The World Bank has approved a $US 49 million loan for Vietnam to 
upgrade its banking services. The purpose is to help Vietnam reform its 
Inter-banking Payment and Clearance services as well as customer 
services.
    Since October 1993, the World Bank has loaned Vietnam $US 788 
million, including this $US 49 million new loan.
    Beneficiaries from the banking reform project include Vietnam's State 
Bank (VSB), Bank for Foreign Trade (Vietcombank), Bank for 
Commerce and Industry, Bank for Investment and Development, Bank 
for Agriculture, Eximbank and Maritime Bank.
    Before 1988, almost all banking activities in Vietnam were controlled 
by VSB. VSB is now charged with regulating the country's money 
supply and preserving the value of the national currency, and the 
majority of commercial banking transactions are assigned to other 
state-owned banks. 
    By and large, most Vietnamese do not see banking institution as a 
safe place to put their hard-earned savings. Partly due to what happened 
in 1975 when the communist regime has begun to exert control over the 
entire nation. The regime naturalized all private businesses and 
individual bank accounts, including foreign-owned enterprises. These 
assets, with a small number of exceptions, later became government 
assets. 
    Since then the majority of Vietnamese preferred to keep their savings 
to themselves, usually in gold, US dollars or both.
    Many Vietnamese prefer a community loan system called hui, from 
which a member could get a loan without any officially written 
contracts. This type of loan is solely based on trusts among group 
members.
    This system of loan is far from providing any security for its 
members. Although not on a regular basis, defaults have happened but 
hui tradition continues despite loan defaults. 
    Another common way to raise money for investment is to borrow 
from friends and relatives. Both the personal  and hui-type loans usually 
have higher interest than Vietnamese banks could offer.
    Although the interest rates for saving accounts in Vietnam are rather 
high compared to those of western nations, the percentage of personal 
banking deposits as compared with personal assets is remarkably low. To 
date, Vietnam has less than 40,000 personal accounts. The government 
of Vietnam needs to do more than just banking modernization to 
persuade its people putting their savings in banks or similar financial 
institutions.
    In order to spur economic growth, following the recent interest rate 
cut from Vietcombank, Bank for Commerce and Industry and Bank for 
Agriculture have slashed their interest rates .
    For its customers in the service and commercial sectors, Vietcombank 
now offers a new annual rate of 22.8%, a reduction of 2.4%. For the 
Production sector, the annual rate is cut to 19.2% from 21.6%.
    Bank for Commerce and Industry now charges an annual rate of 
19.2% instead of 20.4% for its customers in the production sector.
    Bank for Agriculture in Ho Chi Minh City offers different rates for 
private enterprises and state-owned businesses. For private production 
enterprises, the annual lending rate now is 28.8%. For state-owned 
businesses, the current rate is 20.4%. 
    While lowering the lending rates for businesses, the government is 
planing to raise interest rates to attract more individual depositors.

BASKIN-ROBBINS IN VIETNAM 

    Baskin-Robbins ice cream franchise has been opened for business 
about a year in Ho Chi Minh City. 
    The franchise in Vietnam, owned by an overseas Vietnamese, is so 
successful that the owner is planing to open new stores in Nha Trang, 
Da Nang and Hanoi. The franchise is importing ice cream from 
Baskin-Robbins parent company in the U.S.  
    With Baskin-Robbins in Vietnam, Vietnamese now can have more 
choices of ice cream from France, Italy and the U.S. Price of ice cream 
has come down to about 80 cents (US) per scoop.
    As far north as Hue (central of Vietnam), the climate is tropical 
monsoon. Temperatures in the country are usually in the 90's degree 
Fahrenheit. The weather is humid especially in summer when one could 
definitely enjoy an ice cream.

MEDICAL JOINT VENTURES

    Braun of Germany and Hanoi Pharmaceutical Enterprise has entered 
into a Joint Venture to produce Intravenous (IV) solutions -- drugs or 
nutrient solutions administered into veins -- for local consumption.
    The Joint Venture is valued at $US 1.75 million with the German side 
contributing 70%  and the Vietnamese firm  30%. The Venture is 
expected to produce 3 million plastic bottles of solution per year.
    Vietnam's hospitals are using IV solutions that are locally made and 
often do not meet minimum hygienic guide lines specified by World 
Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations.  
    Recently General Electric (GE) Pacific Ltd., a subsidiary of GE of 
the U.S. has signed a Joint Ventures with state-owned Medical 
Equipment Corp. (Megeco) under Vietnam's Ministry of Public Health.
    This $US 2.1 million GE Vietnam Medical Systems Joint Venture, of 
which GE contributes 70% and Megeco 30%, will assemble X-ray and

companies have won the bids from the Vietnam's Ministry of 
Transportation to overhaul various sections of National Highway 1 -- the

Engineering of China and Kukdong Engineering and Construction of 
South Korea.

Transportation. They are: You One Anam and Construction Corp. No 8, 
Keangnam and Construction Corp. No 4, Singsung and  Construction 
Corp. No 5.
    The contract for the 150 Km Ho Chi Minh City-Can Tho section was

Communications (VNMTC) to supply two high-power dredges worth 
$US 12 million. The dredges will be used by Vinawaco for port 
development. Vinawaco is a division under VNMTC.

Philippines and Thailand in an effort to foster trade between the U.S. 
and Asia/Pacific countries. He is the second U.S. cabinet member to

CANADA GIVES VIETNAM MFN STATUS

    Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet made his first 4-day visit 
to Vietnam in November 1995 and was welcomed by Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
Mr. Ouellet signed an agreement with Vietnamese Trade Minister Le 
Van Triet to grant MFN (Most Favored Nation) status to Vietnam.
    Canada will provide a $US 15 million aid package aiming to improve 
Vietnam's economic reforms and help Vietnam to better manage its 
environment and natural resources. The money will be used in three 
major projects: the Environmental Management, the Financial 
Management and the Language Training projects.
    Canada resumed its Official Development Assistance (ODA) Program 
to Vietnam in 1990, and since then, under ODA program, Canada has 
contributed about $US 40 million.
    Trade between Canada and Vietnam was at a humble figure of around 
$US 42 million in 1994. In term of investment in Vietnam, Canada is 
currently ranked 22nd with $US 52 million, behind China and ahead of 
Germany.
     Canada has recently elevated its trade office in Ho Chi Minh City 
to the level of Consulate General headed by Mr. Ian Burney.
    Although Canada investment in Vietnam is modest, Nortel of Canada, 
a telecommunications company, has made its mark in the Vietnam 
Telecommunications sector. Nortel was selected to install a 3,000 Km 
fiber-optic Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) system that runs 
between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (a distance of 1710 Km). Vietnam 
Post and Telecommunications also contracted Nortel to install a Digital 
Switching System DMS-100 for the port city of Hai Phong. Hai Phong 
is about 103 Km (65 miles) from Hanoi on National Highway 5. 
    Even though the U.S. and Vietnam have normalized diplomatic 
relationships in July 1995, trade normalization has not been fully 
realized until Vietnam receives MFN status from the US. There have 
been talks between the two countries, but no time is set for the U.S. 
to grant Vietnam MFN status.

THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS INSURANCE COMMISSION

    (Industry Review) Insurance is still a fairly new concept to an 
average Vietnamese, even though Vietnamese press has repeatedly attempted 
to promote it. The Vietnamese generally understand that motor vehicle 
insurance is necessary, realizing the danger of being bankrupted or being 
drawn into a court battle when a fatal accident occurs.
    However, regarding Life Insurance, their thinking is different. The 
idea of paying money and expecting family members can collect a large 
sum should one die is still new and skeptically received among the 
Vietnamese. Even though making a final financial arrangement is 
obviously necessary, speaking beforehand of one's death is viewed as 
superstitiously bad luck.
    The Vietnamese would rather buy house, land, jewelry and gold and 
leave these assets to their loved ones. Like in other developed Asian 
nations, this view may be changed once they are getting more familiar 
with insurance concept.
    In an effort to exert control over the Insurance sector, the Ministry 
of Finance issued Circular 76 TC/TCNH dated 25 October 1995 to regulate 
Insurance commission. Only agents who are licensed to work in the 
insurance business are allowed to collect commissions.
    The commission rate for personal property is the lowest (0.3%) and 
the rate for Life or Health Insurance is among the highest (10%). 
Insurance commission is based on the value of the insurance policy.
    Before 1993, the only insurance company operating in Vietnam was 
state-owned Vietnam Insurance Company (Bao Viet). Although this 
sector is no longer one-company industry, the government still wants a 
tight control in this business and is not ready to open up to foreign 
companies.
    Currently, foreign companies are not allowed to have 100% 
ownership of the venture, therefore they must operate through local 
firms acting as their agents.
    Major portion of local insurance firms' revenues is their commissions 
earned from second tier "re-insurance" rather than direct premiums paid 
by customers.
    At present, there are five non-Life insurance companies in Vietnam. 
Three state-owned insurance companies -- Bao Viet, Bao Minh and 
Vinare (National Re-insurance Company) -- are well-known in Vietnam.
    More than 20 foreign insurance companies from countries such as 
France, England, Switzerland, South Korea and Taiwan have opened 
representative offices in Vietnam.
     One of the leading insurance companies in Europe, Zurich Insurance 
Group of Switzerland, has recently opened an office in Ho Chi Minh 
City to promote Life, non-Life, and re-insurance. Also LG Insurance 
Company of South Korea has opened  an office in Hanoi. Both Zurich 
Insurance and LG Insurance will cooperate with Bao Viet and Bao Minh 
insurance firms.
    Vietnam's Ministry of Finance has asked Yasuda Fire and Marine 
Insurance Company of Japan to provide insurance training for 
Vietnamese officials in 1996.
     On one hand, the government knows insurance business is lucrative 
and wants to put state-owned local insurance companies in a controlling 
position. On the other, they realize that the country lacks capital and 
desperately needs foreign investments. 
    The government is facing a dilemma and they have to find ways to 
overcome it if they ever want to efficiently develop this industry.

AIRLINES PASSENGERS INCREASE 30 PERCENT

    By the end of 1995, Vietnam Airlines, a state-owned enterprise, has 
transported more than two million passengers, of which 40% were 
international and 60% were domestic. This is an increase of 30% over 
the 1994 passenger volume. Also about 30,000 tons of cargo were 
transported in 1995. 
    As the demand is expected to grow, Vietnam Air lines forecasts an 
increase to about 5 million passengers and 110,000 tons of cargo by the 
end of this century.
    Vietnam Airlines is making improvement after a major restructuring 
more than two years ago. Recently, Vietnam Airlines has signed an 
agreement to lease two ATR-72 from Aircraft International Rental of 
France; this will bring the total ATR-72 operating in Vietnam to 6 
airplanes. These planes are used for short distance flights between 
Vietnam's cities.
    Besides Soviet made aircraft, Vietnam is also using Airbus and some 
older version of Boeing planes. The government is seeking to eventually 
replace all of its aging fleet of Soviet made aircraft with planes from 
Airbus and Boeing.
    Due to their modest budget, Vietnam needs to have more Vietnamese 
pilots who could fly modern jets. Vietnamese pilots' salary is much 
lower than that of foreign pilots. Vietnam pays foreign pilots on the 
average around $US 10,000 per month while the Vietnamese 
counterparts may earn only about $US 3,000 per month. 
    Aiming to increase the number of Vietnamese pilots by the year 2000, 
Vietnam has sent its bright young men to Australia for a three-year pilot 
training program.
    In a joined-marketing effort to boost sale, Vietnam Airlines and other 
ASEAN's airlines: Brunei Airlines, Garuda Indonesia Airlines, 
Malaysian Airlines, Philippines Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Thai 
Intl. Airways have recently offered their passengers a 15% discount. 
Vietnam has become a member of the ASEAN (Association of South 
East Asian Nations) since July 1995.
    Vietnam's second Airlines, Pacific Airlines, operates mainly in three 
largest cities of Vietnam -- Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang and 
Hanoi -- and between Vietnam and Taiwan as well.
    Pacific Airlines suffered a considerable loss of  as much as $US 
200,000 a month in 1994, prompting the Vietnam Civil Aviation 
Administration (VCAA) to reorganize its management team. The new 
team includes Mr. Duong Cao Thai Nguyen as Managing Director and 
Mr. Luong The Phuc as chairman of the Management Board. Mr. Phuc 
is currently Deputy General Director of Vietnam Air Lines.

GETTING TO KNOW THE VIETNAMESE 

    The Vietnamese are basically a very polite, hospitable and sensitive 
people. With 4000 years of civilization, they are proud people who like 
to recite to a myth that they are descendants of an angel and a dragon.
    Their manner is casual, friendly and they take pride in their 
hospitality. Not only are the Vietnamese deeply attached to their 
families, they also view friendship as a very important aspect in life, so 
important that in Vietnam, there is a saying " far away relatives are not 
as important as nearby neighbors." 
    Personal and business matters could be confined among close friends 
since friendship is not only necessary for their emotional supports but 
also for mutual assistance.
    Their homes are always open to friends.  No appointments are 
necessary for casual visits to their homes and visitors are usually 
received warmly. However, it is best to let them know or phone them in 
advance if it is a business visit. 
    If you happen to be in their homes at meal time, they will probably 
invite you to sit down and share whatever food is available. They may 
not hesitate to offer you the best portions as a sincere gesture of 
hospitality and close friendship. Let them know that you enjoy their food 
is one way in successfully building a better relationship with them. 
    When they invite you to their homes for a meal, celebration, or 
special occasion, some gifts -- usually food, fruits, chocolate or liquors 
(especially American and French liquors are favorite) -- should be 
offered to the host's family. 
    Although the Vietnamese may be happy to accept your offer, he 
usually refuse the first time or even the second time, for fear that he 
might be regarded as greedy if he accepts your offer the first time. He 
may claim that he already has or does not need it. It is recommended 
that you have the patience to repeat the offer once more. 
    Patience is one of the keys in successfully dealing with the 
Vietnamese.
    On the other hand, when they offer you gift, they will usually speak 
lightly about it. Even though it is an expensive gift, they may pretend it 
is of no great monetary value, since boasting is often criticized
    Having a few drinks in a social gathering is widely acceptable. Like 
many other parts of the world, Vietnam does not sanction heavy 
drinking. Alcoholism is often kept hidden since it is viewed as a social 
disgrace to the family. 
    Alcohol drinking is now increasing among men and drunkenness in 
public does occasionally happen.However, the Vietnamese, at present, 
do not view this as a social problem because alcohol consumption level 
per capita in Vietnam is still one of the lowest in the world -- average 
about 5 liters per person.
    The majority of Vietnamese women never drink and it is not unusual 
if they decline when alcoholic beverages are offered to them. Drinking 
problem are rare among women. 
    While smoking is considered the norm among men, even young men; 
very few women smoke. Women's smoking in public is seen as tackiness 
and those smoking women are often regarded as " liberal".

VIETNAM: MID-AUTUMN FESTIVAL

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Thu Hanh

There were few domestic toys for sale for the Mid-Autumn Festival
this year. This is a common comment of shoppers during their buying
sprees for children prior to their festival that fell on the 15th
of August of the lunar calendar (Sept.27,1996).

Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival is a tradition in Vietnam.
Although it is a children's festival, it is a common concern of
society, because on this day children in almost every family must
have a tray full of "banh nuong" (pies) and "banh deo" (sticky rice
cakes), a grapefruit, a bunch of bananas, persimmons, "com"
(steamed young rice dyed green), and toys such as paper lion heads,
small drums, star-shaped lanterns, or turning lanterns with a shade
decorated with paper cut figures.,to celebrate the Mid-Autumn
Festival.

A couple of weeks before the festival, the toys shops along Luong
Van Can, Hang Ma and Cha Ca streets and in front of Lenin, Thu Le
and Bach Thao parks were already stocked different kinds of paper
masks, lanterns, dolls and electronic toys. In general, the toys
were attractive looking and selling at cheaper prices than last
year. For instance, a small lantern made in China cost 9,000-12,000
VND, and a bigger battery-operated musical lantern cost
17,000-30,000 VND. A turning lantern sold for 20,000-30,000 VND.
During the pre-festival days, even the poorest parents tried to buy
some toys they could afford for their children. A mask, a
star-shaped lantern, or a small drum cost only 1,500-5,000 VND.
Well-to-do families preferred modern toys, each of which might cost
from several hundred thousand to even several million VND.

Hanoi's wholesalers sold toys to traders from the outlying
districts of Dong Anh, Soc Son and Thanh Tri, Ha Dong town in Ha
Tay province, and Ha Bac, Hai Hung and Nam Ha provinces. However,
except for paper masks, lanterns and drums, not many toys were made
in Vietnam. Currently, there are only a few toy-making enterprises
in Hanoi such as the Phuc Hung Plastics Company and the Dai Kim
enterprise. But these enterprises only produce toys for the
education programs of kindergartens, and they cannot compete with
Chinese and Thai toy-makers in terms of quality, designs and
prices. Furthermore, these Chinese and Thai products have often
been smuggled without tariffs and, naturally, are sold at cheaper
prices. So far, stuffed animals made by the Hung Sang and Binh Tien
companies have won the trust of customers for their high quality
and diversified designs, but their prices are still high for most
customers. For instance, a little Mickey bear costs 7,000 VND, and
a bigger one costs as much as 250,000 VND.

On the occasion of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the confectioneries,
state-owned or private, produced about 200 tons of pies and sticky
rice cakes with different fillings: green beans, salted eggs,
Chinese sausage, roast chicken and vegetarian. A box of 4 pies or
sticky rice cakes costs between 20,000 and 80,000 VND. The prices
this year were higher than last year because of a 10-20% increase
in prices of ingredients. The Thuy Ta restaurant by the side of
Hoan Kiem Lake and the Bodega Foods and Drinks Company were the
main suppliers of pies and cakes; each produced about 50 tons. In
addition, Xuan Dinh village in Tay Ho district with 60 years of
experience supplied 80 tons of pies and cakes. Among the most well
known non-state confectioneries supplying pies and cakes for the
Mid-Autumn Festival are the Bao Ngoc, Huong Nam and Duy Tan shops.
However, some unlicensed private shops produced poor quality pies
and cakes causing a feeling of uncertainty among customers.

VIETNAM: NGUYEN TU NGHIEM, THE CULMINATION OF AN ARTISTIC CAREER

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Pham Thi Tuyet

Nguyen Tu Nghiem, one of the seven prominent painters in the
generation trained during the war against the French colonialists,
received the Ho Chi Minh Award on his 75th birthday. He is one of
the three living painters in his generation to receive this prize
instituted by the Vietnamese Government in 1985 to  honour the
writers, artists and scientific workers who have best contributed
to national liberation and construction.

The old artist was sitting in his small garden  absorbed in
memories as we arrived in  his small flat at the government-leased
TrungTu apartment building.His young wife was preparing dinner.

"It's a real pity, a real pity, " he repeated as he took us around
the small room hung  with recent paintings which serves as his
exhibition room. He said that almost all his paintings made during
the  anti-French war have been lost. He estimated it was
approximately one hundred paintings.He recalled with a deep sigh of
regret and a lowered head the loss of hundreds of paintings done by
himself and Bui Xuan Phai,  his alter ego and another winner of
this Ho Chi Minh Award. The two were preparing an art exhibit when
French troops parachuted on the resistance base  in the northern
jungle and destroyed or took away all the sketches and canvasses
they had completed during the first years of the war.

One thing that intrigued me right after scanning  the scores of
paintings in his room is the predominance of paintings about
"Kieu",  the main character in a novel the same name. Each painting
was executed differently on a different material. Explained the old
artist:"It is like the haunting of all my life. I made a clay
figurine of Kieu when I was only a six-year-old  kid in my native
village in Nghe An province and started to paint its face as best
as I could imagine from the story related by my father. Although
the story of Kieu originated in China, the Kieu created by Nguyen
Tu Nghiem's brush, is always every inch a Vietnamese girl, a
Vietnamese beauty. Another favourite theme of his is the mythical
Giong, the child hero who defeated the aggressors and saved the
kingdom after being transformed into a giant with a fire breathing
horse from a heavenly messenger. Nguyen Tu Nghiem also has done
painstaking research into the regional folk dances which he
reconstructed so well that some critics called them the most
perfect collection of folk dances of Vietnam. He distinguishes
himself by the original way he executes his lacquer paintings. A
famous case depicts the " Guard of the Temple of Literature" (in
Hanoi). The whole picture is painted in white lacquer but with
varying thicknesses of paint which create different nuances and
shades. The same can be found in his painting titled "The  Gate of
Mong PhuVillage during Harvest Time". This work is so evocative
that one admirer exclaimed:" It makes me feel as if I could hear
the croaking of the frogs in the painting."

Nguyen Tu Nghiem is one of eight painters and sculptors receiving
the Ho Chi Minh award this time. Five received the award
posthumously.

VIETNAM: THE HANOI FINE ARTS SCHOOL, ONE OF THE OLDEST IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Nguyen Luong Tieu Bach
Associate Professor, Director of the Hanoi Fine Arts School

The Hanoi Fine Arts School is rightly described as the"cradle of
Vietnam's modern arts." Founded in 1925 by the French as the "
Ecole des Beaux Arts de l'Indochine," it was the first formal art
school in  Vietnam. Prior to this, Vietnam as well as Laos and
Cambodia had no institutions for formally training painters and
sculptors. There were only small groups of artisans who learnt
their techniques from their parents and grandparents and perfected
them through extensive work in handicraft workshops. In this sense,
the modern arts taught at the Fine Arts School of Indochina were
divorced from the artistic traditions of the nation. Art students
were given classes chiefly in the European, more particularly the
French classic arts. But this deviation was soon discovered by the
first crop of Vietnamese students who, coincidentally, were to
become also the most prominent artists of modern times. Such names
as To Ngoc Van, Nguyen Phan Chanh, Tran Van Can and Nguyen Gia Tri
are icons in the pantheon of Vietnamese modern painting.
Increasingly, this first generation of graduates and their
successors realized the crucial need of using their art in the
service of the people; this tendency was displayed through the
resistance against the French war of reconquest (1946-1954).
Teachers and students, sometimes without even an easel, packed
their minimum indispensable working tools in a rucksack and went to
the front to record scenes of battles or the combatants in the
hours between battles, or the seemingly endless throngs of men and
women transporting supplies to the front. In the twenty-year fight
to liberate South Vietnam, the Hanoi Arts School had more
opportunity to concentrate on large scale training. After the
reunification of the country in 1975, training was no longer
limited to Hanoi. Now there are also art schools in Hue (Central
Vietnam) and Ho Chi Minh City. This has enabled the Hanoi school to
raise its  standard and  concentrate on university-level tranining
and, eventually, post-graduates training in painting and sculpture.

The opening up to the world has also opened broad vistas for the
Hanoi Arts College to increase its exchanges with artists in
countries in the region and across the world. More and more
painting exhibitions have opened in the country and abroad. Higher
sales of paintings are not only bringing higher material benefit to
the artists but also have raised the profile of Vietnamese arts in
the eyes of local and foreign art lovers.

The improved living standards in the country have also expanded the
market for art and motivated artists to make consistent efforts to
improve themselves. Outdated models, styles and genres can no
longer capture the vast horizon of present day life. Artists,
mostly  from the younger generation, venture out  into their
changing environments in search of new modes,  materials, and
styles of expression.

Many graduates of the school have won prizes abroad. For example,
Nguyen Thu now at the exhibition of realist painting in Bulgaria,
and Dinh Trong Khang in the international art expo in the former
Czechoslovakia. 95% of the  awards  at  annual art exhibitions
inside the country are won by artists trained by the Hanoi school.

VIETNAM: MARIJUANA ADDICTION SPREADS TO ALARMING PROPORTIONS AMONG SCHOOL
CHILDREN

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By  Lan Huong

Recently the press has sounded the alarm about the spread of
marijuana addiction among schoolchildren, and educators have raised
their voice about the need to stop this social vice.

In HCMC marijuana has found its way through the school gates in
hand-rolled cigarettes while in Hanoi schoolchildren buy heroin,
burn it on a piece of tin foil, and inhale it as a way of
relaxation. According to a report by the Interior Ministry,
students began to smoke opium in 1993 and the addiction has been
spreading ever since. In Hanoi over the past year, nearly 80 school
children and college students were caught in the act of using
marijuana. This figure, of course, reflects only a small percentage
of the actual users, but it reveals an alarming social phenomenon.
Many schoolchildren lacking the money to buy marijuana have joined
gangs riding high-powered motorbikes to rob people. A report from
the Hoan Kiem police precinct (Hanoi) said police had captured a
gang of 8 young robbers who admitted to having committed 50
robberies in a period of one and a half months.

Who then are the suppliers of marijuana to schoolchildren and
college students? Tracking down marijuana rings has revealed the
availability of these toxic drugs at tea shops located near
university and college campuses. These tea shop owners eager for
profits have sold marijuana to students, even though they are well
aware that selling marijuana may bring them from 5 years to life
imprisonment and even the death penalty. In one case, an entire
family consisting of 11 members from grandparents to grandchildren
was engaged in drug trafficking. Since the Government issued a
decree on strengthening the fight against smuggling and drug
trafficking, smugglers and drug traffickers have adopted more
cunning methods of operation to evade the police.

Speaking of drug addiction among schoolchildren, Ms. Nguyen Thi
Hung Cuong, Vice-Chairwoman of the People's Committee of Quang Ninh
province, said the province has sounded the alarm about drug
addiction among schoolchildren. Quang Ninh province has taken
measures to prevent addiction by making the commitment between the
schools and families to strengthen the management of
schoolchildren, build walls around schools, increase school
patrols, and remove tea shops located near schools.

Mr. Nguyen Minh Chanh, Vice-Director of the HCMC Labour, War
Invalids and Social Affairs Service, said cigarette peddlers have
sold marijuana to schoolchildren and students in hand-rolled
cigarettes. When they get addicted, they have turned to
pickpocketing to get money for drugs.

Mr. Tran Xuan Nhi, Vice-Minister of Education and Training, said
the education service should do all it can to prevent the spread of
drug addiction among schoolchildren and students. The service has
introduced anti-marijuana lessons in the school curriculum at all
levels. It has given special attention to such lessons at the
schools in mountain eous areas to help prevent the cultivation of
the opium poppy there.

The coordination of anti-marijuana efforts among the police and
customs services, the schools, and the families is essential to
help curb the spread of a social vice that is affecting
schoolchildren and students now.

VIETNAM: REFORM OF STATE ENTERPRISES CONTINUES

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Doan Huong Lan

The reform in the organisation and operation of the State economic
enterprises has resulted in a dramatic reduction of State-owned
enterprises from 6,300 entities in 1990 to 516.

Meanwhile, the combined liquidity of the State-run enterprises rose
3.5 times or an annual increase of 30.1% and output value rose
11.3% on a yearly average. Its gross profit almost quadrupled to
7,100 billion VND between 1990 and 1994. Meanwhile losses dropped
from 503 billion VND to 300 billion VND.

State-run enterprises are still predominant in key industries such
as energy generation, chemistry, iron casting and food processing,
which over the past 5 years have recorded an annual growth of 20%,
20,1%, 16.1%, and 13.6% respectively. However, small and
medium-scaled business with old and obsolete equipment still
account for a large proportion in the State economic sector. Thirty
five per cent of all State-owned enterprises are employing less
than 100 workers each and 50% have a legal capital of less than 3
billion VND (270,000 USD).

Shortage of capital remains as acute as ever. Liquidity can meet
only 60% of the demand, which is estimated at 20 billion VND,
excluding the cost of capital construction and upgrading of
equipment.

Only 20% of the value of the industrial products of the State-owned
enterprises have been exported.

VIETNAM: ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN A VICE

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Ha Linh

The more than 100 Vietnamese enterprises in electronics are finding
themselves in a vice: If they want to survive the harsh competition
from such world giants as Sony, Matsushita, Philips, Samsung and
Technics, they have to accept working as subcontractors for them in
joint ventures in which their share is always very far from giving
them a significant say. But if they choose to stay on their own,
chances are high that they will meet their foretold death earlier
than they think.

In both cases, chances for Vietnamese to develop an electronics
industry of their own are very slim, if any at all.

The quick fix backfires

To be fair, it is the foreign electronic companies which have
helped the local electronics industry to get to where it is today.
In the late 70s and early 80s, Vietnamese enterprises were allowed
to import semi-knocked-down parts to assemble TVs and radio
cassettes and many of them indeed made a fortune out of it.

The policy proved to be an important quick fix, for the country was
then faced with a dire shortage of consumer electronics goods.
Consumers had to import TV and radio cassettes on their own,
further straining the country's scarce reserve of hard currencies.

The arrival of foreign electronics manufacturers on the market and
the emergence of joint ventures provided a strong stimulation for
local manufacturers to strive more. But problems soon cropped up,
one after another. The foreign companies which used to sell
components to Vietnamese assemblers no longer do so if the latter
are not their joint-venture partners. But once the Vietnamese are
in the joint ventures just to keep their production alive, they
lose their autonomy in production because they never have the
necessary capital to hold a controlling share in the ventures. And
all this happened on the same market that the Vietnamese used to
have the last say. Moreover, most joint ventures only sell their
products in Vietnam, just as Vietnamese assemblers did in the past.

One of the pioneer assemblers of electronics goods in Vietnam,
Viettronics Tan Binh, is finding itself at a loss in this dilemma.
For years, it had been making a good buck assembling and selling
Sony and JVC TVs. But as soon as Sony officially entered the
Vietnamese market, it had no choice but joining the Sony-controlled
venture if it wants to retain the privilege of assembling Sony
TV's. Tan Binh was harder pressed for there were many other smaller
Vietnamese assemblers were waiting on the sideline for a chance to
take its place. Experts predicted that when JVC comes in, it is
likely that Tan Binh will have to set up a similar joint venture
with it as well.

Problems

It would be no problem if the joint venture brings more benefits to
the local company and promises it a stronger future development. In
reality, benefits from the joint venture have come to only those
sections of the local company which work for the joint venture. The
rest suffer real losses because their market is already taken away
by the joint venture's products. Viettronics Thu Duc, an assembler
of the same calibre as Viettronics Tan Binh, is an example. Its
joint venture with Matsushita to assemble Panasonic TV has
benefited only the sections which work for the venture. The rest of
the enterprises now has enough work for only four days a week.

Economists see more problems than that. They said that in joining
ventures with world electronics giants, Vietnamese manufacturers
are losing at least two opportunities for their own development.

First, they said, as foreign companies come, many Vietnamese
assemblers have already set up modern assembly lines which are not
any inferior to those brought in by the foreigners. Now, that they
are already part of the joint ventures, Vietnamese tend not to make
sizable reinvestments in keeping their technological edge. Further,
the Government's slowness in taking action to protect local
industries has discouraged them from attempting to keep this edge.
The result is a virtual hand-over of the playground to the foreign
companies.

The second lost opportunity is their miss in grabbing the market of
telecommunications products as this industry is fast expanding in
the past couple of years. Experts said that if Vietnamese had been
quick enough, they could have easily taken control of this market
which has now become almost a open ground for foreign suppliers.

The sole solution

Recently, as the Hanoi Electronics Company (Hanel) announced that
next year, it will market the first Hanel TV sets with at least 60%
local content, the news was received with mixed feelings. Many
other Vietnamese electronics companies may have also thought of
producing something of their own, but doubts about the
competitiveness of their products against those made by
foreign-invested joint ventures discouraged them from going any
farther. There are also doubts that any local banks would be
willing to finance such local ventures.

"As for now," commented an industry expert, "the only choice for
Vietnamese electronics manufacturers seems to join a
foreign-invested venture. But this virtually amounts to an
on-the-spot export of labour in which they will sell their skilled
labour for a living and a marginal benefit."

This expert also said that the only solution to the problem rests
with the local manufacturers themselves. "They need to fend for
themselves, and in the process, they need the Government to provide
them with the necessary protection through appropriate policies and
financial support.

VNC: What do you have to say, Minister, about labour and the labour
market in Vietnam?

TDH: Vietnam has a population of 75 million of whom population of
37 million of working age. Each year, 1.15-1.2 million more people
come of working age.

The rural areas make up 76% of the total workforce and the urban
areas, 24%. The urban areas have a 6.1% unemployment while 30%, and
in some places even 40-50%, of the rural workforce is partially
unemployed. The state-owned sector employs about 3 million workers
who account for 8.5% of the total work force.

Since Vietnam began the renewal process, the labour force in the
state-owned sector has been reduced considerably as a result of the
re-organisation of production. Simultaneously the labour force in
the foreign-invested and private sectors has rapidly increased
thanks to the encouragement of foreign investment in the developing
multi-sector economy. The demand for labour has fluctuated greatly
as the supply-demand process, in each sector of the economy affects
the wages offered as well as the number and skills of needed
workers.

VNC: Is there any contradiction between the availability of labour
and the demand for labour as required by the industrialisation and
modernisation processes?

TDH: The most noticeable contradiction can be seen in the supply
and demand of skilled workers. Currently, Vietnam has more than 4
million trained workers, just 10.7% of the total workforce,
distributed primarily in urban centres, in the state-owned sector.
As the cause of industrialisation and modernisation demands a large
contingent of skilled workers, the Party and the State have
encouraged diverse forms of job-training. The 8th National Party
Congress in its Resolution called for increasing the skilled
workforce to 22-25% of the total labour force by the year 2000. It
is also necessary to adjust the current training structure which
has a ratio of 1-1.6-3.6 for university graduates, high school
graduates and skilled workers, respectively. The ratio in developed
countries is 1-4-10 respectively.

As the foreign-invested sector is developing vigorously, the demand
for skilled high-tech workers will also grow rapidly. Therefore,
the system of training centres must  combine formal class room
training with on-the-job training and access to the latest in
high-tech equipment meet this specific demand.

VNC: What is the solution to unemployment and a more efficient use
of intellectual workers?

TDH: With a  market economy, unemployment is common in developed or
developing countries. Since Vietnam began to shift over to the
market mechanism, there have been signs of unemployment. For
instance, a population census conducted in 1989 showed an
unemployment rate of 4%. This rate grew to 9% in the first years of
the 1991-1995 plan. A labour and employment survey in urban areas
in 1994 pointed to an unemployment rate of 6.1% in urban areas and
7% in major towns. Currently, the jobless in Vietnam are estimated
at 2.5-3 million people.

Over recent years, the State has issued policies encouraging job
creation. The best results were obtained in 1995 when jobs were
created for more than 1 million persons, equal to the number of
persons  coming of working age each year. The Ministry of Labour,
War Invalids and Social Affairs has, together with the other
ministries and branches concerned, built a national job generation
program and is elaborating an insurance system for the unemployed
to submit for Government approval.

On the other hand, the solution to a more efficient use of
intellectual workers focuses on 5 causes of the irrational use of
intellectual workers. First, there must be a plan to adapt training
to the demand of employment. Second, a labour market must be
created to help intellectual workers find suitable employment in
their profession. Third, a policy must be issued encouraging
intellectual workers to work in those areas which have a great
demand for them. Fourth, a suitable wage scale must be developed
for those intellectual workers working in a field outside their
profession. And fifth, those intellectual workers in the
state-owned sector who have been made redundant by the
administrative reforms and the re-organisation of production must
be re-employed in other branches.

VNC: What comment do you have on the labour market in
foreign-invested enterprises? on the strikes by workers and the
maltreatment of workers by foreign employers?

TDH: Foreign investment is a strategic factor helping to accelerate
the renewal of the economic structure, the industrialisation of the
economy, and the generation of employment. That's why, over recent
years  the labour market in this sector has developed vigorously
and now employs more than 85,000 workers. This sector is demanding
more and more skilled workers in industrial production. The demand
for labour by foreign-invested projects in agriculture, forestry
and fisheries is growing continually because  the cost of
generating employment  in these branches is lower than in
industrial production.

During the 1991-1995 period, the demand for labour by
foreign-invested enterprises gradually shifted from the South to
the North and the Centre. Because this sector pays higher wages for
qualified skilled labour. About 70-80% of the workers in this
sector are skilled labour,About 90% of the labour force employed by
this sector are urban workers.

Of the 214 strikes since 1989, 79 have been in state-owned
enterprises, 93 in foreign invested enterprises, and 42 in private
enterprises. During the same period, there have been 32 cases of
maltreatment of workers, including 18 cases in enterprises invested
by ROK employers. These cases have all been settled by the agencies
concerned by means of warnings, imposing fines, forcing
compensation for the economic damage, deportation, and even legal
prosecution.

To ensure a good relationship between workers and employers, to
prevent strikes and to stop maltreatment of workers, it is
necessary to set reconciliation councils, arbitration councils, and
labour courts. For the time being, each province and city must set
up a working group composed of representatives of the branches
relating to labour employment, help to form trade union
organisations, improve the efficiency of labour inspection
organisations, and control implementation of the Labour Law.

VIETNAM: FIRST ALL-WOMEN ART EXHIBITION

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Hoang Yen

They are three women who share the same ambition to make powerful
representations of their artist visions on the canvasses. Thus, a
group exhibition of 70 of their favourite paintings was opened at
a Giang Vo Street gallery in Hanoi.

In fact, none of them is a professional artist. Le Minh Ha works at
Vietnam Airlines, Vo Thanh Huong at the Archaeology Institute, and
Nguyen Hong Hanh at the Oil and Gas Corporation. Something that
stands out as one enters the gallery is the variety of subjects
that have come under the optical as well as visionary perceptions
of the three artists whose well-travelled records are beyond
dispute.Another common denominator is their training at the same
Hanoi College of Industrial Arts. But the similarities end there.
Vo Thanh Huong tends toward a forceful realism which catches her
subjects in their most natural, deepest   self-expression: "
Farewell", "Streets", Still Life," and "Palm Trees" are  some of
the best  illustrations.

Nguyen Hong Hanh is more pensive and romantic in her paintings
"Young Women Returning from the Market", "Boats on the Red River,"
Dusk on Tam Bac River" and "Peacock Displays Its Plumage". On the
other hand, Le Minh Ha  prefers stronger colours in her paintings
of "Sundown on the Suburban Village", "Street on the Seashore",
"Bluebell Flowers".

A tentative attempt to venture into the strange waters of
surrealism can be detected in the "The Mark of Time" by Le Minh Ha
who seems to arrange things and feelings according to her
perceptions of time and space. For Nguyen Hong Hanh, space becomes
more unreal, more introspective in  Spring Comes over Dien
Bien".Occasionally, Vo Thanh Huong departed from her mainstream
style and  reverted  to tradition by making black the dominant hue
on her canvasses.

VIETNAM: ORIGINALITY AMONG PAINTERS OF THE YOUNG GENERATION

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Hoang Yen

As the market economy has opened new outlets for all kinds of arts,
originality has become a distinctive mark for which all painters,
especially those of the young generation, are aspiring and striving
for. How these young painters are trying to establish their
hallmarks, in other words, to carve a name among the multitude of
artistic displays, is approached by VIETNAM COURIER'S HOANG YEN, in
her recent interviews with a cross section of painters.

Doan Van Nguyen, 49,  lecturer at the Hanoi Arts College whose
specialization is lacquer painting. Nguyen has had several of his
works displayed at the Vietnam Arts Museum and the Oriental Arts
Museum in Russia:

"Originality and popularity must go side by side and in most cases
must mingle. Lacquer painting is not unique for Vietnam but its
materials and mode of expression must be an original art of
Vietnam. In this sense, while preserving the national tradition,
lacquer painting has to absorb elements of modernity of the world.
I would stress that in any case, quality must come first and this
is what differentiates one artistic work from another.

An ever larger proportion of the newly enrolled students wish to
learn lacquer painting, perhaps because this remains a genre of art
which still opens many windows for innovation. There is, however,
the risk of confounding the lacquer painting art with the
traditional craft of making lacquer ware for votive or decorative
purposes."

Pham Anh Thuy, 40, a graduate of the oil painting section of the
Hanoi Arts School:

"My first training was architecture and I got my civil engineering
diploma from the Hanoi Building College in 1980. Frankly speaking,
the economic reforms which are going on have offered me a vast
opportunity to make a fortune by using my capacity as a
construction engineer. But I later enrolled inthe Arts Collge
because I felt that painting, especially oil painting, is my
vocation.  I could not live without it even though I know that not
all artists are economically secured to devote themselves entirely
to art. In any case, the business world is not my stuff and I feel
much freer in the world of artistic creation."

Van Thuyet, 42, free-lance painter, who lives a spartan life with
his small vendor wife in a 20m2 room in Tran Nhat Duat street,
Hanoi:

"As you can picture for yourself, the life of a free lance artist
is anything but easy.People call me a surrealist, abstractionist or
something like that. I like to paint things which exist in my own
imaginary world, a world that no living human might have
visualized. Perhaps for this same reason  very few are those who
share my visions and still fewer are those who bought my paintings.
Once I got 1,000 USD for a painting and on another occasion I sold
a bronze statue for 3,000 USD. But these are my chance once in a
life time, so to speak."

Ta Hai, Head of the Youth and Children Program of the Voice of
Vietnam Radio:

"My main job is a radio reporter but I can't do without painting.
I take a special liking for painting on dead leaves. I consider
this to be the best method of achieving self - perfection. I
treasure all I have created after weeks, months and even years of
persistent and laborious work and was always caught between a sense
of regret and self - satisfaction when someone asked to buy a work
of mine. I do not want to part with my own creations but at the
same time it  comforts me to know that my work has been justly
appreciated. The only material of my paintings are the dead leaves,
pressed flower petals, a sheath of an areca leaf, in a word
everything that comes from the plants and trees. I want to preserve
nature and make the best of its beauty.

Young artists of today are more and more inclined to paint
abstractions. Not a few have succeeded but many others have failed
because they have cut themselves off from the practice of life,
that is, from the own source of their creation."

Phan Thi Lan Huong, 40,born in Hue city and teaching arts in Qui
Nhon town,Binh Dinh province, Central Vietnam. She is holding an
exhibition at 29, Hang Bai Street,Hanoi:

"I paint mainly on silk but I also make paper cuts and also try my
hand at lacquer. My favourite colour is black, not because I took
a dim view of life but  only to give greater relief to the bright
spots such as red, yellow and white.A  viewer of my paintings said:
"Your pictures give me a sense of true relief."That may be too
flattering a word but the fact remains that I want to impart the
sense of beauty and relaxation to people around me. This is also
perhaps why I like to paint women and nature.

At this exhibition alone I have sold ten paintings, the highest
priced is 1,000 USD. I consider myself much luckier than my
colleagues in Qui Nhon and other small towns. I'm looking forward
to some practical aid from the Vietnam Arts Association to help
painters in small towns like Qui Nhon also to have access to the
large public including foreign art lovers and researchers."

Quach Dong Phuong, teacher at the Hanoi Arts College:

"I have painted all these twenty years and my subjects are nothing
but scenes of daily life: going to the market, replanting rice,
family visits.... Some people rightly noted that the conical palm
leaf hat is nearly omnipresent in my pictures. I want in fact to
"personalize" my works by the conical hat, but not that alone. I
think that the conical hat is a traditional trait of the nation
which must be preserved in any form, including painting and
sculpture.

I am listed among the "richest" among Vietnamese painters. That may
be true or not, but the fact remains that I have sold many
paintings to several countries in Asia such as Singapore, Japan and
South Korea. Some European countries have also displayed my works.
I am told that they like my paintings because they combine very
successfully modernity and traditionality."

Nguyen Quoc Huy, 25, graduating from the Hanoi Arts College in
1994:

"Freedom of creation is my guiding principle and my greatest source
of self satisfaction. It might have been different if I had been
born in earlier times when everything depended on the government.
Now we have opened all the windows to the world, including the
artistic window. This enables us young painters and sculptors to
broaden our perspectives through increasing exchanges with the
outside artistic world. Lacquer paintings is my preference and is
a relatively safe way of making a living. If you are lucky enough
to sell two, or even one, lacquer paintings, it might sustain you
and your family for a whole year. When things go awry, I take up
other genres such as designing book covers, or painting posters and
advertisements".

VIETNAM: GROWING PRESENCE OF YOUNG PAINTERS, A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Duong Tuong

Painters 23 to 40 years of age account for 60% of the membership of
the Vietnam Fine Arts Association, according to Ms. Vu Giang Huong,
General Secretary of the Association.

The common and easily discredible trait of all the galleries and
exhibition is the growing presence of the young generation of
artists. It is that the older generation of artists has died or
silently withdrawn from the art market. Exhibitions by such
luminaries like Nguyen Tu Nghiem and Diep Minh Chau still attract
a large number of visitors, but they are greatly outnumbered by the
exhibitions of young painters who accounted for 400 of the 650
exhibits in 1995. "That is a welcome development," said Dzu Thanh,
a senior member of the Arts Association because they have been, and
will be, the vanguard to integrating Vietnamese art onto the world
scene. They are also the most dynamic force to vitalize and
diversify painting and sculpture in our country. All styles, genres
and perspectives are being accepted provided they do not run
counter to Vietnamese traditions. The young artists are eager to
test their worth through galleries and exhibitions which open
almost weekly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the two largest art
centres of the country. Their presence might also be the best
influence to eliminate all that is extravagant and eccentric.
Censorship in the truest sense of the word belong to the public,
not to any vested power. Some tendencies toward eccentricity and
eroticism have been quickly dismissed by the public even though the
press rarely interferes in these so-called "experimentation".Ta
Hai, an art lecturer commented: "I am a painter myself but I must
confide that some  enigmatic and eccentric paintings are past
comprehension or unstandable only to their author. In my view, the
search for the new must not allow us to disregard the public".

VIETNAM: YOUTH UNION RAISES PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT HIV/AIDS

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

A two-day conference on HIV/AIDS was held in Hanoi on Sept. 23-24
to raise public awareness about the HIV/AIDS disease and its
dangerous effect on youth.

Reports made at the conference said over 50% of HIV infected people
are between 15-24 years of age and in some places the rate of
HIV-infected girls is double that of HIV-infected boys in the 15-19
age group.

The conference aimed to raise public awareness about the epidemic
and seek solutions to prevent it from spreading. Participants in
the conference called for innovative partnerships and efficient
assistance among government agencies, communities, non-governmental
organisations, families of infected people and the private business
sector to help promote efforts against HIV infection.

Speaking at the conference Dr. Roy Morey, UN Resident Co-ordinator
and UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, said: "As elsewhere,
recognition and acceptance that everyone is at risk, and therefore
has a part to play in overcoming the AIDS epidemic, are key in
reversing the trend of rising infection rates".

Mr. Steve Kraus, Country Programme Advisor for UNAIDS, called for
special efforts "To provide this education to all children and
youth, especially those who are harder to reach such as children of
minorities, indigenous people, and street children."

A two-year UNDP project launched in early 1996 has selected Vietnam
as a priority for its assistance. The one-million USD project is
aimed at enhancing Vietnam's capacity to plan and coordinate the
implementation of policies and programme for the prevention of HIV
infection and care of HIV-infected people.

Funding for the conference has come from Vietnam's National AIDS
Committee, America Online, John Snow Inc., Health Ed and UNDP.

VIETNAM: COAL INDUSTRY NEEDS OVER 9 TRILLION VND UP TO 2010

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Quynh Trang

Sources at the Vietnam Coal Corporation (VINACOAL) said that the
coal industry will need about 9.4 trillion VND between now and 2010
to boost its production.

This sum, the sources said, is included in a development plan for
the industry for the period.

Under this plan, the development of the coal industry is to be made
in two stages. The first stage now to 2000 requires capital of
3,400 billion VND. The second stage  from 2000 to 2010, requires
capital of 5,900 billion VND.

Mr. Doan Van Kien, general director of VINACOAL, told VNC that in
1996, the industry's output may reach 9 million tons. In 2000, it
may increase to 12 million tons/year, instead of 10 million tons as
so far projected.

A problem for the industry, said Mr. Kien, is how to expand its
market outlets. VINACOAL has set in exports an annual target of
between 3 and 4 million tons/year in the upcoming years. In the
first 9 months of this year, its exports have reached 2.3 million

VIETNAM: LEATHERWARE INDUSTRY LOOKS FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

Sources at the Vietnam Leatherware Association said that the
leatherware industry is looking for some 465 million USD in
investment to improve its technologies, boost its output by 2.5
times and triple its export value to 1 billion USD by 2000.

The industry plans to acquire this investment capital through
selling stocks, attracting foreign direct investment, and taking
bank loans.

Of late, the industry has shown good signs of improvement, with its
turnover up by 462% compared with the same period last year. In the
first eight months of this year, it is expected to achieve an
output of 250 million pairs of shoes and 5,500 tons of products
made of genuine or imitation leather, and gross 685 billion VND,
17% higher than the whole  of 1995.

The leatherware industry has been rather attractive to foreign
investment. Of the more than 100 leatherware businesses in the
country at present, 12 are joint ventures and 22 are fully
foreign-owned.

VIETNAM: NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLASTICS INDUSTRY

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Le Thanh Huyen

It is not by chance that the recent Asian Plastics Forum in Ho Chi
Minh City attracted more than 200 delegates from various regional
manufacturers, including 51 from Japan. Vietnam has in recent years
become a potentially lucrative market for plastic products. Not
only has its need for materials for plastics production increased
steadily, from 100,000 tons/year in 1992 to 300,000 tons in 1995
and a projected 370,000 tons in 1997, but its fast-growing oil
industry is also making it a potentially important supplier of
materials for the plastics industry.

Growing need

Industry experts are unanimous that Vietnam's need for materials
for plastics production will increase much faster in the next three
to five years. Auto plants, telecommunications equipment factories,
cement plants, and many other industrial projects under
construction will be requiring quality plastic products.

Cement officials, for instance, said that their industry alone
will, by the year 2000, need about 300 million plastic bags.
However, all they have now is a small mill in Can Tho which
produces only 14 million plastic bags/year.

For the time being, the country's need for materials for plastics
production is being met mostly by imports from Southeast Asian
countries. Only 4% of those materiatls, however, are used in
high-quality products. But this situation is expected to change in
a few years when the country's petro-chemical industry is ready to
begin production.

Already, Petronas, the Malaysian oil producer, has invested 4
million USD in helping the Vietnamese Government design the
blueprint for its petro-chemical industry. Meanwhile, Mitsui of
Japan is applying for a license to invest in building an
82-million-USD mill attached to the oil refinery to be built at
Dzung Quat in central Vietnam.

According to a plan being designed by the Ministry of Industry,
Vietnam will be producing each year starting in 2010, about 500,000
tons of PVC, 330,000 tons of PP, 200,000 tons of PS, and 75,000
tons of DOP.

Industry experts predict that given its good resources, Vietnam can
then focus more on producing materials for plastics production
rather than manufacturing plastic consumer goods as it has been so
far. The plastic products it produces then should be mostly for
high-end markets.

The needed investment

According to the Vietnam Plastics Corporation, Vinaplast, in order
to reach the above targets, the Vietnamese plastics industry should
invest at least 1 billion USD between now and the year 2005, mostly
in high-tech plastics. Thus they could reduce the volume of plastic
consumer goods from the present 60% of total output to only 20%.
About half of this investment is planned to come from foreign
sources through joint ventures or loans schemes.

Officials of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) said
that they have so far licensed 30 investment projects in the
plastics industry, with a total capital of 330 million USD. Twelve
of these projects are wholly foreign-owned.

However, the officials also said that most of these projects are
small and focused only on producing consumer goods. There have been
so far only two projects for producing PVC compound, two others
producing PVC resin, and a 15-million-USD project in plastic
insulation for electronic parts, they said.

One of the projects to produce materials for the plastics industry
is the Oxy-Vina, a 109.4-million-USD joint venture among  Tramasuco
and VietGas of Vietnam, Oxychem of the US, and Marubeni of Japan to
produce PVC compound. It is located in Ba Ria-Vung Tau and is
scheduled to start operation in 1999. As this article goes to
press, it is reported that Petronas of Malaysia is negotiating a
deal to take over Oxychem's share in this joint venture.

The other on-going materials  projects include the 92-million-USD
joint venture between Vinaplast and Mitsui of Japan which is to
start producing 80,000 tons of PVC resin/year in 1997 and the
12-million-USD joint venture between Vinaplast and Lucky GoldStar
of South Korea which is to produce 30,000 tons of DOP/year.

VIETNAM: ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY CAUGHT IN DILEMMA: OUTGROWING THE TIGHT
SHIRT

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Quynh Trang

The electricity industry is caught in a dilemma. On the one hand,
it is being told to produce, between now and the year 2000, about
30 billion kWh/year to meet the needs of the economy. On the other
hand, it has not yet acquired the capital to develop both its
generating capacity and its electric grid to match the economy's
growth, let alone double the 1995 output of 14.6 billion kWh in
only four years.

In a recent interview with VNC, Mr. Truong Bao Ngoc, deputy general
director of the Vietnam Electricity Corporation (VEC), said that
for the electric industry to fulfil its plan, it needs an
investment of about 6 billion USD in the 1996-2000 period. But, he
said, our biggest problem now is finance. We are not in any
position to balance our budget and make significant investments in
developing power resources and a distribution network. Demand has
been increasing faster than the supply and this may result in a
power shortage in the 1996-98 dry seasons. The power grid is either
overloaded or inefficient in many places".

In search of a solution

To help the electricity industry overcome its financial problems,
the Government has allowed it to retain all its capital
depreciation fund for the period from now until 2000 for
reinvestment. It is also allowed to increase electricity prices by
about 70% during this period (the maximum expected to be 800 VND or
about 0.70 USD for a kWh) and mobilise funding from other domestic
sources. However, experts said, all these new funds will, at best,
meet only 30% of the industry's financial needs. The rest will be
made up by loans from foreign banks and financial institutions such
as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

An important form of investment is coming through
Build-Operate-Transfer projects  or joint ventures. By now, the
industry has had three BOT projects which are expected to be
completed before 2000. They include the 300-MW thermo-electric
power plant (phase I) in Quang Ninh province, the 600-MW
gas-operated power plant II (phase II) in Phu My, Ba Ria-Vung Tau
province and the 620-MW gas-operated power plant III, also in Phu
My, Ba Ria-Vung Tau. They will be followed by a number of other
power projects, in both northern and southern provinces. It is
projected that the BOT plants will generate about 30% of the total
output of all domestic power plants.

A problem with the BOT plants which is being addressed is the
timing of their transfer. Because of the low price of electricity
in Vietnam, which is meant to keep it within the reach of most
low-income customers, an early transfer will make BOT electricity
too expensive. Meanwhile, a prolonged transfer which would keep the
price low, would result in a relatively higher depreciation 1 on
equipment.

Whatever the solution may be, it will be carefully balanced to make
the output price reasonable for both the project owners and
customers, industry sources said.

For the immediate future, the industry is taking measures to ensure
a stable power supply. These measures include upgrading existing
coal- and diesel-fuelled power plants and accelerating the
construction of on-going power projects. There are also measures
planned to reduce the electricty loss in transmission to 0.5% each
year from now to 2000.

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Thanh Huyen

Sources at Oxy-Vina, Vietnam's largest joint venture in PVC
production, said that Petronas of Malaysia has expressed an
interest in replacing Oxychem of the US as its largest share
holder.

Oxychem contributes 40% to the capital of this 109.4-million-USD
joint venture which was licensed in July 1995. The other partners
are Tramasuco and VietGas of Vietnam and Marubeni of Japan. The
joint venture's factory is to be built in Ba Ria-Vung Tau where oil
and natural gas are expected to be readily available.

replacement was yet to be worked out and signed.

Petronas has provided the Vietnamese Government with a
4-million-USD assistance to design a plan to develop Vietnam's
petro-chemical industry.

By Doan Ngoc Thu

Experts at the FPT, a leading Vietnamese computer dealer, said that
Compaq products are accounting for almost 20% of the local computer
market.

Compaq's market share in many other countries has been only 10% or
less, the experts said.

Mr. R. Sivadas, Compaq's business director for Southeast Asia and
Indochina, said in a recent press conference in Hanoi that in the
first six months of this year, Compaq fulfilled 66% of its sale
plan for the year.

Still, according to Mr. R.Sivadas, Compaq owes its market share in
Vietnam to its high quality products and good maintenance services.

Compaq is selling its products in Vietnam through a dealer network
which includes 3C, Dong Nam Associates, Quang Minh and Thakaral
Brothers. FPT is the only dealer appointed to provide maintenance
service for Compaq computers.

It is reported that Compaq is taking steps toward opening its own

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

Sources at the Daewoo group of South Korea said that they are still
determined to continue their joint venture with the Hanoi Bus
Service Company to build an integrated bus service in the
Vietnamese Capital City.

The project is still under consideration by the government even
though it was signed two years ago.

A reason for this delay is that many people have been skeptical
about its profitability since it would cost a rather huge amount.

The project has a total investment capital of 136 million USD to
which Vietnamese side is to contribute 30%.

A ground for hope for the investors is the recent government
approval of the allocation of 26 ha of land area for the operation
of a public bus system in Hanoi.

The government has encouraged both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to
develop their public transport systems. Recently, it has effected
a temporary halt on the licensing of new taxi companies and now
only licenses bus companies.

VIETNAM BEGINS MAKING DIARRHEA MEDICINE FOR CHILDREN

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

By Pham Thanh Thuy

An oresol production factory has just been put into operation in
the central coastal province of Khanh Hoa to help fight against
diarrhea among children under 5.

For the first time Vietnam can produce this medicine, which
according to a World Health Organisation study, is quite effective
in the treatment of diarrhea, one of the six child killers.

The factory, capacity 10 million packs/year, can meet the national
demand, which is estimated at 4 million packs/year for diarrhea and
about 6 million packs for other diseases such as malaria and Dengue
fever.

In the first year of operation, the factory is expected to turn out
2 million packs and will increase the production in the following
years until it runs at full blast.

More than half of the project cost of 750,000 USD is funded by the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as part of its package aid
for the National Programme for Control of Diarrhea Disease (CDD).
Since 1984 UNICEF has granted CDD about 400,000 USD/year in medical
personnel training and supply of oresol. The programme is covering
95% of villages and communes throughout the country.

VIETNAM: THE LU PEOPLE

from VIETNAM COURIER, Issue No. 161, September 14-September 20, 1996

The Lu have about 3,700 inhabitants settling in two districts of
Phong Tho and Sin Ho of Lai Chau province.

The Lu are also called Lu, Nhuon and Duon. Many ancient vestiges
are found in Dien Bien, but there are a few Lu people living there.
Lu language belongs to the Tay-Thai group.

The Lu have practised farming from time immemorial. They plough and
harrow the fields, dig canals for irrigation, sow rice seeds and
transplant rice, but do not weed or use fertilizers. The Lu also
use burnt-over land to grow corn, cassava, groundnut, indigo and
cotton. Every family has its private garden around their house. The
Lu's staple food is sticky rice. They like to drink tea and men
like to smoke tobacco with bubble pipes.

Weaving is the most widespread sideline occupation. Each family has
several looms. The Lu are very skilful in weaving, sewing and
embroidery. Their garments are decorated with colourful motifs on
dark indigo cloth.

The Lu live in houses on stilts. The back - side of the roof is
shorter than the front one which reaches down to cover the corridor
and stairs. The entrance door faces northwest. Each house has two
kitchens, one used to cook daily meals and the other to boil water.

Young men and women are free to choose their partners. The
fortuneteller plays an important role in the matching of a couple.
The husband must live with the wife's family for two or three years
before building their own home. The children take the father's
family name. All Lu boys have the common mid-name Ba and the girls,
the mid-name.Y. The Lu are friendly and faithful. Divorce is rare.
As is the custom, he or she who asks for a divorce will be fined.

Buddhism is the predominant religion. After the dead person is
buried the family builds a paper sepulchral house decorated with
beautiful designs and fills it with cloth, mattress, paddy and
money to take the deceased's soul to the pagoda.

The Lu like to sing Khap (sung verses), tell old stories, proverbs,
recite poems and play flutes, two-string violins and drums.

COMMERCE'S ROTHKOPF LEAVING

     David J. Rothkopf -- who has been acting Undersecretary of
Commerce for International Trade since the departure of Jeffrey
Garten last October (WTD, 9/29/95) -- yesterday announced he too
is leaving the department later this month.
     Mr. Rothkopf -- who joined Commerce in late 1993 after
having served as chief executive officer of International Media
Partners -- will become the managing director of Kissinger and
Associates, a strategic consulting firm in Washington and New
York.

DRUG MAKERS WANT USTR TO GET TOUGH WITH ARGENTINA

     The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
yesterday called on the US Trade Representative to get tough with
Argentina because of its failure to fulfill promises to
strengthen its intellectual property rights protection laws (WTD,
11/22/95).
     Despite repeated promises to improve the law, patent piracy
in the pharmaceutical sector continues, PhMA President Gerald J.
Mossinghoff wrote US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor.  The
lack of movement is costing US drug manufacturers some $500
million a year in lost sales opportunities.
     Mr. Mossinghoff said Argentina "should receive a clear
message -- the US will not accept further procrastination and
failure to enact a new patent protection law.  A comprehensive
strategy -- one that features sustained face-to-face negotiations
with Argentine officials, and the possibility of enforcement
action if talks fail -- should be developed."
     Argentina sits on a less important "special watch list"
under the Section 301 program, the association said.
     In the interim, Argentina has actually passed legislation
that weakens protection of intellectual property rights for all
fields of technology.  "Correcting that problem should be a top
USTR priority in 1996," Mr. Mossinghoff wrote.

CREATING JOBS DECLARED MAIN CHALLENGE FACING GERMANY IN 1996

Reducing Germany's stubbornly high unemployment, the country's
leaders agreed as 1995 drew to a close, stands as the most
important task for the coming year. Across the political
spectrum, German politicians acknowledged that creating new
jobs must be given the highest priority in public policy.
Religious and labor leaders warned, however, that job creation
must not come at the expense of the social welfare system.
Speaking to the nation in his annual New Year's Eve address,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said "the battle against unemployment"
would be his government's main concern in 1996. The German
economy, he noted, continues to expand, but growth has not
brought about a much needed breakthrough on the job front. New
thinking is necessary, the chancellor insisted as he promised
that job creation would be the focus of talks between the
government, labor leaders and representatives of industry, "We
will be able to address the future successfully only if we find
common answers to the issues that concern us," he said. "Every
reasonable proposal, every forward-looking initiative should be
considered and not rejected out of hand or subjected to the
destructive effects of sustained public controversy." Given
plans to curtail government bureaucracy and cutbacks at major
corporations, much of the impetus for job creation will have to
come from small and medium-sized businesses, Germany's famed
Mittelstand, Kohl went on to argue, and particular attention
must be given to encouraging new businesses and self-
employment. "Anyone who starts up anew business in our country
creates employment and a living for an average of four
additional persons," he observed. "In Germany, we need a new
spirit of enthusiasm for business start-ups. We need men and
women who are self-confident and able to translate their ideas
into action."
Like the chancellor, Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth (CDU)
called for a "unprejudiced" examination of a broad variety of
proposals to boost employment. Suessmuth, speaking in a radio
interview New Year's Day, cited the "Alliance for Work"
recently put forward by the industrial union IG Metall as one
such proposal that warrents serious consideration (cf. TWIG
11/3/95, p.4). Last November, union head Klaus Ziwckel
suggested labor would be willing to forego wage increases in
exchange for guarantees of job security from employers and an
end to government plans to cut social welfare spending. In
addition to considering proposals like that, Suessmuth said,
emphasis has to be placed on investment. That includes not only
investment in the industries of tomorrow, she stressed, but
also in efforts to put people back to work, even if in only
menial jobs and even if at the taxpayers' expense. That could
lead to higher social security deductions from the paychecks of
the employed, Suessmuth acknowledged, but otherwise the social
welfare systems is threatened with collapse as growing numbers
of Germans - the unemployed and holders of exempted low-wage
jobs (see story page 5) - find themselves unable to contribute.
An "alliance for the social state," according to the public
employees' union DAG, is needed to protect Germany's social
welfare system against excessive cuts in the interests of
employers. "Attacks on the social system by employers and
politicians make it necessary to organize social counter forces
in 1996," DAG board member Lutz Freitag told reporters in
Hamburg at the year's close. It is incompatible with the goals
set out in the Basic Law, Germany's constitution, that the less
affluent are increasingly being pushed to the margins of German
society, he said. That message was echoed by Bishop Klaus
Engelhard of Hannover (Lower Saxony), chair of the governing
board of Germany's Evangelical Church. The growing gap between
rich and poor, the bishop said in his New Year's Eve sermon,
threatens Germany's social consensus. He thus welcomed
Zwickel's call for an "Alliance for Work" and urged labor and
industry to sit down with the government for talks.

HERZOG PROCLAIMS JANUARY 27 DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR VICTIMS OF
NAZISM

January 27 will henceforth be a national day of remembrance for
the victims of Nazism, President Roman Herzog of Germany has
proclaimed. It was on that day in 1945 that the Auschwitz
concentration camp was liberated. Auschwitz, the president
noted in a proclamation he issued Wednesday (January 3), stands
as a symbol of the Nazis' racist and genocidal policies. The
Nazi terror must never be forgotten, Herzog said, and future
generations must be made mindful of what happened in Germany
during the Third Reich so that nothing comparable will ever
again be allowed to occur. The newly designated day of
remembrance will pay tribute to the millions of men, women and
children who were tortured and murdered by the Nazis, to every
individual who suffered persecution and disenfranchisement
during the twelve-year nightmare of the Third Reich.
The day after Herzog made his proclamation, Bundestag President
Rita Suessmuth (CDU) announced that the parliament will hold a
session to commemorate the victims of  Nazism on January 19.
President Herzog, she said, had agreed to address the special
session.

NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA AFFIRMATIVE ACTION LAW TO REMAIN IN
EFFECT DESPITE COURT RULING

An affirmation action law will remain in effect in the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia despite a court ruling against it, state
officials indicated late last month. On December 19, a state
superior administrative court (Oberverwaltungsgericht) in
Muenster rejected a petition from a woman who had been passed
over for a promotion in favor of a male colleague. Under North
Rhine-Westphalia's law to advance equality in the workplace,
women are to be favored over men with comparable skills and
qualifications in hiring and promotion until the office or
department in question has equal numbers of men and women. In
rejecting the petition, the court, which had previously
declared the law unconstitutional, invoked a recent ruling by
the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The European court
ruled in October that a similar affirmative action law in the
state of Bremen violated guarantees of equal treatment for all
individuals contained in European Union law (cf. TWIG 10/20/95,
p.4).
Minister of Women Ilse Ridder-Melcher (SPD) of North Rhine-
Westphalia announced that the disputed law will remain in
effect because the superior administrative court does not have
the authority o invalidate a law passed by the state
parliament. Only the Federal Constitutional Court, she noted,
can do so. Approximately 40 men have sought to challenge the
constitutionality of the North Rhine-Westphalia affirmative
action law since the beginning of the decade, but all have
ultimately withdrawn their complaints upon receiving promotion.
Two men, Ridder-Melcher said, recently filed complaints against
the law.
Comparing North Rhine-Westphalia's law on promoting women with
Bremen's, Ridder-Melchers told the Frankfurter Rundschau, is
like comparing apples and oranges. In North Rhine-Westphalia's,
she notes, women are not automatically given preference over
men. Each case must be reviewed individually to assure that the
man or men involved are not put under unfair hardship by hiring
or promoting women in their place. This clause, in Ridder-
Melcher's view, puts North Rhine-Westphalia's law on more solid
legal footing than Bremen's. In 1993, she said, the Federal
Labor Court upheld the validity of the law.

NUMBER OF ETHNIC GERMAN RESETTLERS DROPPED IN 1995

The number of ethnic Germans resettling in the Federal Republic
dropped slightly last year, the Federal Ministry of the
Interior announced Monday (January 1). In 1995, a total of
217,898 ethnic Germans registered as resettlers in Germany,
roughly 5,000 fewer than the 222,591 who did in 1994. The
overwhelming majority (209,409) came from the successor states
to the Soviet Union. Most of the remainder came from either
Romania (6,519) or Poland (1,677). During 1995, German
authorities received 260,556 applications from ethnic Germans
seeking to resettle in the Federal Republic. Approximately
100,00 ethnic Germans in the former East Bloc, the ministry
reports, have received permission to emigrate to the Federal
Republic but have not yet done so. Ministry officials believe
most do not intend to use their entry permits unless an
emergency arises.
Not all the ethnic Germans leaving their homes in the Central
Asiatic states of the Commonwealth of Independent States are
resettling in Germany. According to Ministry of the Interior
Parliamentary State Secretary Horst Waffenschmidt (CDU),
approximately 10,000 ethnic Germans left Central Asia for the
Russian Federation. Many settled in western Siberia, which has
a 600,000-strong German minority. Both Russia and Germany,
Waffenschmidt noted, support this migration.
The number of ethnic Germans who opt to resettle in Germany
during the coming year will depend on the political situation
in the Commonwealth of Independent States, Waffenschmidt said.
Germany's goal is to accept a limited number of resettlers
while providing development aid to German minorities in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet republics. Particular emphasis
will be placed on intensifying ties between Germany and ethnic
German communities this year. Germany is contributing toward
the construction of community centers which will offer, among
services, courses in the German language. More aid will also be
offered this year to support small and medium-sized businesses
in ethnic German communities.

THE PRESS ON THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
(January 2) "It seems 1996 will be the year of alliances in
German economic policy. The chancellor, as part of a general
plan of action, wants to join in the `alliance for jobs,'
proposed by Klaus Zwickel, chairperson of the IG Metall
metalworkers union. SPD party leader Oskar Lafontaine would
like to bring all the social forces into an `employment pact.'
And the Public Employees Union, suspecting that meetings with
the chancellor and employment experts have involved a critical
look at social (security) costs, is making a cautionary appeal
to the churches of an `alliance for the social state'
(Sozialstaat).
Those rubrics indicate the right priorities. Reducing
unemployment is the most urgent economic issue for Germany. The
connection between unemployment and social costs is a spiral
into fiscal calamity: social welfare payments increase business
costs, leading to unemployment, and unemployment requires
increased contributions to let the social fund bear the costs
of joblessness. If there is no action, the society moves toward
ever higher unemployment, a prisoner of the social spiral it
constructed. The necessity of halting that fateful turn needs
no further explanation. That brings up the question how.
Zwickel's proposal makes clear, above all, where the risk is in
a new collectivism of alliances. Unemployment has occured
because the wages reached through collective bargaining don't
correspond to the employment requirements of employees and the
profit and loss position of businesses. The errors of these
collective agreements are now supposed to be cured by an even
more far-reaching collective agreement. In exchange for a
promise vaguely binding them to moderation, the partners of
the `alliance,' in the stead of business, are promising to
procure hundreds of thousands of jobs, and the state should
forget about revising the social system. That will not work;
high employment won't come out of it.
From the point of view of the unions, however, the Zwickel
alliance has an entirely different aim: to bring in the unions
as players in the center of a corporative policy. One shouldn't
fall into that trap."

Sueddeutsche Zeitung
(Munich, December 30) "It's difficult enough to read between
the lines, even harder to extract the insinuations. Helmut
Kohl's New Year's speech will not make it easy for readers or
listeners, at least not those who are interested in finding out
from the chancellor what the new year will really bring by way
of problems or opportunities.. `Much has gone well, but not
everything.' If that isn't the epitaph of the year! Or maybe
even better: `In retrospective we are looking backwards, but
the future is ours only if we are confident.'
Jokes aside, the chancellor is stating the obvious: no
breakthrough in employment. But he isn't what he needs to:
tighten those belts a little tighter! Business people should
stop complaining and get down to business! It's time to
redefine and rediscover social consensus in the face of vastly
changed worldwide market conditions! Be more flexible! Less
vacation! More participation in (meeting) social costs from
those who can do so! And everything else you could put an
exclamation point to...
Instead, Kohl clothes the need to save and cut down and be
realistic in vague terms: `There can't be any exceptions.' And
he promises a new growth of small and medium-sized businesses.
Where will that come from? `Ideas' and the `courage of
independence' do not suffice. Public policy needs the courage
to create the right conditions. But maybe it's too much to ask
for anything concrete on New Year's Eve. During the night
fireworks will explode into momentary dreams. Then it soon will
be day again with plenty of time for the truth."

General-Anzeiger
(Bonn, December 30) "The social state is not the cause of
structural change (in German society), but rather it makes the
consequences of (that change) - in particular mass unemployment
- at least halfway endurable, since it saddles everyone (with
responsibility) for them. Whoever shrinks (the social state)
too severely will not only create room for maneuver for new
investment, but also a different society. But solidarity is not
a one-way street, not in the family or in the work place or in
politics. The French learned this painfully during the weeks of
strikes before Christmas. It is obvious to say but difficult to
put into action: the Germans must act together to meet the
challenges they face."

Berliner Morgenpost
(December 30) "For better or worse, our leisure and good-time
society will have to get used to the fact that unified Germany
has taken on a new role in international politics. That does
not mean first and foremost more prestige, but rather more
responsibility, which is an encumbrance to each and every
individual citizen. We are flattered to be considered one of
the world's prosperous, indeed rich nations, when Germany is
admired for its political and economic stability. But we are
overcome with dread when we think about the transformation of
the D-mark into the euro. So, too, is sending German troops
into a war zone for the first time ever, where they might
become involved in combat actions, part of the price that an
enlarged Germany has to pay.

YEAR'S END BRINGS REVISIONS IN ECONOMIC FORECASTS

As 1995 drew to a close, a handful of Germany's leading
economics institutes made last minute revisions in their
predictions of the country's economic performance. Each fall,
six research institutes join in presenting a report on their
expectations for the German economy. This past October, the six
agreed that growth for 1995 would stand at about 2.25 percent
and reach 2.5 percent in 1996 (cf. TWIG 10/27/95, p.4). Three
of the six announced in late December, however, that they had
been over optimistic in their outlook for the coming year. In
its December monthly report, the Federal Ministry of Economics
likewise pointed to disappointing economic performance in the
second half of 1995, but nonetheless predicted continued
economic recovery in the next twelve months.
The Munich-based Ifo institute announced on December 20 that it
now expects economic growth of 2.0 percent for 1995 and 1.75
percent for 1996 rather than the previously anticipated 2.25
and 2.5 percent.. The institute cited disappointing capital
investment figures for the second half of 1995 in issuing its
revised forecast, but stressed that it does not expect Germany
to slip into recession. Private consumption boosted by tax
breaks will help the economy, according to Ifo, and investment
and exports are expected to recover from the effects of a
strong D-mark and high wage settlements. But unemployment will
change little over the year and probably drop by only one-tenth
of a percent o 9.5 percent, Ifo now believes. Hamburg's HWWA
Institute for Economic Research similarly announced that it now
expects economic growth of only 2.0 percent for 1995, but, like
Ifo, it believes the recovery process should pick up in 1996
and that the German economy will not slip into recession
The Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research said it
still expects 2.25 percent growth for 1995, but maintained that
the German economy is not performing as well as it could. The
anticipated growth, the institute added, will hardly help
change the employment situation in Germany as a whole; it
foresees a reduction in unemployment only in the eastern half
of the country. In the view the Institute for Economic Research
(IWH), Halle (Saxony-Anhalt), the eastern economy should grow
by 4.8 percent in 1996. Limited growth in the west, according
to IWH, will slow growth in the east.
Acknowledging a number of factors slowing Germany's economic
recovery, the Federal Ministry of Economics pointed to others
in its December report that should give the economy a boost in
coming months. Low interest rates, stable prices and increases
in household incomes arising from tax cuts should help lift the
economy after 1995's disappointing fourth quarter. Preliminary
data on fourth quarter production, contracts and wholesale
prices, the report said, suggest that growth in the second half
of the year will stand at about 1.5 percent, a marked drop from
the 2.6 percent registered in the first six months of 1995.

COMPUSERVE RESTRICTS ACCESS TO 200 IN RESPONSE TO GERMAN
INVESTIGATION

The computer network firm CompuServe announced Friday (December
29) that it was restricting access to 200 Internet sites in
response to an investigation by public prosecutors in Munich.
In late November, the public prosecutor's office in Munich
launched an investigation to determine whether the CompuServe
network was being used to distribute materials that violate
German law. Specifically, prosecutors believe child pornography
and pornographic materials legally off limits to minors are
being disseminated via CompuServe's German subsidiary,
CompuServe GmbH. To forestall any further violations of German
law, officials at CompuServe's headquarters in the United
States said they were blocking access to 200 sites dealing with
sexual topics. The restrictions will affect CompuServe users
around the world because, as the company explained, it cannot
currently tailor its services to meet the different national
laws in each of the countries where it has subscribers.
CompuServe says it provides network services to over four
million subscribers throughout the world, including 220,000 in
the German-speaking nations. According to the public
prosecutors office, officials at CompuServe GmbH's Munich
office voluntarily turned over materials to investigators on
November 22. CompuServe has emphasized that it cannot control
what its subscribers make available through the Internet and
called for investigations that are "specifically focused on
those people and groups that place materials on the Internet."
Chief Prosecutor Manfred Wick told reporters Tuesday (January
2) that his office has sought the advice of technical experts
to determine whether the providers of online services are
capable of preventing the distribution of illegal materials.

EUROPE ONLINE JOINS RANKS OF NETWORK PROVIDERS IN GERMANY

Competition among the providers of online services in Germany
became tighter on December 15 as Europe Online went into
operation. The newcomer joins America Online's AOL Europa,
CompuServe, Deutsche Telekom and Microsoft in the race for
subscribers in Germany, where a well-educated population of 80
million makes for a potentially lucrative market. Europe Online
is based Luxembourg and provides services in English, French
and German. Germany's Burda Verlag, the publisher of the
magazines Focus and Bunte, has a 30-percent stake in the
venture.
Another major German media concern, the Axel Springer Verlag,
had planned to participate in Europe Online. Springer, which
publishes the widely read tabloid newspaper Bild, decided
instead to team up with the Bertelsmann media conglomerate and
Deutsche Telekom, the German national phone company, in
participating in America Online's AOL Europa.

SOCIAL SECURITY EXEMPTION FOR LOW-WAGE WORKERS DECLARED VALID

Germany's exemption on social welfare contributions for workers
in low-paying jobs, the Luxembourg-based European Court of
Justice ruled last month, does not violate European Union law
and is thus valid. Under German law, workers with monthly
incomes of less than DM 580 (about U.S. $400) do not pay into
the social security system that provides pensions, unemployment
benefits and health insurance. Local courts in Hannover (Lower
Saxony) and Speyer (Rheinland-Pfalz) brought the case before
the European Court of Justice on behalf of three female
domestic workers. According to the local courts, the German law
is discriminatory because the great majority of those who hold
so-called "580 Mark jobs" are women. Dismissing that line of
argument, the European Court of Justice backed the German
government's right to use the exemption to "achieve a socio-
political goal." Bonn maintains that without the exemption,
low-wage jobs would disappear without any corresponding
increase in full-time, higher-wage employment.
The number of people holding "580 Mark jobs" is estimated at
between 4.5 and 6.0 million. By the calculations of the Munich-
based Sueddeutsche Zeitung, about a quarter of them are
employed in private households. Many of the rest hold part-time
jobs in retail sales, manufacturing, and the hotel and
restaurant industry. Other European countries, including
Belgium, France, Great Britain, Ireland and Luxembourg, have
similar social-service exemptions for low wage earners.

"MULTIMEDIA": WAVE OF THE FUTURE SELECTED AS WORD OF THE YEAR

Multimedia," pundits say, is the inevitable wave of the future,
but in the past year, according to the preeminent monitors of
the German tongue, it was the inescapable buzzword of the
moment. The Society for German Language (Gesellschaft fuer
Deutsche Sprache) proclaimed "multimedia" 1995's "World of the
Year" late last month, citing its broad influence on recent
public discussion and debate. "We found a five hundred-percent
increase in the use of the concept `multimedia' this year,"
society spokesperson Gerhard Mueller explained in announcing
the Word of the Year. "Multimedia is the guiding term
(Leitwort) for the journey into the brave new media world."
There will hardly be an area of everyday life, Mueller and his
colleagues speculate, that will not be touched by advances in
information technology in the none too distant future.
Another change on the horizon - if Europe's political leaders
hold firm to newly approved plans - will be the introduction of
a common Eurogeld ("Euro-currency"), the runner-up on the Word
of the Year list. Third place went to the much-discussed
Kruzifixurteil ("crucifix judgement"). In August, the Federal
Constitutional Court ruled that a Bavarian ordinance mandated
the hanging of crucifixes in public school classrooms violated
Germany's constitution, the Basic Law (cf. TWIG 9/8/95, p.6).
The ruling provoked indignation from many Bavarian politicians
and large public protests throughout the state. Prime Minister
Edmund Stoiber (CSU) and his cabinet subsequently drafted
legislation that would change the wording of Bavaria's school
ordinances but still keep crucifixes in the great majority of
classrooms (cf. TWIG 9/15/95, p.7).
Religious concerns also stood behind the society's "Motto of
the Year," Wir sind Kirche ("We are the Church"). The line
served as both the name and the rallying cry of a lay Catholic
initiative calling for reforms within the Roman Catholic Church
(cf. TWIG 11/24/95, p.6; 12/8/95, p.7). Wir sind Kirche
gathered 1.8 million signatures on petition calling for an end
to obligatory clerical celibacy and the prohibition on the
ordination of women, among other changes.
Until last year, the Society for German Language designated the
Unwoerter ("non-words") of the year, the most unfortunate
expressions to enter the language. The Unwoerter selection
committee and the society parted ways in 1994 in the wake of a
controversy over the inclusion of kollektiver Freizeitpark
("collective leisure park"), a term used by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl to criticize Germany's extensive social welfare system,
among the Unwoerter of 1993 (cf. TWIG 1/6/95, p.6). The six-
person selection jury, a spokesperson reported Tuesday (January
2), has received a record number of suggestions from the
general public for 1995's Unwort of the Year. The jury's
verdict is expected later this month.

HEINER MUELLER, LEADING FIGURE IN GERMAN THEATER, DIES FROM
CANCER-RELATED ILLNESS

Heiner Mueller, one of Germany's most respected and most
controversial post-war playwrites, died Saturday (December 30),
a week and a half short of his 67th birthday. The author of
over 30 pieces for the stage, Mueller also earned acclaim for
his work as director and drama theorist. His professional
success was anything but straightforward, however. Mueller was
a Marxist and long time member of the German Democratic
Republic's governing Socialist Unity Party, but he was
temporarily forbidden to publish or stage his socially critical
work in the GDR. From the mid 1960s on, Mueller's plays tended
to be staged more frequently in the Federal Republic and other
nations than in the GDR. Yet even though the East German
authorities were often less than enthusiastic about Mueller's
cynical tone, they nonetheless acknowledged the merit of his
work. In 1986, he was awarded the GDR National Prize for Art
and Literature, one of the country's highest honors. Mueller's
independent stance before the collapse of the GDR was much
lauded, but not long after unification it was revealed he had
served as an "unofficial collaborator" - i.e., as an informer -
for the Stasi, East Germany's secret police. Mueller,
acknowledging that he had been in regular contact with the
Stasi, said he had tried to advise the authorities and to use
his influence constructively.
At the time of his death, Mueller was the artistic director of
the Berliner Ensemble, the theater company founded by Bertold
Brecht in eastern Berlin shortly after the establishment of the
GDR. Like all eastern German cultural institutions, the
Berliner Ensemble entered a period of change and uncertainty
after unification. Mueller was appointed to serve as one of
four co-directors to guide the venerable company's way into the
future. The four-person directorship fell apart late in the
winter of 1995, however, and Mueller, despite having recently
undergone surgery for cancer of the esophagus, accepted an
invitation to take over as sole artistic director.
The members of the Berliner Ensemble, joining with the rest of
the German theatrical and literary community in mourning
Mueller's death, are honoring Mueller's memory with a marathon
reading program. On Tuesday (January 2), company member Hans
Fleischmann began reading Mueller's piece Bericht vom Gro_vater
("Grandfather's Report") before an audience of about two dozen.
The readings will continue through January 9, the day Mueller
would have turned 67.

THE G-7 NATIONS PLEDGE $2.3 BILLION TO HELP CLOSE CHERNOBYL

Plans for the eventual shutdown of the infamous Chernobyl
nuclear power plant came a step closer to realization in late
December as Ukraine and the leading industrial nations came to
a provisional agreement on a financial aid package. The
industrial nations agreed in principle this past spring, nine
years after the accident that made Chernobyl a household word
around the world, to help offset the costs of closing the
hobbled but still operating power plant (cf. TWIG 4/21/95,
p.5). At that time, the amount of aid Ukraine could expect in
exchange for agreeing to shut Chernobyl was left undetermined;
Ukrainian authorities estimated the shutdown would cost a total
of U.S. $4.4 billion. In a statement of intention signed
December 20, the G-7 nations (Canada, France, Germany, Great
Britain, Italy, Japan and the U.S.) declared themselves
prepared to contribute U.S. $500 million in direct toward the
cost of taking Chernobyl out of operation once and for all. The
G-7 and the European Union are also prepared to make available
another $1.8 billion in credits for construction of power
plants to replace Chernobyl. These figures are "targets,"
explained Ukrainian Minister of the Environment Yuri Kostenko.
Further negotiations, he added, will be needed to work out the
details. Canadian Minister of the Environment Shelia Copps, who
signed the statement of intention on behalf of the entire G-7,
described the signing of the statement of intention marked only
the beginning of Chernobyl's closing, a process she said will
take several years to complete. Under current plans, Chernobyl
will be taken out of operation by the year 2000. "Germany is
especially interested in the concrete shell over reactor four,"
a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Ministry of the Environment
told the German Press Agency (dpa) the day after the statement
of intention was signed. Ukraine, he added, hopes to negotiate
bilateral aid agreements with the G-7 nations in the next
several weeks so that formal agreements can be signed at a
summit on nuclear security scheduled to take place in Moscow
this March.

SCHOLARS QUESTION CLAIM OF A MAJOR LUTHER DISCOVERY

Readers who can't resist the urge to write in books might be
the bane of librarians' lives, unless, of course, the reader in
question happens to be a major historical figure. If, as some
scholars believe, recently discovered notations in a bible came
from the pen of Martin Luther, the Wuerttemberg State Library,
Stuttgart, will be able to boast of a unique treasure. If, as
others maintain, the marginalia was written by a follower of
Luther's, the library is left with an old book containing old
notes of interest to only a small circle of specialists.
In late November, a researcher named Manuel Santos Noya
announced he had discovered extensive comments in Luther's hand
in a copy of the Vulgate bible, that is, in a copy of the Latin
version of the bible that was considered the authoritative text
of the scriptures in Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages.
Santos Noya argued that the copy of the Vulgate he found in the
Wuerttemberg State Library was the copy Luther had used in
preparing his German translation of the bible. That translation
is widely credited with having played a decisive role in the
development of modern written German, much as the "King James"
translation influenced English prose. If Santos Noya is
correct, the marginal comments he found could throw new light
on Luther's thinking as he prepared his translation and thus
upon an epochal event in German cultural history.
Other scholars have been quick to point to weak points in
Santos Noya's case. Professor Ulrich Bubenheimer of the
University of Heidelberg (Baden-Wuerttemberg), a theologian who
is regarded an authority on sixteenth-century handwriting,
agreed that the marginalia Santos Noya found is written in a
hand that shows many similarities to Luther's, but also many
differences, especially in the way Greek and Hebrew characters
are written. According to Bubenheimer, it was not unusual for
students in the sixteenth century to pattern their handwriting
upon their teachers. Luther's close collaborator Philipp
Melanchthon (1497-1560), he notes by way of example, wrote in a
hand that resembled Luther's.
Bubenheimer and other Luther scholars have underscored
additional  evidence that similarly points to a follower of
Luther rather than Luther himself as the annotator of the
Stuttgart bible. Some one wrote the date January 28,1528 at the
beginning of the text and November 14, 1528 at the end,
suggesting that the annotations were written during that
eleven-month period. Luther, on the other hand, did his
translation of the New Testment in 1521-1522. The annotator
also cites Luther's writings and mentions Luther by name or by
his initials when he does so; Luther is not known to have
followed such a practice. Finally, the initials IW are written
at the end of the text. Bubenheimer and like-minded scholars
suspect that they refer to the owner of the bible who made the
disputed annotations.

KOHL REIGNS SUPREME IN EDITIONAL CARTOONS

The figures are in, and now there's no disputing Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's political stature. An inventory of 110 daily and
weekly newspapers, the German Press Agency (dpa) reports, has
determined that the chancellor was far and away the country's
most frequently caricatured political personality during 1995.
His distinctively well-fed figure - no doubt a godsend to
cartoonists - appeared in a total of 1,127 editorial cartoons,
more than twice as many as the runner-up, Federal Minister of
Finance Theo Waigel (CDU). Waigel's luxuriant eyebrows turned
up in just under 500 cartoons, making them about as well known
to newspaper readers as his unceasing efforts to trim the
federal budget. Lest anyone think Germany's cartoonists unduly
partisan, Rudolf Scharping, until November the national leader
of the opposition Social Democrats, came in a close Third
behind Waigel.

HONGKONG DIARY: At this delicate point in Hong Kong's history, there are
strongarguments for favouring an experienced and well-respected legal
figure: A Suitable Candidate 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.64

WE welcome the entry of Simon Li Fook-sean as a candidate for Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Indeed,
we would suggest that, of the candidates who have presented
themselves, he appears to have the best combination of the
qualities that will be required for this onerous and responsible
position.

Perhaps we should first define those qualities. The CE should -
obviously - be a person of probity and acumen who has distinguished
himself in the eyes of his profession and has a respected standing
in the community.

The successful candidate must also go into this election well aware
that the position aspired to is no sinecure. It will be a taxing,
arduous job, made more difficult by the fact that there will be no
clear precedents to guide him, and any number of carping critics
willing to damn his actions and question his motives.

No doubt, even as we write, the knives are being sharpened by
various factions. The CE's every move will be closely monitored by
the media - both local reporters and the thousands who are expected
to swarm in for next year's ceremony - by the people of Hong Kong,
and by all those on the mainland who have the territory's interests
at heart.

We would also suggest that the person filling the CE position
should be someone of maturity, experienced in the ways of the
world, impervious to flattery and who has attained some distance
from the transitory tug of ego.

While virtually every successful person in Hong Kong has business
interests, the successful candidate should be someone who is
clearly not active in the business community, or likely to return
to an active role at some later date.

Trust: It goes without saying that the first CE of the SAR must be
acceptable to and trusted by Beijing. China reposes great faith in
the people of Hong Kong - after all, the SAR will have a far
greater degree of autonomy than any other territory in China. We
believe that the Beijing leadership will abide by its pledge that
Hong Kong people will rule Hong Kong.

But Hong Kong has been harmed by the tenure of its last colonial
governor. It is now obvious that Chris Patten was sent here by
Britain to perform a PR job for international consumption, whilst
knowing all the while that none of his political manouevrings stood
the slightest chance of ever being allowed to carry through beyond
the transition.

Nonetheless, Patten's machinations have left Beijing deeply
suspicious as to what seeds may have been sown by the outgoing
British administration in Hong Kong's politically green soil. The
CE will have to be someone capable of sniffing out any unexploded
bombs left behind by the outgoing colonial power.

But the first CE must also be someone who enjoys the wholehearted
trust of the people of Hong Kong. He should be someone who was born
here and whose roots are firmly embedded in the territory. To be
the first CE of the SAR will be a lonely job. It is not a job for
the weak, nor one for someone who would seek to appease Hong Kong's
new sovereign.

Conciliation is generally much to be preferred to confrontation at
such a sensitive time and it is in everyone's interest that we
abandon the short-sighted discord that has been an unfortunate
feature of so much of the transition.

But the CE must also be prepared to stand up and be counted upon by
the people of Hong Kong to defend the valid interests of the SAR
within China. He must be someone who is well-versed in the Basic
Law and is adequately prepared to maintain the rule of law that
underpins the territory's prosperity.

Simon Li has enjoyed a respected career in the legal profession,
ending up with his appointment as Vice-President of the Court of
Appeals in 1984 before his retirement in 1987. He maintains a
directorship of the Bank of East Asia, in which his family has
interests. However, while some of his activities post-retirement
have focused on community involvements such as the Society for
Homes for the Handicapped, educational matters and his honorary
stewardship of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, much of his energy
has been devoted to working for a successful transition.

Beginning in 1985 with his appointment to the Basic Law Drafting
Committee, and more recently with his heavy involvement with the
Preparatory Committee, of which he is a Deputy-Director, Li has
developed an intimate knowledge of the details of transition.

He evidently enjoys the respect of and a personal relationship with
senior leaders. But he brings to his candidacy something arguably
more important: a detailed understanding of Hong Kong's legal
system and the Basic Law, and an irreproachable reputation as a
judge.

On a personal note, within his own family he has a lawyer son in
London and another son who is an international news editor with the
Los Angeles Time. His daughter, as head of the Bar Association, is
both respected and a well-known critic of some of Beijing's
actions. Nobody could accuse Simon Li of being out of touch with
sceptics both within and outside Hong Kong.

All those who have put themselves forward for scrutiny in this
unprecedented process deserve our respect. There are those who
argue that, as a financial centre, a businessmen should be the
first CE. We would argue that at this delicate point in Hong Kong's
history, there are strong arguments for favouring an experienced
and well-respected legal figure.

COMMENTARY: SPECULATOR'S DIARY: An Ode to the Market 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By PUNDIT, P.61

ARE you a bull or are you a bear?/ Bet against Hong Kong only if
you dare./ 1997 is the year when greed does battle over fear./ The
voice of the bear growls but a thought: /Sell this market, it's far
too overbought!/ 1997 marks Hong Kong's demise./ Under China's
rule, should this come as a surprise?/ The voice of the bull
replies in disdain:/ "Listen investor, there is much more to
gain."/ 1997 is the Gala Ball's start - Hong Kong's celebration -
you must buy to take part!/ So, are you a bull or are you a bear?/
1997 - We are almost there.

Bethany Chan, Worldsec International

UNANIMITY of opinion is the biggest single danger for investors.
Let enough people say there are too few hotel rooms in Bali, or
that there is a glut of oil in the world, and you can be sure that
glum Indonesian hoteliers will soon be slashing room rates, and
airline profits will nose-dive on the soaring cost of aviation
fuel.

The commodity everybody tips to be in short supply is shares in
Hong Kong companies. Pundit's friend Fergy the fund manager says:
"We are all throwing money at the place. Interest rates are stable,
profits will soon jump, politics look great, the dollar is fine. If
Wall Street goes up that is good, if it goes down, that is also
good - more US money will come here. If you absolutely put my feet
to the fire, I might risk a few bob in Malaysia, otherwise this is
the spot. Can't think why I didn't buy when it was cheap."

For every buyer there is a seller. Carlton Poon and his research
team at Worldsec International have just carried out a reality
check on the Hong Kong bourse as the Hang Seng Index hovers around
12,500. They summarize the sell case thus:

 By historic standards the market is not cheap selling at around 14
times earnings.

The p/e discount relative to other regional markets has narrowed,
and the risk-reward balance has become unfavourable in view of the
uncertainties that prevail.

 Valuations here are stretched and profits growth will not be fast
enough to underwrite current prices. Earnings quality could well
deteriorate and earnings per share are vulnerable to equity-fund
raising.

 Wild cards that could trigger a catastrophic fall in the market
include speculation against the Hong Kong dollar, China's reactions
to any demonstrations against the government in Hong Kong,
corruption and breakdown of the legal system, large-scale illegal
immigration from China,

 Loss of competitiveness, due to most expensive property prices in
the world. Labour costs high and skilled workers in short supply.
Ports losing business to China and elsewhere and territory's
position as a financial centre under threat from Singapore and
eventually Taipei and Shanghai.

Worldsec ticks off the buy case:

 The market is cheap because the political discount imposed by
Margaret Thatcher's 1983 visit to Beijing will narrow or disappear.
That paves the way for an upwards re-rating of the market closer to
the valuation of other Asian markets;

 Hong Kong economic growth is expected to accelerate in 1997 aided
by a recovery in spending. The momentum will be maintained an
upturn in the China economy;

 Potential reward outweighs the risks of investing in the PRC. Hong
Kong was midwife to the emergence of China in the world economy and
will play an important and profitable future role in nurturing
growth;

 Structural change in the territory from manufacturing base to
service centre is a major plus.

Worldsec has been consistently positive on Hong Kong equities. In
July 1995 it was the first broker to forecast 20,000 for the Hang
Seng Index. The house remains bullish, particularly on the
political re-rating argument. It has fed the bull and bear factors
into a model which produces a Hang Seng Index down to 9,054 at the
end of 1997 on a worst-case scenario and throws up a best-case
target of 16,847 over the same time frame.

We are taking a modest punt in the shares of Asia Securities. The
company was at one time under the stewardship of Australian tycoon
Bill Wyllie and the Lau Brothers. It is now China controlled and
has a major stake in a number of Beijing real-estate projects. One
of these is very close to the Imperial Palace and is planned as the
heart of the Beijing financial district. The project is 60 per cent
owned by Asia Securities and 40 per cent by Beijing Huayan which is
in turn controlled by upcoming IPO China Resources Beijing Land. We
have bought 50,000 Asia Securities at $2.275. To raise a little
cash, out go half the long-term holding in Fountain Set, where the
performance has been boring.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Tourism Receipts Rising 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

HONG KONG'S earnings from tourism jumped 17.6 per cent in the first
six months of this year to $40.9 billion on a 15.8 per cent
increase in visitors to the territory over the same period last
year. The Hong Tourist Association is forecasting a record $85
billion in earnings from tourism for 1996 as a whole.

Among the 6.44 million visitors in the first six months, north
Asians were the biggest spender, splashing out $9.3 billion, up
37.6 per cent year-on-year, followed by mainlanders, who spent $7.9
billion, up 20.8 per cent.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Hold Your Horsepower 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

WAIT. It may not be over. Scarcely had shareholders in Cepa
finished counting their winnings from the $18.50 a share takeover
bid from Atlanta-based Southern Power, than another possible
counter-bidder emerged.

Typically, the news broke in the press first. Confirmation came
yesterday from Hopewell chief Gordon Wu who said the company had
received "an approach from one third party for the possible
acquisition of a controlling interest in Cepa." His statement
added: "The board would like to emphasize that no offer or formal
proposal has been received from an independent third party."
Investors were advised to tread with caution.

The news sparked heavy trading in Cepa on the stock market where
8.3 million shares changed hands at prices up to $18.10. The price
slipped back to be 10 cents up by the close, at $17.95, with
traders disinclined to believe a takeover battle will break out
over Cepa.

The current discount to the bid price represents the time it would
take to get the takeover cash, together with the slim chance that
stockholders will vote to reject the offer. A spokesman for
Southern in Hong Kong said the company had no comment to make other
than to say it was hopeful that its agreement to acquire control of
Cepa would go through.

CHINA's export boom has forced the organizers of the Guangzhou fair
to move the event to a bigger location. Trade officials say this
week's autumn session of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair could
have attracted some 200,000 exhibitors, but had room for only 6,000
booths.

The new arena will be triple the size of the existing venue with at
least 500,000 square metres of floor space, vice-minister of

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: ADB Approved 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

ASIAN Development Bank is set to become the first foreign bank to
buy into one of China's state-controlled commercial banks by taking
a three to five per cent stake in Everbright Bank of China. The
deal has already been approved by the People's Bank of China.

Chinese regulations permit foreign investors to buy up to 10 per
cent of a Chinese financial institution and sources say ADB has
been encouraged by the central bank to buy into Everbright. Founded
in 1992, Everbright is a subsidiary of state conglomerate China
Everbright Group and had net assets worth 1.68 billion yuan as of
the end of last year. ADB's investment is part of a share
restructuring plan Everbright is conducting to increase its assets
to about 4 billion yuan. The Chinese bank has also said that it
plans to list at some point in the future and increase its branch
network on the mainland from seven to 15-17 outlets within a few
years.

Manila-based ADB, which provides loans for emerging Asian
economies, is a member of a bank consortium that holds a 25 per
cent stake in Xiamen International Bank, a joint venture. It is
also buying into three small Indian banks. Neither ADB nor
Everbright officials would disclose the size of its latest
investment.

P.60

RICHARD Li's Singapore-listed Pacific Century Regional Developments
is taking an 85 per cent interest in a 400 acre township
development project in Huangjinwei Farm near Guangzhou.

The farm is currently owned by Hua Ken Industry and Commerce Co, a
state-owned enterprise of the municipal government and the Chinese
joint-venture partner. The farm will become a large residential
community over three years with construction beginning at the end
of this year.

Phase one of the project has an estimated cost of 400 million yuan.
The project is expected to develop 2 million sq ft of low cost
housing on 21 acres of land, 13 kilometres north of Guangzhou.

A Pacific spokesman says the group's other China project, a
building related to the mass transit project in Beijing is still on
hold because the site has not been delivered. Pacific Century is
engaged in an office-commercial-residential development in Bombay
and the construction and operation of a power plant in Gaoyao,
Guangdong province.

COMMENTARY: AROUND THE SQUARE: No Ifs or Butts 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By MALCOLM SURRY, P.59

COUNSEL for industrialist Leung Wah-chai, who was found guilty of
insider trading this week, asked the Insider Dealing Tribunal to go
easy on his client because he was "an honorary citizen in China."
Leung and his sister-in-law Butt Chin-han were found to have used a
network of offshore companies to unload more than 12 million shares
in audio-cassette maker Yanion International Holdings in May 1993 -
directly in front of news of a profits crash.

Lawyer Terry Poon asked the tribunal not to impose a ban of more
than six months on Leung being a company director because it was
vital that he be at the helm of Yanion through the 1997 handover.
He said Leung ran 78 enterprises employing 3,000 people in the PRC.

During the hearing Leung - whose assets have been put in excess of
$180 million- blamed bad legal advice he had received about share
trading regulations. He noted that he was educated to primary six
in China and had only one-year English schooling in Hong Kong.

This is not the first time Leung seems to have received bad advice.
Leung and Madam Butt were discovered to have carried out improper
dealings in Yanion through an offshore vehicle back at the time of
the public listing in 1991. SFC investigators found that a shell
company in the British Virgin Islands had been used to funnel $108
million for initial subscription and $31.5 million for share
trading to support the price in the first few days after the
flotation. This activity helped conceal the fact that less than the
statutory 25 per cent of Yanion's capital was in the hands of
genuine minority shareholders.

Yanion was one of half a dozen companies named in the scandal
involving the Standard Chartered Asia investment bank. It was found
that the then stockbroking arm of Standard Chartered had advanced
substantial sums of money to major shareholders and their nominees
in companies going public. The facilities were used to artificially
inflate the oversubscription level and to manipulate the market in
the shares when they commenced trading.

Leung and his sister-in-law, along with another director Leung Tai-
shing, were publicly censured by the stock exchange in December
1994 for the 1991 dealings. It would appear that Leung has been
skating on thin ice for some time.

There are those who would put a political spin on the mitigation
argument put forward in the Yanion case. I do not see it that way.
Certainly his counsel gilded the lily by suggesting his client was
"revered" in China. But he was entitled to raise Leung's position
in the business community and the fact that he is apparently a
substantial employer. Since the majority of Hong Kong companies
have investments in the PRC, and cross-border commercial
transactions have become the norm, insider dealing cases are as
likely to have a China connection than not. Politics are
irrelevant.

In fact a case has just started in which it is alleged that
Taiwanese businessman Hwang Chou-shiuan bought shares in the
Parkview property group in Hong Kong in the hope of making a profit
from his knowledge that China International United Petroleum and
Chemical Co was buying a big chunk of the company.

The tribunal will hand down its penalty decision in the Yanion
matter next week. Leung faces having to cough up some $4.35 million
- three times the amount of the loss he was judged to have avoided
by dumping shares. Imposition of the maximum five-year embargo from
being a company director would put him in the same category as
maestro fraudster George Tan. That might be a bit over the top.

I have no idea how prevalent insider dealing is on China's domestic
stock markets. What I do know is that Beijing securities regulators
take a very dim view of the practice. When they eventually codify
national laws for malpractice, the penalties are likely to be
severe. Hong Kong share manipulators might well have cause to
congratulate themselves that their transgressions are dealt with on
this side of the border.

WE HAVE not heard much lately about the mooted second board for
small companies in Hong Kong. The perhaps more innovative Kuala
Lumpur exchange hung out its shingle for speculative companies,
capitalized as small as US$2 million, nearly three years ago. The
KLSE second board index has doubled to 620 this year and tripled
since 1994.

Jardine Fleming tut-tuts over this in its latest unit trust
newsletter and describes the speculative little market as a "death
trap." That is perhaps going a bit far. The relatively meaningless
price/earnings ratio stands at 420, and recent Bank Negra action to
raise deposit levels for margin trading will no doubt hose things
down.

Jardine Fleming says "highly unprofitable" small Malaysian
companies have raised $1 billion on the "rumour-led" market this
year. No doubt many of these companies will disappear up the
Swanee, and the management of some may be probity-challenged.

At least the little bourse provides a venture capital avenue
somewhat lacking in Hong Kong. The banks here would require your
first-born child as collateral before lending money to back a smart
idea. The stock exchange requires a three-year profit track record
from IPOs, and it only seems to grant a waiver to China
infrastructure companies. Knocking on the door of the Nasdaq market
in the US is not yet a proven route to riches for Hong Kong
players.

That leaves the extended Chinese family as the source for raising
capital for a new business - if Uncle Chan-wah is tapped out this
year, tough luck.

Not withstanding all this, I find it hard to support the notion of
a nursery for corporate toddlers in the territory. Having seen what
the manipulators can do with the first board, the blood runs cold
imagining what they might do with a second.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: CATERING: Harry Ramsden's May Bring Batter to
Beijing: Move into China mooted for chippie group 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From PETER MOSLEY in London, P.57-58

ENCOURAGED by the success of its Hong Kong restaurant, Harry
Ramsden's, the up-market fish-and-chips group, is planning to
expand into China next year.

Executive Chairman John Barnes says he is looking to open two or
three outlets there within two years and is considering Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou.

"Next year seems a marvellous time to expand out of Hong Kong into
China," he says.

Window has also learned that Harry Ramsden's has put in a bid for a
restaurant site at Chep Lap Kok airport, which it will operate as a
joint venture. This would be its second Hong Kong restaurant,
building on the success of the first one in Queen's Road East,
which is one of the most profitable in the group.

Its partner would probably be Compass Group, with which it already
operates a Harry Ramsden's at Heathrow airport, London.

Details of the proposed move into China are still being worked out,
says a spokesman for the group. They form part of an outside
feasibility study now nearing completion for a broad expansion at
home and abroad, heady stuff for a group that has grown from a dour
back street in a Yorkshire town to see its shares riding high on
the London Stock Exchange.

For Barnes, it just goes to show that what used to be thought of as
a very British acquired taste can tickle palates around the world.
He is sure that fish-and-chips will soon be as international as
hamburgers, pizza or sweet-and-sour pork.

Barnes is untroubled by any fears that Chinese officialdom might
view the advance of a British fish-and-chips chain as gastronomic
neo-colonialism, and put up obstacles.

"The Chinese love Western brand names," he says.

Besides that, Chinese diners rather like a touch of opulence - and
Harry Ramsden's, its trademark chandeliers, white tablecloths and
waiters belying the traditionally working-class fare of fish-and-
chips, is certainly posh, if not opulent.

"The restaurant in Hong Kong has been a huge success and it is
logical that we should capitalize on that," says Barnes.

At first, most of the customers in Hong Kong were expatriates.
These days, though, Chinese customers outnumber them three-to-one,
even though the menu holds only one rice dish.

New dish: Although fish-and chips is generally ranked with roast
beef and Yorkshire pudding as a classic British national dish the
combination is, in fact, relatively new.

Fried fish appears to have made its public debut as a convenience
food back in the London of the 1830s, at about the same time Queen
Victoria ascended the throne and the British Empire was stretching
its muscles around the world.

But according to Frying Tonight, a history of fish and chips, whose
unlikely author was the late BBC Religious Affairs correspondent
Gerald Priestland, chips did not appear until 50 years later when
Britain started importing deep-fryers from France.

For long years after that, until 1940, the throat-catching odour
from corner fish-and-chip shops, or "chippies" - also known in the
North of England as "chip oils" - caused their operation to be
officially designated "an offensive trade," along with blood-
boilers and gut-scrapers, respectively selling black sausage and
tripe-and-onions.

The pungent pong arose from undeodorized fats and cooking oils
bubbling away at often dangerously high temperatures (fish is best
deep-fried in beef dripping at about 200 C; the dripping catches
fire at 225 C.)

To stop the fish becoming fat-soaked it is first dipped in batter,
which also enhances the flavour and texture. Some fish-and-chip
shops claim to use special secret-ingredient batters like Colonel
Sanders' Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe.

Others, like Harry Ramsden's, put it all down to the freshness of
the fish and the quality of the potatoes.

British officialdom's disdain for fish-and-chips was abandoned at
the start of World War II when it was realized that here was a
wholesome, high-energy and relatively cheap dish, using local
resources and very suitable for consumption by a workforce whose
general health was vital to the success of the war effort.

Popular: The munching masses, anyway, had always ignored such
questions of image and continued to queue nightly to buy fish-and-
chips, smothered in salt and vinegar to kill the grease and wrapped
unhygienically in smudgy old newspaper.

This wrapping practice is a thing of the past since Britain entered
the squeaky-clean European Union. The bureaucrats in Brussels threw
up their hands (or maybe just threw up) at the idea of anyone
eating cod coated in printer's ink.

These days, many fish-and-chips shops in Britain are run by ethnic
minorities, including Chinese. The product is as popular as ever
despite its high calorie-count and the challenges of hamburgers,
fried chicken, Indian and Chinese foods, and pizza outlets which
have gobbled up large chunks of the mass market.

Few of today's "chippies" fry in the traditional beef dripping -
vegetable oil is cheaper and easier to manage, even though it lacks
the flavour.

But Harry Ramsden's has stuck with beef dripping. With fears of BSE
("mad cow disease") crossing from the bovine to the human
population, however, it has started importing dripping from Ireland
and Holland.

Harry Ramden's first restaurant opened in a back street of
Guiseley, near Leeds in Yorkshire, in 1929 and down the years
became a Mecca for lovers of succulent, fresh fish-and-chips.

On Saturday nights after the pubs closed Harry Ramsden would still
be frying well past midnight.

Today Harry's son, also Harry, aged 72, is a only a shareholder but
acts as a "travelling ambassador" for the group, which has 15
restaurants in major British cities. The notable and frustrating
exception is London; each time they find the right site in the
capital, someone else comes along and grabs it first.

Hong Kong is not the only overseas outlet. There are Harry Ramden's
in Tenerife, Dublin and Melbourne, too, all places that can boast a
British community or heritage.

Barnes thinks he might open 25 new restaurants in Britain by 2001,
possibly as franchises but with the group holding at least a 50 per
cent stake.

He is also contemplating sites in the Middle East, including
Jeddah, and would like to move into South Africa and New Zealand.

It was the brave flotation on the London Stock Exchange in 1989
that provided the funding and impetus for Harry Ramden's expansion.
It also won huge publicity for the group - which still had only one
shop at the time but was thinking big.

Since then, turnover and profits have risen on average by 20 per
cent a year.

This week shares in Harry Ramsden, launched at 100 pence (HK$12.34)
seven years ago, were trading at 375p after a high of 438p earlier
in the year. Market capitalization has risen from 4 million at
launch to more than 40 million.

Much of the success is down to (Michael) John Barnes, a man in
total contrast to the firm's late founder. At 47, and with a smile
as broad and gleaming as Labour leader Tony Blair's, he is the very
model of a modern chief executive.

When he took over Harry Ramsden's in 1988 via a new start-up
company, Barnes already had experience as a brand manager with
Procter and Gamble and had also worked for International Playtex
and PepsiCo and as managing director of the British end of Kentucky
Fried Chicken.

He has now led the company through seven years of consistent
earnings and earnings-per-share growth under the banner "The
World's Most Famous Fish and Chips." All has not been entirely
rosy, however.

Demand for fish-and-chips tends to be seasonal and was hit by the
hot summer in the UK last year, while margins in associated joint-
venture companies were trimmed by sharp increases in potato prices.

But the group has ventured out into instant fish-and-chip products
sold in supermarkets, and a joint venture to create a chain of
fish-and-chip takeaways under the Henry Higgins brand.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: REGION: Exports Stifled by World-Wide Malaise:
US slowdown affects Asian foreign trade 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By SUSAN FENTON, P.54-55

JAPANESE Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's re-election triumph on
Sunday may provide a much-needed boost for neighbouring Asian
exporters.

While the Liberal Democratic Party's tenuous majority initially
prompted a slide in the Japanese yen, some analysts see greater
political stability paving the way for sustainable economic
recovery in Japan that will boost demand for Asian goods and
strengthen the Japanese currency.

The yen has fallen 30 per cent in real terms against the US dollar
in the 12 months to June, making cheaper Japanese goods more
competitive vis-a-vis other Asian exports and exacerbating a slump
in the region's export performance since the start of the year.

"The year-over-year impact of depreciation has already started to
moderate and should reverse with yen strengthening expected in
1997," says Richard Ligon, an economist at UBS Securities. A
possible spending spree by Japanese consumers ahead of a planned
increase in sales tax from three per cent to five per cent in April
could also boost business for regional exporters.

The need: They certainly need it. After a boom year in 1995 that
saw nominal export growth exceed 20 per cent in most East and
Southeast Asian countries the same countries face single-digit
growth this year. South Korea, for example, will have to adjust
from 30 per cent export growth last year to 7.5 per cent this year,
to US$134.5 billion, recovering slightly to nine per cent in 1997,
predicts brokerage ING Barings.

"East Asia's surprisingly rapid deceleration of non-oil export
growth in recent months has exposed the region's continued
vulnerability to global supply/demand imbalances," says Ligon. He
doesn't foresee a real improvement until next year - helped by
accelerated growth in Europe - and then only a moderate one. "A
better picture will emerge in the second quarter of next year," he
says. "There will be a recovery, yes, but not a boom like the
levels seen in 1995."

Hindering a significant improvement in the short term is a
continued downturn in the electronics sector and recent data from
the US pointing to slower-than-expected growth in the US economy.

"The US remains the critical factor for a regional upturn in export
growth," says Barings in a report. Recent data is in line with
analysts estimates that US economic growth slowed to around two per
cent in the third quarter, down from 4.7 per cent in the second
quarter.

Barings, however, points out that there are already signs that
inventory stockpiles in the US, which have curbed import demand,
are now being depleted and renewed orders for manufacturing goods
will prompt a pick-up in imports in the final quarter of this year.
"The notable exception remains the electronics sector, which is
still undergoing consolidation and is not expected to see a marked
recovery until at least the first half of 1997," says the
brokerage.

While this is bad news for the region as a whole, Singapore, which
depends on electronics for 51 per cent of its non-oil exports, and
South Korea, where the sector accounts for 35 per cent of exports,
stand to suffer most. "Singapore and Korea have been hard hit by
the downturn in the electronics cycle and that will continue for a
few quarters," says George Leung, economic adviser at HSBC Markets.

Singapore's non-oil exports slid an unexpectedly high 6.2 per cent
year-on-year in nominal terms in September to S$7.31 billion,
following a 6.3 per cent drop in August.

Korea, which is also hardest hit by a weak yen, saw its exports
fall 8.1 per cent year-on-year in September, to US$10.1 billion.
HSBC Markets, however, says that new measures introduced by the
Finance Ministry to help cut manufacturing production costs,
including slashing domestic steel prices and reducing prices of
government land for factories, should in the longer term help make
exports more competitive.

The impact of the downturn in the electronics sector, largely the
result of excess inventory build-up in the US, is now being felt by
Malaysia as easing demand spreads beyond D-RAM prices to
peripherals and related industries.

The electronic components industry, much of it shifted from higher
cost Singapore, generates 27 per cent of Malaysia's non-oil exports
and has helped it consistently achieve export growth of between 17
and 26 per cent over the past three years. The slowdown this year,
will result in a meagre 9.1 per cent increase in Malaysian exports,
to $80.8 billion, and 10.5 per cent next year.

Good for some: In contrast, the outlook for the Philippines is
promising. Analysts generally agree that it is set to produce the
strongest export performance in Southeast Asia this year, on 15.8
per cent growth to $20.1 billion according to Barings, and in 1997,
on 16 per cent growth. "As the Philippines produces very low-tech
products such as consumer electronics like television sets and
radios, it suffers little impact from a downturn in the cycle,"
says Leung. Growth rates are still well down from last year's peak
of 29 per cent, though, partly because of year-on-year declines in
sales of traditional exports like textiles, coconut oil and
footwear.

The only other country in the region expected to post double-digit
export growth this year is Indonesia, with Barings forecasting an
11.4 per cent increase in exports to $50.6 billion.

Indonesia is something of the odd-one-out among East and Southeast
Asian nations, as the only one not to enjoy an export boom last
year nor suffer a slump this year - mainly because its exports are
raw materials, making it less exposed to the global business cycle.
"In that sense, Indonesia's backwardness has been a help," says
Dominique Maire of UBS Securities in Singapore.

If that is the case, does it follow that as Asian nations are
moving into increasingly sophisticated areas of manufacturing,
export growth of 25-30 per cent a year is a thing of the past?

Not necessarily, says Ligon. "The era of export-led growth in East
Asia is not over, but it is changing," he says.

Increasing competition from lower-cost countries means erstwhile
sources of cheap labour like Thailand and Indonesia are having to
shift to producing higher value-added goods in the way that Hong
Kong and Singapore did before them. But that is not automatically
depressing their export performance. Indonesia, which has started
to reduce its dependence on textiles and plywood by producing raw
material-based but value-added products, is enjoying a mini boom,
doubling sales of paper products this year and increasing exports
of industrial chemicals by more than 50 per cent and glass and
ceramics by more than 20 per cent. The Malaysian Government is
promoting investment in the more cyclical hi-tech sector.

Thailand, however, has yet to make the switch. "The most worrying
country is Thailand," says Maire. "It has had the worst export
slump and requires investment in higher-value added products
because it is losing its lower cost competitiveness." HSBC Markets
adds that it also needs to invest in human resources, including
comprehensive training programmes, to boost export competitiveness.
"The government has also pledged that it will focus on enhancing
Thailand's export competitiveness by cutting tariffs for imports
and on raw materials for export-oriented products," says HSBC.

"It will, however, take a long time before these measures come into
effect." Barings sees

Thai export growth plunging to a meagre 5.2 per cent this year, to
$58.4 billion, from 23.6 per cent last year.

"Until evidence of an export turnaround is apparent, Thailand will
remain the lacklustre story of Asean," says Barings. Asean
comprises Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Like its neighbours, however, Thailand still stands to benefit from
rapidly expanding demand for exports from within Asia itself. "The
manufacturing boom owes much to Japanese investment, which has
facilitated the growth of intra-regional trade," says Ligon.

He notes that intra-Asean trade, for example, accounted for about a
fifth of Southeast Asian exports over the past three years, but
contributed more than a quarter of total growth.

Last year's export peak and this year's slump were both cyclical,
triggered by weak global demand, says Ligon. "Strong foreign direct
investment flows supporting manufacturing growth have not subsided,
and export growth is now coming chiefly from within the Asian
region," he says.

"These factors will provide a substantial cushion to Asian
exporters as they contend with rising costs and new competition."

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TAXATION: Tax Reforms Take Toll On PRC
Companies: Revenue men get more efficient 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By TIM WILSON, P.53

THEY were down but never out, and now they are clawing their way
back. China's central tax returns have been rising consistently
since the tax system underwent a major revamp in 1994. No more the
wilting remittances that shrank the tax revenue from 35 per cent of
GDP in 1979 to 15 per cent in 1993. Last week the central
government released the figures for the industrial and commercial
receipts for the first nine months of this year. They are up again
- by 20 per cent. And this comes at a time when the economy is
supposed to have slowed down.

According to the figures, 249.8 billion yuan went into central
government coffers for the period from January to September - a
year-on-year rise of 19.6 per cent. And local governments raised
203.1 billion, 22.9 per cent more than this time last year.
Although the Chinese economy has grown at a rate only slightly
below this, the increase, say analysts, is largely attributable to
the reforms of two years ago - and it is a measure of their
success. "Since 1994, the policy framework has been set," says Qu
Hong Bing of UBS Securities, "but in terms of implementation, it's
a gradual process." The effects of this mean different things to
different people.

Networking: The process has involved the setting up of a national
tax collection network. Prior to the reform, provinces submitted
tax, which they collected, on a contractual basis. Since then, the
various taxes, and the responsibility for collecting them, have
been divided up between local and national collection agencies. To
achieve this, local bureaus were effectively split in half to
accommodate the new national ones. It is a change which presented
many logistical difficulties, not least of which was the job of
recruiting and training a large intake of staff. This took time, as
has the task of delineating more clearly the roles of the national
and local bureaus.

But the reforms are taking hold. Add to this the fact that the
government has been taking serious steps to chase up tax evaders
and to put an end to the contractual arrangements that have tended
to operate between individual companies and local tax bureaus, and
you have a situation where the fiscal net is noticeably tightening.

The central government will be gratified to have rationalized the
tax system, and to have ensured itself a more reliable source of
income with which to make a dent in the budget deficit, which came
in at 66 billion yuan last year. There is still the nagging problem
of intergovernmental transfers, however, which means that the
centre is obliged to give up the bulk of its receipts to subsidize
poorer provinces. But overall the indicators are favourable.

Nonetheless, if central and local governments are increasing their
revenue, it does mean that somebody else is paying the price.
Although China's tax regime has been and remains low in
international terms, companies in the country have been finding
themselves saddled with new and larger bills. Firms are getting
away with less, and this has had its own effects.

For local companies, says Chen Xingdong of Crosby Securities, it
was a contributing factor in this year's poor interim results.
"These were awful," he says, "and it is true to say that the tax
increase has been greater than economic growth. And you can add to
this that VAT is a turnover tax, not a profit tax. They pay VAT as
long as they make the product. These enterprises that are unable to
sell, still have to pay the tax." VAT was one of the cornerstones
of the reform. Nevertheless, penalizing overproducers is not
necessarily a bad thing.

Foreign woes: Foreign-invested enterprises are also getting caught
in the net. Many of them, says Tsang Shu-ki of Hong Kong's Baptist
University, were in the habit of bargaining for a lump sum tax
submission on a contractual basis. "They are under pressure to
eliminate that practice, and I know that some FIEs are complaining.
I hear that in the Pearl River Delta life is much more difficult."

And in general terms, the FIEs will be contributing an increasing
proportion to government coffers, not only because the collection
process is being revamped. The drop in the rate of VAT refund for
exporters - it stood at 17 per cent in the middle of last year and
now stands at nine - would not feature on these tax returns
announced by the government, for the simple reason that it
qualifies as an expenditure. Nor, as yet, will the ending of duty-
free machinery imports, which does not really take effect until the
grace period ends in December of this year. But both of these will
have significant consequences both for government revenue and
company burdens.

A recent report by the Economist Intelligence Unit argued that
these new measures were also playing a big role in keeping property
prices down. The higher costs of doing business lower net operating
incomes and hence market values. And this phenomenon is worsened by
the government's success at controlling inflation, to the point
where the cost of credit in the country has actually entered
positive territory.

So you have the ironic situation where improving macroeconomic and
budgetary controls - both positive signs - are actually depressing
the property market and stopping investors in their tracks. The
government urgently needs to increase revenue, but companies in
China could do without the uncertainty this brings.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: PROFILE: Strategic Advances in Financial
Marketing: Richard Tsang outlines new firm's role 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By CATHY HOLCOMBE, P.52

CREATIVE and outgoing, fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English,
PR operative Richard Tsang represents the ideal local manager for
international firms.

In an age when such firms are increasingly dependent on the
cultural and language skills of native executives, he also
represents their worst fears. For like many local directors who
learned the ropes in industries dominated by multinationals, he
broke away to found his own firm.

After building up Edelman Public Relations financial relations
team, Tsang left 15 months ago to form Strategic Financial
Relations Ltd, taking two senior account executives with him.

Strategic is one of four companies in a group representing a new,
homegrown force in political and media relations: the three others
are run respectively by politico C.K. Lo; radio personality Andy
Ho; and former Burson-Marsteller director Sam Lam, who merged with
Wendy Hughes to form a China relations counselling group.

Tsang took several senior account managers with him when he left
Edelman, but he did not storm off with a load of clients in tow.
"We only had three or four clients when we started," he says.

Following: Some of his clients have since trailed him, while others
turned to his custom-tailored services to handle new listings.
Besides special projects work, these days Strategic has 17 retainer
clients, mostly small and medium-sized companies that count on
Tsang's team to do everything from clipping newspaper articles to
writing annual reports, to arranging road shows or media tours.

The most important role Tsang plays is in making sure his clients
have investor followings.

If you're not a blue chip, it can be hard to get attention in Hong
Kong's family of nearly 500 listed companies. All his clients,
whether they've seen their share price fall or rise in the last
year, have healthy followings by local brokerage houses. Two of
them, leather trader Dah Hwa Holdings and plastics maker Ngai Hing
Hong, enjoyed share price growth of more than 500 per cent last
year.

"We don't tell people how to invest. We help people meet," the
energetic Tsang explains from his sunny office in Admiralty Centre.
"For low-profile, smaller companies, they may not know how to find
the fund managers and  analysts."

He points to the example of tissue paper maker Dransfield. Analysts
had a hard time getting too excited about the company that makes
tissue on behalf of Tempo, those packets snatched up for just over
$2 at any newsstand or kiosk.

But the company had plans to create its own brand. Tsang put
executives in touch with analysts who decided such a move was worth
funding and a Nasdaq placement was made, raising money as well as
exciting movement in the company's shares.

"You've got to feed [analysts] as much information as possible,"
explains Tsang. "And get them out for visits whenever possible."

Lively and loquacious, there are few subjects Tsang will not hold
court on. He is bashful in one area, however. Asked his age, Tsang
pauses before revealing the figure with a shy laugh: he is 30 years
old, a fact generally greeted with gasps of surprise.

"People guess I'm something like 38," Tsang says. "I remember all
those nights I never left the office until midnight. I say even if
[chronologically] I'm 30, I'm equal to a 38-year-old in work
years."

Tsang is the epitome of a generation which came of age at a time
when the price tag for the skills of locals began to match and then
overtake demand for expatriate talent.

He moved quickly up the career ladder at Burson-Marsteller, his
second place of employment after earning a communications degree
from the Chinese University, and later held a lead position at
Edelman.

A little serendipity also didn't hurt his advancement. When Tsang
was first transferred to Burson-Marsteller's financial relations
team in 1990, the ho-hum department had few business-specialist
media or even brokerages to whom it could disseminate company
profiles. But within three years IPO fever had gripped the local
bourse, brokerages were flooding the territory and local papers
were spawning expanded financial sections.

Today he has a data base of between 2,000 and 3,000 brokers,
bankers and media contacts. Most of his senior account executives
come not from a PR background, but from brokerages and banks.

Tsang waves away suggestions that breakaways by crucial local
executives are international firms' worst nightmares these days.

"It's not like the whole company left with me," he says. He simply
found his own little niche.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: INVESTMENT: China Tops Survey of Best Emerging
Markets: Asia heads money-spinning opportunities 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From CHRIS JASPER in London, P.50-51

A MAJOR new survey into investment opportunities in emerging
markets world-wide has rated China as the most attractive of
developing economies, with others Asian countries judged to be
among the best of the rest.

The report suggests that more than three-quarters of companies with
international operations are now investing in emerging markets as
they compete to make the most of liberal trade policies adopted
following the demise of state-controlled economies.

But though it evaluates where the greatest rewards are to be had,
the study from Control Risks Group, an international political and
business risk consultancy, also highlights the problems and
concerns facing investors.

Based on 100 telephone interviews with managers specifically
responsible for their company's overseas operations, the survey
covers 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and eastern
Europe.

Leading: Asia dominates the report's top 10, with China heading the
league on a score of 7.2 out of 10 - the rating being an expression
of both the opportunities on offer and the pros and cons of the
operating environment.

Not that investment in China is a bed of roses, says the report,
suggesting that worries over the eventual succession to Deng
Xiaoping prompt concern about the time frame within which the
mainland will justify expectations.

The study also details worries about the Chinese legal system,
corruption, intellectual copyright, counterfeiting, theft, break-
ins and whether rural areas will fulfill their potential.

Yet despite the hitches, China has one unbeatable advantage: sheer
market size. With 1.2 billion inhabitants, it emerges as way ahead
of the pack in offering the most exciting opportunities for
business expansion.

"China's scale alone justifies the number-one spot," says Boris
Starling of CRG's business development department. "And were it not
for reasonably high risks, it could have scored a perfect 10."

Rating some distance behind China are three more Asian countries.
Malaysia ranks second in the survey because of confidence in its
"stable and focused political institutions" - although growth has
slowed and the economy remains  relatively small.

Third is Indonesia, with investors wowed by an impressive growth
record. CRG experts, however, express "concerns over the next
political succession" in a country where "politics and business
have been traditionally intertwined."

Next comes India, scoring points for its huge market potential and
ongoing transition to an open economy. Only continuing worries over
bureaucracy and infrastructure and the fact that it starts from a
lower base prevent India from ranking higher.

Thailand ranks sixth, "current political wobbles" not having dimmed
confidence, according to the report, although concern over wage
rates, skills and infrastructure could see some investors shift to
Vietnam.

Punctuating Asia's dominance of the top 10 are Brazil in fifth,
strong on communications, energy, infrastructure and the extractive
sector, and eastern Europe's two brightest prospects - the Czech
Republic (joint sixth and well on course for convergence with the
EU) and Poland, placed eighth despite the rise of neo-communism.

South Africa, where economic success has outlived initial euphoria
over Nelson Mandela's coming to power, stands alone in ninth, with
Argentina, Chile and the Gulf States all tied in 10th.

The most notable absentee from the upper reaches of the list is
Russia, rating only 20th, partly because of problems with organized
crime, inadequate legislation and political instability, but mainly
because of an overall failure to "turn potential into concrete
commitments."

However, Boris Yeltsin's re-election convinced 62 per cent of
respondents that opportunities would increase over the next five
years, although India rates top in this respect with fully 81 per
cent expecting an improvement.

Other Asian countries were among those which, like Russia, rated
not so highly, but were expected to offer more in the future -
predictions not always endorsed by CRG.

The authorities in Vietnam will currently allow investment only on
their terms, and the situation is likely to prevail, yet 67 per
cent of those polled thought prospects would improve, especially in
infrastructure and energy.

Burma, according to 11 per cent of respondents, will also show
improvements, but CRG warns against over-optimism. It suggests that
"blindness to the political consequences" of operating there could
leave companies open to "consumer boycotts and even lawsuits."

For Cambodia, 39 per cent of investors predicted better prospects
in five years' time, prompting CRG to caution that "there is little
evidence to suggest" it "will emerge as a productive business
environment."

Asian economics apart, respondents rated the Baltic states (53 per
cent) and some parts of the former Yugoslavia (38 per cent) as the
poor performers most likely to show improved opportunities.

The CRG's ratings and predictions are based on a survey carried out
on its behalf by the Industrial Research Bureau in June. The IRB
chose, at random, 100 of the 500 biggest companies with a presence
in Britain and operating internationally.

Sectors covered included aerospace, brewing, chemicals,
commodities, communications, construction, electricity,
engineering, food manufacturing, health, hotels, insurance, media,
metals, mines, paper, tobacco, transport and water.

Managers completed questionnaires asking them to rate the emerging
markets in which they operated in terms of opportunities and
prospects, fears and concerns, trade barriers, local partners and
other factors.

CRG collated the results, analyzed and evaluated them. The
resultant report, it says, is relevant to any business - Western or
otherwise - which has dealings in emerging markets.

Says Starling: "Our conclusions are based on the experiences of
British companies, but the rules apply across the board. I expect
the findings will be studied especially hard by people in east
Asia, who are always very careful."

The country rankings apart, the report's real value is likely to be
in pointing out the problems faced by those investing in developing
economics - and in evaluating whether common fears are real or
misplaced.

CRG head of research David Battman cites the main challenges to
such companies as "adjusting to often ambiguous business and
political environments, and combating problems of corruption and
organized criminal activity."

According to the survey, the greatest concerns of respondents are
political stability and the security situation. But CRG claims that
the security threat is often overestimated and "can be managed,"
whereas the degree of political instability is "crucial."

Environmental and democracy issues are regarded as much lower
concerns, but this, says CRG, underestimates their importance, as
they can lead to global repercussions such as boycotts and
insurance withdrawals.

The report also reveals that two-thirds of investors favour a local
partnership, but that at least 37 per cent experience some kind of
serious problem with their newly established joint venture.

In Guangdong, for example, it claims that foreign executives "are
far more concerned by possible 'official' abduction on behalf of a
powerful local partner than by the greatly exaggerated threat of
kidnap by common criminals."

However, CRG asserts that though businesses are right to worry
about fraudulent activity and criminal connections when selecting
partners, they should pay more attention to their political
connections.

This was highlighted recently in Russia, it says, when a number of
companies found that their local associates went Awol as they
jockeyed for patronage prior to June's presidential elections.

On top: Control Risks is, though, keen to stress that it regards
few problems as insurmountable.

"Some surveys just look at potential," says Starling. "That means
that people get paranoid when problems emerge. But we try to
evaluate both risk and opportunity - and we are able to help when
things go wrong."

CRG's 3,500 clients in more than 130 countries can draw on any of
its four main divisions: political and security risk analysis,
which compiled the report; confidential investigation, handling
problems including fraud; security consultancy, which provides
advice and, if necessary, men on the ground; and crisis response,
which helps firms cope with emergencies such as kidnap and
extortion.

The latter role betrays CRG's origins: its original incarnation was
as an adjunct to the corporate kidnap and ransom insurance policy
at Lloyd's of London. From that four-man operation it has expanded
to 160 staff in 11 offices world-wide.

The ending of the Cold War and collapse of old power blocs has
hastened CRG's rise, with companies presented with new
opportunities and new dangers - although Starling argues that the
problems of dealing with developing nations have been exaggerated.

"People seem to think that things are more dangerous than they used
to be," he says. "But that's not necessarily the case. Very often
you're talking about dangers in countries where a few years ago
opportunities did not exist al all."

Control Risk is, for example, aiding several businesses in Algeria,
which some consider perilous, while only Bosnia and Afghanistan
have ever been declared unsafe, and then solely in times of war.

"North Korea is perhaps the last closed state in terms of
politics," adds Starling. "And people are even trying to go there."

Ironically, while CRG finds that investors often magnify problems
encountered on the ground, it concludes that they are often
alarmingly blind to bigger threats.

"The world is wide open at the moment," says Starling. "But there
is nothing to say that it won't close up somewhat again in the
future. We're already seeing the return of communist regimes in
some areas, but businessmen seem to think that the clock can never
turn back."

He adds: "Neither will companies from developed countries have it
all their own way for long. There are going to be big firms from,
for example, Russia, China and Brazil coming along, and they won't
be subject to the same constraints as today's investors."

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TECHNOLOGY: Taking the Hi-tech Road: Government
centre nurtures real-time IT research 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By BRIAN TRUSCOTT, P.48-49

FINATECH Ltd - a self-described financial engineering and risk
management company pushing the envelope on real-time information
technology - could be considered one of Hong Kong's showcase
efforts to create what many believe is a much-needed but under-
developed, hi-tech sector.

The consensus is that Hong Kong has succeeded in making the decade-
long transition from a manufacturing base to a service-oriented
centre; services now comprise 83 per cent of gross domestic
product, while manufacturing has shrunk to 9.3 per cent this year
from 20 per cent of GDP just five years ago.

A key player in this transition has been the financial sector,
although people employed in wholesale/import and export still
dominate the sector; finance and insurance make up only  about 19
per cent of Hong Kong's total services industry.

Nevertheless, if a company such as FinaTech can be given the
fiscal, managerial and networking wherewithal, then perhaps Hong
Kong can be successful in launching some semblance of a sector
dependent on hi-tech R&D.

Second centre: The 235,000 sq ft Hong Kong Industrial Technology
Centre, which the government built in 1994 in Kowloon Tong for $250
million, is the forerunner of what is to be a second technology
centre. Price tag: about $500 million for a 350,000 sq ft centre to
be operating by 1999. Chief Executive Officer Dr James Liu says
these centres will probably show how a government can "simply
create an industry."

Liu says 45 companies will have set up shop by next year, and that
the addition of a new centre means more than 100 tech-based
companies will be operating under the umbrella of the HKITC by the
end of the decade.

FinaTech is currently just one of 20 fledgling companies so far in-
house. Company founder Eric Wong hopes his firm can benefit from a
local derivatives market that could and should flourish in coming
years - given the territory's tax structure, ease of trading, it
being a strong financial community already delving into the
fledgling exotics market and, as always, its proximity to China.

And this minnow - which originally started operations in Wong's
flat - has succeeded in attracting some significant partners,
specifically Reuters. The news giant recently gave FinaTech third-
party development rights, after initially being interested in the
company's 1993 prototype, Risk Rider, a program designed to keep
track of Hang Seng Index Options.

"FinaTech is the only financial engineering firm in Hong Kong that
has joined the Reuters Application Development Programme," says
Wong. The company is now in negotiations to perhaps include the
company's increasing number of financial software applications for
risk management in conjunction with Reuters' products - a move that
would save it expensive marketing and training costs.

The initial marriage between FinaTech and the HKITC started in May
1995, a few years after Wong and partner Arthur Man started looking
for potential business niches in the territory's growth in
financial instruments - options, warrants and various other
derivatives and exotics.

He says Hong Kong's derivatives market - in a holding pattern since
the mid-1980s - has only recently started to take off, gaining
momentum since 1992 when volume and liquidity started to fuel
growth. Business looks brighter now that brokerages have benefited
from a fat year in dealing with the booming market.

Wong has surrounded himself with a number of consultants well
versed in finance, marketing, mathematics and software expertise;
unlike other traders he has worked with in the past as a trader at
Citibank, Wardley James Capel and Credit Lyonnais, his sideline
interests in software applications and writing have led him into
the field he describes as financial engineering.

Wong's oft-published commentaries in such publications as Asia Risk
and the Hong Kong Economic Times as well as his seminars and
teaching have forged contacts and business for FinaTech. His
activities have also helped fund an enterprise that has surpassed
the $5 million mark in start-up funds.

By placing himself at the heart of Hong Kong's expanding
derivatives market, he has also been instrumental in bridging the
gap between the West's sometimes opaque options market for Chinese
brokers, again by giving seminars, lectures and writing books
(Options: a Primer with Professor Raymond Chiang in 1993, for
example).

"There has been trouble in the past in finding Cantonese [and
Mandarin] speakers on the subject; I have invented many of the
financial terms in Chinese," he says, adding that language skills
have helped set up initial ties with the Shenzhen and Shanghai
markets - another fount of business opportunities in the future, he
hopes.

While a handful of those also in residence at HKITC are financial
information-based ventures, the others comprise a variety of hi-
tech enterprises. Liu expects a number of them to flourish once
their initial three-year "incubation" period is completed - after
which time, they have to leave and "enter the real world."

The director describes those 1,100 days as a sort of "MBA on the
job," as the centre ensures that the company - apart from
developing the core business - learns an array of managerial,
marketing and networking skills.

There is also seed money involved, to the tune of $1 or $2 million
initially being doled out from HKITC's $50 million annual budget.
Companies which continue to expand are earmarked for additional
capital and, finally, a concerted move to attract local or
international venture capital if a company and its business ideas
continue to attract interest.

Besides FinaTech, Liu points at other HKITC occupants for bigger
things to come - SuperLogic Communications, for example.

The company is developing FaxMail, multi-networking systems and
Internet applications. Company representatives say that computer
fax means "directly sending and receiving a facsimile through the
computer." But in a local area network, one PC must be dedicated as
the fax server and a fax card must be installed.

"The key feature is the fax LAN software which controls the
hardware," says a company spokesman. Hence, its FaxMail component
is merging fax technology with LAN technology, highly useful where
there is heavy fax traffic.

The hope is that such companies will do what traditional
manufacturing-based middlemen did for Hong Kong years ago: attract
business and technological exchange from foreign multinationals as
well as China-based companies.

Nevertheless, Liu believes Hong Kong's hi-tech development will be
unique, unlike a Taiwan, Singapore or South Korea. Research and
development, he says, fuels any hi-tech venture. Liu says Hong Kong
will be used as a managerial storefront operation: financial
strategists and policy makers located here, with most of the
labour, both R&D and production, eventually being carried out in
China, or more specifically, the Pearl River Delta.

The reason is simple. China is starting to churn out well-trained
engineers in increasing numbers; a company can hire five or six
PRC-based engineers for the price of one Hong Kong engineer. Given
that China is just 40 minutes away, Liu believes Hong Kong's
comparative advantage will ensure that the hi-tech sector continues
to grow; China's elephantine presence beside mouse-like Hong Kong
also makes a consistently compelling argument.

It's interesting to note how Wong and Liu come to the same
conclusion about why Hong Kong has only recently seen the
development of a credible hi-tech industry.

Liu says that while entrepreneurs have the drive and a fundamental
grounding in various hi-tech disciplines, the underlying focus or
initiatives did not truly exist in Hong Kong until this decade,
when the government started making fiscal overtures for the
creation of a hi-tech sector.

Liu says the networking potential, seed money and simple policy
direction instilled by the government acts as a catalyst for
businessmen wanting to enter Hong Kong's hi-tech sector.

Formula: Wong says it has taken a number of synergies, such as
software knowledge and stockbroking expertise, to create useful
real-time risk management products for market players. That
combined with what the HKITC provides - everything from cheap rent,
cost-free air conditioning, free access to seminar rooms to
international trade junkets such as the one last month to Seattle,
where the itinerary included visits to Boeing and Microsoft -
suggests a winning formula.

Liu also suggests that Hong Kong entrepreneurs remain focused on
southern China, Hong Kong's true hinterland. Currently, Hong Kong
manufacturers employ fewer than 400,000 people in the territory,
but more than 3 million in China. That disparity should continue to
grow simply because Guangdong province - as well as the potential
business from two new railroads between Hong Kong and Beijing - is
a gold mine waiting to be exploited, he says.

"And why be greedy? There's enough in the Pearl Delta for
everyone," he says, conceding that for the moment, growth in the
province looks flat. "Guangdong is like Hong Kong 10 or 15 years
ago; you have to transform yourself and you need time for that."

AROUND TOWN: Ascending the Peak on: Double 9, circa 1930 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

THE "Double Ninth" was originally the Day for Climbing the Hills,
the festival when all good Chinese believed they must visit high
places. Today, the pragmatic Cantonese combine it with the Ch'ung
Yeung - the Autumn Festival, when ancestral graves are visited,
swept clean, and offerings placed on the graves (similar to the
Ch'ing Ming Festival in the spring). In North China, the two
festivals are observed separately.

The origin of the "Climbing the Hills" festival is obscure, but is
reputed to have originated during the Han Dynasty (220 BC-224 AD),
when a virtuous scholar was advised to ascend the mountain with his
family in order to escape an impending disaster.

Visiting and attending to the graves of the departed ones is an
extension of the all-important tenet of ancestral worship, serving
also as welcome family reunions.

The photograph shows a long procession of people ascending the
Peak, on Hong Kong Island. The small building, in the centre of the
photograph, is the gatehouse of the Governor's Peak residence -the
Mountain Lodge. The gatehouse is still standing, but the Mountain
Lodge was demolished after World War II, and a public pavilion
built on its site.

Several sedan chairs can be seen in the centre, waiting for
customers, and a few can be seen ascending with the crowd. Under a
temporary cover, refreshments are being sold to the thirsty
climbers.

AROUND TOWN: CHESS 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By CHEUK BO-YAN

China did well again at the Chess Olympics (this year in Yerevan,
Armenia) although the 13th place with 32.5 points (of 114 teams) in
the men section may not satisfy everyone back home. A few poor
results in the last few rounds was almost negated by an emphatic 3-
1 win over Belarus (with Boris Gelfand) in the last round. Still,
on rating China was only placed 30 at the start of this spectacular
biennial event. The other strongest Australasian nations finished
as follows: 19th Uzbekistan (32 points), 26th Philippines, 27th
Vietnam and 28th Australia (all 31 points), 30th Kazakhstan and
39th Turkmenistan (both 30.5), while Indonesia came 44th on 29.5
points. The small number of points difference indicates the
unreasonableness of the Swiss system being used, and at the same
time the importance of scoring well in rounds 12, 13 and 14; this
is often more of a lottery than a real draw. One of the PRC men
team's finer wins occurred in round 3 against Hungary with 3-1.
They then briefly occupied first spot ahead of Cuba, and even
consolidated this next round by beating Castro's team by 2.5-1.5;
the eventual winners Russia overtook them then by a hard-fought
2.5-1.5 result in round 5. Here the two games that showed that
China are on the right track. Hungary were rated third and gold-
medal winners in 1978. Peng Xiaomin on board 3 contained Zoltan
Almasi, while Zhang Zhong on board 4 also drew with up-and-coming
17 year old GM Peter Leko (see also next week). On board 1, GM Ye
Jiangchuan is still very much improving, probably because he
currently plays from Amsterdam as his base. Here he outlasted Judit
Polgar rated 10th in the world, and the strongest female player
ever. Of course he has met her many times before. White - Polgar

his own games in his study. White - Wang Black - Portisch

AROUND TOWN: BRIDGE 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By PHILLIP ALDER, P.46

Last September, as we left a restaurant, my wife spotted the club
four on the floor by the door. (She's poetic, my wife.) When we got
home I looked in Right Through the Pack by Robert Darvas and Norman
de Villiers Hart. The deal related by the club four features
Sherlock Holmes. And, as the detective nearly said, "Come, reader,
come! The game is afoot."

West leads the spade four: five, seven, king. Declarer plays a low
diamond to dummy's jack. After winning with the queen, East
switches to the heart king. Declarer wins with the ace, cashes the
ace-king of diamonds and exits with the club four. West wins with
the ace, but South has the rest of the tricks - and 11 in all -
with the spade ace, the queen-jack of hearts and his four diamonds.
What is the contract?

Don't be misled by my auction, which reaches the right final
contract, not the one in the book.

The first deduction you should make is that diamonds are trumps.
Otherwise, after West won trick six, declarer couldn't claim four
more diamond tricks as he has no side-suit hand entry remaining.

So, is the contract five diamonds? No, because then South couldn't
afford the safety-play in diamonds, which guarantees only one trump
loser against a 4-0 split. For all he knows, West has the heart
king, and he will lose three tricks even if diamonds are 2-2 or 3-1
with a singleton queen. Could it be three diamonds? No, because
then South doesn't need the safety-play. Therefore, the contract
must be four diamonds. For the rest of the tale, buy the book.

Rossini

Peches de Vieillesse

Frederic Chiu

Harmonia Mundi France 907102

With his superlative technical facility, Chinese-American Pianist
Frederic Chiu could be a piano virtuoso of the old school. But
Rossini's Sins of Old Age and Liszt's arrangement of the overture
to William Tell are perhaps too similar in content and style to
reveal the man behind the notes.

It's not easy to convey the irony and humour of Rossini's little
indulgences for keyboard, written 30 years after he had finished
writing operas.

The composer evidently intended the 150 or so little pieces to be
frivolities, but Chiu's general demeanour tends towards the
pedantic and he adopts a kind of mock morose approach for the start
of each piece, which effectively torpedoes the music from the
outset. All seven pieces sound too similar.

Liszt's William Tell piano arrangement also misses, another
indication Chiu lacks the range to convey the symphonic original.

REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: FILM: Costner Proves A Winner on Links: Tin Cup 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

Director Ron Shelton

Starring Kevin Costner, Rene Russo, Don Johnson, Cheech Marin.

It would. seem that if you want to make a movie about sport in
Hollywood these days, you have to call Ron Shelton - who went
against cinema tradition and managed to make a film about baseball
that wasn't a flop (Bull Durham).

He also put together the charming basketball comedy White Men Can't
Jump, and the much misunderstood tale of the embittered major
league baseball legend Cobb.

In Tin Cup Shelton turns his attention to that most sedentary of
sports, golf.

Golf, by it's very nature, is not given to frenetic moments. It is
a ponderous and deliberate game, a game for those who like to
consider all the ramifications before making a decision, a game for
those who enjoy a wander near woods and lakes while the sun slowly
goes down.

And it is exactly this leisurely, relaxed atmosphere that Tin Cup
manages to capture while at the same time providing the beleaguered
Kevin Costner with the kind of role he was born to play. Costner
has too soft a face to pull off post apocalyptic warriors
(Waterworld) or mucho macho mediaeval outlaws (Robin Hood Prince of
Thieves).

In such overblown epics as these his lost-little-boy persona
becomes swamped and we lose sight of just how charismatic, in a
"gorgeous boy next door" kind of way Costner is.

Costner also excels in a role with humour. As he had begun to view
himself as a "serious" film-maker since his success with Dances
With Wolves, he has recently nixed humorous scripts. One supposes
that the trauma of Waterworld saw him just desperate to take on
more light-hearted projects.

And light-hearted (delightfully so) Tin Cup most certainly is.
Costner plays Roy McAvoy, a naturally gifted player who just
couldn't take himself seriously enough to make it as a pro. He can
drive like Daly, and putt like Faldo. If he could only do it on a
more regular basis, he would be up there with the best. But to be a
top golfer requires an enormous amount of dedication and
concentration, and Roy just doesn't possess those qualities.

Like a wayward Steve Ballasteros, Roy also has a penchant for the
spectacular, going for a birdie where he should take a par,
refusing to play a percentage game, even though a percentage game
might bring him success and riches.

Glory shots and entertainmen - that, for Roy, is what the sport is
about.

But now his tournament days are behind him, and Roy has settled
down into a life of middle-aged indolence. He owns a run-down
driving range in Nowhereseville Texas, where he gives the odd
lesson in between drinking beers with his mates.

It looks like Roy will make his way to the grave in such fashion,
until he is shaken out of his complacency by Dr Molly Griswold and
David Simms (Rene Russo and Don Johnson).

The former tickles his fancy, the latter, an old golfing chum who
is now a slick pro, hurts his pride by asking him to caddie in a
major competition.

Sure enough, Roy rises to both challenges, but, thank goodness,
does so in unpredictable fashion. He refuses to be tamed, either by
Molly, who would have him "extend his follow-through" a little
(what's the point of making a sport's movie if you can't use the
sport's terms for a little double entendre?) - or by David, who
smugly insists that the only way to win is to take the percentage
shot. Instead, Roy goes all out to win, both his lady and the golf
game of his life, on his own terms.

The movie delights in watching Roy take on the challenge of
seducing '90s woman and psychologist Molly in an old-fashioned way,
and in its climactic scenes, manages to instil more excitement and
tension in a fictional golf match than I have ever seen in a real
one. By the time its climax comes around, the movie becomes a real
nail- biter.

Director Shelton hasn't had a big hit in a while now, but with this
movie, and with Costner at his very best, he looks set to win
worldwide. What is more, by making his heroines intelligent and
full of character he is set to explode the myth that only bimbos
follow sport.

Dr Molly in this movie is as quick-witted and pithy as Susan
Sarandon was in Bull Durham.

It is Molly who provides Roy with the key to success thanks to her
superior understanding of his character. No cheerleader this lady.

All in all, a smart, exciting, character-driven comedy that should
keep everyone, golf fan or not, thoroughly entertained. Even if you
hate the game, you should try to take this charmer in.

REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: FILM/Martin Snape: DeNiro Is Up and Down in Thriller:
The Fan 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.44-45

Director: Tony Scoff

Starring: Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn,
John Leguizamo, Andrew J. Ferchland.

Robert De NirO is doing an awful lot of work lately, some of it
good (Casino) some of it mediocre (Heat). In The Fan his
performance vacillates between the two.

Nobody does a "psycho" quite as well as De Niro. Has anyone
bettered his portrayal of a troubled Vietnam vet in Taxi Driver?

Has anyone personified violence better than he did in Scorses's
update of Cape Fear?

Here he plays Gil Renard, Mr Middle America, with a screw loose.
Gil has the worn outlook of a man who has too often confronted
failure. His hair looks like it has been styled using a knife and
fork, his clothes and brow are rumpled, his sales patter matey and
outdated.

During the film, De Niro sells: a lot of knives. He is an expert on
them. Big ones, small ones, hunting ones, combat ones, all of them
lovingly cared for and sexily captured on celluloid, thanks to
director Tony Scott's trademark glamorous style,

It's all very phallic, and once you've seen the camera linger on
Gil's highly polished wares, you know it's only a question of time
before he unsheathes one and gets stuck into cutting up a victim or
two.

And it's not long before you realize that target number one will
ultimately be Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) a swaggering,
loudmouthed baseball player, the latest addition to Gil's favourite
team the San Francisco Giants.

Bobby is everything Gil always wanted to be. He is talented,
effortlessly successful, a perfectionist who can attain perfection.
Gil sees himself as a bit of a perfectionist too, the only problem
being that he isn't really very good at anything, not even at
flogging knives.

He can't meet the sales figures laid down by his unforgiving boss,
he has a failed marriage and an ex-wife who despises him (nicely
played by Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn), a son (Andrew J Ferchland) he
can't relate to and as a result, an awful lot of pent-up anger.

A degree of this he dissipates at ballgames, as during a father/son
outing to a ballgame where his anger continually bubbles to the
surface as he lectures his unfortunate child on the game.

De Niro's performance is perturbing, amusing and at times touching.
To see a man who is so far removed from what he wants to be is
poignant, and this is the key to the film's success. To an extent
we can understand the frustrations that leads him to be obsessed
with the arrogant millionaire baseball player, the man who
personifies everything Gil feels he ought to be.

But as Gil's actions become increasingly violent, he becomes less
sympathetic and the film begins to resemble just another
psychothriller. This, combined with Tony Scott's overly slick
images sees the film descend into areas that are the familiar and
glossy realm of Hollywood. Ironically, the more The Fan turns into
a thriller, the less it thrills and as De Niro's character becomes
more psychotic he becomes correspondingly less complex and
therefore less interesting.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: THE WRITING SCENE: A Shopkeeper's Diary: A
writer's debut on an outlying island 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By JANE RAM

When outlying island dwellers say where they live, most city
dwellers react in a predictable way. The typical first question is,
"How do you do your shopping? Do you have a supermarket?"

"We don't have a supermarket, but we do have Green Cottage!" Lamma
Islanders reply.

Within less than two years, the little shop on Yung Shue Wan's Main
Street has become an institution. Rustic wooden seats or the nearby
sea wall have made it a meeting place as well as the source of
everything from aroma therapy oils and wholemeal bread to steaming
espressos or glasses of fresh orange juice.

These days Green Cottage has diversified further, selling Birds in
the Sky, to give a direct translation of the title of  the $48 book
written by Queenie So Lai-chun.

Professional translator, former city dweller, dedicated greenie,
tireless farmer and full-time observer of human nature, So is the
owner and manager of Green Cottage. "I always wanted to write
something about Lamma," she says. "This funny community is unique
in Hong Kong."

Changed topic: She originally wanted to write about being a farmer
but once she became involved in selling green products, she found
herself spending so much time in the shop that it seemed only
natural to write about life on Main Street. The result is a
collection of short stories, which provide glimpses of Lamma life,
and the major concerns of the island's inhabitants.

Some of the stories are based on readily identifiable, real life
Yung Shue Wan characters - the Pizza Lady among them. Others have
been distilled through So's imagination and emerged in new forms.
Directly, or indirectly, everything in the book relates to Lamma,
she says, although less than a third is actually about keeping a
shop. Most stories touch on environmental issues. "I hope the book
will encourage people to value Lamma and keep it beautiful."

Three power station chimneys dominate Yung Shue Wan's scenery, but
instead of complaining, the long-suffering residents are inclined
to joke about them. So collected some of the comments - life's
exclamation marks, according to the philosopher; Salem cigarettes,
according to the chain smoker; blunt pencils according to the
professor; fingers with black nail polish, according to the
secretary; and so on.

Different viewpoints can transform the subject matter. So tells the
story of two Lamma residents, each with a big tree in his garden,
one to be doted over, the other to be torn down. Arguments between
their respective overseers ensue - to be put into So's record.

And then there was the 40-year-old who was proud to announce her
pregnancy - and her 50-year-old husband who arrived later to
complain his pension would be chewed up bringing up the baby.

So says hers is the first book in Chinese about Lamma, and it's
almost certainly the first book of any sort about Hong Kong's third
largest island. "Most people seem amazed at the idea that anyone on
Lamma can even read, let alone write," says So.

Birds in the Sky is boldly labelled "Islands Series No 1" and more
books are already in hand, including one being written by So's
partner, David Sheel, based on the diary of one of his forebears
who worked on the southern coast of China a century ago. So plans
more volumes of stories, although she says her next book will
probably be about the turtle who recently laid her eggs on a remote
Lamma beach: before anyone could really appreciate what a special
event this was, the eggs were dug up and eaten.

Main Street has certainly been an education, So says. "On the farm,
everybody I dealt with was so nice, it was like being cut off from
the real world, like being in an ivory tower. The problem was that
the ivory tower was getting smaller and smaller!

"The reality of Main Street was quite a shock. Suddenly I had to
deal with the real world of drunks and suppliers. After six months
I realized that it was impossible to carry the farming mentality
into the street. I learned to be more business oriented, more
practical and less idealistic to be able to survive. I'm not a shop
keeper by nature and I paid a heavy price for that lesson. I work
very hard, but I'm not very good at it. I've been writing all my
life and I continue to collect ideas and stories. I plan to do more
writing in the future: all I need is the time."

For the moment at least So does not plan an English version of her
book. "There are too many Cantonese puns for a successful
translation."

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: TRAVEL: Garlic Spells Trouble: There's no
substitute for metal at silver fest 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By PHILIP REEVE, P.42-43

A solitary drum began to beat. The simple rhythm, booming over and
over, soon became hypnotic. And then the air was filled with the
ethereal sound of hundreds of tiny bells jingling. One by one, out
of the surrounding houses, young Miao women appeared - dressed to
the nines in silver: magnificent headdresses, necklaces and thick
neck chains, bracelets, earrings, and tunics fringed with bells.
They surrounded the older woman, tirelessly drumming out the beat,
and began to dance in a slow, shuffling circle around the drum.

This was one of the highlights of the annual Sisters' Meal festival
of the Miao people, held amidst the camel-hump hills and folded
terraces of Guizhou's Shidong district. An extravagant courtship
ritual, it allowed the eligible young women to show off their
beauty to the men and at the same time their families' wealth -
invested in the fabulous silver costumes they wore. Families begin
collecting silver jewellery and headdresses for their daughters as
soon as they are born. Over 60 types of intricate silverwork can
make up a full costume including tiaras, coronets, combs and
phoenix crowns.

Wearing the heavy costumes for hours is gruelling for a young woman
but the more silver she can wear, the greater the prestige for her
family. Many silver costumes weigh as much as 15 kilograms.

All the men formed an admiring audience around the dancers,
preparing to make advances, proposals, and, for some, the
beginnings of courtship. The women prepare multi-coloured "sisters'
rice" for the young suitors, with symbols hidden inside to signal
their true feelings. A pair of red chopsticks means she has
accepted a hand in marriage; a garlic or red chilli, that the man
should look elsewhere; pine needles, that the man present silks and
colourful threads for further consideration.

The Miao people are surely one of China's most colorful ethnic
minorities, certainly the most festive. The "Black Miao" alone
celebrate 448 different festivals during the year. The hundreds of
different types of Miao in southwest China have been placed in five
broadly-defined categories - Black, Blue, Red, White and Flowery
Miao - though these convenient classifications do little justice to
the enormous diversity that exists in their customs, festivals and
dress (over a hundred prominent types). They are spread over an
area roughly the size of Germany and France, inhabiting seven
different provinces, though half of the Miao population of seven
million are concentrated in Guizhou.

Nobody knows their exact origins and this has led to a good deal of
conjecture. Some Chinese scholars have pointed to Tibet, Mongolia
and even Lapland as the Miao's original homeland. It seems more
likely that they inhabited the valleys of the Huang He (Yellow
River) around 4,500 years ago; scholars have even suggested they
were the first farmers in the Yellow River valley, terracing the
land to grow rice. The waves of invading Mongols from the north led
to a gradual migration southwards and it is estimated that they
began settling in Guizhou from at least the Qin and Han periods
(221 BC - AD 220).

During the Song (960 - 1279) and Ming (1368 - 1644) Dynasties, the
Miao were pushed further south into even more remote and rugged
areas by the advancing Han Chinese troops and settlers, eventually
reaching Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand - where they still live
today, known internationally as the Hmong. Allies of the Americans
in the Vietnam War, many of the Hmong were permitted to settle in
the US. Recently, Japanese scholars have been studying Miao customs
and language in detail as it has been suggested that the two
cultures may have common roots. The Miao of southeast Guizhou have
a much more imaginative explanation of their origins; the first
Miao man, according to legend, hatched from the eggs of a butterfly
(married to a bubble!); a water buffalo, a dragon, an elephant, a
snake, a tiger, a thunder god, and more abstract phenomena such as
calamities and ghosts, also figure in their richly storied
beginnings.

Exactly when the Miao started producing silver jewellery and
costumes is also not known but it is thought to have been during
the Ming period. Never having mined silver themselves, the Miao
purchased it from traders usually in the form of silver coins which
they then melted down.

At the time of the Cultural Revolution in the '60s, the Miao feared
their wealth would be confiscated by the Red Guards and so many
families buried their heirlooms in the hills. Luckily, that proved
only an interlude.

The central government, not unsympathetic to local traditions,
established annual silver quotas for the Miao way back in 1949.
Today, the "silver" tends to be a silver-plated base metal or one
of various silver alloys.

It is in the southeast of Guizhou, in districts like Shidong, that
the silverwork is the most outstanding and intricate. Many
villages, such as Tang Long near Shidong, have a number of skilled
silversmiths fashioning up to a hundred different types of silver
jewellery and adornments for their womenfolk. The Miao women, with
equal workmanship, produce exquisitely-embroidered textiles, often
full of colourful mythological figures and scenes.

In recent years Guizhou has opened up as an exciting destination
for the more adventurous tourist, and the Miao with their
extravagant silver costumes and lively festivals almost every day
of the year, are the province's prime attraction.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: A Prophet's Rise & Fall: New papers tell more of
China's Christ figure: God's Chinese Son: The Heavenly Kingdom of Hong
Xiuquan 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By Jonathan Spence

New York: HarperCollins

Extraordinary dangers may flow from a book as volatile as the
Bible, writes Jonathan Spence by way of an introduction to one of
the most amazing periods of Chinese history, the Taiping
Revolution. The prolific Yale history professor argues in his
latest book that more than anything else, it was one man's
interpretation of Christian scripture than turned China upside down
from 1851-64, bringing the Ching Empire to its knees. Spence echoes
many other sources when he writes that in the process, at least 20
million people were killed in battle or starved to death.

The author says he would never have contemplated adding to the
ample literature on the period were it not for the fact that about
10 years ago, new texts were discovered in the British Museum.
These volumes record purported visions of God and Jesus relayed to
Hong Xiuquan and some of his fellow believers. They also offer a
detailed description of life and events in China in the mid-18th
century.

Spence gained access to the books and went to Beijing to consult
with the man who had uncovered them, Wang Qingcheng. He decided
there was room for a book focused on Hong himself and the mechanics
of his enormous sway over thousands of followers.

Hong's introduction to Christianity came by a circuitous route.
Western missionaries were active in China in the 1830s,
distributing Bibles and related tracts. One Chinese convert, Liang
Fa, translated parts of the Bible and liked to give them away
outside the hall in Guangzhou where Confucian examinations were
held. Hong, at the time a schoolteacher from a small Hakka village,
happened to pick up one such handout on his way home after an
unsuccessful attempt to pass the exams in 1836.

Heady stuff: These random translations - particularly of Old
Testament prophets, the teachings of Jesus and the book of
Revelations - ultimately had a profound effect on Hong, who was
already sympathetic to the harsh lot of peasants like his father.
Following another failed attempt at the examinations, he grew ill
and fell into a delirious state on the 50km walk home. He later
described this experience as a journey to heaven where he was
reunited with his relatives, learned that he was the younger
brother of Jesus, underwent a heavenly baptism and was instructed
to banish evil from the earth.

By the time Hong failed the exams for the third time in 1843,
China's defeat in the Opium War had thoroughly discredited the
Manchu rulers and Confucius, too, in the minds of many.

Hong began his movement (called Tai Ping, or great peace) to drive
the forces of evil from the land and establish a New Jerusalem. A
handful of followers grew to thousands, despite incredible
hardships and setbacks and draconian codes of conduct, and the
Taiping took control of Nanjing as the seat of their Heavenly
Kingdom.

Spence takes pains to show that Western religious influence was
only part of the story. He asserts that "millenarian" thinking was
a phenomenon that evolved independently in different parts of the
world, including China. For example, until about 1500 BC, Egyptian,
Mesopotamian and Indo-Iranian cultures saw death as a final
darkness. Then through Zoroaster (Zarathustra) belief grew that
another worldly existence could come about following an apocalyptic
triumph of good over evil. This was the root of biblical
apocalypse.

In China, Spence points to accepted certainties first established
in the fifth century BC Lao Zi - paradox, balance and the absence
of dogmatism - later undergoing a similar erosion. Between the
third and sixth centuries AD, he writes, new Taoist and Chinese
Buddhist ideas combined to create an apocalyptic vision where a
celestial saviour and his chosen ones on earth would survive a
period of terrible destruction to form an ideal, peaceful society.

Even trying to narrow his focus to the inner workings of one man,
Spence must deal with a large cast of characters and many
complexities. He succeeds in bringing his material to life,
particularly through an inventive use of the present tense that
gives his narrative a journalistic feel.

Whether Hong emerges any more fathomable is open to debate.
Certainly the Western missionaries who met or corresponded with him
remained largely mystified by him, unable to reconcile his very
literal religious interpretations and uncompromising mission with
their own. Hong did not take kindly to their criticism.

But Spence does succeed in adding dimension to this historical
figure. Elsewhere, generally, he is portrayed simply as a Chinese
hero. Here, his fleshed-out story has the elements of tragedy; a
great man of noble purpose brought down by a fatal flaw. For Hong,
singleminded belief in his own infallibility bred dissension in the
ranks. That was his undoing.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: BOOKS: A Change of Season: Painful journey to
enlightenment: Bound Feet & Western Dress 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.40-41

By Pang-mei Natasha Chang

New York: Doubleday

I flipped through Bound Feet & Western Dress and put it down,
dismissing it as yet another yarn from some festering banana,
whingeing about being neither American nor Chinese. I remembered
enduring The Joy Luck Club, only to see a succession of characters
climb further down their navels, and concluded this cross-cultural
confessional stuff was spinning right out of control.

There was another problem with Bound Feet. It mixed the story of
one generation with the story of another, something a friend did
not very successfully accomplish in retracing the travels of his
great grandfather tramping through 19th century Europe. On the
surface, it was a simple "then and now" exercise, but it became a
game of matching wits, with my friend in charge of allocating
space. The device pitted one-off but sometimes eloquent
observations of a dead diarist against the musings, snoozings more
like, of a young writer who recast every phrase till it was too
clever by half.

As it happened, I inadvertently picked up Bound Feet thinking it
was something else, and headed for San Francisco airport. By the
time we touched down at Pearson in Toronto, I had finished the book
enthralled.

Rare for a debuting author, Natasha Chang neatly avoids both
problems, reining in her own story to the barest, thought-provoking
essentials, and using these to bridge different chapters of her
great aunt Chang Yu-i's fascinating life. Yu-i was the daughter of
a prominent Shanghainese doctor, a prolific dad who produced eight
children, including one son who would become president of the Bank
of China.

She was also, more to the point, the wife of one of modern China's
most celebrated poets, Hsu Chih-mo, who comes off as a creep in
this tragic story. But Yu-i herself was clearly a figure of
history, too, having been the first in her family to escape the
hideous practice of foot binding, after a few agonizing days' trial
- and being the first in China to be divorced. Unfortunately, that
precedent-setting split didn't seem to free her emotionally to get
on with other relationships. And unravelling the psychological
knots tying her up reveals the various cultural and social
conundrums that make Yu-i's such an interesting story.

Enlightened as her father was for the times, Yu-i was not given the
educational opportunities lavished on her brothers, and basically
tracked for an arranged marriage.

She didn't see her husband-to-be till the big day, and didn't think
she was winning much of a prize when she did finally lay eyes on
him. Hsu, going through the motions of honouring his parents'
wishes but really hungering for a modern, educated woman, dismissed
Yu-i as a bumpkin from day one.

If that wasn't a clue of more unpleasantness to come, we soon learn
that he rarely talked to her and stayed abroad as much as possible
before finally abandoning her. This he did a few years later, like
the guy who went off to buy a quart of milk never to return, after
she joined him to resume their partnership in England.

Son number one: Even the birth of a son, Hsu Chi-cai, and a second
- the tra-gic Peter, who was born in Germany and died at three -
failed to warm him to her. Indeed, he suggested she abort her
second pregnancy. But he seemed to dote over Chi-cai when he was in
China, which was rare. Chi-cai, in fact, spent his earliest years
with his paternal grandparents, as the story flips between China
and Europe, with tangents following Yu-i's brother to America.

After England, Yu-i went to France to live with her student brother
for a time before moving to Germany where, having nailed down the
essentials of German, she found work in a Berlin kindergarten. This
period in some ways seems both the happiest and saddest part of her
life. Berlin was where son Peter was born, forming the centrepiece
of her live-in friendship with Dora Berger. But that happy
interlude disintegrated with Peter's death, Dora never to be seen
again.

In Germany, Yu-i acceded to divorcing Hsu, desperate to marry his
latest flame and literary soulmate. She returned to China but
divorce didn't free her from familial bonds with the in-laws, just
as Hsu's desertion failed to spur her to act on mating signals she
got from a Chinese she met in Germany.

In the end, we have a woman caught between social and political sea
changes, prepared to explore the new, but not deeply enough to
leave the old, which includes a form of reconciliation with Hsu,
not long before he dies in a plane crash.

Hoping ties with her by-now Bank of China GM brother would pay big
dividents, the directors of the Shanghai Women's Savings Bank
appointed her a vice president. She proved astute in business, but
with civil war heating up, she moved to Hong Kong in 1949 and later
remarried. But with the death of her second husband in 1974, she
decided on New York, where she was to live out her days with her
son always close at hand.

There were probably many women like Yu-i trying to cross that gulf
separating imperial and republican China. The hope is they did
better than achieve what seems the worst of both worlds.

We are lucky for Natasha Chang writing Yu-i's story down, a process
that involved years of interviews and intricate interpretation and
editing.

A victim of racial taunts growing up in America, Chang found
herself on her own journey of self discovery.

But unlike most second-liners warming up rock fans for the main
act, Chang's story is compelling, too, laying out her own
conundrums. One suspects that at least some of them were confronted
and overcome in the process of working on Bound Feet.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: ANTIQUES: First, Remove the Butter: Tibetan
furniture starts making its way to Hong Kong 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By HILARY BINKS, P.38-39

It was a painstaking process, gently removing the thick layer of
grime built up over centuries of exposure to the smoke and grease
of yak butter lamps in a Tibetan monastery. But gradually the
beautiful colours and gold leaf of the painted chest beneath were
revealed. Miraculously, the decoration was largely intact.

"A layer of butter covers almost everything in Tibet," says Shaun
Kelly of Zee Stone Gallery, "and in this case it protects the
valuable painting. The very dry climate in Tibet also means that
furniture can be preserved for centuries without looking old. As
long as you clean the pieces carefully and patiently, so as not to
remove the gold, you can restore them to their original state."

Traditional Tibetan furniture is the least researched field of
Tibetan art. While art forms related to Buddhism, such as statues
and thangkas, Buddhist scroll paintings, have been popular for some
time, until recently few furniture pieces have been available
outside Tibet. Over the last four years, however, a handful of
dealers in the US have pioneered the import of Tibetan furniture,
and now at least three Hong Kong galleries - C.P. Ching, Plum
Blossoms and Zee Stone - offer good selections.

Late market bloomer: Neglect of this branch of Tibetan art was not
surprising when one considers the practical difficulties and
expense involved in getting pieces to Hong Kong. It is one thing to
import thangkas, which can be easily rolled up and carried by hand,
quite another to arrange safe shipment of furniture from the high
Tibetan plateau first to Katmandu in Nepal, and from there to Hong
Kong.

"It certainly demands an act of faith to get the pieces out," says
Stephen McGuinness of Plum Blossoms, who has just held his first
exhibition of Tibetan furniture at his galleries in Hong Kong and
Singapore. "But my interest is both personal - my wife is Tibetan -
and professional. I have a deep interest in Buddhist art and I
think people will appreciate the incredible Tibetan craftsmanship."
Both Plum Blossoms and Zee Stone are also making the most of their
newly expanded gallery space to show the furniture to best
advantage.

The three main types of Tibetan furniture are chests, cabinets and
tables. Because of their largely nomadic existence, most ordinary
Tibetans had little, if any, furniture. There were no chairs in
Tibet, as the people preferred to sit on a rug on the ground or on
a low platform. But small tables, some of them portable, were used
to serve food and drink, especially butter tea, and the household
shrine would have a stand or altar table on which offerings could
be placed. Chests were used to store precious things and wealthier
households might possess larger cabinets.

Monasteries, centres of Tibet's wealth and economic power, no doubt
needed more furniture in which to store the vast quantities of
precious silks, thangkas and Buddhist scriptures they accumulated
through trade and donations. Some cabinets housed images of
deities. A smaller type of cabinet, the torgam, was made to hold
torma, sacrificial sculptures made from butter and flour.  Pegam
cabinets, unique to Tibet, had scalloped panels on three sides to
support heavy wood-covered Tibetan texts. But by no means all
furniture was made for monasteries, says Kelly. "I have seen chests
stacked up in private houses, and everyone needed small tea tables.
Apart from cabinets with a Tantric or obviously religious theme, I
don't think there is very much distinction between domestic and
monastic use."

In contrast to Chinese furniture, where the main focus was on the
quality of beautiful hardwoods such as huang hua-li , in Tibetan
furniture the wood was of little consequence. On one of the highest
plateaux in the world, mostly above 4,500 metres, the only timber
available were softwoods such as pine and cedar. Joinery techniques
were basic but still clever locking systems and hinges, always with
an emphasis on practicality and efficiency. Fittings were of brass
or iron.

The really important thing about the furniture was its painted
decoration. Sometimes the wood was covered with a soft cotton
material to prevent cracking before sizing, water-based mineral
colours and gold paint were applied. Many pieces also had gesso (a
white ground, like plaster) applied to give a raised delineation or
texture. Finally, pieces were coated with a shellac-type of
varnish.

Annie Marcz-Ching, of C.P. Ching, recalls the first time she saw
Tibetan furniture in Katmandu: "I was excited by the vividness of
the painting. When I buy, my first criterion is that a piece must
have life. That is, it has to be a painting, rather than just
painted.  When the painting is good, it feels completely different
from when somebody has just decorated the piece with another motif.
I was also fascinated by the different influences I could
distinguish. I could immediately see Chinese characteristics,
sometimes Indian ones also, and even Islamic elements in the
beautiful floral patterns - and yet the furniture is unmistakably
Tibetan. That is the charm of it."

Clues to dating: While no definitive guidelines have yet been
established for dating pieces, foreign influences can provide
valuable clues. From the 15th century, Chinese influence became
paramount in Tibet and many of the designs used on furniture,
including floral and dragon motifs, can be compared to those seen
on Chinese textiles and porcelain.

On this basis, Kelly believes that many Tibetan chests date from
the 17th century or even earlier, pre-dating more elaborate
cabinets which were more numerous during the heyday of the
monasteries in the 18th century.

But many features are uniquely Tibetan. Marcz-Ching points to the
painted flower cabinets, which she says are in particular demand at
the moment. "You can really see the character of the Tibetan people
here, very warm and cheerful. They love to use bright colours -
red, green, gold and blue. I think it has to do with the mountain
climate - when they see the flowers in spring they are very happy
and this is communicated in their art."

Chests used to store precious goods often bore auspicious
decoration associated with wealth, such as dragons bearing a tray
of jewels. Typically the central cartouche was encircled by a
geometric design with corner scrollwork. The sides of chests were
frequently painted with a tiger pelt design, believed by Tibetans
to possess protective powers. Buddhist emblems, such as the lotus,
the vase, and the endless knot, were also popular.

Tibetan Buddhism, incorporating the Mahayana or "Greater Vehicle"
school, Tantric practices from India, and elements of the
indigenous animist "Bon" religion, also had its own darker imagery.
"In this case," says Marcz-Ching, "what is wonderful is not what
meets the eye, but the symbolism.

"For the moment, people are only just becoming familiar with
Tibetan furniture, but in the long term, when they understand it
more, I think Tantric Buddhist pieces will represent part of a more
serious collection."

COVER STORY: A SEA OF TROUBLES 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.32-37

The territory's First International Symposium on Marine
Conservation gets under way in Hong Kong this weekend. Speakers
will address such concerns as destructive fishing practices,
pollution, increasing threats to biodiversity and low levels of
enforcement of current legislation to protect the oceans. Window,
which has regularly covered these issues since it was founded four
years ago, is a co-sponsor of the symposium. Neil Colclough reports
that the organizer - the Hong Kong Marine Conservation Society -
hopes to make people more aware of their stake in the marine
environment and the role they can play in protecting it.

UNSEEN and unsuspected by many Hong Kong people, there are deserts
scattered around the territory - beneath the sea. Years of
overfishing, including dynamite fishing, as well as pollution,
dredging and a general lack of environmental management have left
areas of the seabed a virtual wasteland.

"Divers in Hong Kong know there are hardly any fish to be seen," is
the grim picture painted by one local diver. This is particularly
chilling when the southern China region, including Hong Kong, is at
the edge of the world centre of marine biodiversity - the Indo-West
Pacific. Conservationists fear this diversity faces collapse unless
urgent action is taken. Species such as sea turtles, lobster,
several species of grouper and sea cucumber are already as good as
extinct around Hong Kong.

Trawlers working in pairs can regularly be seen ploughing the same
area within hours of one another, in some cases depleting fish
stocks below a recoverable level. Perhaps even more destructive is
dynamite fishing. Divers from conservation groups describe areas
such as those around Rocky Harbour, where the coral lies in heaps
of rubble, with only crusty species of algae surviving. Dredging
and dumping have turned other areas into swirling mud pits.

Until recently, there were few laws protecting Hong Kong's marine
life. Even though the government has now legislated fines for
dumping, critics point out that it is hardly enforced, with little
policing and usually low fines imposed on transgressors.

There are some encouraging signs: marine conservationists have
started to win a few battles. In 1992, a sand-dredging project in
Mirs Bay was halted in the face of an environmental impact
assessment of the potential damage to coral reefs, backed up by
extensive lobbying from green groups. It was the first time such a
scheme had been stopped because of possible biodiversity loss.

Sanctuaries: In addition, the Marine Parks Ordinance was passed
last year, creating four protected marine sanctuaries.

But such measures are not enough, according to marine
conservationists, who say more public support needs to be created
to force the government to make more improvements. They believe the
government's primary environmental focus should be to formulate and
adopt a comprehensive, coordinated plan to save the territory's
marine life.

As part of the drive to put the public spotlight on the state of
Hong Kong's marine environment, the territory is hosting its First
International Symposium on Marine Conservation at the University of
Hong Kong this weekend. Organized by the Hong Kong Marine
Conservation Society, the two-day event has attracted local experts
and those from the US, the Philippines and Vietnam.

The symposium brings together scientists, politicians, lawyers and
media representatives in an attempt not only to highlight the
problems, but also to offer some solutions.

Society chairman Dr Brian Darvell says there has been a tendency
over the past few years to restrict the environmental debate to a
dialogue between green groups and government agencies, excluding
the general public.

"People in general need to be involved in these discussions because
it is their quality of life which is being affected," he says. "Yet
all the lobbying tends to be done in the opposite direction,
towards the administration, and argued on technical grounds. Our
intention is to make people aware of what's going on, enthuse them
to take action and then empower them to take that action."

Given the state of Hong Kong's marine environment, much action is
needed, according to conservationists. While terrestrial
conservation began in earnest in the mid-1970s with the
establishment of Hong Kong's country parks, the marine environment
has been largely ignored until recently.

A government commission was set up in 1965 to study conservation
needs. It formulated a plan for both terrestrial and marine
conservation but only the former was acted upon, initially with the
passage in 1976 of the Country Parks Ordinance.

This lack of action, combined with the effects of pollution,
overfishing and dredging, has proved devastating, according to Dr
Gregor Hodgson of the Institute for Environmental Studies at the
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Essential: "Biodiversity loss is occurring at an unprecedented rate
in Hong Kong and southern China," he says in a paper to be
presented at the symposium. "It is essential to move forward to
implement a conservation process now, or there will not be much
left to preserve."

A major cause of this loss is overfishing, say conservationists.
They argue that intensive fishing over the past few decades,
fuelled by technical improvements to trawlers and equipment, has
left very few edible or larger species of fish in local waters.

Hong Kong fishermen now focus almost exclusively on "trash fishing"
- smaller species, such as sardines, pony fish and anchovies, which
are sold as feed to fish farms at high prices: $2.5 per kg. These
species are now also being fished too intensely, according to
conservationists, who say the devastation is spiralling down the
ecological chain. Not only are stocks of the smaller fish being
severely depleted, but the techniques employed in trash fishing
also catch the fry of bigger species.

Bottom trawling with small mesh nets catches high levels of fry of
such fish as bream, croaker and goatfish, which are commercially as
well as ecologically important.

"The fishing fleet in Hong Kong is far too big. Pair trawlers are
going through the same areas several times within hours of each
other," says Darvell. "How can we justify that intensive fishing
effort when the returns are negligible? This activity is denuding
everything in the areas where it takes place. It's just getting out
of hand."

Darvell and others argue that the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department has known for years about the decline of large fish in
local waters but has refused to admit there is a problem or attempt
to tackle it by limiting fishing activity.

However, in a report to be presented at the symposium, department
officer Keith Wilson concedes not only that current levels of trash
fishing are "alarming," but that few bigger fish are being caught
inshore. Conservationists believe Wilson's report is the first
public confirmation by a department offical of what they have been
saying for years.

Inshore: "The impacts of the Hong Kong fry fishing industry on
fisheries resources may also be unsustainable," Wilson's paper
says. "The low proportion of demersal fish [those that live near
the bottom] in the inshore catch taken by vessels less than 15
metres is indicative of very high fishing pressures."

The demand for trash fish took off when the number of fish farms in
Hong Kong expanded enormously throughout the 1970s. Today more than
1,500 licensed farms in 26 fish culture zones produce just under a
quarter of all the live fish consumed in Hong Kong.

The knock-on effect is that of the fish caught in Hong Kong waters,
roughly 80 per cent are trash fish sold to farms. Less than 10 per
cent are higher value demersal species, according to Wilson's
report.

In addition to overfishing, other capture practices are damaging to
the marine environment. Dynamite fishing also kills non-target fish
such as the fry of larger species, particularly as it is usually
conducted where fish congregate, such as spawning and feeding
grounds. Police fear dynamite fishing is on the increase: so far
this year they have uncovered 368kg of explosive used for this
purpose, compared with 15kg for the whole of 1993.

Also destructive is the use of vacuum suction and dredging devices
to harvest clams, a practice increasingly common, according to the
AFD.

The suction method pulls up everything in the target area, while
dredging - dragging heavy steel frames covered with steel meshes
along the seabed - ploughs deep into the mud, seriously disturbing
the environment. Such dredging has angered fishermen in Wong Chuk
Kok Hoi where most clams are harvested. But unlike dynamite
fishing, the practice is legal.

If overfishing is indicative of a lack of initiative taken by the
government in protecting the marine environment, some
conservationists also claim that even where laws have been enacted,
this has largely proven a hollow effort.

Earlier this year, areas at the bays of Yan Chau Tong and Lai Chi
Wo in the eastern New Territories and Hoi Ha Wan just off Sai Kung
Country Park were designated as marine reserves. Hong Kong has more
than 50 species of coral - as many as in the whole of the
Caribbean. Sixty per cent of them occur at Hoi Ha Wan alone.

As marine parks, the areas are theoretically protected from dumping
or other damaging activities. However, there is a grace period
allowed for fishing, which has angered many conservationists who
say fishing should be stopped now.

Patrol: There is also concern that there will not be sufficient
resources to ensure the integrity of the parks - police have
privately admitted they may be unable to patrol the areas
regularly. "Its no use introducing laws unless you're prepared to
back them up," says Darvell.

The government's environmental protection programme in general has
been marked by a lack of willingness to enforce legislation or take
the initiative in practical terms, according to Brian Baillie,
lecturer in professional legal education at the University of Hong
Kong.

In his paper to the symposium, he says Hong Kong has adopted "a
rhetorical approach" to enforcement of environmental laws.

Baillie argues that environmental objectives and policies, in terms
of the written law, are at least adequate. Similarly there are
clear enforcement powers and suitable penalties at the disposal of
the courts. "But the government has paid lip service only to its
own standards and powers," he says. "Its rhetoric about
environmental care is just that: rhetoric."

Under the various local laws the Environmental Protection
Department has the power to:

 License polluting, discharging or dumping.

 Monitor emissions and discharges.

 Investigate sources of pollution, including entering private
property.

 Prosecute offenders.

 In some circumstances, where the area comes under the Water
Pollution Control Ordinance, it can order an offender to clean up
or pay the cost of cleaning up.

But despite an increase in the number of prosecutions over the last
four years - there were 249 under the Water Pollution Control
Ordinance last year - Baillie believes there is an overall lack of
resolution on the government's part to enforce environmental laws.

Even before the EPD was given the power to prosecute polluters,
Baillie argues that the attorney general could have done so using
the common law remedy of public nuisance. "The fact that the AG
never bothered to do so, despite overwhelming evidence of illegal
discharges continuing for years, as with the Tuen Mun River, is
simply another indication of the government's tradition of
placating the business community to the detriment of the
environment," according to Baillie.

Even now, he claims, the EPD's own manual says that prosecuting an
offender should be the last option.

When offenders are prosecuted, Baillie says, with few exceptions
the fines handed out by magistrates are pitifully low and have
little deterrent effect. He says the average fine for environmental
offences from May 1995 to May this year was about $13,000. This
covers first and second offences - fines for repeat offences are
supposedly heavier.

For one of the most common offences of illegal discharge of waste
into public drains, the first fine is $400,000. For subsequent
offenders the maximum fine is $1 million, with provisions for
culprits to be imprisoned and fined $40,000 per day for a
continuing offence.

Baillie says heavy fines are occasionally imposed by more
environmentally enlightened members of the Judiciary, but the
generally low fines are probably the result of the lack of
precedent for environmental convictions.

When the EPD first launched prosecutions, the fines were low and
few if any cases went to higher courts, which traditionally provide
penalty guidelines to the lower courts, where such cases are
generally handled.

"So it is very difficult for magistrates, who hear all first-
instance environmental prosecutions, to work out where on the range
of possible penalties they should pitch each offender," says
Baillie.

Slows: Other critics of the government's environmental record claim
that bureaucracy often slows down the pace of implementing
effective measures.

So what is the way forward in the drive to protect Hong Kong's
marine environment?

According to Hodgson, there needs to be a move away from ad hoc
policies and action towards a comprehensive strategy to preserve
and manage Hong Kong's marine life. He says an "integrated
biodiversity management plan" would be based on zoning and tough
regulations to protect marine life. Following its implementation,
there would also need to be continuous and comprehensive monitoring
of biodiversity changes over time.

Hodgson says in his paper that conservation needs to be viewed
holistically - "from mountain top to seabed." He adds: "For
example, common sense tells us that marine parks should not be
planned in areas adjacent to heavy industrial zones, where the
threat of pollution will be high." He also says that conservation
needs to have realistic aims, with the assumption that many
problems will not be solved in the near future.

Survey: As a first and urgent step, Hodgson believes a fast
reconnoitre rather than a prolonged in-depth study needs to be made
to establish the state of the marine environment - what is left,
what has gone and what can and cannot be saved. This is necessary
despite the fact that such a swift survey might result in mistakes.

"Given the rapid rate of biodiversity loss now occurring, unless
immediate decisions are taken on what should be saved, then it will
be too late," he says. "The alternative, to wait until every
species and its ecological role is known prior to taking action,
would be catastrophic."

Hodgson argues that ultimately conservation, if it is to be
successful, cannot be restricted by political borders, and Hong
Kong will have to combine its efforts with southern China.

Closer to home, Baillie believes that changing the law to allow
private citizens to take legal action against polluters and the
government for failing to prevent illegal pollution would be a
major step forward in ensuring environmental laws are enforced. He
says such provisions in the US have proved effective.

"Indeed, the major victories for the environment in America since
they first embarked on their environmental legislation in 1969 have
very often been due not to the EPA's [the quasi-government
Environmental Protection Agency] vigilance or initiative, but
rather to the efforts, via litigation, of concerned citizens'
groups," he argues.

For this to happen in Hong Kong he believes three "foundation
pillars" are necessary. These are:

 Rights for citizens to sue both offenders and non-performing
government agencies.

 No awards of legal costs against unsuccessful plaintiffs in
actions brought against government agencies.

 Genuine, comprehensive, inexpensive freedom of information
legislation and procedures.

Baillie argues that a clean and protected environment should be
viewed in the context of basic human rights.

Linking all the recommendations and proposals to clean up Hong
Kong's marine environment, most conservationists and their
supporters agree that their success largely depends on getting the
general public involved. Not only does public awareness need to be
increased, but people generally need to be involved in the planning
process.

COMMENTARY: The ideal ruler rarely speaks. When a good thing is done, the
people will say 'We did it': Catching up with Lao Zi 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By GERALD CHEN, P.31

FOR THE moment let's forget about floods and the disgraceful
pollution man has brought to our planet's rivers, lakes and even
seas. Let us also pause to consider water - that life-giving
element as perceived by ancient Chinese thinkers more than 2,500
years ago. To Lao Zi (who lived around 571 BC), founder of Taoism,
water symbolized the very essence of Tao, the Great Way.

"Supreme goodness - Tao or Taoist - is like water," says the
Daodejing (one of China's great contributions to understanding of
the universe and humanity), which literally translates as Virtues
of the Tao, or figuratively as The Great Way. "Water benefits all
creation but never contends. It stays in places that most men
avoid. The Taoist prefers to be in the company of the lowly. He
does not err because he never contends."

In another reference to water, the Daodejing says: "Nothing is more
soft and pliant than water, yet it is capable of subduing the
strong and breaking the powerful. The weak can conquer the strong
as softness can conquer hardness. Although everyone knows this
truth, no one ever practises it because truth often appears to be
untrue."

As symbolism in the philosophical thinking of Lao Zi, it would
naturally be wrong to judge his concept of water as we understand
it today. But its value lies in the insight it gives into the way
our world moves and fulfils itself and, indeed, how human beings
should behave towards nature as well as towards fellow humans.

In this space it is unnecessary to go into what seem to be the
absurd extremes of Lao Zi's outlook, such as his vision of an ideal
small state which has absolutely no contact with its neighbours, or
his rejection of knowledge and learning on the grounds that they
are twin sources of evil.

What many pundits have found intriguing are the numerous glittering
sparks of Lao Zi's philosophic thought which still ring true today
- despite the fact that they seem contrary to conventional wisdom.

Philosophical opposites: A contemporary of Confucius, Lao Zi was
founder of one of the two most important schools of thought to
dominate Chinese culture down through the ages. Although a
personalized god is absent in both Taoism and Confucianism, their
ideas on what constitutes good government, virtue and the meaning
of life are distinctly different. In fact, they are opposite.

In the final analysis, it might be said that in the dialectics of
both schools, Confucianism, with its stress on studying the
classics and aspiration to official duties, takes a positive
attitude towards life whereas the Taoist position, with its stress
on inaction and affinity with nature, the meek and lowly, is
totally negative.

The alternating dominant positions of Confucianism and Taoism in
Chinese history have not obliterated the fact that both continue to
exert profound influences on Chinese culture. It is well said that
Chinese intellectuals prefer to observe the loyalties and ethical
values of Master Kong's teachings when serving as officials. Poets
and writers, on the other hand, draw inspiration from the subtle
feelings and romanticism of the Taoist gospel. But this does not
rule out the possibility of Taoist officials showing great respect
for Confucian ethics in their public life, while continuing to
relish their Taoist thoughts in private. Nor can it be overlooked
that disgraced or disheartened Confucian officials often turn to
Taoism to find solace in a quiet life away from worldly worries. In
effect, it really is quite possible for a Chinese to be now a
Confucianist and now a Taoist.

That the legacies of Confucian and Taoist thinking are part and
parcel of contemporary Chinese culture is evident from the fact
that traces of their influence can be found among Chinese
businessmen, Buddhists, Christians, artists, scientists and
communists.

Grades of rulers: The subtleties of Lao Zi's thinking are still
frequently manifest in his maxim that truth often appears untrue.
"The best ruler of a state," he said, "is he whose subjects are not
aware that he is there. The next to the best is adored, the next is
feared while the worst is despised by his subjects. The ideal ruler
rarely speaks. When a good thing is done, the people will say: 'We
did it'."

It might be argued in the present day that both the first and last
forms of such governments are democratic. Although "invisible," the
first case is effective, which is what matters. The last, worst,
case - while an adversarial form of government - is also a
democracy. But the first is an example of the effectiveness of
"doing nothing" (inaction), the most important tenet of Taoist
outlook.

The ways of nature are to take from excesses to replenish the
deficient. Man behaves the opposite way by taking from the
deficient to enlarge the excesses. The Taoist seeks to balance the
inequality by adopting the ways of nature. Although "doing nothing"
can result in "accomplishing everything," the Taoist has no wish or
reason to feel proud or jubilant. Simply, he has done nothing.

The wise appear foolish, great straightness bends, great cleverness
appears clumsy, great eloquence is short on words, loudness is
silence, speech is poor before ideas, and misfortune is the seed of
blessing (and vice versa).

Said Lao Zi: "When common folks hear what I say, they just laugh.
Why shouldn't they? Greatness comes belatedly. Great sounds sound
faint. Tao cannot be named. Had they not laughed, I would not be
talking about Tao."

CHINA: SPORTS: Warming Up to Sports: Fujian people's route to health 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From ZENG XIANCHENG in Fuzhou, P.28-29

EARLY morning sunlight finds numerous people in Chinese cities
jogging, playing ball or dancing in public parks or by the
roadside. At this time of day, all these people - of different
ages, various occupations and diverse interests - seem to be
focused on a single goal: achieving a long and healthy life.

Freed from the old worries about lack of food and clothing, more
and more Chinese, as those in Fujian province shown in these
pictures, are becoming health conscious and spending increasing
amounts of money and time on sport.

As with almost anything in China, the history of sport can be
traced back aeons through a colourful range of traditional
activities and styles. The Fujian area used to be called Min. The
Min people were an ancient ethnic group who were integrated with
the Han - the majority of the Chinese race - centuries ago. As a
result, many traditional sports, such as Chinese martial arts and
dragon boat racing, were adopted by the Min as well.

Today, many Western sports - golf, snooker, aerobics to name just a
few - are becoming increasingly popular with the younger people in
Fujian. Well-equipped gyms are being opened in many cities in the
province, attracting large numbers of eager exercisers.

The fitness trend is also fuelling a spending boom and sales of
sporting goods, including home exercise machines, are rising
rapidly.

Fujian's provincial government has spent handsomely on building
sports facilities and supporting sporting events. More than 400
stadia and gyms have been built across the province in the last few
years. The cities of Quanzhou and Xiamen have each constructed
large, well-equipped sports centres, ending their chronic shortage
of such facilities.

Local governments in Fujian are keen on waging campaigns to
encourage people to participate in both traditional and modern
games. Sports meets are held frequently across the province and
last summer a number of "thousand-people" games were held in Fuqing
city. In each of these events a thousand participants competed in
swimming, jogging and martial arts exercises.

CHINA: BOOKS: Unmitigated Butchery: Vivid re-telling of Nanjing's 1937
nightmare, when 300,000 died at Japanese hands 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.27

Nanjing Massacre, 1937

Xu Zhigeng

Published by Chinese Literature Press

ON December 13, 1937, units of the invading Japanese Imperial Army
occupied Nanjing, at that time the capital of China. They entered
not as a disciplined force engaged in modern warfare abiding by the
Geneva Convention and other accepted moral and legal codes that
govern conflicts, but rather as ravening foxes into a hencoop. The
soldiers, encouraged and abetted by their leaders, began a campaign
of slaughter, torture and pillage that lasted for months on end.

Informed conservative estimates of the number of dead conducted at
the time, and immediately upon the expulsion of the Japanese, put
the death toll among a subdued and captive population at more than
300,000, the majority occurring during officially sanctioned
instances of mass slaughter and gratuitous violence.

Appalling as this was, does this one instance in an expansionist
period during which the Japanese slaughtered and pillaged across
Asia, merit a book to itself? Or is this merely an example of a
citizen of one country caring more about what happened to
compatriots than to the inhabitants of Vietnam, Burma, Hong Kong,
Singapore and Indonesia, to name but a few? Many other accounts
exist which document the planning and cruelty that went into
Japan's thwarted aggression, including the preparation of spy
rings, drug dealing, subornment and cruelty in the extreme.

The author justifies his publication on the grounds that, once the
idea had been suggested, he found it remarkably hard to uncover the
facts. Despite anecdotal evidence from survivors, historians seemed
to have largely passed over the event. Indeed, as a second edition
was being prepared for translation and press, Japan's justice
minister went on record to claim that the Nanjing Massacre "was a
complete fabrication" - a staggering denial that in itself makes
the need for a record such as this the more necessary.

It would seem that, at a time when ignorant youngsters in Fujian
province are buying Japanese military replicas, when Japanese
right-wing militarists are gaining press attention, and when
textbooks are claiming that Japan "entered China" rather than
invaded, there is an insistent need to put the facts on record,
lest we forget.

Neither designed as, nor perhaps desirable as, a work of literary
accomplishment, this account tackles the topic in analytic and
dispassionate fashion, despite the fact that even the Japanese
translators "found [their] eyes filling with tears" and were often
"ridden with a sense of crime."

Ordeal: Opening with an account of the (inadequate) defence of
Nanjing against military superiority, set in a time of divided
loyalties and poor communications, the author shows the peculiar
blend of heroism and scarce resources that characterized the
Chinese resistance to the Japanese occupation. From this he moves
on with chapters detailing aspects of the ordeal, not in a temporal
chronicle but as an examination of each outrage in turn.

Despite the inevitable repetition this entails, the themes are
strongly buttressed by eyewitness accounts from different
perspectives, leading the reader from house to street to riverside
in a never-ending orgy of carnage, waste and inhumanity.

We learn of thousands machine-gunned, hundreds doused in petrol and
set afire, groups buried alive, and rape and disembowelment as
daily occurrences.

The citizens of neutral powers and the Red Cross tried to enforce
safety zones for non-combatants, but to only limited avail. The
streets and rivers ran red while property was looted, destroyed or
shipped to Japan.

Perhaps the most spectacular instances of unnecessary cruelty
involved the beheading of innocent civilians in competitions
between Japanese officers testing the edges of their swords for
fun, accounts of which were published in Japanese papers for the
amusement of those unable to take part in this savage apology for
sport.

But was this any different from other wartime atrocities? The point
that the author wishes to leave us with is emphatically "yes."
While waste and plunder have historically accompanied armies,
modern sensibilities have given rise to accords and regard for the
well-being of civilians under occupied rule: these were disregarded
pointlessly and comprehensively. It can be no defence to the charge
that the occupiers behaved atrociously by saying, as did Japanese
commander Iwane Matsui: "The struggle between Japan and China
should be regarded as the unavoidable conflict between two
developing nations, and the rivalry between the national ideologies
of the two cultures."

Modern proponents of terrorism as warfare might seek to justify the
Japanese behaviour, saying that by terrorizing the occupied areas
they were following militarily sound principles of seeking to
demoralize the opponent. But, as one reads further into this
account of the massacre, such pleas appear hollow and specious: why
adopt a policy of stupidity and waste?

At a time when nationalisms and ideologies again threaten to clash
in Southeast Asia over territory, we would do well to read this
account and, even if we cannot agree on what the ethical
considerations are, to call to mind Sun Tzu's observation, made in
The Art of War, probably compiled during the Warring States period
(475-221 BC): "Generally in war the best policy is to take a state
intact; to ruin it is inferior to this."

CHINA: HEALTH: Vast Majority Ignore Need to Clean Teeth: Toothbrushes used
by only half population 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By JAMES NING, P.26

IN THE West at least, it has long been as essential a personal-
hygiene instrument as a nailbrush. Infants as well as adults use it
at the start and finish of each day, and wouldn't dream of
travelling any distance without it. It's as prominent in TV
advertisements and print ads as on the shelves of pharmacies. There
was even a song written about it - quite a tribute for a stick of
plastic with a few dozen bristles stuck on one end.

Take a bow, toothbrush.

But while its use is widespread in developed countries, it is still
far from ubiquitous in China. Only about half the population of 1.2
billion use one, even though it was first imported from the West
early this century.

Old concept: Not that the concept of cleaning one's teeth was
earth-shatteringly new to the country. The well-to-do were
polishing their molars, sans toothbrush, with lumps of rock salt as
early as the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), though the practice was
never widely popularized.

Currently, say national public health officials, about 60 per cent
of China's 700 million rural dwellers have yet to adopt the use of
a toothbrush, while 10-20 per cent of urbanites also ignore it.
Then there are, at a rough count, some 400 million infants and
senior citizens who have no need of one because they have no teeth.
The end result: only about 300 million mainland citizens brush
their teeth regularly.

The fact that only one-quarter of the population actually do so has
for years been of major concern to dental and medical authorities.
But shortage of funds has hampered large-scale publicity drives on
dental hygiene where it is most needed - in underdeveloped country
areas, most of whose people have never seen a toothbrush, let alone
used one. Many rural folk who now clean their teeth picked up the
habit after seeing town-dwellers doing so.

Poverty is another factor that prevents people from adopting such
healthy habits, lack of money rather than ignorance depriving them
of these fundamentals. Equally, strapped-for-cash local health
authorities are unable to hand out free toothbrushes and
toothpaste, or to mount promotional campaigns. Meanwhile, the
majority of people continue to spend surplus money on household
goods rather than dental hygiene. Their teeth receive attention
only when giving them problems.

China produces some 800 million toothbrushes a year, the majority
of low quality and thus cheap. Those who retail them invariably
have large inventories because customers tend to use their
toothbrush for some years before replacing it. A snap survey by the
municipal product-quality monitoring office at major department
stores in the Haidian district of Beijing last year showed that
more than 30 per cent of non-brandname brushes had serious defects
and should not have been allowed onto the market.

Potential risk: Many users of these brushes are unaware of the
potential risk to their health - an ulcerated mouth or infected
gums, for example. But, say health officials, even much-hyped
imported and domestic-brand brushes are not necessarily of a
quality that justifies their price tags. And medical experts in
Beijing continue to warn that new designs, promoted on TV as being
"recommended by most dentists overseas" are not necessarily
suitable for Chinese, or other races for that matter.

Last month, reporting China's seventh annual Tooth Protection Day,
the Economic Daily carried a special report on dental matters. It
observed that moneyed people tend to opt for expensive imports in
the belief that dearer is better, while those on tight budgets are
often of necessity forced to disregard quality. The best
domestically produced toothbrushes, said the report, are just as
good as their foreign counterparts but sell for half the price.
Other points:

p Of toothbrushes replaced daily in hotel guest rooms, including
some top hotels, more than 90 per cent fall short of state quality
standards in one aspect or another, if not completely. This is
because managements keep such costs to a minimum.

p The report's writer could not specify the number of China's
toothbrush producers, but did learn that more than 30 are members
of the Association for Daily Necessities Industry. (Members of such
trade groups are usually major state-owned enterprises trying to
stay in business against the competition of far wealthier joint
ventures.) Combined, the domestic manufacturers would be a
formidable force; currently, most struggle by on their own.
However, several toothbrush firms in Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei province, recently formed an industry group to form a
united front.

p Most manufacturers have been making the same models since their
firms were founded years, even decades, ago. Lack of funding and
technical know-how has prevented them from launching better models
using modern materials. Those who have contrived to come up with
fresh designs in recent years have found themselves with little
capital left over to promote their new products. Many of these
match the design and product quality of those from overseas.

p China's toothpaste producers are generally far more successful
with sales than brush makers. Thus, suggests the report, the two
should merge their operations in the same way as their powerful
foreign rivals to become more competitive. But this is not possible
at present because the two sectors belong to different industrial
areas. Toothpaste manufacturing is part of the chemical industry,
toothbrushes the Ministry of Light Industry. Central government,
assumes the report, would not be against a merger.

CHINA: Move West Proves Yugur Salvation 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

THE Yugur originated from an ancient nomadic tribe, the Ouigurs,
which roamed the Erhun river valley in northwest China during the
Tang dynasty (618-907). Dogged by foul weather and constant attacks
from the neighbouring Turkic Kirgiz people, the Ouigurs began
moving westward in separate groups in the mid-9th century. One of
the groups emigrated to today's Gansu province, and settled in
Guazhou (today's Dunhuang), Ganzhou (Zhangye) and Liangzhou
(Wuwei). Because the three places were all in the Hexi Corridor,
the former nomads became known as the Hexi Ouigurs.

From the mid-11th to 16th centuries, many of those in Guazhou
assimilated with local people, thus forming the community now known
as the Yugurs. During the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the rulers
moved a large number of Yugurs further east to today's Zhangye
area. Through such gradual contact with the neighbouring Han
community, the Yugurs started to learn farming and animal
husbandry.

Today, about 90 per cent of the 12,000 Yugurs live in Sunan Yugur
Autonomous County, founded in Zhangye in 1954. A small number of
them can be found in Huangnibao township, in the Jiuquan area that
borders Zhangye. Blessed with abundant grassland, most Yugurs
continue to work in farming and animal husbandry. Others are
engaged in industry, mainly carpet-making, the fur trade and food
processing.

CHINA: FOCUS: Minority Yugurs Profit From Old Cultural Ways: Zhangye resort
contrasts industrial base 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From ZHONG ZHENGXIANG and CHEN JIAN in Zhangye, P.24-25

BUSINESS people know Zhangye in China's northeast Gansu province as
a burgeoning industrial town. Tourists, however, are drawn to its
Lan Hua Ping resort with its picturesque scenery and friendly
Yugurs, a culture numbering some 12,000.

A recent tour of the resort, 3,000 metres above sea level, which
attracts about 200,000 visitors a year, proves a rewarding
experience.

Our approach to the entrance was to the sound of folk songs by a
group of young Yugurs in ethnic dress. Their first greeting was a
hada (a piece of white silk used as welcoming gift) and a full cup
of qingke wine fermented from highland barley. According to local
custom, we took a sip, dipped the third finger of our right hand
into the wine, then flicked it three times to symbolize respect for
heaven, earth and the person serving the wine - in this instance a
Yugur woman. It seems that many tourists, failing to appreciate the
drink's potency, gulp the whole cup and become drunk.

Happily we remain sober, and are invited to eight tents bordering a
meadow slope, there to be served a Yugur meal. The tents are simply
furnished with a carpet and low tables and stools. Once we are
seated, young women wearing fancy head adornments matching their
colourful dresses serve the steaming hot buttered tea and roast
mutton, true highlights of Yugur cuisine.

Because the tea is mixed with parched flour and milk as well as
butter, it tastes rich though surprisingly not greasy. The unboned
roast mutton comes in large portions and, as we are reminded, is
best eaten by hand - a greasier experience than the tea and
remindful of the bacchanalian heroes of the Chinese classic Water
Margins. But pulling the meat apart requires more skill than we had
realized.

The most delicious part of sheep - the tail and tendons - are by
Yugur custom usually given to guests, while the shank is for
children. The tender thigh is reserved for the elderly for obvious
reasons. A chef explains that the best roast mutton is neither too
lean nor fat. If the former, it will have an unpleasant smell, the
latter too greasy.

At meal's end a young man and five girls hurry into the tent. At a
gesture from the man, the girls start to sing, and when they're in
full flow he proposes individual toasts to each visitor in our
group. In return, guests have to finish half a cup of the qingke
wine. Although the host's warm hospitality is difficult to refuse,
we quickly realize the the wisdom of taking only sips, for girls
follow on his heels to propose their own toasts. The good news is
that the Yugurs will not force a guest to get drunk.

Yugur women are very particular about their headwear, which
represents their marital status. Married women's headwear is often
their precious dowry, inlaid as it is with pearls, diamonds and
agates. These form various patterns on a one-metre piece of cotton
flannel, which is circled turban-like around the head, with a short
stretch hanging down the back. Unmarried women wear far less
luxurious headwear, characterized by strings of beads adorning the
forehead.

The Yugurs are divided into two major groups, known as east and
west. The groups share the same language but, verbally, use
slightly different delivery. Women's headwear is the most
noticeable difference between the two groups. The easterners wear a
flat-topped design, westerners a "pointed" design.

Fortunate tourists - alas we were unlucky - might be invited to a
local wedding ceremony, unique to the Yugurs from time immemorial.
On the eve of the wedding, the bride's family hosts a dinner during
which a few married women place new headwear on the bride while
girls sing appropriate songs. When the bride and her attendant
leave their tent home the following morning, the bride's face is
veiled by a scarf. En route to the groom's tent, the bridal party
is greeted by the groom's friends and relatives, who provide wine
and introduce those who have made preparations for the wedding. By
custom, the bride's family is allowed to be critical of the
preparations, and even turn back if dissatisfied - an embarrassment
that rarely occurs.

As the bride approaches her new tent home, a "battle" breaks out,
which ostensibly shocks the guests. Seven or eight young men on
horseback from the bride's side of the union gallop around the tent
three times in a feigned effort to collapse it. The groom and his
family remain inside in an equally feigned effort to protect it.
When the battle is over, the groom's family takes the horses from
the riders.

When the bride enters the tent's flap, the groom shoots three
harmless "arrows" at her. If one strikes, it means the couple will
forever be happy together. Then it's on with the real ceremony,
conducted by a senior member of the groom's family. The young
couple, sitting on separate sides of a carpet, first worship Buddha
and then indicate their respect for each other.

Simultaneous with the start of music and singing, guests begin to
drink. Then uncles and aunts of the bride officially hand their
niece over to the groom's family. Celebrations continue until the
last guest leaves.

Yang Yuxia, a young local tour guide, says that Yugur girls are
these days allowed to marry Han men, a practice that had always
been forbidden. The change reflects increasing cultural and social
exchanges between the two cultures.

CHINA: Same Trip Yesterday 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

PROBABLY the most famous trip ever made from Xi'an to Lhasa was
more than 1,300 years ago by a princess on her way to marry the
King of Tubo (now Tibet). As early as the seventh century, Tubo was
establishing close ties with the Tang dynasty (618-907AD), the most
prosperous in feudal China. In 614, Tubo's King Songtsan Gambo made
an offer of marriage to the Tang through Emperor Taizong, and
Princess Wencheng was selected to be the bride.

It is not difficult to imagine the hardships of such a long
(2,700km) trip, which took the princess and her handmaidens and
escorts - headed by special envoy Li Daozong - more than two years
to reach Lhasa. There, the king had renovated the Potala Palace as
a welcome to his bride.

Now, with the opening of the Xi'an-Lhasa air route, travellers can
complete the same distance in little more than the time it takes to
watch a movie, about two and half hours. Meanwhile, those who are
curious about the details of the princess' legendary trip can
retrace her route, though in far greater comfort than the princess.

Now available is a tour called "Princess Wencheng Entering Tibet,"
developed by the Tibet Tourism Bureau. Tourists are taken by road
from Xi'an to Lhasa in about two weeks. En route they make four
major stops for sightseeing and special events.

CHINA: AVIATION: Jets to Roof of World: A new air route connecting Lhasa to
Xi'an is expected to harvest tourist gold 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From ZHANG DAN in Xi'an, P.22-23

TOURISTS and business travellers are taking advantage of a new,
third, air route to Tibet. Recently inaugurated by China
Southwestern Airlines, the sole civil service to offer round trips
to the roof of the world, the new service is between Xi'an -
capital of northwestern Shaanxi province - and Lhasa. Its average
seat occupancy rate since starting has been 57.3 per cent.

While this rate is still almost 10 per cent below the annual
average for China's civil carriers overall, a spokesman for China
Southwestern, which ranks fourth among the country's six major
airlines, says it is confident of filling more seats during the
next peak tourism season, summer 1997. "It's a new route, and may
still be unknown to many tour and ticketing agents," he says.

The maiden Xi'an-Lhasa flight was by a 198-seat Boeing 757 which
left Xianyang International Airport, 25km north of Xi'an, with 159
passengers. Just two-and-a-half hours later it touched down at
Gongar Airport, 100km outside Lhasa. The plane returned to Xi'an
the same day with 38 passengers.

As of September 11, more than 4,000 passengers had used the new
route, whose opening gives Tibet-bound travellers both a convenient
and interesting option to China Southwestern's two established
routes. Previously, people had to choose either Chengdu, capital of
southwestern Sichuan Province, or Chongqing - also in Sichuan - as
their starting point for Lhasa. Now, those beginning their journeys
in the north, Beijing for example, are finding it more convenient
to fly from Xi'an.

In marketing potential, the airline and China's tourist agencies
value the Xi'an-Lhasa route above the two Sichuan options. After
Beijing, Xi'an is high on most tourism itineraries because of the
famous terra-cotta warriors and horses of Emperor Qin Shihuang,
dating back 2,200 years.

This acknowledged wonder of the world helps make Xi'an one of the
country's most popular tourist destinations. In 1995, it received
nearly 400,000 international visitors, a number that is growing by
seven per cent every year. Meanwhile, at the other end of the
route, Lhasa, with its splendid Potala Palace, is an irresistible
attraction to countless tourists. Last year, Tibet received more
than 30,000 international tourists. It expects some five per cent
more this year.

Golden Route: China Southwestern press officer Yi Shizhong says the
airline is actively promoting the new flight to international and
domestic travel agencies and ticketing agents. "We believe it will
become a golden tourism route" - a view confirmed by the fact that
several Chinese airlines competed for the Xi'an-Lhasa licence. The
Civil Aviation Administration of China's decision to grant it to
China Southwestern was due to the airline's 40-year, accident-free
record in flying over the Tibetan Plateau, where blizzards and
jagged snow-clad peaks combine to test the nerve of pilots. "We
impose the strictest safety regulations to ensure that our flights
over the 'third pole on the planet' are safe," says Yi. "Four
decades of safe flying speaks for itself."

To date, the airline has made more than 24,000 flights to and from
Tibet, carrying a total of 2.8 million passengers and 10,000 tons
of freight.

Since 1994, China Southwestern has opened two other Tibet air
routes. One of them, Chengdu to Bangda in eastern Tibet, was made
possible by the construction of an airport encircled by 4,000m-high
mountains. The other is Chongqing-Lhasa. Prior to 1994, the airline
had only two routes: Chengdu-Lhasa and Lhasa-Kathmandu, the capital
of Nepal.

At present, the airline operates 44 Boeing 757 flights a week on
five routes over Tibet. "They are the newest and most reliable
planes in [our] fleet," says Yi. Some 300,000 passengers per year
fly China Southwestern to and from Tibet, a vast increase against
the services' early years.

Independent tourists: Yi believes the new Xi'an-Lhasa service will
further promote Tibet's economic and tourism growth. However, for
foreign independent tourists, visiting Tibet isn't simply a case of
buying and flying. A little planning and paperwork is necessary in
advance.

According to the Tibetan Autonomous Region's tourism bureau - "to
ensure foreign tourists' safety in Tibet" - international tourists
must travel in organized groups with special visas. Ticketing
agents can decline to sell air tickets to Tibet to individual
travellers without proper visas.

Tibet-bound visas: There are more than 40 travel agencies in Tibet
with government authority to receive tourists organized by their
business partners abroad. These agencies are responsible for
notifying Chinese embassies in foreign countries to issue visas
directly to Tibet-bound tourist groups.

But, for the convenience of independent tourists already in China
who wish to visit Tibet and may be unaware of the restriction, the
Tibetan Tourism Bureau has opened information offices in Chengdu,
Xi'an and Golmud, a railhead in northwestern Qinghai province where
overland travellers transfer to buses for the long onward ride to
Lhasa. There is also an office in Kathmandu. All these offices can
issue visas on the spot to foreign travel agents and foreign
independent tourists who have grouped together, after necessary
contacts have been made with local Tibetan agencies.

"In principle, Tibet doesn't allow nor receive individual
international tourists," says an official of the Tibetan Tourism
Bureau. "However, quite a number of them just travel overland from
ports on the China-Nepal border or Golmud." The local government
urges such tourists, who often display their adventurous spirit by
managing to travel across the formidable but challenging Tibetan
Plateau by bus - or even bicycle - to form groups upon their
arrival in Lhasa. To provide for their likely needs, a special
travel agency was set up in 1994. Called Lhasa Minjian (meaning
non-official) Travel Agency, the unit can make travel arrangements
for their further exploration of Tibet.

"A lot of individual international travellers come and go without
letting us know," comments a Tibetan tourism bureau official,
surmising that most are either unaware of the regulations or
worried that the procedure for obtaining a special visa is too
complicated

However, because Tibetans are eager to boost their tourism industry
and enrich the regional economy, they interpret the term "tourist
group" in the most-flexible way possible. "As a matter of fact, as
few as two people can make up a group," observes one official, "so
it's not a difficult thing.

CHINA: POLICY: Opening up In a New Era: China stays open to foreign funds,
with some policy adjustments 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From Chen Gengtao in Beijing, P.20-21

SEVENTEEN years into the country's opening to the outside world,
more and more Chinese can barely get through a day without using
something whose origin was in a foreign land. They may ride in a
Santana car to work, make long-distance calls with a Motorola
cellular phone, drink Beck's beer and wash their hair with Lux
shampoo.

These products have two things in common: they are all foreign
brands, and they are all made in China - mostly by joint ventures,
a few by wholly-owned foreign manufacturers. The car, for example,
is made by Germany's Volkswagen and its Chinese partner in
Shanghai.

The open policy advocated by retired leader Deng Xiaoping, and
vigorously implemented by the government over the years, has
benefited the Chinese as well as their country. More than 17
million people have found generally well-paid jobs in foreign-
funded enterprises, increasing numbers of them now boasting US
dollar accounts in the bank. Products they consume and use,
including table wines, toothbrushes, shoes, elevators, televisions
and cars, are of far better quality than ever before.

Thanks partly to the presence of foreign businesses which have
brought with them investment capital, technology and management
expertise, the Chinese economy has been able to grow at an annual
average rate of 12 per cent in the last five years. In 1995 alone,
foreign-funded enterprises paid close to 70 billion yuan (US$8.4
billion) in taxes, almost one-tenth of national tax revenues. Also
last year, with its total imports and exports amounting to $280
billion, China ranked 10th among the world's top trading nations.

Its dramatic emergence as a trading nation is due largely to its
open policy: foreign-funded enterprises accounted for about 40 per
cent of total imports and exports last year. In the first quarter
of this year, they rose to 45.9 per cent. And by May this year,
China's foreign exchange reserves reached $85 billion.

The open policy is one of two legs with which China is to achieve
modernization, according to Deng Xiaoping's design. The other leg
is economic reform, which has entered the phase of establishing a
market economy. As China begins to execute its 9th Five-Year Plan
this year, and with the 21st century only five years away, the
government has formulated a development programme covering the next
15 years - a blueprint adopted by the National People's Congress at
its general session last March.

Wider opening: Consistent with the open policy, the programme lays
down a number of principles for the future, the most general one
being to "open wider to the outside world," as Premier Li Peng told
the NPC. Says Lin Qihui, an official of the Special Economic Zones
Office under the central government: "This means primarily that
China will increase its openness in terms of geographical area and
business scope.

"Geographically, we will promote more foreign investment in cities
along major transport lines, and establish foreign investment zones
in provincial capitals. In [terms of] business scope, we will
gradually allow foreign businesses to play a greater role in fields
where they have been more or less restricted, such as mining,
banking, retailing and insurance."

Another principle is to "improve quality" in the actual
implementation of the open policy. This, according to Lin, means
broadening the economic efficiency and returns of all projects
involving foreign investment. Simply, China will become choosier in
approving new projects. "[Those] that use new and high technologies
will be encouraged, and those which pollute the environment
rejected," Lin says, adding that the administration and taxation of
foreign-funded enterprises will be reinforced.

Other major principles include the operation of foreign-funded
investments in accordance with market economics, with future growth
relying mainly on improved management and the use of advanced
technologies rather than on the launching of more projects.

Tariff slash: Preferential policies too will be substituted by
"increasing the vitality" of enterprises, thus giving them the
impetus for future growth. Indeed, from April 1 this year, foreign-
funded enterprises have no longer enjoyed tax exemptions on
imported manufacturing equipment. China has also slashed its tariff
rates from an average 35.9 per cent to 23 per cent.

Economists predict that the revocation of preferential treatment
will not affect foreign-funded operations that rely mainly on
technology. But it will create difficulties for those that have all
along relied mainly on tax breaks for profits. Revocation of these
breaks also means that Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises now
compete on an equal footing, the government says.

With political stability and a huge market, China is confident of
its continued attraction to foreign investors. The government
expects to receive a further $150 billion in foreign direct
investment in the next five years. That is big money indeed, though
a continued influx of such investment is seen as but a natural
widening of foreign interest in China over the past 17 years.

By the end of 1995, China had approved a total of 260,000 foreign-
funded enterprises, almost half of which have gone into operation.
Aggregate foreign investment reached $135 billion, making China the
world's second-largest recipient after the United States.

Coastal zones: Over the years, China has established five Special
Economic Zones along its coast, opened Pudong New Area - a
Singapore-size piece of land wedged between the East China Sea and
Shanghai proper - and established Suzhou Industrial Park, also near
Shanghai, with the Singapore Government as its partner. (Window,
August 9) All have become major centres of foreign investment.

Also playing host to foreign largesse are 32 state-level economic
and technological development zones, mainly in coastal cities. Many
of them have become economic powerhouses, too. In the economic and
technological development zone of Tianjin, a port city in north
China, for example, America's Motorola has been making pagers and
cellular phones in huge quantities and will soon make computer
phones and chips. Its investment in the zone has reached $1
billion.

Foreign-funded operations can now in fact be found almost
everywhere across the country, from Xinjiang in the far northwest
to Hainan Island in the South China Sea, Tibet to Inner Mongolia.
Thanks to paramount leader Deng's open policy, the PRC has become
increasingly economically integrated with the rest of the world.
Now, with the "open wider" policy adopted by the government, there
seems no limit to what the country can achieve in the future.

CHINESE MEDIA: What The Chinese Papers Say: Qian Misquoted: Distortion of
what Qian said during interview: From a commentary in the Ta Kung Pao,
October 18 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

IN REPLY to questions from staff reporters of the Asian Wall Street
Journal as to whether demonstrations to commemorate the June 4
incident be allowed in Hong Kong after 1997, Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said: "Hong Kong should not hold those
political activities which directly interfere in the affairs of the
mainland of China."

On the question of Hong Kong media being critical of Chinese
politics or leaders, Qian replied: "They can put forward criticism,
but not rumours or lies. Nor can they put forward personal attacks
on Chinese leaders."

As it is clear from the context of the report, Qian said no more
than to reiterate China's consistent position of implementing the
"one country, two systems" scenario and the principle of Hong Kong
people ruling Hong Kong.

But it should be remembered the vital importance of respect for the
rule of law and the counsel of "keeping well water and river water
separate" if the "one country, two systems" scenario is not to be
undermined.

While it is important that the mainland should not interfere in the
capitalist system and way of life in Hong Kong, nor should Hong
Kong interfere in the mainland's socialist system. Respect for each
other provides the space for each to conduct their affairs in their
own way.

Enshrined in the Basic Law, the letter and spirit of these
principles, are accepted by the vast majority of Hong Kong people.

In reiterating these principle, Qian had no intention of suggesting
that the China is tightening its control of Hong Kong. There is no
cause to stir up a storm in a teacup from what Qian told the staff
reporters of the AWSJ.

The incident of Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe and the media fervour
it created in Hong Kong is blatantly a case of interfering in
China's internal affairs. Moreover it also violated the territory's
immigration laws.

CHINESE MEDIA: What The Chinese Papers Say: Time to Move: It is time to
seek return of the Diaoyus: From an editorial in the Sing Tao Daily News,
October 16 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By GERALD CHEN, P.19

SO FAR the moderate stance maintained by Beijing with regard to the
Diaoyu issland issue has caused considerable misunderstanding among
Chinese within China as well as abroad. Under these circumstances,
we were heartened by news conveyed recently by Hong Kong members of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from top
Chinese leaders that Beijing is prepared "to lose a thousand ounces
of gold, rather than give in an inch to territory" - quoting a
Chinese proverb. This reassuring message can be understood to mean
that all necessary strategic precautions have been put in place by
China.

It was disclosed that Chia did not refrain from from demanding the
immediate return of the Diaoyus for economic reasons. More
important, it was because of the wrongful involvement of the US in
the Diaoyus issue that a settlement must wait until "an appropriate
time," although it is still unknown when that appropriate time
would be.

In his written reply to the Japanese media last week, Chinese Vice-
Premier (and foreign minister) Qian Qichen stated that in both
agreements signed between China and Japan in l972 and 1978 it was
agreed that the Diaoyu issued should be shelved and its settlement
should be left to posterity. This commitment was the greatest
hindrance to efforts seeking the return of the Diaoyus.

But now that Japan has categorically denied that there ever was
such an understanding, it stands to reason that China no longer
need to feel bound by any commitment and would be in a position to
seek the return of these islands. Indeed, it might be taken as a
sign of weakness to be taken advantage of by Japan if China were to
continue with its hitherto mild stance on the issue.

It is true that China must tread carefully because of the US
involvement. However, as one can gather from the US spokesman's
statements on the subject, Washington does not wish to get further
involved in this issue, most probably because it has realized its
mistake in placing the Diaoyus under the administration of Okinawa
in 1971.

The present international climate makes it mandatory for
territorial disputes to be resolved without the use of armed force.
In the case of the Diaoyus, resorting to the use of force can only
give Japan additional excuse to expand its military build-up, which
would not be in interest of regional stability.

Many are in China's favour in its dispute with Japan over the
Diaoyus if the issue is sorted out without the use of force.
Historians know that the Diaoyus used to be under the jurisdiction
of Taiwan. The island group never had anything to do with Okinawa
at all. This is not only because the Diaoyus were formally
designated as a part of Taiwan in 1862; evidence of this can also
be found in Okinawan and Japanese  history books.

Japan most probably first decided to seize the Diaoyus in 1894,
although it was the Shimonoseki Treaty signed at the end of Sino-
Japanese War of 1895 which ended in China's humiliating defeat that
put the Diaoyus under the administration of Okinawa. Taiwan was
also annexed by Japan as a result of the Shimonoseki Treaty.

When the US took over Okinawa after World War II, the Diaoyus were
also considered within the administration of Okinawa. Okinawa and
the Diaoyus were "handed back" to Japan by virtue of an US-Japanese
agreement signed in 1971.

The point is, Japan's claim to the Diaoyus was already nullified
because the unequally Shimonoseki Treaty had been abolished (by the
Cairo Agreement of 1943 and the Potsdam Agreement of 1945). There
is no legal basis whatsoever to Japan's sovereign claim to the
Diaoyu islands.

Although, properly speaking, administration of the Diaoyus should
still belong to Taiwan, it stands to reason that any diplomatic
effort seeking the return of these islands can only be conducted by
China with Japan.

No doubt Japan is not about to give up it claim to the Diaoyus
easily.

But all reason is on China's side, in the light of international
laws and otherwise, even if the issue goes before international
tribunal.

COMMENTARY: BACKSTREET JAPAN: Child Abuse 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By R.J. GUTHRIE, P.18

UNSOLICITED solicitations in the daily post for everything from
home-delivered masseuses to bargain leases on BMWs is another
unwelcome sign of Japan's wealth. Many make interesting reading.
Some are downright scary, like a recent deluxe mailing telling me
about a pre-kindergarten for one-year-olds. Since our youngest is
in his third year at university I almost threw it away. But then I
noticed the glossy colour pictures showing something that looked
more like an upscale athletic club than a creche. So I read its
pitch.

It seems this particular school is telling Japanese mothers that
it's never too young to get on the education treadmill; that their
children should start learning something now and begin mastering
those particular skills eventually needed to get them accepted by
Tokyo or Waseda universities. Some may call this progress. I tend
to see it as child abuse, and another example of a society blessed
with more money than sense.

Preschool education has been a big business in Japan for quite some
time and has become a lucrative business for entrepreneurs more
concerned with bottom lines than children. At last count, there
were 8,600 privately run kindergartens in Japan with 77,800
teachers and an enrolment of 1.47 million.. This is more than four
times the number of public-run facilities.

Some of the "top rated" kindergartens have unofficial ties with
universities in that X kindergarten is a stepping stone to X
elementary school, then X middle school, and finally X high school
leading to entrance in X university 15 years later. These
kindergartens can cost up to US$1,300 to $2,000 per month,
including "unofficial" and supplemental fees, and entrance is as
competitive as it is at Oxford or Harvard.

Education mamas: Sound ridiculous? Well, it doesn't to Japan's
millions of kyoikyu (education) mamas, the hybrid Japanese noun
used to describe and decry those mothers whose sole purpose in life
is to ensure their children pass the entrance examinations at a top
university. These are the mothers that send their six-year-old to
juku or privately run cram schools for around three hours a day
after school, six and sometimes seven days a week.

The accent is not on personal enlargement or even acquiring
knowledge. Rather it is on rote mastery of the material of and ways
needed to pass entrance examinations to the more desirable schools
that requires living for 15 years in the "examination hell'" as the
Japanese themselves call this process. This disquieting phenomenon
has now, it seems, filtered down to the toddler level.

Kiysohi Takara, a clinical psychologist, recently published a book
with the rather ponderous title Warning! Dangerous Preschool
Education - A Clinical Report condemning the sort of services being
provided by the kindergarten that sent me its glossy catalogue. Dr
Takara says that while education at a young age is not the only
cause of children's problems, it does cause them to lose any spirit
of independence. It puts heavy pressure on them and drives them on
to a sort of mental treadmill. Parents are forcing their young
children to become "smart" and the children feel an immense
pressure to do what they are being told - to live up to "A-grade"
expectations at their kindergartens, for example. This, in turn,
places a terrible burden on the parent-child relationship. As
preschool education drives children to go faster and higher than
others, they lose self-confidence in the process and feel more
restless. This accumulates a tremendous amount of stress and more
and more children are even "losing the ability to cry as an SOS
signal."

Other, equally respected experts have been saying for years that
children who are forced to use their brains too much in the early
stages of development lack emotional stability. There are dozens of
published case studies on three-year-olds suffering from stress.
This is disturbing, even in a country where dying of overwork is
officially classified as an "occupational hazard."

Even more worrying is that a vast number of parents see nothing
basically wrong with the present accent on education, and believe
that schooling is the means to all desirable ends. As Japan's
wealth has multiplied and the extended family declined, many
parents have abrogated their responsibilities for child-rearing to
the schools. Whatever the reason, the young people today are
worrying their elders like never before. The first, spoiled progeny
of Japan's economic boom and the sons and daughters of the
prototype "education mamas" are now in their early twenties. They
see themselves as Japan's first "lost generation."

Several immensely popular television shows make big advertising
dollars by making fun of them. One regularly spotlights fashionable
young women who take an almost perverse pride in not being able to
boil an egg or fry rice. While presented as comedy, such shows are
giving a once-satisfied older generation another reason to worry
about where they have gone wrong.

Critics more serious than those who appear on television - which in
Japan includes your average cabdriver, bottle washer, and noodle
cook - see the rise of the Aum Shinrikyo subway-gassers and dozens
of less homicidal yet equally strange cults as natural outgrowths
of fallen educational and parental values.

Today's younger people feel a spirit-sucking emotional and
philosophical vacuum in modern Japan. Most of my son's more
intelligent friends have no intention of becoming part of the
economic juggernaut that their elders worked so hard to build. I
like to think this is a hopeful sign, and that tomorrow's Japan
will be a lot more human, a little more green, and a lot less self-
centred. I do know for certain that none of them will ever dream of
sending their one-year-olds to a fast-track kindergarten.

COMMENTARY: WINDOW FORUM: Arrogance of a Ruler 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.16

SZE CHEUNG PANG: Member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference and one of the earliest investors in China.
Sze is an authority on economic development in China and Hong Kong
and has published many articles on the subject.

SOON after Governor Chris Patten came to Hong Kong, he pushed for
political reform and set in motion a Sino-British argument. This
was condemned by former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser,
writing in an Australian newspaper, who said that Patten was trying
to teach China how to manage its own country, and pointing out
Patten's ulterior and destructive intention.

Patten immediately rebutted, explaining that he only wished to
stage a "fair election," and not teach China how to administer. But
Patten completely forgets this statement and continues to dictate
to China how it should manage the Hong Kong Special Administrative
region. The degree of arrogance and ignorance is simply beyond
forbearance.

Patten uses the term "successor" throughout his policy address for
the first chief executive of the SAR. This is also a demonstration
of utter stupidity. The resumption of sovereignty of China over
Hong Kong means an absolute end of British colonial rule, and a
start of a new era for Hong Kong.

There is nothing in the handover that suggests a political nature
of continuance or succession between the governor and the SAR chief
executive. Handover of sovereignty is to be carried out between
Britain and China, and the first chief executive will receive his
authority from China, and not from the governor.

Patten's statement violates the rules governing the handing over of
Hong Kong's authority as stipulated in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration. He is continuing to stir up public opinion on
"returning rule to Hong Kong people."

Patten's rule of Hong Kong is not up to standard. He is therefore
not qualified to talk about "Hong Kong's success story" or "the
principles of governing Hong Kong."

Basic Law guide: Furthermore, he deliberates on the necessity of
China signing two international covenants. This is absurd. In his
policy address, he listed out 10 key elements for future SAR plans
and 16 benchmarks for judging the future Hong Kong. The chief
executive has the Basic Law as guiding principles of
administration; the Basic Law is also the best benchmark for
appraisal. The 10 elements and the 16 benchmarks are already
embodied in the Basic Law.

In the section on the 16 benchmarks, Patten let himself go and in
many places talks about "pressure by Peking; "objectives dictated
by Peking" and makes other high-sounding but meaningless points. He
speaks as if the decisive factor for Hong Kong's future success
lies in whether it can act against Beijing. His ulterior motive is
obvious, and is particularly strong at this moment when his leaving
is imminent.

Patten refers to Hong Kong's autonomy several times in the policy
address. He says that before Britain leaves Hong Kong, it, besides
trying its best to retain a certain value, will also strive to make
sure that Hong Kong will enjoy autonomy in social and economic
affairs as at present.

He also insists, "my anxiety is this: not that this community's
autonomy would be usurped by Peking, but that it could be given
away bit by bit by some people in Hong Kong," and calls on Hong
Kong people to "defend and assert" for autonomy. An English
governor, endowed with absolute power to fulfil colonial rule in
Hong Kong, deliberates on autonomy!

Slave-master: This is just like a slave-master talking about
autonomy to his slaves, and is the most ludicrous farce under
heaven. It is simply deceptive to say that Hong Kong has autonomy.
Hong Kong people don't even have the right to elect their governor,
and final judicial judgement lies with Britain; where does autonomy
comes in?

Hong Kong will have autonomy only after its return to China. At
present there does not exist a problem as to who has ruined Hong
Kong's autonomy. Hong Kong's autonomy is granted by China, so there
would not be a problem of its being "usurped by Peking." Patten
bases these opinions on visits by some Hong Kong people to Beijing,
which he calls "surreptitious appeal" or "closed-door lobbying,"
and that "it draws Chinese officials into matters which should fall
squarely within the autonomy of Hong Kong."

This is simply absurd. It is in Hong Kong people's interest to
stand by the Chinese Government to counteract the damage and
interruption caused by Patten on Hong Kong's smooth transition.
This is fair and embodies Hong Kong people's responsibility as
masters of the place. We who have been under colonial rule will no
longer be submissive subjects at Britain's beck and call. In the
eyes of Patten, this is the worst heresy. This clearly reveals his
true picture as a guardian of colonialism.

That an ignorant and arrogant British politician has a chance to
fan flames of disorder at the final stage of Hong Kong's transition
is in itself a misfortune brought about by history.

What is fortunate is that Hong Kong people are more and more aware
of the real colours of Patten, and have completely forsaken him.

Lu Xun, a great Chinese author, once said: "Some people wish to be
immortal, but rot more quickly than the earth." Patten is exactly
such a figure.

HONGKONG: HEALTH: Patten Dogged by UK Rabies Control Law: Pet pooches face
long confinement 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From CHRIS JASPER in London, P.15

CHRIS Patten has once again been accused of exploiting his position
as governor of Hong Kong in order to intervene in British politics
- this time on behalf of his pet dogs Whisky and Soda.

In November last year Patten backed UK tax cuts and the
Conservative Party's lurch to the right in a move seemingly in
contradiction of his required neutrality as a civil servant. The
comments led to calls for his resignation.

And last week the governor threw himself into UK politics for a
second time when he gave a high-profile interview in which he
called for the scrapping of quarantine laws aimed at keeping the
killer disease rabies out of Britain.

Patten had made remarks critical of quarantine in the past - and in
May he was accused of making a personal plea to former cabinet
colleagues for a change in the law, the details of which Window can
now confirm.

The governor's most recent outburst followed the revelation that
British agriculture minister Douglas Hogg had proposed a review of
the world's toughest rabies controls, in force since 1901.

Passports: Details of the proposed move to a "passports-for-pets"
scheme - featuring strict vaccination and blood testing and animal
identification by means of implanted microchips - were circulated
to cabinet ministers last month. And when the controversial plan
was later leaked to the press, Patten popped up to endorse it.

"Like thousands of diplomats, service and business families around
the world, I feel the present British quarantine rules are
preposterous," he told The Times in an interview conducted on
October 13. "And yes, I have told the prime minister what I think."

Patten added: "There is just no scientific basis for them and they
risk cruelty to animals. But with new safeguards we can get rid of
the rules without undermining public health."

Unfortunately for the governor and his two Norfolk terriers, even
the reformers envisage abandoning quarantine only for European
Union countries and rabies-free islands such as Cyprus and Malta.
And though Hong Kong is notionally rabies free, it is no island.

Desperate to win his pampered pooches a reprieve from the
compulsory six-months behind bars - cost around 2,000 (HK$24,000)
per dog - Patten was moved to call for the extension of the scheme
world-wide.

"I think it would be very curious if they applied it just to the EU
and not generally," he said. "Provided the animals carry a
microchip, have been inoculated, have a certificate, and are tested
on arrival in Britain, it should not make too much difference which
country they come from."

In its front-page article, The Times also indicated that Patten
hoped Britain would reach cross-party consensus on the issue before
his dogs were forced into kennels next summer, while Government
House sought to make light of his remarks. "The governor has
basically said the same thing over and over again," said a
spokesman. "And though he's definitely going to bring Whisky and
Soda back to UK, he understands that any change in the law will be
too late for him."

Perhaps - but a personal approach made by Patten earlier this year
and reported in The Spectator on May 25 suggests that he will not
give up that easily. Discussing the quarantine debate, the magazine
remarked: "The word in Westminster is that Patten has been making
noises on the subject to Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine."

Window can now reveal that those "noises" were made when the
governor was visiting Britain and had a private chat with
Heseltine, during which he suggested that diplomats and others
should be partly exempt from the quarantine law.

Says a source: "What Patten wanted was some sort of fast-track
through quarantine of the type being demanded by army officers
serving in Cyprus. They seem to think they are more deserving than
- let us say - the 70,000 Britons living in Spain."

Significantly, new government pointers this week suggest that a
universal fast-track quarantine of just two months is under
consideration, and that Patten may get his way - although whether
any changes could be made before next June is debatable. Either
way, the governor's stance on the issue has already made him new
enemies in Britain, with Guy Tamplin, chairman of the Quarantine
Kennel Owners Association, accusing him of a "gross misuse of his
public position."

Says Tamplin: "He's abusing his job to campaign in his own
interests. And he's a government appointee, so it's not even as if
he can claim to be expressing the views of constituents. Let's hope
he didn't employ public funds or time in pursuing this personal
crusade."

"One of the animals once went missing for four days," he recalls.
"And the other was locked up for biting someone. On top of that
there is virulent hook worm in Hong Kong, so I don't think their
case is very strong." Tamplin also calls into question the
effectiveness of anti-rabies vaccines, claiming that in many cases
they fail to produce enough antibodies. Yet his objections will
count for little if the Ministry of Agriculture has made up its
mind.

But though new legislation may be in the pipeline, Patten must
place Whisky and Soda in kennels in January to be sure of a July
reunion. And as the pair will be required for myriad photo
opportunities when he resumes his political career, their early
departure still seems likely.

HONGKONG: WELFARE: Home-alone Law Plea: Handover hampers Legco
deliberations 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By JUANITO CONCEPCION, P.14

WHEN home-alone Chan Chi-ho, aged five, almost burned to death a
week ago in a padlocked public housing flat in Kwai Chung, the
community was understandably outraged - rightly feeling that
locking up small children and leaving them unattended, even for a
short period, is unforgivable because it is a blatantly
irresponsible invitation to tragedy.

Despite the appalling burns to 60 per cent of the child's body and
the collective outrage it generated, chances are that a similar or
even more serious accident will occur in coming months, warn child
welfare activists. For Chan was far from the first child to be left
in such a situation, witness the prosecutions and resultant wide
publicity of recent years, but some parents never learn.

Activists' fears stem from three major factors: the ineptitude of
relevant government departments, glaring loopholes in different
pieces of legislation on child welfare and protection, and the
irresponsibility of parents themselves.

Under current laws, a parent or guardian who leaves a child
unattended is not liable to any penalty, even if the victim dies or
is injured in an accident - serious or otherwise.

Grey area: Says Cynthia Luk, division supervisor at St James
Settlement: "It's [the practice of leaving children unattended] a
grey area, and it's not prosecutable right now because it doesn't
fall under any ordinance. Unless it's defined clearly in the law as
a form of child abuse, I don't think there will be a strong and
effective deterrent against this malpractice." She says St James
has yet to firm up its position on this issue.

In the past, the group has always advocated education rather than
prosecution as a more effective tool in addressing problematic
issues. The volunteer agency believes that prosecuting erring
parents can be counter-productive as it can generate their
hostility and anger, and make reunion with their children more
difficult.

Luk concedes, however, that while some parents change through
education, others do not respond despite reminders and warnings of
the consequences of leaving their children unattended. "There are
hindrances in Chinese society and culture in resolving problems
involving parents and their children," she says. "Chinese people
are moderate, and very reluctant to resort to legal action.

"If legislation is passed, the consequences of penalties that would
be imposed on adults, or the parents, would have to be carefully
considered as they may adversely affect the welfare and interests
of their children."

The community's ambivalence over this issue was clearly
demonstrated when the government sponsored a public consultation
more than a year ago on how home-alone children could best be
protected. Luk recalls that the consultation exercise failed to
produce a consensus on a way forward.

Against-Child-Abuse director Priscilla Lui argues that the act of
leaving children unattended should fall under neglect - one of the
four classifications of child abuse currently punishable under the
law. The others embrace the physical, psychological and sexual.

However, the Home Affairs Branch is reluctant to define home-alone
situations as a form of child abuse, Lui asserts. HAB is
responsible for overseeing the implementation of the package of
legislation, passed in July last year on child care and protection.

She says: "Nobody wants to penalize anybody, especially if a home-
alone child dies. Nobody wants to impose a further burden on the
party who is responsible for a tragedy. What we're saying is that
defining home-alone situations doesn't mean jailing anybody. It's
simply putting a problem in focus which can be likened to a doctor
making a diagnosis that helps him determine the right remedy to a
medical problem."

She stresses the importance of classifying home-alone cases as a
form of child abuse because it will set a baseline in the community
on how young children should properly be taken care of. "Our real
intention is to see better and more effective protection for
children, not erring parents and child minders being placed behind
bars."

ACA has recommended an increase in the options for punishing erring
parents and guardians of home-alone children. These include advice
or reprimand; payment of fines; rendering community service; and
jail.

Luk complains that Hong Kong, unlike the US, Canada and other
Western countries, does not have comprehensive legislation for
protecting and promoting the rights of children, as well as
vigorously tackling the problem of child abuse.

As Legco's agenda is full for its final session before next year's
handover, the prospects of it adopting new legislation that
addresses the home-alone problem does not look promising, says Luk.

ACA's Lui concurs, even as she laments the seemingly high level of
tolerance among policymakers and the community over tragic the
tragic incidence of children being badly injured while locked up at
home and left unattended by their parents or guardians.

At its 13th conference in Geneva early this month, the United
Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child attacked Hong Kong's
poor record in protecting and promoting the rights of children. The
UK, a signatory to the (separate) UN Convention on the Rights of
the Child, filed a report on behalf of Hong Kong.

Legco also slammed the government's shortcomings in a report it
tabled at the Geneva conference which criticized the government's
statistics on child abuse and neglect as incomplete and
uncoordinated. It is thus doubtful if the figures, says the report,
"present a true picture of the problem."

The Legco report also quoted the coroner's 1994 statistics which
showed there were 113 deaths between 1989 and 1994 involving
unattended children under the age of nine.

HONGKONG: EDUCATION: Instilling the Blithe Spirit of Learning: Plan to
drive boredom out of classroom 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By ANNA YUE, P.12-13

A BLACKBOARD revolution is set to sweep over the curriculum for
local secondary school students - a wide-ranging Education
Department initiative to make their studies more fun, thus more
effective. As a result, bored-with-school youngsters could find
themselves chalking up far better grades than ever before.

The fun-factor innovation was disclosed by Brenda Lo, secretary of
a department steering committee set up in mid-1993 to "coordinate
the design and implementation of appropriate curricula and related
activities to promote pleasurable and effective learning" - a
concept whose various components are geared towards the common goal
of making learning a happier experience.

A joint survey by the Education Department and the University of
Hong Kong's curriculum studies department of 610 students from all
types of school shows that only 30 per cent of secondary pupils
find studying enjoyable. Sixty per cent describe it as "OK," while
the remainder confess to being unhappy about studying anyway.

The majority of respondents agree that a school's study environment
and the relationship between friends, family members and teachers
can greatly affect their study mood. The most important factors
affecting their motivation to study were the teaching method and
atmosphere of the school.

Experiences: Conducted in 1994, the survey was in two parts. In the
first, students were asked to list and rank their pleasant and
unpleasant experiences, and factors leading to them. Questionnaires
for the second part were set according to the results of the first.
The final report of the survey, still under review, will be
produced late next month. Its release will coincide with a November
29 seminar for secondary school principals and teachers who will
discuss the findings and share experiences on the promotion of
pleasurable and effective learning.

Lo emphasizes that the focus of the survey was both how much
students enjoy studying, and how effectively they learn - both
aspects being of equal importance. She says there is a chance the
Education Department will change the design of the curriculum to
reinforce students' learning motive, and make studying fun. "This
is exactly the goal of the survey," she says. "Because it found
that the relationship with friends and teachers can influence
students' interest in learning, we would bear these factors in mind
when redesigning the curriculum to make learning fun and effective
for them."

Betty Wong, who has taught Form 1-4 at Chinese Holiness College for
three years, believes many students do not find studying
pleasurable because of off-school attractions such as karaoke and
video games. "Another reason is related to the problems that
teachers face. The curriculum is often boring and difficult, and
not many teachers are able to make it lively for students," she
says. "Teachers have a very heavy workload; apart from teaching,
there is a huge amount of administrative work, so there is no time
left to prepare interesting, motivating material for students."

Wong also points to parent-child relationships as a cause of
students' lack of motivation. Many of her own students have no
siblings. "They are neglected by parents, and usually brought up by
grandparents. They are spoiled and lack discipline. During class,
some day-dream and others talk or sleep." She feels that such
children lack self-confidence, and are deserving of the concern and
encouragement of teachers.

She recalls a successful case with a student who had a poor
academic record. After he was charged with organizing some extra-
curricular activities, his self-esteem greatly improved -
triggering pleasure in his studies and better academic results.

Ankey Wun, a teacher for six years and currently involved in
teacher-training for target-oriented curricula, agrees there are
many reasons for students' inability to learn happily and
effectively. For example, the Education Department's limited
resources restrict secondary students with poor academic records
from repeating a grade more than twice. "Some students need to
repeat more than this," he argues, "but as the system does not
allow it, they cannot catch up in an upper form. This adversely
affects their enjoyment of study."

Wun also points to the transitory teenage years, when boys and
girls are developing independence. "But the Hong Kong educational
system does not encourage independent thinking," he says. "This
limits their strengths and preferences, such as creativity. As they
are not allowed to develop independence in school, it leads to
dissatisfaction." He notes that as many teachers do not hold
education certificates, they may not know the correct way to teach
effectively.

Wun's solution: a more flexible curriculum, which is part of his
role in his current post in aiming to improve the level of
happiness and effectiveness in learning. Under target-oriented
curricula - at present restricted to primary students - youngsters
are taught through activities such as games and competitions, using
examples from daily life to better explain concepts and ideas.

Ultimately, it is believed, students' interests are aroused and
their performance improved. Wun says the Education Department plans
to introduce this method to secondary schools in 2001. Meanwhile,
he hopes more clerks can be employed to relieve teachers'
administrative burdens.

Student view: Window spoke with various secondary students
including, during his mid-morning break, Daniel Kwan, who is in F2
at Kowloon Wah Yan College. Kwan says he is happy with school life,
and particularly delighted with the new-found freedom he finds at
secondary level. "In primary school there were so many restrictions
and lots of regimentation, like forming proper lines to go into
assembly" he recalls. "But now that I'm here, I'm free. I don't
have to queue any more, which I always hated."

He also enjoys classes because "teachers are very humorous and
often tell jokes, which make us laugh. I enjoy studying [here]
since the environment is very good. The teachers are concerned
about us, and talk to us individually to see if we are coping with
our studies. And there is a quiet library when we want to study,
and a basketball court, soccer pitch and swimming pool when we want
to play with our classmates, who are also our friends." Kwan admits
his parents pressure him about his studies, but says his
relationship with them is good.

In contrast to Kwan, Wong Wing Ho and Dan Ny Luk - F1 students at
Chong Gene Hang College - view their study environment merely as
"OK" because they are unhappy with some schoolmates' behaviour.
"When we queue for lunch at the canteen, some of them always jump
ahead of us," complains Wong. Adds Dan: "Some often chat with each
other during class, and this interrupts our learning process
because the teachers have to stop teaching to scold them."

Monica Wan, an F7 science student at St Gloria Girls' School, also
classifies learning as "OK," claiming the tight syllabus of the
HKCEE and A-levels "suffocate" her. "Both public exams require me
to digest a large volume of information within a very short time,"
she says. "Unfortunately, some teachers do not have the patience to
teach. They just prepare a whole bunch of written material and ask
us to read it by ourselves. It's really hard to learn without their
guidance. But as an upper form student, I think I should learn to
study independently."

Noting that most of her science teachers are male, she wonders if
they know how to express concern toward students. This said, she is
happy with her relationships with her family and classmates.

F3 students Joey Lau and Fiona Leung of True Light Girls' College
say their school life is "below average" since they think their
school too small and because there are many dictation sessions,
mini-exams and other tests every week.

Agreeing that a school's teaching methods affect their study
motivation, they say: "Some teachers give daily life examples,
personal experiences and even tell stories to explain ideas. This
makes studying fun. But some teachers just read straight from
books."

HONGKONG: WELFARE: Elderly Not Fed Up With Daily Allowance: Life at the
bottom on SWD allocation 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By BETSY MAY VELOO, P.10-11

IT IS as far a cry from a banquet as you can get when 75-year-olds
Ng Hing-sing and friend Pang Chak-kui seat themselves at a small
table in the former's tiny Shek Kip Mei flat and dig into their
evening meal - rice with hints of scrambled egg and tomatoes, and a
shared four-cm sliver of salted fish left over from some days
before.

No soup, gentlemen? "It would cost $40 to $50 if we made soup,"
says Ng. "We will wait until there are more friends with us, then I
can cook soup" - shorthand for the poverty-line reality that making
a pan of soup is a finely balanced economic proposition as much as
a nutritional need. But that's how you think when the daily food
allowance doled out to you by the Social Welfare Department is
calculated at $23 per day - or $7.60 a meal.

The diners had bought their eggs for a dollar apiece, though they
could have saved a whole 20 cents on each had they scrabbled around
stalls in other districts. But that would have entailed transport
costs.

Inferior stuff: The slightly discoloured tomatoes are part of a
pack of five bought by Ng for $4. Had the men wanted pork,
unavailable in the tiny amounts suitable to their budget, it would
have cost $8-10. Fish too is expensive at their level of existence,
so for one meal it would have meant something low grade at around
$10.

Salted fish, the friends note, can cost $60-70 so it is eked out in
tiny amounts over a few weeks. Fresh vegetables are a rarity on
this particular table. But that doesn't stop them from sometimes
splashing out $2 or $3 for some stale greens.

Ng can cook - which makes him luckier than most of the single
elderly. He lives in public housing and has a refrigerator which
SKM Kei Oi Social Service Centre, run by volunteers, helped him
acquire. Thus he is able to economize slightly by buying "that
little bit more" and keeping it relatively fresh.

Friend Pang's world is a bedspace cubicle, where cooking is banned.
Unless invited for tea or a larger meal by Ng, he has to shop for
his own food. A lunch box of plain white rice with a string of
green vegetable - and perhaps two pieces of meat - sets him back
$18-20. A plain soup noodle with two wonton dumplings costs about
the same.

Thus he buys $2 buns for breakfast, sometimes plain congee for $4.
If he wants fried flour sticks (yau char kui) to go with his
congee, it costs an additional $4. Pang says in order to stretch
his finances he has only two meals a day.

What about fruits? Ng and Pang reply with one voice: "Too
expensive." But they say they try to buy a few grapes or oranges
"once in a while." What then about yum cha, for which Hong Kong is
famed? "I can't remember when I last had it," says Pang, without
rancour. "It's been so long."

So can elderly people reasonably be expected to survive on $23-
worth of food a day (and disregarding that Hong Kong is one of the
richest but most expensive cities in the world)? A government
report on the Review of the Comprehensive Social Security
Assistance Scheme says they can. (The scheme was set up to help
those in financial need.)

According to Dr M. F. Leong, president of the Association of
Gerontology, people must - in order to maintain a healthy body -
have at least two main meals a day, comprising cereals or rice,
bread, meat or meat-related products, vegetables and fruits.

The government report's arithmetic is that a single elderly person
can survive on $688-worth of food a month - hence the average $23 a
day, or $7.60 a meal.

Survival: Professor Stewart MacPherson of City University agrees
with the report's findings, but only to a point. "An elderly person
can survive on $23-worth of meals per day," he says. "That is clear
from the many thousands who do so every day in Hong Kong. But can
they live? My calculation of the 'minimum acceptable' level of food
gives a figure of $34 per day for an elderly person at today's
prices. This is still not generous, and is a minimum standard."

He explains: "The major difference between SWD calculations and
mine is that they exclude all food except that required for
survival. I try to take some account of real life to allow some
dignity in social life for old people."

Suvan Law of the voluntary social service centre is "appalled" at
the SWD allocation. "I don't know what [the government] was
thinking. Imagine having only $7.60 to spend on a meal. This may be
one of the reasons why old people have no money to buy healthy
foods." She has on earlier occasions accused the government of
ignorance in its calculation of people's basic needs. "Government
officers really don't know how the elderly live, what they eat or
how they try to save by buying low-quality food," she charges.

In scrimping, many of the elderly forego social events such as
picnics or trips to other districts. "That is why so many of them
are found in parks - their only social life," says Law.

Dr S. Y. Au, president of the Hong Kong Geriatric Society, relates
how his elderly patients save money. "I received some tips from
them, like don't boil water," he says. "Just drink tap water to
save energy. When cooking, prepare enough for two meals so that,
again, fuel is saved. Afterwards, don't put leftover food in the
fridge as more energy is required to warm it up."

While the inventiveness of the elderly in cutting financial corners
is admirable, it should not detract from the harsh fact that a
proper diet is as important to them as a babe in arms. As Au says:
"These people are more prone to disease, and so have to pay
particular attention to their diet."

But, given the amounts they are presently expected to manage on,
can they do so, ask social workers? The CSSA payment for a single
elderly person was increased last April to $1,935 per month from
$1,810 - a jump of seven per cent, said by the government to be
pegged to inflation.

"But things today are so much more expensive, especially for the
elderly," argues Law. In addition to higher quality food, they by
far prefer Chinese herbal medicines which can cost anywhere between
$100-150. And while public hospital services are virtually free for
CSSA recipients, the queues are long.

Au says that, sometimes, the problems of the elderly might not so
much be lack of money as lack of knowledge about the availability
of resources. "The problem is that many may not know what these
resources are, and how to access them. We therefore need to
increase publicity," he suggests.

There is another side to receiving welfare, he says. Many of the
elderly can be quite proud when it comes to seeking financial aid
from the government. One example is a 76-year-old woman who buys a
single fish for $5, making it last for two days. She consistently
refuses help, says Au. "She says she has no financial problems, and
says she is used to eating half a fish a day - which she regards as
a good habit." Even an offer of help over a new set of dentures
(minimum cost $800) was refused. "She said she had enough money to
buy her own," says Dr Au.

Law agrees that many of the elderly refuse to live on what they
perceive as charity. Sometime, she admits, social workers have to
convince them that it is their right to ask for financial help from
the government. "It's often a tug-of-war between charity and their
rights. We have to convince them that it is their right to have a
better life after all their years of contributing to society- their
right to live with quality and dignity."

Current SWD payments being what they are, she adds, "dignity"
appears to be a foreign word.

Perhaps, she says, the government should heed MacPherson when he
says that the so-called Basic Needs Approach adopted by the SWD is
"inappropriate in a wealthy modern society such as Hong Kong," and
that it should re-think just how much an elderly person can live on
with dignity.

Says MacPherson: "We should be using standards and measures which
reflect the society we live in. A society may be judged by the way
it treats its old people."

HONGKONG: POLITICS: Li Enters CE Race: Heavyweight contenders ready for
battle 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By BRIAN MACLEOD, P.8

WITH the announcement on Wednesday by retired Appeal Court judge
Simon Li Fook-sean - a 10-year behind-the-scenes veteran of key
transition events and positions - that he has officially joined the
race for the chief executive post, and a similar confirmation by
shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa last weekend, the contest has begun
to take on some really interesting dimensions. In joining Chief
Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang and businessman Peter K.C. Woo, it can be
said that there are now true heavyweights in the ring, giving the
lie to those who proclaim that the selection process would amount
to little more than Beijing bestowing its blessing on the pre-
ordained candidate of its choice.

Although Li has been the last of the four to declare his candidacy,
his decisiveness in doing so stands in marked contrast to the coy
initial approaches made by other aspirants - a decisiveness that no
doubt comes naturally to a former Appeals Court judge.

Firm stand: And decisiveness is not the only quality that sets
candidate Li apart. While all the contestants in the race so far
claim that, as chief executive, they would consider comprehensive
consultation with the community-at-large in aid of reaching
consensus, Li has taken a firm stand in favour of governing Hong
Kong as it has always been governed: "I think that the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region's chief executive's administration
blueprint should include a comprehensive and detailed policy
programme. But this should be based on the existing tradition of
policy-making which has served Hong Kong so well," he says.

He is also candid in saying that he believes this programme cannot
be spelled out in detail at the present time, given that so many of
the variables on which it will ultimately depend will remain
unknown until after the formation of the first SAR government. But
his declaration in favour of maintaining the status quo differs
from the rather more prescriptive policy ideas being put forward by
the other candidates in laying out their vision of Hong Kong's
future.

As Li sees it, the chief executive's primary role will be to
faithfully implement the Basic Law. Otherwise, while he supports
the setting up of the Provisional Legislature simply out of legal
necessity, he would limit the scope of its activity to enacting
only the legislation needed to allow the new SAR government to
function; other legislation would wait to be dealt with in detail
after the establishment of the first elected SAR Legislative
Council.

Li also stands for preserving the apolitical role of the Civil
Service (including the disciplined services,) and ensuring that
civil servants have a solid grasp of the new concepts inherent in
the basic law as a prime expedient in maintaining Hong Kong's
promised autonomy. As well, he takes a holistic view of the way the
SAR will have to be governed, safeguarding the livelihood and
interests of the grassroots on the one hand while ensuring that
Hong Kong remains the investment destination of choice for both
local and international investors. And, not surprisingly, as a
former judge, he is a strong advocate of upholding the rule of law
in the territory.

Tung Chee-hwa, in his long-awaited policy testimonial, wants to
build the new Hong Kong's relationship with the mainland in a
spirit of seeking consensus built on mutual trust: "To stand up for
the interests of Hong Kong does not mean confrontation," he says.
He also laid emphasis on the need to ". . . talk more about our
duties, rather than our rights."

Key role: In his view, the SAR has a key role to play in the
modernization of China, helping it to take its natural place as an
international leader. At the strictly political level, he hopes to
elicit support in achieving the necessary consensus from all
political parties, including the Democrats. More broadly, he feels
that paying closer attention to traditional Chinese cultural values
could go a long way to ensuring a much more harmonious transition,
and they remain, according to Tung, ". . . as relevant today as
they have ever been."

What is more interesting is that the race, in the end, will be
likely to boil down to a choice between a candidate from either the
business or legal communities. And in choosing, Hong Kong will have
taken that all important first step in its journey of a thousand
li.

In predominantly business-oriented Hong Kong, it might seem obvious
that a businessman would be ideal, if only to ensure that one of
Hong Kong's major assets - its profitability - is preserved. But
the very things that make a businessman successful - an intense,
and perhaps somewhat narrow concentration on the bottom line -
could amount to disadvantages in executing what will certainly be
an arduous and many-dimensioned task in heading up the first SAR
government.

A legal person, on the other hand, particularly one who has devoted
a lifetime to serving society on the bench, has of necessity take a
broader view of the complex interactions of society, and through
this is likely to have a more cogent view of the interests of the
various sectors that make it up, both in a local and international
context.

This basic, fundamental choice is what will now make the contest of
compelling interest, both inside and outside Hong Kong.

HONGKONG: CRIME: A Haven for Horrors: Killers lurk among Lantau's hordes
of visitors 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By TOM IGGULDEN, P.6-7

LANTAU is becoming a haven for murderers and kidnappers, police on
the island say. With just one recorded murder last year, six bodies
have been discovered so far this year, according to the Lantau
North Assistant District Commander for crime, Liam Scally.

The island draws thousands of visitors every weekend, attracted by
cheap holiday villas and remote countryside. But the features that
lure the leisurely also make Lantau ideal for those who would avoid
the prying eyes of the cramped city.

Scally says the New Territories used to be the place of choice for
kidnappers to hold their hostages, and for murderers to dump their
victims' remains. But as development encroaches on Yuen Long,
Fanling and other traditional hide-out grounds, criminals are on
the lookout for less conspicuous places to pursue their activities.

Stranger: "With so many visitors coming here anyway, no one is
going to notice a stranger who stays for a weekend or a week," says
Scally. The island's steep hills, remote beaches and out-of-the-way
roads also make ideal terrain for body-dumping.

The body of Chan Lan-kiu, a 34-year-old insurance agent, was the
first to be discovered on the island this year. Her dismembered
corpse was found in about 10 pieces on February 16, more than a
week after it was dumped on a hillside at Ngong Ping.

It may never have been found if one of her alleged killers, Lo Yau-
fuk, 28, had not led police to the site in mid-February, 10 days
after Chan went missing. Chan's meticulous diary allegedly detailed
a scheduled meeting with Lo the day she disappeared.

He was detained at the Lo Wu border crossing attempting to leave
the territory.

Lo and Cheung Moon-keung, 29, are said to have shot Chan, loaded
her body into a van and driven to Shum Wat Road late at night to
dispose of the remains. They are alleged to have held her hostage
in a Mui Wo holiday villa, demanding a $300,000 ransom from her
family. Their trial is scheduled for January.

They have also been charged with two other murders on the island.
Police say they were led to two more bodies, those of Yung Tse-lun
and Chan Chik-yee, bound in cloth and buried under bushes in
shallow graves on a remote hillside at Lai Chi.

Though the area is sparsely populated, the bodies were found about
100m from the doorstep of resident Keith Addison, who has since
moved to Mui Wo.

"Certainly I would never have found them, even though they were so
close," he says. "They were buried and the area is very thick with
vegetation. It was scary to think that someone had come up and
buried these bodies 100 yards from my front door."

In early August, the body of a construction site foreman was found
in an abandoned hut near Tong Fuk pier. He was dressed only in
underpants, his throat had been slashed and he was covered in a
sheet of iron, his clothes beside the body.

Tong Fuk is a popular beach village with several holiday villas.
Police are still working on the case.

Later that month the body of Tam Ngan-hung washed up at Shap Long
Kau Tsuen, also on the popular southern Lantau beach strip. Tam's
naked body had been folded into a nylon bag, and red nylon string
had been tied around her head.

Kowloon West police are still investigating her killing. They
believe her body had been dumped into the sea at another beach on
Lantau.

The sixth killing on the island came to light early last month. Two
mainland workers had apparently fought over money - one battered
the other to death with a spade and later put the body in a plastic
bag and threw it into the sea. It floated for weeks until washing
up at Tung Chung New Town. The surviving mainlander later pleaded
guilty to the murder.

Worried: Addison says island-dwellers are worried about the sudden
surge in violence on Lantau. "They are concerned that among all
these visitors there are murderers and kidnappers. I think most
people think that as long as you leave them alone, they'll leave
you alone, but that doesn't mean they like it."

Andy Tsang, Senior Superintendent for Crime for New Territories
North, who is leading the investigation into the triple killing,
agrees Lantau is now more attractive to criminals than the New
Territories.

"People in the villages here aren't used to seeing a stranger, so
if they do they are more likely to remember it," he says. "I
wouldn't say we have seen a decline in murder in NT North, but I
would imagine it would take a lot longer to discover a body if it
were dumped on Lantau."

However, he says there is insufficient evidence yet to establish
whether a change is in progress. "The sample [six bodies in a year]
is too small too make a trend out of," he adds.

Scally says the island's holiday villas are also used by triad
debt-collectors to hide kidnap victims. "Let's say you run up a
gambling debt in Macau, then you return to Hong Kong rather than
pay it. The loansharks in Macau will sell the debt to their
contacts in Hong Kong, who are a lot more ruthless about collecting
it."

This usually means kidnapping either the debtor or a member of the
family for ransom. Scally says Lantau is increasingly playing host
to these kidnappings.

Tsang says the island is not necessarily the perfect place for
hiding a hostage or dumping a body. The ferry is the only access to
Lantau unless you have your own boat. Tsang says that if police are
able to follow a kidnapping trail to Lantau, finding the hostage
and the kidnapper is easier on the island than in the city. If a
criminal knows police are closing in, a quick getaway from the
island is almost impossible.

Tsang says murderers or kidnappers must also first lure their
victims to the island. A Lantau murder, he says, must be properly
planned and the murderer must have established some sort of
relationship with the victim before setting off for the island.

Extra police: Scally says stationing extra police on the island
would do little to contain the murder rate. All but one of the
killings this year were investigated by non-Lantau police divisions
because the victims were not residents. With throngs of visitors
every weekend, extra police at the Mui Wo ferry pier could do
little to identify "suspicious" characters.

Meanwhile Addison says the sudden jump in murders is a blow mainly
to the island's permanent residents. Addison, a long-time Lantau
resident, says he has always appreciated the island's slow pace of
change, even with the construction of the new airport at Chek Lap
Kok. "I do worry about things like this, though. I think it worries
everyone here."

SPORTS: Rafter Smashes And Grabs Title 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.5

Australia's Patrick Rafter stole the hearts of tennis teenyboppers
and netted US$200,000 as he powered his way to victory in the rain-
delayed final of the Marlboro Championships at Victoria Park on
Monday.

The 23-year-old Queenslander overcame American Vincent Spadea 6-2,
3-6, 6-2, 7-5 to take his first singles title since 1994. Rafter, a
former top 20 player now ranked 56th after an injury-plagued year,
was a clear crowd favourite. Scores of young female fans whoopped
at every point he won, and were "rewarded" by the sweat-soaked T-
shirt he threw into the crowd after clinching victory. Rafter
admitted the fans had given him a boost. "It's the kind of
attention I like. I'd be lying if I said I didn't." His
concentration was also tested by the prospects of a fat pay cheque,
the largest in his career so far. "I was thinking about the sum of
money [during the match] I have to admit. It's hard when you've got
that in your mind and it does make it difficult to play."

Rafter's blistering serves, clever drop volleys and accurate
smashes kept 22-year-old Spadea on the defensive. Ranked 65th in
the world, Spadea pocketed $65,000 for his gritty but, at times,
petulent performance. The American was a lucky entry into the semi-
finals, replacing injured fourth-seed and compatriot Richey
Reneberg to beat Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman.

The championships proved one of the most dramatic in its nine-year
history. Despite one of the strongest line-ups ever, none of the
top four seeds made it into the semi-finals. Lacklustre
performances saw the early exits of world No.1 Pete Sampras of the
US, No.3 Thomas Muster of Austria, and French Open champion and
No.4 Yevgenev Kafelnikov of Russia.

Sampras seemed as stunned as the capacity 4,000 crowd when he bowed
out to world 47th Byron Black of Zimbabwe in straight sets, 6-4, 6-
2. He later reflected: "I just couldn't get my game going. I was
digging a hole deeper and deeper with a lot of unforced errors."
But he denied that as it was a non-official ATP tournament, his
heart hadn't been in the match. "I play to win, I don't want to
lose to anyone. It hurts just as much as, say, losing the US Open."
Black, whose masterful return of serves constantly outwitted the
number one seed, failed to find the same form when he met Rafter in
the next round. The champion won 6-2, 5-7, 6-3.

Unseasonal heavy rains postponed the final by a day, allowing 2,500
fans to watch for free. The unseeded finalists proved the silver
lining in the dark clouds as higher-ranked players would have been
unlikely to play beyond Sunday due to other commitments.

CHINA DIARY: Making arduous efforts for the success of a new Long March:
Long March Commemorated 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By DAVID CHEN, P.4

CHINA celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Long March this week
with President Jiang Zemin calling on the nation to carry forward
the revolutionary spirit of the epic event and push forward the
great undertakings initiated by old revolutionaries.

The event was marked by a soiree and a commemoration ceremony on
Monday and Tuesday in the Great Hall of the People, reported
Xinhua.

Sixty years ago, the Red Army, forerunner of the People's
Liberation Army, covered 12,500km, trekking through more than a
dozen provinces and municipalities, defeating numerous attacks by
Kuomintang forces and became strong through their historic feat.

It was in the critical Long March period that the Chinese Communist
Party held the Zunyi meeting, during which Mao Zedong was made the
leader of the Red Army and the party Central Committee, signalling
that the party had become mature, President Jiang told the
gathering at the commemoration ceremony.

He described the Long March as "a brilliant chapter in Chinese
history and the military history of the world."

The president, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party
and chairman of the Central Military Commission, urged party cadres
to follow the examples of the revolutionaries and learn to make
sacrifices, but not to seek comfort.

"It is completely wrong to think that now that we are materially
better off, we no longer need to strive hard and struggle," Jiang
added.

Spiritual force: "The spirit of the Long March," he said, "is a
strong spiritual force that guarantees our marching from victory to
victory."

Looking forward to the next century, President Jiang said the party
had created Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and established the basic line and a
series of principles and policies, as well as a development
strategy in three phases, and a cross-century blueprint.

"The crux of the matter for the moment," Jiang said, "is to fully
implement those lines, principles and policies and make enormous
and arduous efforts for the success of a new Long March."

It has been a busy week for President Jiang on the diplomatic
front, greeting heads of state and senior foreign government
officials as well as prominent businessmen.

The most notable meeting he has had was with the German Foreign
Minister, Klaus Kinkel, whose planned visit scheduled for early
this year was postponed because of the adoption of a resolution by
the German parliament on the Tibet issue. China regarded the
parliamentary action as interference with the country's internal
affairs. Discussions and exchanges during the intervening months
have resolved the controversy and Kinkel's visit signified the
return of the very warm relationship between the two countries. Not
only did Kinkel have a series of intensive and fruitful sessions
with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, but the visitor was also
received by President Jiang and Premier Li Peng.

Noting the resumption of the friendly ties, President Jiang
observed: "As long as the two sides earnestly abide by the
principles of mutual respect, seeking a common ground while putting
aside differences, non-interference in each other's internal
affairs and equality and mutual benefits , there will be good
prospects for relations between the two countries."

He welcomed the minister to China, noting that Kinkel's main task
was to make preparations for the German president's visit.
"President Roman Herzog's visit is an important event in bilateral
relations," Jiang said, adding that he was looking forward to
meeting with him.

Premier Li said that Sino-German relations should be oriented to
the future, recent twists and difficulties in these ties having
coming to an end.

Economic and trade cooperation between the two countries had
achieved marked results and bilateral cooperation in various fields
had brought about benefits for both sides, he added.

Li also met German businessmen in Kinkel's entourage, noting that
Germany's business circle had made positive contributions to the
healthy development of bilateral ties.

President Jiang also met the chairman of the Russian Federation
Council, Yegor Semeonovich Stroyev, expressing the belief that the
latter's visit would become a milestone in exchanges between the
parliaments of the two countries.

THIS WEEK: Last Run for Long Rally 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

THE 555 Hong Kong-Beijing Auto Rally got off to a rousing start on
Saturday from Stonecutters Island, in Hong Kong, on what will be
the last race under the present format. Next year, the 3,800-
kilometre race will be shortened to three days, centering on
Beijing and following a world championship format. The defending
champion Kenneth Eriksson from Sweden was soon in trouble when his
Subaru crashed on stage 12, the longest in the event.

His closest competitor in the 52-car race is Ari Vatanen. If either
of them win, they will be the first drivers to take the event
twice. The rally, which was inaugurated in 1985 and held seven
times, will conclude today in Beijing. Only 27 of the 52 starters
remain in the race.

sentencing judge, Justice Wally Yeung Chung-kuen, described as an
elaborate bid to frighten a vital prosecution witness into
withdrawing his evidence.

Tin, 47, a close associate of sacked Independent Commission against
Corruption deputy director Alex Tsui Ka-kit, admitted conspiring to
pervert the course of justice by intimidating and threatening Tommy
Chui To-yan. Chui, who was to give evidence in a multibillion-
dollar smuggling and corruption trial, was murdered in Singapore in
March last year.

Tin pleaded guilty to trying to persuade a witness not to give
evidence after a plea bargain in which the prosecution dropped a
charge of conspiracy to murder.

CHINESE President Jiang Zemin hailed the Long March as the greatest

to mark the 60th anniversary of the odyssey. Jiang said the march,
led by the late Chairman Mao Zedong, marked the turning point in
the communist struggle against the nationalists and Japanese
invaders and should be upheld as a permanent monument to the
Chinese revolution.

He urged younger cadres show the same commitment as the Red Army
members, some of whom attended the ceremony, who marched nearly

INSURING PRIVATE MEDICAL EXPENSES

The UK Market

Strong encouragement by government for people to make their own welfare
provision means that private medical expenses cover continues to be an
attractive employee benefit.  Individuals who are not insured by their
employer have the option of buying private plans.  In response, some
insurers have introduced a range of low cost schemes to accommodate
businesses and individuals unable to finance more comprehensive cover.

Despite energetic marketing by provident associations and insurers as
well as increasing criticism directed at the National Heath Service
(NHS), the market for private medical insurance has not grown for many
years.  Peter Mannion, assistant actuary, Munich Re, told a recent
conference in London that only 11% of the UK population was insured,
with market share being gained by new entrants largely at the expense
of the leading providents.

He identified flaws in private medical cover and suggested some
solutions.

* With products varying considerably in coverage, it might be helpful
if each type of product had guaranteed minimum cover.  There would
still be scope for competition in coverage above the minimum and in
other areas such as service and premiums.

* Insurers often adjust cover at renewal, sometimes limiting it or
introducing lower monetary limits.  This can be confusing for
policyholders and other routes might be tried to protect the
underwriting result.

* Private medical cover is not really designed to cover chronic
conditions, particularly those resulting from ageing and most insurers
turn off such claims when treatment becomes of a palliative nature.  Mr
Mannion suggested insurers consider whether cover could be extended or
whether a cash benefit could be offered in such circumstances.

* Medical insurance has a reputation for rapidly rising premiums; as
well as inflation in medical costs, policyholders have to cope with
heavy premium hikes when they move into a new five year age band,
meaning that cover may become unaffordable as people age.  One solution
might be designing long term contracts with level premiums (other than
inflation increases) throughout, as offered by the Exeter Friendly
Society.  There is also scope for life insurers to enter the market via
this route.

Private medical expenses cover is a significant part of the UK
healthcare market which includes other products such as income
replacement benefit, critical illness cover, long term care insurance
and major medical expenses.  Income replacement benefit sales have
fallen in the last five years despite reductions in state disability
welfare benefits last year.  The other three - critical illness cover,
long term care insurance and major medical expenses - have so far
failed to make significant inroads in the market.

Major medical expenses insurance was introduced in 1992 as an
alternative to private medical expenses cover.  A number of insurers
offer this including Canada Life, GAN Life, Lincoln National, Old
Mutual and Scottish Mutual.  Generally cover is marketed in combination
with life assurance and some other benefits such as income protection.

Future prospects

The private medical expenses insurance customer base should expand
during the remainder of the 1990s, according to Laing's Review of
Private Healthcare 1995.  However, the rate of growth will depend on a
number of factors including: price of cover; the impact of new
distribution channels for individual paid cover; product innovation;
government policy, and public perception of the NHS.

The review also looks at whether commercial insurers are poised to take
a substantially larger share of the market during the 1990s.  It says
that in the early 1990s, the company sector - traditionally dominated
by the providents - became more ready to switch insurers.  By 1992,
commercial insurers' share of the company paid market reached 22.2%
although, with the exit of ITT London & Edinburgh, the share dropped
back to 19.1% in January-June 1994 (the last period for which figures
are available) as ITT London & Edinburgh's book of business transferred
to other insurers including the providents.  "The effect of this exit
has now worked its way through the system and it is likely, though
complete figures are not yet available, that the commercials' share of
company paid PMI business has started to grow again".

Commercial insurers' penetration of the individual paid market,
including small groups, initially grew more slowly with switching
between insurers being discouraged by pre-existing conditions
exclusions used by most insurers as a means of avoiding anti-selection.
 Laing's puts the commercials' share of such subscription income as
18.8% by June 1994 but suggests it has probably increased further since
with the continuing growth of Norwich Union's individual business.

Scope for further fragmentation of the market depends on barriers to
entry and economies of scale.  Industry sources suggest that a
subscription income of #50m to #100m per annum may be necessary to take
full advantage of the fixed costs of setting up a comprehensive in-
house claims administration system.   "Ultimately, the key to whether
commercial insurers will sustain and consolidate their position in the
individual and corporate markets will depend on whether they can keep
their administrative overheads and new business acquisition costs low
enough to remain competitive in the long term."

EUROPEAN TRENDS

In this report - European healthcare trends: towards manged care in
Europe - Coopers & Lybrand describes and analyses health reforms in
17 countries.

There are wide variations between European healthcare systems but there
are many shared perspectives and themes in their reform programmes,
because they are responses to common pressures and the possibilities
offered by modern management and information systems.  However, the
report does not imply that a single model of health reform has emerged;
each country has responded to features of its own health system.

The starting point for most healthcare reforms has been concern to
control escalating costs.  Other objectives, such as to improve the
state of public health, to ensure equitable access to health services,
to improve the quality of health services and to make health services
more responsive to public preferences, have been major determinants.

While central measures to control cost have had an important impact,
the main aim of health reforms has been to change the way decisions are
made about the direction and management of health services.  The aim is
to create a self-regulating system, which reflects an appropriate
balance between the desired level and quality of service and affordable
resources.

The report states that the impacts of European health reforms can be
seen at four levels in decision making

* health objectives, policy and responsibilities are more clearly
defined

* health purchasing (insurance) decisions are separated from heath
provision and in some cases general practitioners are involved in
purchasing

* the management of health service provision integrates the management
of medical practice and the management of resources, in response to
patient needs

* the management of patient treatment and care is based upon evidence
of best practice regardless of setting

The merging themes in healthcare management can be seen as trends
towards a European form of managed care which supports: national health
targets; community health gain; disease management, and patient focused
care.

Some of these reflect trends in the US but they are being given new
meanings because European healthcare systems have social welfare
objectives and reflect a concern with community as well as individual
health.

Conclusions

Following detailed discussion and analysis, the report concludes that
the experience of European healthcare systems during the 1980s revealed
the limitations of a reform strategy that concentrated almost
exclusively on macroeconomic measures for cost containment.  Management
of European healthcare in the 1990s has changed its primary focus to
structural reform to ensure cost reduction (or cost inflation
containment) without compromising basic healthcare quality and access.

Successful healthcare management needs to reconcile the interests of
individuals with long-term health gain objectives of a community.  The
key to achieving this is to develop service strategies which are
monitored on a case-by-case basis to ensure that they are continuously
improved to meet national and community targets for health.  European
approaches to managed care achieve this by a balance of competitive
choice and controls and incentives.

The report says that implementation of competitive choice requires well-
informed individuals and agencies capable of assessing cost benefit
choices for the community.  Both individuals and agencies must have the
ability to influence the performance of healthcare providers.
Competing choices must be exercised within a framework of controls and
incentives which ensure that minimum standards are met and improvements
are recognised and rewarded.

In many social insurance based systems, the sickness funds are facing a
change from being regional administrative organisations (payers) to
commissioners (strategic buyers) or risk-sharing enterprises that
operate nationally.  Both tax based and social insurance systems are
recognising the importance of primary care physicians as gatekeepers to
secondary and community care.

Provision of secondary healthcare in European countries, with or
without internal markets, is increasingly being based on contracting
mechanisms and performance oriented payment using case-mix groupings
and quality specifications.  Reforms aiming at more effective hospital
management in many European countries involve clinical participation in
management, including devolution of budgetary management accountability
to clinical level.  In primary care, physicians are developing new
skills as gatekeepers and fundholders, resulting in a substantial
change of emphasis from secondary to primary care.

Equity is an issue because an increasing gap between resources and
demand is forcing priority setting and rationing which has to be
justified by reference to social values.  Since all European healthcare
systems must be seen as elements of social welfare, equity is an
important issue in all countries.  Health reforms with or without
purchaser-provider separation make rationing more explicit so it is
therefore essential that the basis for rationing should be accepted as
fair.

The report also concludes that purchasing of healthcare services is
increasingly being based on knowledge derived from epidemiological
needs assessment and measures of outcomes research and quality
assurance programmes.  On the provider side, effective disease
management strategies are increasingly based on medical treatment
guidelines.  Knowledge based purchasing and provision of healthcare in
the 1990s will be heavily dependent on information systems.

INTERNATIONAL MARKETING

AtIBC's Healthcare Industry Conference last November, Neil Horseman,
market manager, BUPA International, looked at the feasibility of
internationally marketing products.

Referring to international concern about current trends in state
healthcare provisions, Mr Horseman discussed whether or not
international marketing of healthcare insurance products was a
realistic goal.  "From small, mature markets like Spain and the
Netherlands, to the vast populations of China and Brazil, people
throughout the world are taking a very serious look at the potential
for private healthcare.  The market has already grown substantially in
recent years, and is set for further continued expansion well into the
next century."

However, while international marketing can be achieved, there are a
number of important considerations.  Markets must be considered
individually as they vary enormously.  "Even countries that seem very
similar in many respects can represent very different marketing
propositions - perhaps due to a minor difference in legislation."

* The impact of local legislation must be taken into account.  In the
United States, for example, legislation makes it virtually impossible
for a non-US company to break into the market.  In other countries, the
regime is slightly more relaxed in theory, but made impenetrable in
practice by a maze of rules and regulations, with the European
Community being a typical example.  Products need to be tailored to
suit local requirements.

* Access is an issue with problems arising from time differences,
different languages, different cultures and different business
environments.  The change in political climates around the world is
helping to ease problems to a  certain extent.  In developed countries,
in particular, the trend towards de-regulation is opening up many new
opportunities.

* Cultural complexity is a major issue in itself.  Differing cultural
values can affect not only marketing but even the validity of the
product as, for example, in Saudi Arabia where the concept of insurance
is somewhat alien to the local culture and could be interpreted as
interfering with destiny.  In Vietnam, most people do not use the state
health service, preferring self-medication or traditional healers.  "If
people don't take advantage of the free state health service, they are
unlikely to be inclined to pay for private treatment."

Mr Horseman stressed that essentially private medical expenses insurers
are selling peace of mind, rather than a tangible product, so buying
cover is as much an emotional decision as a practical one.  Any market
proposition must take account of the fact that people's emotional view
of life is coloured considerably by cultural factors such as religion
and lifestyle.

In a competitive market, there will also be competition from local
healthcare insurers so new entrants must invest in building a brand
image in which people can have total confidence.  "That means having
the people, resources and capability to deal with customers' problems
quickly and efficiently.  It means having the right structure in place,
from distribution through to service delivery."  Customer service is a
key issue, as is cost.

Mr Horseman emphasised the importance of research, product definition
and service, distribution and marketing strategies.  He concluded that
international marketing is a realistic goal - but only for those
prepared to make the effort to get things right.

INDUSTRIAL FIRE PREMIUM DOWN

German industrial fire insurers expect premium income in 1996 to drop
sharply due to price reductions leading to even higher underwriting
losses than those expected for 1995, Klaus Nowitzky, chief executive of
Jaspers Industrie Assekuranz GmbH & Co KG (JIA), Frankfurt, told a
press conference in Dusseldorf recently.  Industrial insurers were
"displaying their irrationality", he said.  "The same insurers who
recently still praised the Konsortialkommissionen (Kokos) are now
heating up competition by substantially undercutting existing premium
levels."

Peak risks in particular had gone down in price, he said.  "Good peak
risks are now quoted 25% below their former price; on average all peak
risks pay 20% less," Mr Nowitzky claimed.  In some instances rate cuts
of 40% had been granted, Ottokar Engelhardt, another JIA executive,
added.  The market for smaller risks was also softening rapidly.
Overall, income in industrial fire in 1996 will be down by more than
DM300m on the estimated DM4.2bn for 1995, the JIA executives said.
"We wonder whether the industrial insurance market went out of control
by accident, or whether it was a conscious decision to force some
insurers out of the market," Mr Nowitzky said, commenting in Allianz'
decision to leave the German fire tariff.  Manufacturing industry was
happy to receive premium reductions but was worried that small and
medium-sized insurers would leave the market eventually.  "We would be
left with an oligopoly, and this is certainly not in the interests of
industrial insurance customers," Mr Nowitzky said.  He added that the
irrationality of the situation was underlined by examples of companies
imposing premium increases for 1995, "always with the justification
that higher prices were urgently needed because of the risk situation",
a position new undermined in fresh price talks for 1996.  There was
even talk of reinsurers planning a new round of market rehabilitation
measures for 1 January 1997, keeping the industry on a roller coaster
ride.

GUJARAT CONTINUES CROP COVER

The Gujarat government has continued the Comprehensive Crop Insurance
Scheme (CCIS) for the rabi (winter) 1995-96 season in the state subject
to certain conditions.  The scheme covers crops of wheat (irrigated and
unirrigated), gram, rape seed and mustard, summer groundnut and summer
barja (coarse grain).  The indemnity limits are 80% for wheat
(irrigated), rape seed and mustard, summer groundnut and summer barja
and 60% for gram and wheat (unirrigated).  Insurance is limited to
Rs10,000 per farmer, irrespective of the loan taken, while the total
insured sum is 100% of the crop loan.  Under the scheme, 107 talukas
have been notified as "defined area" for wheat (irrigated), 37 for
summer groundnut, 30 talukas each for rape seed and mustard and summer
barja, 25 for gram and 20 talukas for wheat (unirrigated).

EMSS RESEARCH BEGINS

The Loss Prevention Council (LPC) is collaborating with Imperial
College London to investigate the links between Environmental
Management Systems (EMSs) and insurance.  EMSs are new tools by which
insurers may be able to assess and quantify the environmental
performance of their clients.  The LPC says that governments and
international agencies agree that continued, sustainable economic
development depends on the availability of adequate insurance cover for
environmental risks.  However, insurers are said to be wary of such
risks, particularly because of past experiences in the United States.

A three-year study entitled The Response of the Insurance Industry to
Developments in Environmental Management Systems recently began at the
Centre for Environmental Technology at Imperial College London.  The
research is aimed at analysing the response of insurers to the
introduction of EMSs as expressed in their attitudes towards their
clients' environmental performance, as well as supplying insurers with
information gathered during the study on the usefulness and benefits of
EMSs.

The study will also address the following questions.  What are the main
constraints on the environmental insurance market?  Are these caused by
uncertainties in technical assessment, or other problems such as long-
term uncertainty in legal liability?  How do insurers currently assess
the environmental performance of their clients - if at all?

In the medium term, the study aims to determine whether and to what
extent compliance with EMSs standards supports insurers' own assessment
systems, and also whether and how insurers might effectively use EMSs
in their assessments.

GANGSTAR DEALERS CARRY RISK

Unlike other motor manufacturers, Beijing Jeep is not providing
indemnity assurances to dealers but states in its dealer agreement that
in liability issues the dealer will be expected to "defend and
indemnify" the distributor.  Beijing Jeep which makes GangStar is owned
by the Chinese government.  When the Yugoslavia-built Yugo entered the
US market in the mid-1980s, its distributor agreed to stand behind the
product to defend its dealers.

TERMINATION OF MOTOR POLICIES

The German supervisory authority Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das
Versicherungswesen (BAV), Berlin, is attempting to change the date by
which a motor policyholder can terminate a policy.  This is a matter of
some concern for insurers, because of the growing movement of insureds
between underwriters.  So far the BAV has shared the view of the
industry that for "old" contracts ie those signed before July 1994
(when liberalised laws came into effect) a three-month notice period
was required.  As most German motor policies begin on 1 January, this
would have meant that the majority of German motorists could not have
switched insurers in January 1996 unless they had decided to terminate
their policy before 1 October 1995 - when the current price war had
just started.

Only for "new" policies signed under the new law was a one-month period
legally binding, ran the old interpretation.  But in mid-November,
shortly before the final date for the one-month notice, BAV suddenly
changed its mind and said that "after scrutinising the legal situation
again" it had come to the conclusion that all policyholders, old and
new, could cancel with just one month's notice.  This, at least, is the
view with regard to TPL contracts; it remains unclear whether
comprehensive policies are also included in this interpretation.

Many insurers, including leading provider of low price motor cover HUK-
Coburg (Haftpflicht-Unterstutzungs-Kasse Kraftfahrender Beamter
Deutschlands aG), have already voluntarily offered the possibility of
termination after one month to their customers.  But HUK-Coburg chief
executive Rolf-Peter Hoenen is also head of the motor committee in the
property and casualty insurers' federation Verband der Sachversicherer
(VdS), Bonn, and in this role he is critical of BAV's changed view,
because it has confused the situation.  He believes that the courts
will have to settle the argument.

PREMIUMS RISE

Insurers were expected to submit their new motor tariffs, to take
effect from 1 January, to the Ministry of Commerce.  According to the
minister, Nikos Akritidis, the average increases will be determined by
the large public and private insurers.  However, despite the minister's
guarded optimism that the average increase would be 20%, the real
figure is expected to be around 30%.  Large private insurers are
expected to set an even higher rise in premiums.

The increases will not be uniform for the whole of the country.  For
example, the largest public insurer, National Insurance (Ethniki
Asfalistiki), will adopt different tariffs for the Attica prefecture
(+29%) than for the other regions (+19%).  Other insurers were also
reported to be planning greater increases in the large urban areas,
smaller ones in the country and even smaller ones in the border
regions.

The increases relate exclusively to the compulsory civil liability
element of cover.  However, the premium hikes are expected to lead to a
drop of up to 50% in complementary covers such as fire and theft which
most motorists bought before.

RATES WARNING

A specialist UK motor insurer warns that changes in reinsurance rates
and the need for bigger reserves will inevitably put pressure on rates.
 Recent legal developments have introduced the use of actuarial
evidence in determining multipliers and the adoption of a discount rate
linked to the yield of index linked government securities.  These
combined factors will have an enormous impact upon the claims burden
falling to UK motor insurers and reinsurers, says the insurer.

Relevant developments are the production of the "Ogden" tables and the
Civil Evidence bill in October 1995 which permits courts to adopt Ogden
multipliers in the assessment of personal injury damages in all future
cases brought before them.  This means that if a personal injury claim
for an accident that occurred in, say, 1988 now comes before the court,
Ogden multipliers may be applied to the assessment of that claim.

It has been estimated that these new multipliers will produce a general
increase in claims of between 15% and 25% but could be as high as 50%.
Not all claims will be affected but plaintiff solicitors are currently
pleading Ogden level multipliers in approximately 10% of all cases.
This percentage is sure to rise very quickly, warns the insurer, as
otherwise there could be implications for solicitors' E&O policies.

The insurer states that the overall effect will be an increase in
insurers' reserves for outstanding claims, which will be seen in many
reinsurance programmes now under negotiation as well as those in the
future.  As the introduction is retrospective, the 1996 revenue year
will see adverse developments due to increased reserves on prior year
claims.
Significant effects are already being shown on quotations for
reinsurance for 1996.  The insurer concludes that these increases,
coupled with the deterioration in claims reserves, will almost
certainly force appreciable premium increases on the industry early
this year.

WORST EUROPEAN RECORD FOR CAR CRIME

British motorists are at much greater risk of having their cars stolen
than drivers in the rest of Europe, according to the second annual
European Car Crime study by a UK insurer.  The study, compiled from the
latest EU government and insurance organisation statistics, compared
the number of cars stolen in 1994 in each country with the total number
of cars in use.

The UK has by far the worst record for car crime, with an average of 22
cars per thousand on the road stolen in 1994.  That is nearly double
the level in the next worst country, France, where 12.5 cars per
thousand were stolen in 1994.  The study found that car theft is lowest
in Austria where less than two cars per thousand were stolen in 1994.
The next most secure country was Switzerland, where just three per
thousand cars went missing.

Overall, a lower proportion of cars were stolen in 1994 than in 1993.
The European average fell from 11.7 thefts per thousand cars to 9.7.
In the UK, the proportion was down from 29 to 22 per thousand.

CARGO TARIFF RETURNS

The General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) has re-introduced
tariff regulations for a wide variety of commodities.  The GIC has
issued a directive to its four subsidiaries announcing new tariff rates
which, in effect, bring back regulation to marine cargo rates
deregulated in April 1994.  Since then, rate cutting has been rife in
the sector with a fall in premium rates for crude oil from about 0.8%
of cargo value to as low as 0.01%.  Rates for certain raw materials and
capital goods fell from 1.5% to 0.03%, a fall of almost 100% in both
cases.  In order to bring back stability, the GIC has re-introduced
tariffs and also introduced tariffs for commodities not tariffed before
April 1994 such as metal pipes and tubes, oil cakes and cashew nuts.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEE PLANS

CapMac, leading credit "enhancer" of asset based securities, is
planning to launch financial guarantee cover in India through Asia Ltd.
 The intention reflects the fact that the increasing role of the
private sector in infrastructure has led to demand for credit rating
such projects.  Since financial guarantee insurance helps in achieving
higher rating for debt instruments, it would allow the promoter of an
infrastructure project to market infrastructure revenue bonds more
effectively than on a stand alone basis.  Potential for financial
guarantee insurance is also enhanced by the capital adequacy
requirements for financial institutions and banks, likely emergence of
a municipal bond market and initiatives taken to activate the asset-
based securities in the country.

Mahesh K Kotecha, managing director of CapMac, said that CapMac's
regional financial guarantee company, Asia Ltd, plans to underwrite
infrastructure revenue bonds and asset-based securities to the
international rating agencies' high non-investment grade standards.
The company will also refer deals it guarantees for additional credit
enhancement to triple-A rated agencies such as World Bank, Asian
Development Bank and CapMac.

Traditionally, the supply of infrastructure has been the responsibility
of the government.  However, because of the ballooning fiscal deficit,
the government has had difficulty in allocating adequate resources and
so has facilitated entry by the private sector by offering a number of
fiscal and tax incentives.

MANDATORY COVER FOR BANK DEPOSITS

The Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, has passed a law introducing a
mandatory insurance scheme to protect private investors against lost
bank deposits.  Compensation will be paid from a special fund whose
authorised capital is to be financed by the state budget.  The fund's
reserve capital will come from insurance premiums, late payment fees
and fines, revenue from investments and money received from banks under
receivership procedures.  The maximum sum insured will be 5,000 litas
and investors will be able to claim 80% of the value of their deposits.

The fund will only pay out compensation for deposits held with domestic
banks in the national currency.  Foreign currency accounts and deposits
held with subsidiaries and branches of Lithuanian banks abroad will not
be covered.

their mortgages and customers who are already insured, but who would
prefer to deal through their local insurance adviser.  For the self-
employed, cover is available for accident, sickness, bankruptcy, or the
involuntary liquidation of the relevant business.  The policy offers up
to 12 months' benefit after an initial qualifying period of 60
consecutive days.

PRIVATE HEALTH CONCERNS

A member company of Allianz AG Holding is concerned at the long-term
trend in the private health market towards rising losses and weak
growth.  Chief executive Dr Jan Boetius is convinced that Health
Maintenance Organisation (HMO) models similar to those used in the US
will be necessary.  Cost control within the industry, which covers
around 10% of the German population, is a problem, not unlike the
statutory system of health funds, Dr Boetius admitted, and new methods
of providing care will have to be found.

"At present, people only think about spreading the costs, not avoiding
or controlling them.  It is our principle that cost control and cost
avoidance should come before cost distribution," Dr Boetius told WPG
sister publication, World Insurance Corporate Report.  "At the moment
we have two dual relationships, patient/doctor and patient/insurer.
The patient goes to his doctor and gets treatment, receives the bill
and sends it to us.  Only at that point can we say anything and, for
example, check whether unnecessary treatment has been carried out or
whether the charge has been properly calculated."

"We cannot break away from this mechanism, as long as we are always
behind the event.  Therefore we have to turn these two bilateral
relationships into a trilateral one.  We need to have direct contact
with the doctors and therapists," Dr Boetius said.  He could imagine,
for example, a Gatekeeper model - setting specific sums per patient for
a doctor.  From this sum he will also pay any specialists to whom he
refers the patient.  "The American models cannot be transferred to us
as they are, but we need the basic principle.  In order to really
control costs, the people who provide the services have to be closely
connected with those paying."

Concerns about increased claims were also reflected by a premium rate
increase introduced by another insurer, Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse
(AOK) of Lower Saxony, this year.  Meanwhile, PKV-Verband, Cologne, the
association of private health insurers, has set up a working group to
discuss the HMO concept.

BANK-INSURER ALLIANCE

Norway's third largest commercial bank Fokus Bank A/S has formed an
alliance with Denmark's second largest insurer for the development and
sale of savings and insurance products.  The alliance will initially
centre on life insurance, pension and other types of personal cover,
which will be marketed as Fokus products throughout the bank's
distribution network in Norway.  Fokus said the agreement formed part
of its strategy to offer customers a complete portfolio of financial
products.

For the insurer, the alliance marks its first success in gaining a
foothold in the Norwegian market.  The British-Danish group - 65%
owned by the UK's Sun Alliance - was involved in a take-over contest
for Forenede Forsikring A/S in the early 1990s and has also shown
interest in Vital Forsikring A/S, which is currently at the centre of
an ownership battle between Den norske Bank A/S and Dutch insurer Aegon
NV.

NEW SUBSIDENCE RATING SYSTEM

A specialist insurer of higher value households is pioneering a
revolutionary system, provided by the British Geological Survey (BGS),
for rating the subsidence risk of individual properties.  The
computerised system - known as the Geo Hazard Susceptibility Package 2
(GHASP 2) - is based on the BGS's 1:10,000-scale geological maps, the
most detailed information on geo hazards available across the UK.  It
enables the underwriter to pinpoint the precise bedrock beneath
individual properties, even where situated close to other properties.

The insurer says that the system represents a major advance on other
current methods of assessing subsidence risk, which are based just on
the first three or four digits of a postcode and give only the average
risk for groups of several hundred homes.  It claims that use of GHASP
2 will lead to premium savings of up to 60% for existing policyholders
with lower risk properties that are currently included within higher
risk postcodes, and even bigger reduction for policyholders moving to
the underwriter from other insurers.

The new rating system is being applied to the underwriter's 606 High
Value House and Contents Policy and will be used in particular to rate
properties in southern England, where many postcodes are susceptible
locally to a wide variety of geo hazards.

QUADRIPLEGIA AND PARAPLEGIA COVER

A Lloyd's broking and financial services group has launched what it
claims is a unique personal accident programme for schools and sports
clubs, providing 24 hour cover for pupils/members for permanent total
disablement resulting in quadriplegia or paraplegia.  This cover can
top-up an existing policy to a total limit of #1m per pupil.

Director Graham Reid said: "The risk of quadriplegia or paraplegia is
of increasing concern to authorities today, where existing policies are
totally inadequate.  This policy now offers a realistic level of
indemnity for sportsmen and women who will, in the main, have their
full life in front of them".  More than seven million people receive
hospital treatment as a result of accidents each year and it is
estimated that of these 1.8m are sports related.

OPEC Countries & Their E&P Partners Have Bright Prospects

Contrary to expectations made in the past year, the situation in
most OPEC countries has improved and their prospects in 1996 are
bright. The prospects for foreign oil companies investing in these
countries are bright as well. To the surprise of pessimists, the
situation in Saudi Arabia will be among the most stable. The
following is a review of prospects in each of the OPEC countries,
based on information obtained by highly placed APS sources:

ALGERIA

The state concern Sonatrach has signed a deal securing the largest
investment by a foreign oil company in Algeria since it won its
independence from France in 1962. Several such agreements are under
negotiation with some of the world's largest oil companies.

The deal, signed on Dec. 23, 1995 in Algiers, commits British
Petroleum to invest in a $3.5 billion programme to develop and
market huge gas reserves in the In Salah region. Exxon is among
majors negotiating a similar deal (see Gas Market Trends).

Sonatrach is producing 780,000 b/d of oil, and its quota from OPEC
is 750,000 b/d. Atlantic Richfield is investing about $1.3 billion
to expand production in south-eastern Algeria. A number of major oil
discoveries were announced by Sonatrach recently after four years of
exploration by Anadarko of the US, Agip of Italy, Repsol and Cepsa
of Spain and BHP of Australia.

The business community in Algeria and foreign investors are putting
their faith in Liamine Zeroual, the former army general who was
elected president on Nov. 16. He won a five-year term with 61% of
the vote as well as a legitimacy he lacked in his previous term,
which he had secured with military help. His Islamic opponents have
lost support, weakened by a government crackdown and by internal
disputes (see News Service of this week's APS Diplomat). Donor
states are giving Algiers new credits and the government is to
accelerate the pace of economic reforms inspired by the IMF.

Foreign oil companies operating in Algeria are satisfied with the
security measures and special flight facilities to and from the
hydrocarbon-rich south. Since mid-1995, the government has
established four exclusion zones in the south with the army
providing protection against sabotage. There are about 5,000
expatriates working in the south, mainly in the hydrocarbon sector.
Their number will increase with the advent of BP, Exxon and other
foreign operators.

GABON

Producing 370,000 b/d, against a quota of 287,000 b/d from OPEC,
Gabon still has good prospects for E&P investors and its capacity in
1996 would reach 400,000 b/d.

At OPEC's ministerial meeting on Nov. 21-22, which rolled the 24/52m
b/d production ceiling over to end-June 1996, Gabon reiterated that
it would leave unless its annual contribution to the organisation's
budget has been reduced in line with the size of its quota. This
matter was shelved until the next OPEC conference on June 5.

INDONESIA

Political stability and rapid economic growth in Indonesia are
inter-dependent and the prospects for 1996 are good. There is a
great deal of new foreign investment pouring into the country. The
list of investors for 1996 is long. For new private oil refining
projects, as one example, there were 33 different investment
proposals made in the past two years and the Board of Investment
only approved eight of them.

These include a $1.1 billion, 150,000 b/d export refinery to be
built by the private Saudi firm, Nimir Petroleum, in partnership
with Mitsui & Co. of Japan and PT Gigaraya International, a private
Indonesian company. The JV would be using Saudi crude oils. A larger
refining venture, for export, is being proposed by Indonesian
investors including a son of President Suharto, to be using Middle
East crudes.

Despite the country's gradual shift to natural gas, oil consumption
in Indonesia is exceeding 700,000 b/d and will reach 1 million b/d
by 2000. The country may become a net oil importer by 2005 or
shortly thereafter, if no major oil discoveries are made in the
meantime.

At present, Indonesia's oil production excluding condensates and
NGLs is averaging 1.33 million b/d, in line with its quota from
OPEC. The biggest investment in natural gas this century is to be
made by Exxon at Natuna, where it holds a major stake, with
Pertamina having agreed in principle to grant a 13% stake in this to
Mobil.

IRAN

Against an OPEC quota of 3.6 million b/d, Iran during the past
several weeks has been able to produce more than 3.75 million b/d.
Production from some onshore fields has improved, due to extensive
field work done by NIOC since early 1995, and offshore output has
risen as well.

The political situation in Iran will depend on the outcome of
general elections in April/May 1996. The current parliament, elected
in April/May 1992, is dominated by traditionalist hardliners who
have proved to be more negative towards the West than the ultra-
populists on the left who lost in the 1992 elections. In the
previous parliament, when the latter had a strong presence,
President Rafsanjani's pragmatic faction used to benefit
considerably from his balancing acts between the traditionalists and
the ultra-populists. Rafsanjani lost that balance in 1992 and has
since become weaker, with the traditionalists' behaviour doing their
country's economy more harm than its real enemies.

The confrontation with the US in late 1995 culminated in a new
measure by congress to punish those non-US companies which continue
to assist in Iran's hydrocarbon sector. In June 1995, Washington
imposed sanctions against Iran and in March had forced Conoco to
cancel a $900m deal to develop two of the Sirri offshore fields -
with Total of France having since signed a $600m agreement to
develop them. Although Tehran now says the US measures would not
harm Iran, in reality the country has begun to suffer more seriously
and its financial difficulties are getting worse. While France would
back Total and the Sirri development might go ahead as planned, no
other major project in this country would be financed by OECD states
or companies in the near future; none of the major banks will
finance any of the oil or gas pipelines proposed to pass through
Iran from Central Asia.

In November 1995 the oil ministry and NIOC held a four-day seminar
in Tehran and attracted about 40 foreign companies. The latter were
presented with 11 new oil and gas development projects worth over $6
billion, all requiring foreign investment on "buy-back" basis.

The foreign participants were told they would provide finance and
would be repaid in crude oil, gas or products from the completed
project. The profit margin offered was a bit better than the one
which the Japanese rejected in 1991, when a small offshore oilfield
at the Strait of Hormuz was to be developed and Japex was to act as
a competitive banker. NIOC asked the participants to come up with
bids by Jan. 1.

All those who are still interested in Iran are awaiting the outcome
of the April/May elections. By then they will have seen how the US
applied the tougher sanctions and how President Rafsanjani managed
to free himself from barriers imposed by the traditionalists. If the
traditionalists win again, the situation in Iran could worsen
further (see News Service).

One of the problems is that Iran is moving steadily to a point when
its oil consumption will exceed its exports. According to its
central bank governor Mohsen Nurbakhsh on Dec. 27, Iran's oil
consumption from March has risen to 1.4 million b/d - compared to
1.1 million b/d in the previous fiscal year to March 1995. This has
raised the "oil burden" on the state to almost $10 per annum. In its
new budget to March 1997, the government has forecast oil export
revenue at $15.9 billion, up 18% over March 1995-96 earnings.

The budget is based on an average price of $15.50/barrel for Iranian
crude oils, compared with $15/barrel for fiscal 1995-96. This seems
to be a bit optimistic, as the prospects for crude oil prices in
1996 are not very promising.

From March to end-1995, the actual price of Iranian crude oils
averaged slightly higher than $15/barrel. But in 1996 oil prices may
fall below that average.

Key factors of uncertainty for crude oil prices in 1996 include: (1)
Iraqi oil, with Baghdad under heavy pressure to allow partial sales
under a UN plan; (2) an increase in non-OPEC supplies, which is
almost certain if no major accident occurs (see study to be
serialised as from next week's Review); and (3) deflation in OECD
countries, if it continues.

IRAQ

There is no way that the UN sanctions against Iraq will be lifted in
1996 while Saddam Hussein is in power. The situation worsened after
Jordan's Dec. 26 announcement that it seized several kilos of three
"extremely dangerous" chemical components bound for Iraq, one month
after Jordan's seizure of a machine tool capable of fabricating
missiles and other weapons. As soon as the Iraqis learned of the
negative consequences, their dinar collapsed. At the same time,
pressures on Baghdad mounted from all directions; and France is
pressing hard for the Iraqi government to accept the UN plan for
partial oil sales which, among other things, should help finance UN
operations, as well as bring in food and medicines to the Iraqi
people.

Last week there were signs that Baghdad might soften its tone on
this. If Baghdad allows partial oil sales, to involve about 300,000-
400,000 b/d in 1996, prices would fall. This is because most OPEC
members are exceeding their quotas, with non-OPEC exporters
increasing their supplies in 1996 to take much of the 1.1 million
b/d boost in world oil demand. The prospects for Iraq might brighten
suddenly in 1997, after the US presidential election of November
1996, if Baghdad and Washington strike a deal related to the Middle
East peace process and other matters.

KUWAIT

Exceeding its 2 million b/d quota by a mere 45,000 b/d, Kuwait is no
longer happy with formula pricing based on sweet Brent and WTI
crudes. KPC wants to see a sour crude marker develop to replace
Dubai and become the benchmark for the pricing of its crudes as well
as those of Saudi Arabia and other Middle East exporters. At a
London conference last November, KPC marketing official Abdel Samad
Al Awadi suggested that Gulf producers sell part of their exports on
the spot market to create their own sour marker. But this depends on
acceptance by Saudi Aramco, whose pricing formula influences world
oil prices (see Downstream Trends).

Kuwait's political stability has improved in recent months and
further improvements are anticipated in 1996. Its oil production
capacity is being expanded according to plan, with downstream
operations overseas to be expanded further in 1996.

LIBYA

Exceeding its 1.39m b/d quota by about 30,000 b/d, Libya has a
number of internal problems caused primarily by UN sanctions imposed
since April 1992. An Islamic movement, spearheaded by militants
trained in Afghanistan to fight Soviet occupation, has declared a
holy war (Jihad) against Qadhafi's regime. One of its leaders,
Shaikh Abu Munther Al Saidi, has said the bloody events in June,
August and October 1995 were only "the beginning of the Jihad".

However, European oil companies have not stopped operating in Libya.
In fact several of them have increased their investment in the past

The political situation in Nigeria is very bad, because its military

internationally. A US-EU oil embargo against Nigeria is unlikely,
however, and Shell has decided to go ahead with a very expensive LNG

Nigeria is exceeding its 1.865m b/d OPEC quota by about 100,000 b/d.
Like most other OPEC members, it will continue to produce at

QATAR

On June 27, 1995, Crown Prince Shaikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani
peacefully toppled his father - then on a tour abroad - and became
emir of Qatar. In the following months Hamad and his chief aides
began to upset Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in many ways and some of
them were too arrogant for the Egyptians, the Syrians and others.
They were too cordial to Israel and the US to bother with the
Saudis. But at the GCC summit on Dec. 4-5, Hamad walked out when the
Saudis got the council to choose their candidate, Jamil Hujailan, as
GCC secretary general. Later Doha threatened to leave the GCC if its
candidate and other demands were ignored.

Suddenly, however, Shaikh Khalifa appeared in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 24
and vowed he will return to Doha to regain power. Overtly, Hamad and
his aides ignored the warning and Khalifa's subsequent GCC tour; but
covertly they panicked and were no longer arrogant to the Egyptians
or Syrians.

Qatar is exceeding its 378,000 b/d quota by more than 85,000 b/d.
Its oil production capacity has risen to 465,000 b/d, due to a boost
in the output of Occidental Petroleum from less than 20,000 to
63,000 b/d. Further increases are evisaged by Oxy and Maersk this
year. Capacity will exceed 500,000 b/d by 1997. In November a spot
market in Al Shaheen sour crude, 30.3x API with 1.9% sulphur, was
created. The crude is produced offshore by Maersk at the rate of
20,000 b/d, to reach 30,000 b/d by end-1996.

Qatar is speeding up the diversification and privatisation of its
economy. At a conference in Doha on Jan. 8 it will present 15
industrial projects to about 300 Qatari, GCC and foreign investors.

The Prospects In OPEC Countries - SAUDI ARABIA

The situation in Saudi Arabia has improved considerably since the
Riyadh bomb explosion in November 1995 and the subsequent
hospitalisa-tion of King Fahd. The issue of succession to the throne
had been resolved prior to President Clinton's visit to the kingdom
in October 1994, and now Crown Prince Abdullah is the acting head of
state. To be the next king, he is the person who presides over
cabinet meetings and receives foreign leaders.

An air-tight power sharing agreement with "The Sudairi Seven" is yet
to materialise. But political stability is top priority for both the
conservative camp of Prince Abdullah and the progressive camp of
"The Seven". Washington will be happy with whatever arrangement both
sides may have in the coming months, provided that the outcome is
favourable, and there is a lot of horse trading going on in the
background.

The trend-setter for the neighbouring countries and the oil market,
Saudi Aramco has raised its crude oil prices for US customers in
January by 35 cents/barrel for Arabian Heavy and by 10 cents for
Extra Light. This follows changes in differentials between light and
heavy oil products and a large reduction in Saudi Aramco prices for
December.

        SAUDI PRICE DIFFERENTIALS FOR JANUARY 1996

$/barrel                       US1  Europe2  Far East3
Arabian Extra Light (Berri)  -2.05   -0.95     +1.20

Arabian Heavy                -3.70   -2.40     -0.55

Fob Ras Tanura: 1WTI, 2dated Brent, 3Oman/Dubai average

Saudi Aramco has the capacity to produce up to 10 million b/d of
OPEC speficication oil, plus 715,000 b/d of condensates and NGLs
which are excluded from the quota system. But it sticks to OPEC's 8
million b/d quota. Its monthly pricing influences the other NOCs of
the Middle East. This is particularly in the case of Kuwait's KPC,
which competes with Saudi Aramco in the US market, and of Iran's
NIOC which competes with the Saudi company in Europe and east of
Suez markets.

Riyadh wants to see crude oil prices defended by OPEC and IPEC. But
it also insists on expanding its market share.

The mix of Saudi Aramco's export crudes has become lighter and the
company has begun work on developing the Shaybah field, which will
be producing over 500,000 b/d of 42x API crude with 0.5% sulphur by
1999 and will raise Saudi supplies of such oils to almost 800,000
b/d (see detailed survey of Saudi Arabia & who's who in Vol. 45).

Politically stable as a confederation, rather than a full union as
its name suggests, the UAE has an OPEC quota of 2.161 million b/d
and is producing slightly more than that. The Acting Minister of
Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Rakad Bin Salim Bin Rakad, stated
on Dec. 7, 1995, that the UAE's oil production capacity had reached
3 million b/d.

Most of this capacity belongs to Abu Dhabi, by far the richest among
the seven UAE emirates with huge reserves of oil and gas (see survey

VENEZUELA

With an OPEC quota of 2.359 million b/d, Venezuela is actually
producing 2.75 million b/d and needs every dollar it can get. The
country has a deep financial crisis and a number of other problems
(see survey of Venezuela & who's who in Vol. 45, December 1995).

The Caracas government recently approved a joint venture between
Bitumenes del Orinoco (Bitor), one of PDVSA's subsidiaries, Conoco
of the US and Statoil of Norway. The JV will build a $320m plant to
produce Orimulsion, Venezuela's trademark boiler fuel excluded from
the OPEC quota. Production is to begin in 1998 at the rate of 5
million tons/year. About 80% of the output will be sold to Florida
Power and Light Co. and the remainder will be marketed in Europe.

In this JV, Bitor will hold 40%. Conoco will have a 30% stake and
Statoil will hold 20%. The remaining 10% will be held by two private
Venezuelan engineering companies.

OPEC Condensate & NGL Exports To Exceed 2.7M B/D: Production and
exports of condensates and NGLs in OPEC - excluded from the quota
system - have risen from less than 1.6 million b/d in the mid-1980s
to over 2.4 million b/d in recent months. They will exceed 2.7
million b/d before end-1996.

With further NGLs to come from large LNG export projects to be
completed in the following years, OPEC production of these liquids
could rise to more than 3.5 million b/d by 2000.

The biggest producer and exporter of these light/sweet liquids is
Saudi Aramco: 715,000 b/d to reach 720,000 b/d by end-1996. The
second is Algeria: 560,000 b/d to reach 580,000 b/d. The UAE:
326,000 b/d to reach 528,000 b/d. Indonesia: 230,000 b/d, to drop to
225,000 b/d by end-1996. Venezuela: 200,000 b/d to reach 220,000

GCC Economies Grow Despite Lower Spending

The economic prospects in the six Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC)
countries appear to be bright. Higher oil prices and reforms boosted
their economies in 1995 despite lower government spending and a
decline in some sectors. But the six states are entering the 16th
year of their alliance with no signs that their targeted economic
merger will materialise anytime soon.

According to local officials and bankers, the oil sector alone in
the GCC has grown by around 8% as crude oil prices averaged nearly
$17/barrel in 1995, compared with $15.50/barrel in 1994. Oil prices
in 1996 may fall if Iraq returns to the market for partial oil sales
(see Oil Market Trends).

Khalid Al Fayez, chief executive of the Kuwaiti-based Gulf
Investment Corporation (GIC), which is owned by the six GCC
governments, says: "The performance of GCC economies recorded
positive rates and the results have surpassed expectations. Such
results were much better than in 1994. This is because the rise in
oil prices hastened growth rates". Bankers have estimated the
combined GDP in the GCC would grow by around 2.1% to $207.6 billion
in 1995, from nearly $203.2 billion in 1994.

A study by Henry Azzam, chief economist of the Saudi National
Commercial Bank, shows Saudi Arabia's GDP, which accounts for nearly
a quarter of the total Arab GDP, would likely rise to around $122
billion from $120.8 billion in 1994. Kuwait's GDP would increase to
$24.2 billion in 1995 from $22.9 bn and the UAE's to $38 billion
from $36.6 bn. Oman's GDP surged by more than 12% in the first half
of 1995 and was projected to grow by over 3% by end-1995. The
economies of the two other GCC members, Bahrain and Qatar, are also
set to grow.

This is in contrast with 1994, when most of the GCC economies
declined due to low oil prices. The decline occurred mainly in
government sectors.

According to the state-run Emirates Industrial Bank in the UAE, the
improvement in crude oil prices would boost the GCC's income by
around 10% to $77 billion in 1995, from around $70 billion in 1994.
The oil sector's contribution to the GDP ranges between 30% and 40%
in the GCC. The other key sectors are construction and trade.

Mahmoud Al Jarwani, director of the Muscat Stock Exchange, said in
late 1995: "I believe all GCC economies have grown because of the
oil price improvement and government measures to restructure the
economy. But some sectors have slightly retreated due to a drop in
investments and government expenditure". Most GCC states cut
spending in 1995 as part of reforms aimed at tackling their budget
deficit and reviving their economies after they were hurt by low oil
prices. From $71.4 billion in 1994, spending was trimmed to $68.79
billion in 1995, with most of the cut made by Saudi Arabia.

Lower government spending has a direct impact on the GCC economy, as
the private sector still relies heavily on such spending given its
relatively small contribution to the GDP. But such a contribution,
estimated at 35-40%, is set to surge in the coming years as regional
states are pressing ahead with reforms, which cover privatisation,
incentives for industries and improvement laws. The sale of key
institutions to the public is expected to fetch the governments
billions of dollars and ease the burden of subsidies.

GIC's Fayez urges GCC states to pursue privatisation plans and other
reforms to repair their economies and lessen reliance on volatile
oil earnings, which still account for more than 80% of their income.
"GCC countries should be fully committed to privatisation to
liberalise their economies and end bureaucracy and red-tape. But
privatisation needs changes in the existing economic laws. It means
not only the transfer of the ownership from the government to the
private sector, but also a change in the structure of companies and
their dealings".

Obstacles To Merger: The GCC states are yet to agree on a customs
union, a joint currency and other steps required for a common
market. Bahrain, which has little oil, fears lowering its tariffs
could hit its economy in view of its heavy reliance on taxes. Saudi
Arabia is also sticking to selective high tariffs to protect its
burgeoning industries as a means of lessening dependence on oil
exports. Although the six members have eased customs barriers among
them and facilitated the entry of their citizens, inter-GCC trade
has remained as low as 10% of their total trade of more than $100
billion per annum.

Egypt-Libya Trade Is Choked By Harsh New Measures

Egypt's Marsa Matruh, the once thriving market in Libyan goods has
become a ghost town after strict measures taken by Tripoli choked
off trade across the border. There used to be 5,000 travellers a day
crossing the town. Now there is only 50 at most. Sometimes it is
completely empty.

Mohammed Al Adl, head of customs at Egypt's Salloum border post,
said last week Libya "imposed a number of strict controls which
stopped the flow of trade between the two countries". Libya slapped
100% duties on merchandise entering from Egypt. Libyan officials at
the Misaed border post "confiscate without any reason all goods and
large amounts of money from travellers" coming from Libya, Idris Eid
Ali, who crossed into Egypt said. He added: "The economic situation
in Libya is collapsing and every hour there are new contradictory
(customs) orders issued".

The Salloum border crossing has been a vital trade outlet for Libya,
under a UN air embargo since 1992 for its alleged support of
terrorism. Travel between the two countries has always been simple
for their citizens, leading to a profitable trade in cheap Libyan
merchandise in Egypt.

In the coastal town Marsa Matruh, 250 km from the border, the
markets where most of the goods from Libya were sold are all but
empty from the cut-off. A trader who deals in Libyan merchandise in
Matruh said: "The town used to be packed with people and cars and
the trading went on 24 hours a day. Now there's not a single
customer after nine o'clock. On the best day, a merchant (at Matruh)
might make about 10 Egyptian pounds ($3). There are no customers and
no new goods coming in".

Besides random confiscations of goods, Libyan officials impose heavy
insurance on merchandise leaving Libya. But then it is very
difficult for the traveller to get back the insurance. One Egyptian
customs official added: "There is no system and no (Libyan) official
to turn to to complain. Every bureaucrat small and large considers
himself unsupervised and can do whatever he wishes".

The Libyan authorities have begun refusing to fill extra petrol
tanks in travellers' cars, in a bid to crack down on drivers who
sold Libyan gasoline at "enormous profit" in Egypt. Libyan customs
also force entrants to pay 50 Libyan dinars ($15) for a health
certificate in response to an Egyptian decision to give arrivals a
health test, after reports of a cholera outbreak in Libya.

Egyptian exports to Libya in 1994 amounted to $44.2 million. Imports
from Libya were worth $47.8 million. Libya has been Egypt's third
largest Arab trading partner, after Saudi Arabia and Syria.

Trade was dealt a heavy blow in September 1995 when Libya decided to
deport the 30,000 Palestinians living on its soil. Up to 1,000 of
the several thousand Palestinians expelled were refused entry by
Egypt and settled into a tent camp in no man's land between the two
borders.

The crisis stifled trade across the border even after Libyan leader
Qadhafi decided to stop the expulsions until 1996. Over a hundred
Palestinians still remain in the tent camp under harsh conditions.

Algeria Gets BP For Its Biggest Gas Project; Talks With Exxon Begin

On Dec. 23, 1995, Sonatrach and British Petroleum signed an
agreement whereby BP and the state concern will invest about $3.5
billion to develop and market natural gas from seven fields in the
remote In Salah region. The gas will be marketed in Europe,
particularly in southern European countries, and will increase
Algeria's gas exports by more than 10 BCM/year from 2002. Further
increases in gas exports are envisaged for the following years.

The deal with BP represents the biggest foreign investment in
Algeria since it gained its independence from France in 1962. It
comes on the heels of President Zeroual's electoral victory (see OMT
& News Service of this week's APS Diplomat.

It paves the way for other international investments in Algeria's
energy sector, which accounts for virtually all the country's export
earnings, with Exxon negotiating a similar agreement for In Salah
gas.

Explored by Sonatrach, the seven fields lie in the hitherto
undeveloped In Salah District Three, about 1,200 km south of
Algiers. They are believed to be rich in natural gas and some
liquids.

In the initial phase, 30 months, BP will spend about $100 million on
an appraisal of the fields' known gas reserves, exploration and
analysis of the chemical composition of various gases in that
region. The aim of exploration is also to find other fields in
District Three. The $100 million spending will be borne by BP alone.

In Salah, a vast desert region, has 30 fields discovered by
Sonatrach. Their reserves have been estimated at between 150,000-
280,000 MCM. But BP has had doubts about these estimates and will
carefully re-assess data and the deposits at the seven fields found
in District Three.

The deal took five years to negotiate and an initial agreement in
1993. It involves a complicated arrangement relating to production
and the quality of the In Salah gas, which is poor relative to the
gas being produced at Hassi R'Mel, Algeria's main gas production
centre to the north. It includes a swap of In Salah gas for Hassi
R'Mel gas.

After the 30-month exploration phase, if the results are positive, a
five-year development programme will be launched. BP will produce 10
BCM/year from 2002 or 2003.

With gas treatment facilities to be set up at the fields, a 520-km
pipeline will be built from District Three to Hassi R'Mel. The
pipeline will cost about $1 billion. At Hassi R'Mel, the gas will be
reinjected to free more of the higher quality of the centre's gas
for export.

From there, the gas will be linked to Algeria's export network: (a)
the Trans-Med pipeline to Italy, and (b) the pipeline to Spain and
France which will pass through Morocco and the Strait of Gibraltar.

Joint gas marketing companies will be established in Europe by
Sonatrach and BP. The British major is expected to provide
considerable assistance in markets that will have become totally
deregulated by 2000 (see reports on following pages). There will be
emphasis on Germany, the largest gas market in Europe, where BP has
a stake in a major gas company.

The BP-Sonatrach partnership will last 30 years. The agreement was
signed at a ceremony in Hassi Messaoud, Algeria's southern oil
centre, by BP's CEO John Browne and Nazim Zouioueche, the head of
Sonatrach. The ceremony was attended by Ammar Makhloufi, Algeria's
minister of energy and industry.

Accordingly, BP will provide 65% of the total investment. In return,
it will get about a third of the profits. There is a confidential
portion in the agreement which provides for other companies to use
the pipeline for a fee.

Makhloufi said the BP deal would be a model for future gas
development and marketing agreements with other international
companies. Browne said: "It is the first major gas joint venture a
foreign company has signed with Sonatrach. It has the potential to
open up a new area of gas production in Algeria. He added that the
deal should raise by 30% BP's natural gas production worldwide,
which in 1994 amounted to 1.12 BCM (13 BCF).

BP will set up its own quarter at the heavily-guarded Hassi
Messaoud, where most of the 32 western oil and gas companies have a
base. It will post 25 of its staff members there and in District
Three, which will be heavily guarded by the army as well.

Browne and his aides had flown direct from London to a small
airstrip at Hassi Messaoud, where the army has heavy fortifications
against Islamic militants. BP will be hiring its own security
experts there and in District Three, and will be chartering its own
aircraft for the staff - as the other foreign operators in Algeria
have done.

At least six army units guard the installations in and around Hassi
Messaoud. At the air strip, soldiers with AK-47 assault rifles stand
silhouetted at the top of the surrounding, honey-coloured sand
dunes. The area is part of four exclusion zones in the south,
established in mid-1995, requiring special permission for entry by
visitors. Soldiers are stationed outside many pumping stations
across the desert. Helicopters routinely monitor the pipelines,
which are buried 3 to 4 metres under the sand.

Exxon Negotiations: Initial negotiations between Sonatrach and Exxon
began in the past week with the aim of signing a gas partnership
deal similar to BP's. If an agreement is signed, which Minister
Makhloufi hopes would be within 1996, Exxon would take some of the
remaining In Salah fields.

After an initial period for field appraisal and exploration, if the
results are positive, Exxon would develop the structures.
Eventually, it would use the 520-km pipeline to Hassi R'Mel which BP
will build from In Salah. Makhloufi says there would be a total of
three to four partnerships with foreign companies for In Salah gas.

Total-Sonatrach Gas Deal

Sonatrach and Total of France were this week expected to sign a
contract for the development of a gas field at Tin Fouye Tadankort
(TFT). The field lies in south-eastern Algeria near the Libyan
border.

The contract involves a production sharing arrangement. The French
company will cover most of the investment required and projects
there include a pipeline to link the gas with Algeria's network.

On Dec. 22, Minister Makhloufi and officials from Sonatrach
inaugurated oil and condensate processing facilities at Bin Rebba,
part of the Hamra field development undertaken by Total. They also
inaugurated Total's new gas treatment complex built at Hamra. The
Hamra project, to produce LPG as well as condensates, includes a
joint Sonatrach-Total company to market the LPG.

Zouioueche, the head of Sonatrach, says Algeria is taking steps to
maintain the momentum of foreign interest and investment. New
exploration acreage will be offered for foreign companies, although
Algeria appears more interested in negotiating specific arrangements
with individual companies than in launching a new international
bidding round. He says there is a continual reassessment of the
fiscal terms being offered to foreign companies. "We think the
current ones are attractive enough, but we must be prepared to adapt
to growing international competition", he adds.

Zouioueche has ambitious plans to revitalise Sonatrach. "Our goal",
he says, "is to have a state company that is managed like a private
company". He is keen to expand international activities. Algerian
officials say part of the attraction of the BP deal, and the one
with Exxon to follow, is that it opens the prospect of moving into
new "middle stream markets" in Europe, such as power generation.

Zouioueche says Sonatrach, which already has a stake in Anadarko,
the US oil explorer, is keen to acquire additional overseas assets.
That could include taking equity in other companies, including gas
marketing companies in Europe. "We're open to any possibilities to
become more international", he says.

At home, Sonatrach will be offering more opportunities for foreign
companies to take part in rehabilitating existing oilfields.
Zouioueche says a $1.3 bn contract on enhanced oil recovery being
negotiated with Arco will form the basis for future oilfield
rehabilitation projects. "But we can't do other ones until the Arco
deal is signed", for the Rhourde El Baguel oilfield (see details in
survey of Algeria in Review's Vol. 44).

Anadarko, meanwhile, has begun negotiating with Chemical Bank and
other banks to finance the development of 1.5 billion barrels of oil
reserves it has found in Algeria. Its partners in these reserves are
Lasmo of the UK and Maersk of Denmark.

The reserves lie in the group's Hassi Berkine fields which, if
developed as planned by Anadarko, would produce 40,000 b/d from late
1996 or early 1997. A full-scale development, to cost over $1
billion, would raise its production to 300,000 b/d by 2000. The
fields will produce natural gas as well.

The European Gas Market Develops; The British Could Buy From Retail
Shops

A spot market in natural gas developed in 1995 at Bacton, on the
British east coast, is becoming the main price market for spot
trades in Europe. With the players having acquired experience from
trading in North Sea oil, it provides forward contracts. Eventually
this would lead to a gas futures market similar to that of NYMEX in
New York which was launched in 1990.

However, the new spot market has caused the gas industry a serious
crisis. As a result of free competition in less than six months, gas
prices fell to about 10 pence a therm ($1.55/million BTU) in
November 1995.

To compare, the value of natural gas in Britain in November 1994 was
almost 20 pence a therm ($3.10/million BTU).

Further pressures on gas prices in Europe would be expected by April
1998, when the UK gas and power businesses will be totally
deregulated. From then on, British consumers could buy electricity
or gas at the supermarket or in chain stores. This form of trade
will influence price trends at Bacton.

Many big retailers have already had talks with the British
electricity regulatory body, Offer, about plans to sell power as
from 1998. They have had negotiations with British Gas for the
retailing of both gas and electricity, though BG is having its own
retailing plans.

The British electricity regulator, Prof. Stephen Littlechild, said
on Dec. 28 that many retailers were considering the sale of
electricity and gas once regional distributors lose their monopoly
in supplying households. The market for 20 million British
households is worth about $12.5 billion per annum. He told 'The
Times': "All of these (retail) chains realise that they have
strengths and the resources which could be of use in the electricity
market".

No new wires for power or pipelines for gas will be required.
Retailers would use their purchasing power to buy large supplies of
gas and electricity at bulk discounts, and then could sell the
unused surplus to customers. The gas or power distributor would
receive a fee from the retailer to reroute the supplies.

According to Littlechild, supermarkets are well placed to sell
electricity in the free-for-all consumer market about to be created:
they are used to driving hard bargains with suppliers and making
slim margins on large volumes. As large-scale customers, these
retailers have been able to achieve savings of 30% or more on their
bills through a competitive tender process. This involves the
various private sector suppliers.

British Gas, the former state monopoly, is already bracing for the
tough new competitive market. It has secured a licence to supply
households with both gas and electricity, in the expectation that
consumers would prefer one major and reliable supplier.

NYMEX Begins Trading New Futures Based West Texas Gas

The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) this week was expected to
begin trading a new gas futures contract based on delivery at the
Permian pool of El Paso Natural Gas Company in West Texas. The
contract is partly similar to the one trading on the NYMEX market
since 1990, with its gas based on the Henry Hub in Louisiana.

The difference is that the Louisiana-based contract expires on the
sixth to the last business day of the month, whereas the new near-
month contract expires on the third to the last business day. The
new contract competes with the Western gas futures contract of the
Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT), which is based on the Waha Hub in
west Texas. The KCBT Western contract expires on the fifth to the
last business day of the month.

NYMEX has promoted the idea since mid-1995. It wants to give traders
in natural gas futures an alternative site to trade. This is to give
further arbitrage opportunities.

Herndon Begins Stint At Florida Pension Plan

The six-month search by Florida State Board of Administration for an executive
director finally came to an end Nov. 12 when John (Tom) Herndon assumed his new
position as chief executive officer of the $55 billion pension.


Mr. Herndon replaced Ash Williams, the previous executive director, and
inherited the alternatives program review Mr. Williams started before he left
this May to join Schroeder Capital Management as executive vice
president (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 6).

Mr. Herndon's appointment, announced in late October, was not without
controversy: A lobbyist and well-known public figure in Florida, Mr. Herndon's
resume was studded with long stints in government but was noticeably shorter on
investment experience, and his selection sparked questions in the industry
regarding his fitness to manage one of the country's largest pension plans.

"I understand the concerns expressed," Mr. Herndon said. "But [Florida State
Board] is a large complex organization with a variety of activities and
concerns, not all of which are investment related, and the board has selected
someone who can put together a solid team, deal with all the activities and
pull the whole thing together."

Prior to joining the board, Mr. Herndon was president of Tom Herndon &
Associates, a government lobbying and consulting firm. His public service
record included positions as chief of staff under two Florida governors-current
Governor Lawton Chiles and Bob Graham, now senator-where for five years he was
director of the governor's office of planning and budgeting. Besides serving on
the Florida House of Representatives, he also spent two years as the executive
director of Florida's Department of Revenue.

"I guess the need was for a seasoned [manager] with strong oversight of
external forces affecting the pension, i.e., the legislature, and he was best
suited for the part," said a source familiar with the pension who asked not to
be named.

At the time of Mr. Williams' departure, the Florida legislature was reviewing
its current restriction on partnership investments, possibly paving the way for
an expanded program (BUYOUTS June 10, p. 4). The pension also was reviewing its
private equity program and was considering new strategies to broaden its
alternatives investment portfolio, including buyout funds and direct
investments.

Before its September commitment of $200 million to The Carlyle Group's Carlyle
Leveraged Capital Partners II, L.P. (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 9),  Florida had
nearly $800 million earmarked for buyouts that was primarily invested by
Liberty Partners, New York.

Mr. Herndon was picked over other candidates with strong investment track
records, sources said, because the pension did not expect to rely on the new
director to drive its day-to-day management. Mr. Herndon said he expects to set
broad policies and structure a new program where the monitoring will be left to
deputies with more investment experience.

Currently, Lan Janecek is the board's chief of equities, and Irwin Loud is the
private equity portfolio manager.

The board has not set a formal timetable for the review. "During the transition
from Ash to myself, which took six months, my sense is the board was sitting at
a red light on the street," Mr. Herndon said. "Now its a flashing yellow light,
and I'm proceeding with caution. I'm not adverse to new deals and areas, but
I'm not jumping into anything quickly."

Sources said Mr. Herndon likely will continue the broad game plan started by
Mr. Williams, which emphasizes the expansion of alternatives investing with a
view to stepping up direct or co-investments. Kopin Tan.

Hancock Team Plans Secession Before Fund Launch

The partners and management team of Hancock Venture Partners is in the process
of buying the private equity arm of the business from parent John Hancock
Mutual Life Co., after which the team likely will launch a fifth domestic
fund-of-funds expected to land close to $1 billion.

Hancock's management team at press time was finalizing the buyout, expected to
close by early January, through which the firm's 11 general partners will buy
Hancock's buyout and venture capital operation from its parent holding company
and run the new entity with its current staff of 49 investment personnel fully
intact.

Brooks Zug, the buyout arm's co-founder and general partner, said the move was
necessary because Hancock Venture Partners has outgrown its parent holding
company's compensation structure. He said it would be difficult to continue to
attract and to keep top industry professionals without giving them a chance to
build equity ownership.

"It worked well for 15 years, and it might have continued to work a while
longer, but the economic rewards and controls had to shift in a direction to
the people that give a value to the investors," he said.

The price of the transaction has not been finalized.
Following the transaction, the new entity is expected to continue investing and
managing Hancock Venture Partners' existing $2.2 billion in assets under
management, including all prior funds the firm has raised, Mr. Zug said.

Commitments from parent John Hancock Mutual Life accounted for only 3% of
Hancock Venture Partner's assets under management, and industry sources said
the firm's rebirth is unlikely to diminish the team's existing clout.

The new entity has yet to finalize its name. Although it may include a
reference to Hancock, it will likely be used temporarily and for a short time,
Mr. Zug said. "All details are not ironed out, and there is still some work to
be done," he said.

L.P. sources who have invested with Hancock said the firm's general partners
had been working on the move for some 18 months, and may have held off the
official launch of its fifth domestic fund because there are investors who may
be waiting for the changes to be finalized before they make their commitments.
The fear, an L.P. source said, is that some of the Hancock general partners may
leave should the acquisition fall through.

Mr. Zug said he does not believe the investors will be unduly concerned about
the change in ownership and name.

"I view the spin-off as positive, and if we chose to invest in them again, it
would be contingent on the deal," said Robert Borden, chief investment officer
at Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System.
U.S. Fund V May Breach $1 Billion

Darrell Allen, the investment officer at Denver Public School Employees'
Pension & Benefit said the establishment of the group as a separate firm is
unlikely to negatively impact the plan's existing relationship with the Hancock
team. Investors said the launch of a new domestic fund-of-funds likely will be
announced the same time the ownership change is finalized.

L.P. sources said the new vehicle, Hancock's fifth domestic fund, will feature
a $750 million goal and will be capped at $1 billion.

Hancock's previous U.S. fund, the $353 million Hancock Venture Partners IV,
L.P., was launched in 1993 and is fully invested. New partnership and secondary
investments represented $196 million of the fund and direct investments $156
million.

The only fund not fully invested by Hancock Venture Partners is the $950
million fund-of-funds Hancock International Private Equity Partners II, L.P.,
(BUYOUTS July 8, p. 23) which held a final close early this year. It is now 40%
invested.

More than half of the $2.2 billion under the management of Hancock Venture
Partners is targeted for international funds, and Mr. Zug said his group will
continue to offer its investors both domestic and overseas opportunities.

"The two parts of our business here have always been integrated,"  Mr. Zug
said. "We've never contemplated splitting them apart."* By Josh Kosman

Despite LBO Firm Neglect, Mezzanine Funds Thrive

When Boston's Bain Capital found itself with an oversubscribed equity fund
earlier this year, its partners came up with a way to tap investor interest
without biting off more equity than it could chew, and Bain Capital V Mezzanine
Fund, L.P. went from concept to closing.

"We thought there was a shortage of mezzanine," says Geoffrey Rehnert, a Bain
managing director. And given the oft-touted perception of mezzanine funds as
ignored by investors and squeezed out of deals by aggressive senior lenders and
roaring junk bond and 144(A) markets, it seems a sound rationale.

But subordinated debt funds were not so much a dark horse as a quiet one. Like
equity funds, these partnerships have experienced a record fund-raising year in
1996 and, like buyout funds, have been busy finding under-the-radar
alternatives in order to put their money to work.

Whether their approach will be successful as they wait for more equilibrium
with other debt sources remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that
while a strong mezzanine contingency is not what buyout funds need right now, a
lack of established sub-debt funds could have serious repercussions for the
buyout industry should the public market and senior lenders pull back.

So far in 1996 there have been roughly a dozen mezzanine-fund closings that
have raised about $2.3 billion, a 143% increase from 1995, according to
BUYOUTS. The sponsors are Capital Resource Lenders, Canterbury Capital, L.L.C.,
Crescent Capital Corp., LPNY Advisers, Retail & Restaurant Growth Capital,
L.P., Frazier & Co., Bain Capital, Green Mountain Advisors, Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co., Summit Partners and Cigna Investment Management.

On top of that there have been five other funds launched this year, including
those by August Partners and GarMark Advisors L.L.C., looking to raise an
additional $1.475 billion.

The wealth of fund raising in 1996 follows several years of slow struggle. In
1992, $786 million was raised among mezzanine funds, which was followed by a
39% drop in 1993 to a total of $482 million.

But beginning in 1994, mezzanine funds began to show a turnaround. In 1994, the
funds totaled $909 million, an 89% increase from the year before. In 1995, the
aggregate was $945 million, not accounting for the $1.425 billion raised by
Forstmann Little & Co., which is being excluded from the data because the firm
uses the fund for its own deals and does not lend to others.

What seems to be driving the mezzanine fund-raising market, sources say, is the
greater appetite on the part of foreign investors.

"[Domestic investors] looking at mezzanine funds ask themselves 'Why would I do
that if we get [a return of] 20% to 25% when we could put it into private
equity and make 50%,'" relates Bob Mast, a placement agent at Boston-based
Monument Group.

International Investors Drive Market
Conversely, many investors from overseas have more modest expectations.

"Many international investors are attracted to the current yield a mezzanine
fund provides," says Robert Gould, a senior manager at Brown Brothers Harriman
& Co., which is  raising a mezzanine fund. "Additionally, it provides good
returns even if the IPO market doesn't do well in the next five years."

The fund, called 1818 Mezzanine Fund, was launched in May and is expected to
close in the first two weeks of December with more than $200 million (see
story, p. 6).

At first glance, the rise in mezzanine fund raising seems paltry compared to
the skyrocketing levels of pure equity. Buyout funds have raised more than $20
billion so far this year, already exceeding 1995's final tally of $18.4 billion
(BUYOUTS Oct. 14, p. 1).

But a closer look at the proportion of mezzanine to equity shows that mezzanine
pools have been gaining ground. In the early '90s, for example, the pool of
mezzanine capital ran at about 8% of equity funds. Although that dipped to
about 5% last year, 1996 has reversed the trend. Mezzanine fund raising this
year totals 13.4% of the aggregate total of buyout funds raised.

While most sources and the numbers agree that it is a good time to raise
capital, not all mezzanine funds have had immediate success. August Partners,
based in New York with a fund launched in late winter, has yet to hold a first
closing on its $100 million target. A much more ambitious target, $750 million,
was set by New York's GarMark, which also has not held a close although
industry sources had hinted earlier this year that they were very close
(BUYOUTS April 8, p. 6). GarMark could not be reached for comment at press
time.

Both these funds are debut efforts, which may be influencing their ability to
draw investors. But GarMark's fund, one of the largest mezzanine partnerships
contemplated, may be a victim of its own size.

Sources that are successfully raising and deploying mezzanine funds say they
are doing so because of their approach: searching for smaller deals or
restructurings where they can put their money to work.

"We are looking for deals at the lower end of the spectrum with smaller funds
or possibly individual deals," says Nicholas Dunphy, a managing general partner
at New York's Canterbury Capital. "I maintain that if you stick with smaller
deals, and create good relationships, there will be enough worthy deals to make
a good investment."

If GarMark reached its target, the fund may be too large to go after the
smaller deals that mezzanine funds are eyeing, and the larger deals that could
effectively put GarMark's fund to work currently are more interested in
cheaper, public debt.

Taking Advantage of the Little Deal
Following a similar story to the equity-fund dilemma of having lots of investor
interest but limited avenues for deployment, mezzanine funds, too, have been
reinventing the kinds of deals they pursue.

For instance, many mezzanine funds that initially were conceived as supporting
structures for buyouts are instead going after their own smaller deals or
helping out companies that need capital for a purchase of another product line,
not a buyout itself.

"The funds that can do this can handle [any squeeze]," says Jim Reinhardt, a
managing director of the California-based Pathway Capital Management.

For instance, Mr. Dunphy says Canterbury's strategy has been to look for
smaller deals rather than to try to provide mezzanine financing for mega-deals.


His firm's fund, Canterbury Mezzanine Capital, L.P., which was launched last
September, most recently held a first closing on $135 million (BUYOUTS Sept.
25, 1995, p. 1, p. 16) and is looking for a final close by January at $150
million.

For its first deal, Canterbury committed $5 million in subordinated debt to
Chartwell Investments's acquisition of Petro Stopping Centers (BUYOUTS Nov. 11,
p. 6).

Canterbury Capital looks for deals between $2 million and $15 million and, with
a range like that, "you will always find a company looking for growth capital
or debt," Mr. Dunphy adds. Canterbury's overall return objective is 20% to 25%.


While the Brown Brothers mezzanine fund takes a larger approach-seeking
investments between $25 million and $75 million in company worth between $150
million to $200 million-the strategy still is to complete deals that are too
small for its second buyout fund, 1818 Fund II, which closed last year on $475
million.

"Mezzanine is the appropriate tool for investments we want to make with smaller
companies, because you can't be as confident that companies will go public
afterwards," Mr. Gould says.

A large part of the mezzanine fund's strategy is to find investment situations
that would not be appropriate for a financial sponsor, such as a family-owned
business where no one wants to replace the financial structure. "There is some
opportunity in leveraged buyouts, but that is not where our focus will be," Mr.
Gould adds.

A Maturing Mezzanine Market
Even as mezzanine funds are finding new footholds to bridge the gap between
investor appetites and financial sponsors' interest, there are signs the
mezzanine market is coming into its own.

LPNY Advisers, based in New York, has dedicated a recent fund raising to
secondary interests in mezzanine funds. The fund, which was launched earlier
this year, closed on $225 million this summer, exceeding its $200 million
initial target. So far, commitments have been drummed up from Pennsylvania
Public School Employes' Retirement System, BancBoston Capital, Houston
Firemen's Relief & Retirement Fund, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance, IBM
Retirement Plan, Wolfson Equities and Paris-based Euristech (BUYOUTS Aug. 5, p.
7).

"Certainly, mezzanine does get a little squeezed when equity providers have so
much money," says Monument's Mr. Mast. "But even if all discipline goes out the
window, [mezzanine] will still have a place in the market."

That mezzanine funds are a maturing market also readily can be seen by buyout
firms, riding high on equity but delving into sub debt as well. Besides Bain
Capital and Brown Brothers Harriman, Boston's Summit Partners is raising a
mezzanine fund called Summit Subordinated Debt Fund II, L.P., which is readying
its first, and perhaps final, closing at between $250 million and $300 million
(see story, this page).

But, because of the abundance of cheaper forms of debt, even some of those
buyout firms that might have first anticipated using their new mezzanine funds
to bolster their own deals may be rethinking their plan.

To date, Bain has used its mezzanine fund, which raised about $250 million, for
its own deals-but now is interested in using the fund for mezzanine lending to
other buyout groups, Mr. Rehnert says.

"I think we are trying to market mezzanine and come up with a formula to price
deals but with better risk," he says. Tanya Bielski

Kidd Kamm's Hamburg In Industrial Renaissance

Eric Hamburg, a partner at Kidd, Kamm & Co., in November founded Industrial
Renaissance Inc., a buyout investment firm that will focus on operational
improvement of industrial and manufacturing companies.

The new firm remains a one-man show for now, although Mr. Hamburg said he has
rounded up two potential partners who soon will come on board the Stamford,
Conn., enterprise. He declined to name the individuals, but said they shared a
strong operational background.

The move follows a decision by Kidd Kamm partners to go their separate ways
over a disagreement about the firm's investment direction. While Kidd Kamm will
continue managing its existing portfolio, partners Kurt Kamm and Terry Theodore
will launch a buyout fund early next year under the banner Kamm, Theodore & Co.
(BUYOUTS Oct. 14, p. 1), while William Kidd has opted to tackle ad hoc deals
through his own buyout shop, Kidd & Co. (BUYOUTS Oct. 28, p. 3).

Mr. Hamburg declined to add further comment on the Kidd Kamm split, except to
say the firm had reached a point where it became apparent the decision was
appropriate.

Industrial Renaissance will target leveraged build-ups of middle-market
manufacturing companies in fragmented industries, as well as of stand-alone
acquisitions of under-performing businesses. Industries the firm will focus on
include industrial and consumer products, and low- to mid-tech manufacturing.
It will steer clear of retail and service companies.

Target businesses will have sales between $15 million and $150 million.

"We're looking for companies with weaker systems and operational processes we
can upgrade-the type of deals we can understand and which a truly financial
buyer may not get their hands around," he added.

The firm has enough committed capital-from individuals, corporations and the
potential partners-to approach deals, he said, and does not plan to raise a
fund. "We don't want to be money managers."

Industrial Renaissance owes much of its operational bent to Mr. Hamburg's
background. Before joining Kidd Kamm in 1993, he spent eight years at Andersen
Consulting, where as senior manager he led and managed the implementation of
business turnarounds. Kopin Tan.

LACERA Adviser Search Ends with Hamilton Lane

Los Angeles County Employees' Retirement Association on Nov. 20 appointed
Hamilton Lane Advisors as the pension's new investment manager for private
equity assets after five years of entrusting the 6% allocation to Chancellor
Capital Management.

The appointment ended a six-month search initiated at the request of the $20
billion pension's board of directors following a series of defections among
Chancellor's ranks (BUYOUTS July 22, p. 1).

According to David Locke, LACERA's investment officer for alternative assets,
the allocation Hamilton Lane will be responsible for has not yet been
determined. That decision is pending the final agreement with the
Philadelphia-based consultant, which should be presented to the board in
January.

The pension has determined, however, that the Hamilton Lane relationship will
be a discretionary one, similar to its prior arrangement with Chancellor.

Mr. Locke said the pension staff had been satisfied with Chancellor's
performance and the switch in consultants was at the direction of the board. A
source close to the board pointed out, in an earlier interview, that some board
members thought Chancellor did not fairly review certain key partnerships the
board had been interested in.

Despite a current 6% allocation to private equity, Mr. Locke said Chancellor's
recent mandate was to invest about $350 million annually, and, Mr. Locke said,
Hamilton Lane likely would be targeting the same amount, "depending on the
market and circumstances."

Historically, Chancellor committed some $540 million of new capital from the
beginning of its tenure with LACERA in December 1991 through Sept. 30 of this
year, in addition to reinvesting distributions.

The LACERA definition of alternative assets is oriented solely on private
equity, including buyouts, venture capital, mezzanine, secondary purchases and
distressed and turnaround situations. Real estate has a separate allocation and
is considered by the pension to be a mainstream, traditional investment.

Mr. Locke said he expected Hamilton Lane to establish on an annual basis its
own investment plan that would be reconciled with an overall strategic plan for
alternative assets that is being developed by LACERA staff, aided by Frank
Russell Co. According to Mr. Locke, the majority of the plan has been drawn up
and is being fine-tuned; it should be unveiled and implemented around the
middle of the first quarter, he said.Jennifer Lea Reed.

Advent Kicks Off Third International Effort

Advent International Corp. last month launched a third international buyout
fund targeting established European and Asian markets, said Douglas Brown,
president of the Boston-based firm.

Offering documents for Global Private Equity III, L.P. feature a $600 million
goal, although the firm hopes to raise a figure closer to $875 million-enough
to invest $250 million annually for three and a half years, said Tom Armstrong,
an executive vice president.

Half of the new fund likely will be invested in Europe, with 33% in America and
17% in Asia, Mr. Brown said. The fund will not invest in Latin America, which
already is the focus of Advent's $200 million Latin American Private Equity
Fund, L.P., which closed this fall (BUYOUTS Aug. 19, p. 7).

The new Europe- and Asia-focused fund will target 35 to 40 companies in the $10
million to $30 million range, focusing on low-risk investments in established
markets. "For example, we won't do deals in China but have invested in Taiwan,
Malaysia and Singapore," Mr. Brown said.

The minimum investment is $5 million, with $20 million being the average
commitment. Co-investments alongside the fund will be encouraged, Mr. Brown
said.

More than half of the fund will be invested in buyouts, with the balance in
recapitalizations and growth financings, he added. This represents an increase
in the percentage allotted to buyouts. In previous efforts, the firm invested
one-third of its funds in acquisitions (BUYOUTS Oct. 23, 1995, p. 5).

The general partners will commit capital amounting to 1% of the fund.

Advent's second international fund raised $313 million in 1994. Global Private
Equity II, L.P. is now 85% invested in 50 companies, with returns in excess of
50%, Mr. Brown said. An additional $47 million will be invested by the end of
the year, he added.

The fund recently invested $35 million in Technologistica, an Italian
outsourcer of logistics management (BUYOUTS Nov. 11, p. 16). Advent
International currently has 70 investment professionals on its team, including
at least 40 who are based in Europe, Mr. Brown said.

PPM America Markets First U.S. Distressed Fund

Already the third largest institutional property owner in the U.K. behind only
the Church of England and the British Crown, Prudential Corp. plc is marketing
to U.S. investors a debut distressed fund with a $300 million goal.

Launched earlier this year by PPM America, Prudential's U.S. equity investment
arm, the fund already has rounded up $154 million largely from Prudential
affiliates in a first closing this June and now is stepping up its fund raising
among other U.S. investors.

A second closing with commitments from U.S. investors is expected early next
year, said a source at the firm.

PPM America Special Investments Fund, L.P.'s $300 million target will break
down as follows: a little more than $100 million in limited partnership
interests from Prudential affiliates, nearly $96 million from U.S. investors
and $100 million in debt.

The fund's June 21 first closing landed $25 million from an affiliate of
Prudential Corp., $75 million from Jackson National Life Insurance Co. and $50
million in senior secured notes from Transamerica Business Credit Corp. and
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.

After the firm raises the remaining $96 million in L.P. interests, PPM America
will round up fund raising with another $50 million debt tranche.

While a leveraged fund is not in itself unusual, industry sources said, it has
not been widely used as a fund-raising tool. "We look at the debt chunk as an
advantage for our investors that will give a bigger kick in terms of returns,"
said Stuart Lissner, a vice president of PPM's special investments group.

PPM sources said leveraging the fund conservatively also does not significantly
increase its risk profile; at the same time, it helps boost the fund size for
the first-time vehicle.

"We're paying 9% on one-third of our capital," which is only marginally higher
than the 8% hurdle rate paid to the fund's limited partners, said Brian
Schinderle, another PPM vice president. "The issue is how you want to structure
your capital."

According to the offering documents, the fund's strategy involves targeting
majority control positions in debt and equity of financially troubled companies
and other special situations. Approximately 80% of the fund will be deployed in
distressed debt, Mr. Lissner said, taking advantage of an inefficient market
for distressed securities.

The Chicago-based firm also has recruited in the past months a team of
investment professionals to help raise the fund and put it to work. They
include Mr. Schinderle, who until August was a founder and manager of Sanwa
Business Credit Corp.'s special situations group; Bradley Scher, a former
director of distressed loans for Teachers Insurance; Levoyd Robinson, who until
May oversaw First Chicago Capital Corp.'s distressed portfolio; David
Dieffenbacher, a former associate with First Chicago; and Brian Baldwin, an
associate and formerly an auditor at Grant Thornton LLP.

The team is headed by John Stark, a senior vice president who founded PPM's
special investments group in 1990.Kopin Tan.

Gen Cap America Readies $25 Mil. Fund IV

Gen Cap America in November kicked off fund raising for a fourth private equity
vehicle that will target small to mid-size companies located in the Southeast.

Southvest Fund IV, L.P. targets $25 million and will focus on sponsoring
management-led buyouts, said a source at the Nashville, Tenn., firm.

Gen Cap's principals, who are expected to commit as much as $3 million of their
own capital, declined to comment, citing the regulatory silent period.

Southvest Fund III, L.P. rounded up more than $5 million in 1995 and will be
completely invested by the end of this year. The firm to date has raised nearly
$13 million in three prior vehicles- named Southvest because Gen Cap invests in
the Southeast-and the stepped-up goal of $25 million reflects the firm's
decision to make a more concerted stab at buyout investments.

The first three funds generated IRRs of 34%, the source said.
Southvest IV will target companies valued between $3 million and $50 million,
including divestitures of corporate divisions and privately held companies with
retiring and absentee owners.

Gen Cap has focused on the Southeast because the general partners believed the
region still has a large number of acquisition opportunities that are left
untapped by national investment firms, the source added.

Gen Cap America was founded in 1987. Barney Byrd is the firm's president;
Donald Napier is the senior vice president.Kopin Tan.

Brown Brothers to Close Debut Mezzanine Effort

Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in December will hold a first, and possibly
final, closing on more than $200 million for its first mezzanine fund, said
Robert Gould, a senior manager.

The mezzanine fund, named 1818 Mezzanine Fund after the year the investment
bank was founded, originally had a goal of between $100 million and $250
million, Mr. Gould said.

Brown Brothers kicked off its fund-raising effort in April (BUYOUTS  May 27, p.
4). The fund targets investments in smaller companies, focusing on mezzanine
tranches between $5 million and $20 million.

The fund was devised to fill a need outside the investment mandate of the
bank's two private equity funds, the $329 million 1818 Fund, and the $475
million 1818 Fund II. Both focused on non-controlling equity investments of
between $25 million and $75 million in companies valued at more than $200
million.

The mezzanine fund will be managed by Mr. Gould, who previously invested the
1818 equity funds, and Joe Donlan, the chief credit officer who headed the
investment bank's New York middle-market lending operations.Tanya.Bielski.

AAM Wraps First Effort After Landing $35 Million

Since Asset Allocation & Management held a $10 million final closing on its
debut fund in August, bringing the final tally to $35 million, the firm has
been busy investing and has put nearly one-third of the fund to work.

AAM Capital Partners, L.P. fell short of its $50 million goal set at the time
of its launch in June 1994 (BUYOUTS July 10, 1995, p. 8).  Tug Wilson, a
partner, said the firm decided to settle for the lower amount in order to
concentrate fully on deals.

The fund targets LBOs of middle-market insurance companies, Mr. Wilson said.

Lead investors in the fund include Chase Manhattan Bank, Allstate Insurance
Co., Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Swiss Reinsurance
Corp. and Banc One Capital Partners.

Mr. Wilson said that this is a good time to invest because of the
demutualization of the insurance industry. As much as 40% of the insurance
market is now mutually owned by policy holders, which means companies are not
able to have ready access to capital, Mr. Wilson said. He added that the fund
will give the Chicago-based group a chance to develop a track record investing
in the insurance industry.

The fund recently invested between $12 million and $13 million to attain
minority ownerships in San Francisco-based HomeVest Financial Group, New
York-based Universal American Financial Group and the Lancaster, Pa-based Old
Guard Group.

The firm also co-invests with other groups, deploying between $4 million and $5
million per acquisition, Mr. Wilson said.J.K

McCown Acquires Sarcom in $150 Mil. LBO

New York-based buyout firm McCown De Leeuw & Co. closed a $150 million
transaction for Sarcom, a Columbus, Ohio, computer systems integrator, on Nov.
15, said McCown Partner David King.

Funded by McCown De Leeuw & Co. III, L.P., the buyout firm committed $30
million in equity. Senior debt of $95 million was supplied by Banque Nationale
de Paris, of which more than $60 million will be dedicated to the company's
future growth. IBM Credit Corp. also put in $15 million.

Sarcom's management committed $10 million and holds a 25% stake in the company.

McCown will use the computer systems integrator as a new platform. The firm
foresees taking Sarcom to an initial public offering in the next few years but
in the meantime plans to grow the company through acquisitions, Mr. King said.

An add-on for the new platform was already underway, Mr. King said, although he
would not name the company as yet. He predicted, however, the acquisition would
increase Sarcom's revenue by 10%.

Sarcom, which is the twelfth largest local area network computer integrator in
the U.S., is expected to have 1996 sales of $250 million.*T.B.

American Securities Buys Burger King Its Way

American Securities Capital Partners recently completed its fourth investment
of the year when it acquired one of the five largest chains of Burger King
restaurants in the world.

The New York firm bought Caribbean Restaurants, Puerto Rico, on Oct. 8 for
about $150 million, including between nearly $40 million in equity, according
to a source close to the firm. Senior debt was provided by Texas Commerce Bank.

The newly acquired company has exclusive rights to the 111 Burger King
restaurants on Puerto Rico, according to Michael Fisch, an American Securities
director.

Mr. Fisch said Caribbean Restaurants, like the buyout firm's other investments,
had not been sourced through the usual investment banking avenues. "You get
more attractive pricing opportunities if you buy outside of broad auction," he
said.

Caribbean Restaurants reported sales of $140 million in 1996.
Mr. Fisch said three of the four investments made so far this year, including
Caribbean Restaurants, featured transaction prices of more than $100 million.
He added the firm targets acquisitions of industrial manufacturing, broadcast
or media companies and distributors of well-known consumer products.

American Securities closed this February on a $90 million fund that is 75%
invested, he said. The firm will think about launching a second fund sometime
in 1997.

Investments made by American Securities this year include MVE, a manufacturer
of vacuum-installation technology; Community Pacific Broadcasting, which owns
10 radio stations; and CTB, a manufacturer of poultry feeding equipment

Bain Sells Two Stakes, Closes First Hedge Fund

Bain Capital had a busy month in November, staging exits from two investments
and closing its first hedge fund.
The Boston-based buyout firm on Nov. 14 sold Experian Inc., a former credit
data subsidiary of TRW, a defense electronics company, for a return of 300%.

Bain worked alongside its fellow Beantown buyout group Thomas H. Lee Co.,
jointly acquiring an 84% stake in Experian for $1.01 billion. The buyout firm
invested approximately $100 million in the deal.

The sale, just seven weeks after the acquisition, gave the firm a profit nearly
three times its initial investment, said Geoffrey Rehnert, a Bain managing
director.

"We were lucky in that a European company we were interested in was interested
in [Experian]," Mr. Rehnert said. "They made us an offer, and it is one of
these fortunate things where everything fell into place."
Experian, based in Orange, Calif., was sold to Great Universal Stores PLC for
$1.7 billion.

The other Bain exit was on Nov. 1, when the buyout firm sold its interest in
Gilbert Engineering Co., a civil engineering company, for $125 million to Oak
Industries, Bain's partner in the Gilbert acquisition.

Bain and Oak Industries bought Gilbert in 1992.
The buyout firm made roughly 27 times its initial investment, Mr. Rehnert said,
but declined to mention how much money the firm paid four years ago for the
company.

Hedge Fund Nears $100 Million
The buyout firm also held a closing on $98 million for its first hedge fund on
Nov. 1, Mr. Rehnert said, although a few other investors may still straggle in.
Bain partners and employees committed $30 million; the remaining $68 million
was raised from other individuals.

The hedge fund is called Brookside Capital Partners, L.P. and will target
positions in public companies.T.B.

Saunders Karp  Takes Hibbett to IPO

New York-based Saunders Karp & Megrue completed an initial public offering for
Hibbett Sporting Goods in October, and, to date, has reaped a profit roughly
three times its initial investment, said John Megrue, partner at the firm and
the chairman of the board at Hibbett.

The company offered 2.3 million shares at a price tag of $16 a share. On the
first day of its trading, the stock closed at $20 a share. At press time, the
stock was being traded on Nasdaq at $15.

The buyout firm did not sell any of its own stock in the October offering.

Saunders Karp bought the sporting goods company a year ago for an undisclosed
price. Already, the firm has repaid most of the $35 million debt incurred by
the restructuring, Mr. Megrue said.

The firm opted to take Hibbett to an IPO because it can more aggressively fuel
the company's expansion, Mr. Megrue said.

Since the buyout firm's recapitalization, Hibbett has opened 19 more stores
across the country, taking the total to 82.

Saunders Karp paid for the acquisition with equity from its first vehicle, SK
Equity Fund.

The firm currently is raising its second fund, SKM Equity Fund II, which
features a goal of $400 million (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 8).T.B.

Amendment Widens  The 100 Investor Rule

An Oct. 11 amendment to the 1940 Investment Company Act that will take effect
within the next six months is expected to give buyout firms greater flexibility
in future fund raisings.

Whereas general partners previously had to restrict the number of investors in
a fund to less than 100 to avoid registration and regulation under the Act, the
amendment creates a new exemption allowing firms to target an unlimited number
of "qualified purchasers"-individuals with more than $5 million in investments
or institutions with more than $25 million under management.

As a result, buyout firms soon will be able to raise funds from a larger number
of investors, instead of targeting a few limited partners with deeper pockets
in order to keep its investor list to 100, said Paul Schreiber, a partner and
head of asset management group at Shearman & Sterling, a New York-based law
firm.

"[The 100 investor rule] hasn't been a problem for most fund raisers," said Jay
Applegate, a veteran placement agent now with Brittany Capital Group, "but it
has precluded some funds from taking in smaller pieces because each piece is
still counted as a slot."
Impact on Fund Raisers

Buyout firms raising large funds from a long investor list would appreciate the
flexibility, a G.P. source said. For example, TA Associates' TA/Advent VIII and
Madison Dearborn Capital Partners II, L.P. both had L.P. rosters numbering
close to 100. Still, not all buyout firms will jump at the opportunity due to
the inconvenience that comes with managing an extensive L.P. list.

Placement agents said the amendment likely will have more impact on
funds-of-funds and vehicles targeting individuals and wealthy families, until
now comparatively minor players in the fund-raising scene due to their smaller
commitments. Also, G.P.s who have complained of the slow approval processes of
public pensions can bypass them for a greater number of individual investors,
although public pensions are still crucial to firms raising sizable funds
because of their larger investments.

At its inception in 1940, the Investment Company Act had been criticized for
its broad inclusion of certain pooled assets whose regulation is not justified
for public policy reasons.  Congress at that time created what was called "the
100 investor rule," excluding a fund if it had fewer than 100 beneficial owners
of its securities, and G.P.s have lived with the rule ever since.

The new amendment will take effect within 180 days from the date of the signing
of the Act or when the Securities and Exchange Commission establishes the
necessary rules and definitions, whichever happens earlier, Mr. Schreiber
said.K.T.

Momentum Holds In U.K. Buyout Market

The U.K. buyout market is showing clear signs of overheating, according to the
Centre for Management Buyout Research (CMBOR). The proportion of debt and
mezzanine in funding structures is now at 50%, the highest since 1989, and the
price-to-earning ratio-particularly in larger divestment buyouts-is continuing
to rise.

CMBOR's preliminary analysis of third quarter activity showed volumes down
slightly from the second quarter but significantly greater than in 3Q 1995. In
the last quarter, 140 deals with a value of #1.25 billion ($2.092 billion) were
recorded, an increase of 16% by number and 30% by value over last year's third
quarter (see table below). The third quarter also saw, for the first time, the
value of externally generated transactions exceed that of management buyouts.

Total deal value for the year to date stands at more than $9.3 billion, and
with several completions since the end of the third quarter and other
substantial deals expected to close before year end, CMBOR predicts the total
market value for 1996 could equal the record $12.5 billion chalked up in 1989.

The combination of high prices and the uncertainties in the face of the
forthcoming general election is expected to prompt venture capitalists to adopt
a more cautious approach, but CMBOR predicts that buyouts of privately owned
companies will continue at a relatively high level until the election.
Meanwhile, many transactions are taking a long time to be completed, with
extensive due diligence being undertaken to ensure the high valuations sought
by vendors are realistic.Jennifer Jury

Pantheon Readies European Fund-of-Funds

Pantheon Ventures is adding a European fund-of-funds to its stable. Although
formal marketing has not yet begun, Pantheon director Carol Kennedy said the
firm has lined up  #80 million ($134 million) in interest, and a first closing
is to take place soon.

Pantheon ultimately expects to raise around $250 million for investment in
expansion capital, buyout and mezzanine funds in Western Europe. As much as 10%
of the fund may be put into direct investments although Pantheon does not
intend to target vehicles that offer co-investment rights. The fund also may
take a small number of secondary positions, with due regard to the priority
that Pantheon International Participations, the group's quoted vehicle, has in
this area.

To date, Pantheon has backed approximately 50 European funds. Pantheon  raised
its second U.S. fund-of-funds this year and is planning a second Asian
fund-of-funds for mid-1997; it currently has more than $1 billion under
management in the private equity asset class.J.J.

Cinven Lands $500 Mil. For Debut Buyout Fund

Cinven can count its first third-party fund-raising exercise an unqualified
success: It took the U.K.'s most prolific investor in larger buyouts barely
five months to raise #300 million ($500 million) for The Cinven Fund from some
20 institutions in North America, Continental Europe and the Middle East.
Merrill Lynch was lead placement agent for the Cinven Fund, with Cazenove & Co.
and JO Hambro Magan the co-agents.

The vehicle's original target was $333 million, to be invested  alongside
Cinven's four existing institutional clients; the fund was to make commitments
accounting for 25% of each transaction. The level of investor appetite led
Cinven to up the target to nearly $417 million. Subsequently one of Cinven's
investors, Royal Life Insurance, decided to commit through the fund for
administrative convenience following its merger with Sun Alliance. As a result,
the fund now will invest about 30% of transaction prices alongside investors
British Coal Pension Schemes, Railways Pension Schemes and Barclays Bank
Pension Fund.

The 10-year partnership has a five-year investment period. One of the funds
first investments will be in Newsquest's $508 million acquisition-jointly
funded by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.-of Westminster Press. Jennifer .Jury.

ABN AMRO Causeway Unveils Mezzanine Effort

Following ABN AMRO's acquisition of Causeway Capital, the group has launched a
#75 million ($125 million) vehicle for mezzanine investments in the U.K. and
Continental Europe. The effort will include NatWest Markets Mezzanine Finance's
team-comprising Barrie Moore, Tina Sharp and John Sealy-which has joined ABN
AMRO Causeway.

The fund will hold the first of three scheduled closings immediately on $22
million drawn from ABN AMRO and other sources, according to Causeway Managing
Director Lionel Anthony.

The ABN AMRO Causeway Mezzanine Fund was structured to operate independently of
the parent bank and the group's equity funds. "We think joint equity and
mezzanine investment is the wrong approach, since it offers potential for
considerable conflict of interest," Mr. Anthony said.

Given the aggressive lending policies of U.K. banks at present, the group
expects the bulk of the new fund's deal flow to originate in Continental
Europe, although the portfolio ultimately will be evenly split between the U.K.
and the Continent.J.J.

Approaching the New, Hancock Keeps the Old

Despite the pending ownership change and the $750 million-plus domestic
fund-of-funds looming on its horizons, Hancock Venture Partners likely will
maintain a conservative approach to investing, sticking to the tried and true
strategy that has worked for the team since 1978.

Brooks Zug, a co-founder and general partner of the Boston-based firm, says the
new firm, with the same staff of investment professionals, will continue to
manage and invest the assets the team handled as Hancock Venture Partners.

Discussing investment strategy, Mr. Zug says domestic buyouts will continue to
represent between 25% and 30% of Hancock's portfolio. The majority of that
percentage, nearly 60%, will be directed at partnerships and the rest in direct
investments, which has been the case for much of the last five years.

So far, Hancock has raised four domestic fund-of-funds that targeted buyouts,
including the $200 million Hancock Venture Partners III, L.P., raised in 1989,
and Hancock Venture Partners IV, L.P., which raised $353 million in 1994.

This fourth fund-of-funds is fully invested, with partnerships and secondary
interests accounting for $196 million and direct investments another $156
million. The lead investors in the fourth fund included Colorado Public
Employees' Retirement Association and Oregon Public Employees Retirement
System, whose commitments each accounted for between 10% and 20% of the
fund-of-funds.

Some buyout firms Hancock has invested with include Bain Capital, Berkshire
Partners, Charterhouse Group International, J.W. Childs Associates, Golder,
Thoma, Cressey, Rauner, Inc., Vestar Capital Partners and Welsh, Carson,
Anderson & Stowe.

Mr. Zug says the increasing amount of money being directed towards buyout funds
does not make him feel uncomfortable.

Besides establishing itself in the domestic arena, Hancock has carved a niche
in the international private equity business as a fund-of-funds manager.

The firm this year raised $950 million for its second international
fund-of-funds, Hancock International Private Equity Partners II, L.P., which is
40% invested. Mr. Zug says that the fund is on pace to be fully invested in
three years.

The first international fund-of-funds, Hancock International Private Equity
Partners, L.P., raised $250 million in 1991.

Mr. Zug says buyouts account for 51% of Hancock's international investments.
This percentage likely will drop to between 40% and 50% as the fund steps up
its investments in Asia, which is not an investment destination targeted by
many buyout firms.

Mr. Zug says that 85% of the international fund will be invested in
partnerships, with the balance in direct investments. To date, Fund II has
invested $225 million in 11 partnerships, nine secondary vehicles and four
direct deals.

By the time the fund-of-funds is fully invested, Mr. Zug says he expects the
portfolio to comprise between 12 and 15 investments in Europe, 10 to 12
investments in Asia, and six to eight in Latin America, as well as other
investments in emerging markets such as South Africa.

Target investment size for the fund ranges from $25 million to $30 million for
international partnerships and between $2 million and $10 million for direct
investments.

Mr. Zug says that the vehicle also would invest in undiscovered funds that have
not raised much capital in the United States.

International groups with which Hancock has invested include French-based Alpha
Associates and CICLAD SA; U.K.-based Baring Capital Investors, Candover
Investments PLC, Industri Kapital LTD, and Phildrew Ventures; Dowdy-Hanson in
Germany; South Africa-based FirstCorp Capital Investors LTD and South Africa
Capital Growth; the Argentina Private Equity Fund and Italian Private Equity
Fund, Mr. Zug says.

"We directly invest in industries that we understand, and we'd like to have a
strong local venture or buyout firm," he says.
Local Presence Essential

Hancock will only invest internationally with fund managers who fully
understand the nations and locales they are investing in.

"We will not invest in someone who comes into this region from another region,"
Mr. Zug says. "We want someone who can have breakfast with the company boss
once a week."

He said Hancock will consider investing alongside local private equity firms
with which it has not previously partnered. Also, secondary interests in
partnerships will continue as a large part of the overall portfolio.

Mr. Zug says secondary investments represent between 20% and 25% of total
investments, and this trend would continue.

Investors in Hancock's funds include Boeing Co., Deere & Co., Delta Air Lines,
Denver Public School Employees' Pension & Benefit Assoc., Ford Foundation, IBM
Corp., Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System, Massachusetts Pensions
Reserve Investment Management Board, NYNEX Asset Management Co., Orange County
Employees' Retirement System and William & Flora Hewitt Foundation.J.K.

At Press Time Summit Partners Nears Mezzanine Fund Close

Boston-based Summit Partners is set to close by mid-December a second mezzanine
fund that was launched Oct. 31. The closing is expected to round up between
$250 million and $300 million, a source at the firm said.

Summit Partners Subordinated Debt Fund II, L.P. was launched with a target of
at least $250 million. The closing, scheduled for Dec. 17, may be the fund's
final because the amount raised so far already is near its target, the source
added.

The buyout firm closed its first mezzanine fund two years ago, landing a total
of $100 million (BUYOUTS March 21, 1994, p. 3). The first fund was raised to
complement Summit's buyout equity fund by quickening the financing of
acquisitions.

The buyout firm closed its $600 million  Summit Partners IV last year and
currently is investing the equity fund.Tanya Bielski.

ESOP'S (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) have unique tax

ESOP'S (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) have unique tax
characteristics which make them an attractive ownership vehicle
for some firms. ESOP's are IRS approved retirement plans that
require investment in stock of the employer company. Because of
the organizational, tax, and financial complexities surrounding
ESOP's, implementation requires careful study. Since ESOP's
became popular in the mid-1970's, we have worked with firms of
all sizes to determine the advisability of establishing an ESOP.
This includes: Performing feasibility studies to decide whether
an ESOP is workable for a particular client; Determine if an
ESOP is the best alternative to meet the client's needs;
investigate the long term consequences of using an ESOP; explore
ESOP feasibility from every angle so that the implemented plan
will function smoothly and without unforseen liability to the
corporation.  (B)  13170

The best candidates for an ESOP BUYOUT have the following
characteristics: shares held by individual (non-corporate) owners__
non-union employees__good cash flow or borrowing base. Other
considerations: 1.) an ESOP transaction can be completed much more
quickly than a sale to a third party and will therefore increase
the volume of transaction. 2.) your fee can be structured according
to your original agreement or as a participation in fees. Inquire if
you have an acquisition candidate which meets our investment
criteria.  (B)  13169

In conjunction with, and through our Investor Database, we can
provide promising corporations with INVESTOR EQUITY OR DEBT,
ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS OR DIVESTITURES, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, AND
ANY PREPARATORY FINANCIAL CONSULTANCY. Our primary focus, however,
is providing $1 MM- $10 MM investor equity to firms that show
$5 MM- $75 MM in sales, have at least a three year operating
history, and have solid management in place. Our fees are paid
only upon successful completion of a funded project.  (B)  13137

Company structures transactions between clients seeking to raise
capital through DEBT FINANCING OR THE SALE OF EQUITY. In
addition, we assist companies in the sale, acquisition, merger or
divestment of their assets or entire business. Affiliated with a
finance sourcing group headquartered in New York City. Have a
network and database of funding sources including venture
capitalists, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies
and a limited number of individuals. Fees are competitive with
major financial houses in the major cities in the United States.
All financing fees are payable out of the proceeds of any equity
or debt financing raised. If the funds are not received by the
company, we do not get paid. Our use of contingent fees obviously
means we are successful in a large number of the financings we
undertake. Since the expenses of the offerings are ours until
the financing materializes we are selective as to the companies
we accept as clients.  The minimum financing is $100,000. Startups
are generally acceptable as long as the principals have invested
a reasonable amount of financing in the company as well as "sweat
equity."  (B)  13136

sort of proprietary feature, whether it is a technology, brand name,
well defined distribution network, or a superior management team. At
the moment, one of our specific interests is manufacturers and
distributors of spare parts for industrial machinery. We look for
meaningful investment positions and input on key issues, i.e. exit
strategy, financings, and other non-operational issues. Most
desirable are opportunities in the Northeast region of the United
States. Finally, we typically avoid high-tech industries and
start-up ventures. In addition to providing funds for growth, our
firm seeks an active role in corporate development and business
strategies through consulting/advisory efforts and Board
representation. Our principals and associates have had considerable
success as entrepreneurs, investors and strategists. Corporations
have found our skills, backgrounds and contacts with Wall Street
to be valuable to their business-building processes.  13050

 AUTO TRADE SHOW

 AUTO TRADE SHOW

1.  About the show:  The Canadian International Automotive Show
(CIAS) to be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, April 14-16, 1996,
is expected to attract over 30,000 automotive aftermarket
professionals from all regions of Canada and the United States.
All segments of the automotive aftermarket industry will be
represented, including warehouse distributors, buying groups,
wholesalers, mass merchandisers, national accounts, sales agents,
national distributors, government buyers, fleet owners, car
dealers, owners of body/paint and specialty shops, as well as
garage/service station personnel.  The show will feature 900
booths, showcasing the products of more than 300 suppliers of
parts, equipment, accessories, products and services available
for sale to Canadian, as well as international aftermarket
retailers and automotive service companies. The Automotive
Industries Association of Canada (AIA) is the organizer of  CIAS,
a biennial show that alternates between Canada s two major
metropolises, Toronto and Montreal. CIAS  is Canada s largest
automotive aftermarket show.  The show will host a delegation of
300 foreign buyers from more than 40 countries in 1996.  In
addition to the USA Pavilion, CIAS will also present in Montreal
the  Future Store : the jobber store of the future featuring
three distinct areas: over-the-counter sales (retail),
professional sales,  and, warehousing, shipping and receiving
operations -- each highlighting the future of its area.

2.  About the market:  There are several favorable market
indicators that should convince U.S. firms to benefit from the
USA pavilion program and take part in Canada s largest automotive
aftermarket event.  Over the past four years, a fast-growing
Canadian demand for automotive aftermarket products in the
categories of glass and mirrors, light trucks and trailer parts,
instrumentation, garage equipment and supplies and aftermarket
accessories has been successfully satisfied by an increasing
number of U.S. suppliers.  U.S. exporters have nearly doubled
their Canadian business in these categories of products and
equipment. There is room for many more U.S.-made automotive
aftermarket products in Canada because a sustained,  strong
demand is anticipated over the next three years.  The vehicle-age
and vehicle-type composition of the Canadian fleet is now
transformed, thus creating a demand for an increasing variety of
technologically advanced, reliable and quality automotive
products and equipment.  Over the past five years, the Canadian
fleet of light trucks, including pick-up trucks, vans and sport
utility vehicles, jumped  from 3.9 million to 4.6 million, while
passenger cars slightly declined from 11.2 million to 11.0
million.  The Canadian automotive aftermarket largely depends on
imports which are valued at US$3.1 billion (point of entry), of
which nearly US$2.3 billion or 70 percent come from the United
States.  The USA Pavilion program is an ideal way to enter the
Canadian market, as well as an excellent way to increase your
sales to Canadian customers with whom you already do business.

3.  About the pavilion:  The USA Pavilion presented at CIAS  96
will offer a complete program for first-class access to the
Canadian automotive aftermarket.  Highly successful at CIAS 94 in
Toronto, the USA Pavilion will now move to CIAS 96 in Montreal,
again hosting U.S. firms ready to start on their way to
successfully penetrating the Canadian marketplace.  USA Pavilion
participants will benefit from: professionally designed and
fully-furnished  booth spaces located near the show entrance; a
promotional program which includes advanced industry-wide
publicity and on-site promotions; a direct mailing campaign
promoting participants  products and services -- targeted
exclusively to buyers, agents, dealers, wholesalers/distributors
and government agencies; a detailed exhibitor briefing featuring
experts on local market conditions and competitive practices;
personal on-site assistance provided by our fully bilingual CS
staff; and, a by-invitation-only cocktail reception to meet with
key Canadian Industry executives.

4.  The complete USA Pavilion Program is available to U.S. firms
on a first-come first-serve basis for a fee of US$2,595.
Participation is limited.  To receive registration forms and
complete details, call Pierre Richer, Commercial Service, U.S.
Department of Commerce,  Montreal: tel: 514-398-0673; fax: 514-
398-0711.

 PULP, PAPER INDUSTRY TRENDS

 PULP, PAPER INDUSTRY TRENDS

1.  Summary: After four straight years of losses, Eastern Canada-
based pulp and paper producers led Canada s forestry sector to a
brilliant recovery in 1995.  Primarily newsprint producers,
eastern Canadian pulp and paper producers have developed new
products to diversify their production over the past few years.
Spread in four of the five eastern provinces, the 116 mills in
operation  are generating combined profits that will exceed
US$1.5 billion in 1995, a return to profit levels only
experienced in the mid and late 80 s.   Eastern Canadian pulp and
paper producers are highly motivated to maintain their world
competitiveness through cost-efficiency and productivity, taking
into account the achievement of high levels of quality for their
products and compliance to environmental and international
standards.   U.S. firms who can help Canadian pulp and paper
producers achieve their goals will find excellent export business
opportunities in the Canadian market place. The Commercial
Service (CS) in Canada offers a direct and cost-efficient
assistance service to U.S. firms ready to explore Canada's pulp
and paper industry market.  (End summary)

 2.  Prices and exports are up in 1995 and the forest industry
will have spent, by year-end, close to US$1 billion in new
products development, environmental initiatives and  advanced
technology in Canada.  The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association
estimates that Canadian forest products companies have suffered
losses of over US$4 billion between 1991 and 1994.   Now, the
forestry industry sector is back in the leading group of Canada s
goods-producing industries with a forecast of combined profits of
U$$2.3 billion for 1995.  Much of this outstanding  recovery is
linked to the successes of eastern Canadian-based pulp and paper
products producers located in the provinces of New Brunswick,
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec.  In the first two
quarters of 1995, eastern Canadian pulp and paper producers have
reported profits nearing three quarters of a billion US dollars,
and they expect to more than double these profits to US$1.7
billion by year s end.

3.  Eastern Canada s  pulp and paper industry is favored by a
substantial forest base, deep water ports and a well-established
transportation network.  Composed of some 116 pulp and paper
mills, with more than half of those located in Quebec, eastern
Canadian mills vary quite significantly in size and increasingly
in product specialty, ranging from 100 to 1,300 tpd in capacity
and producing a variety of products from molded pulp egg trays to
lightweight coated printing papers. This mix of mill capacity and
product specialty is more noticeable in Quebec and Ontario than
in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.   However, eastern Canada is
primarily a newsprint producing region. Quebec and Ontario are,
respectively,  the first and second newsprint producing provinces
in Canada with production of 4.1 and 1.8 million tons per year.
Newfoundland s three mills are newsprint operations as well.

4.  Newsprint is not eastern Canada pulp and paper industry s
only strength.  Exports of printing and writing papers, for
example, now account for more than 14 percent of the total
industry s exports.  Over the years, an appreciable
diversification in the making of value-added products is also
worth mentioning for products like corrugating mediums, liner
board, chemic-thermomecanical pulp (CTMP) and bleached hardwood
and softwood kraft pulp, as well as lightweight coated papers.

5.  Current pulp and paper price improvements have pushed the
industry back to almost full production capacity levels. Profits
are definitely back and while the paying off of long-term debts
comes first on the agenda, pollution control and quality control
upgrades,  personnel training and machine automation and speedups
appear equally important to remain competitive and preserve the
industry s world market share.  Since the majority of eastern
Canadian mills export to the United States and other countries,
compliance with the International Standards Organization (ISO)
standards through a certification process has become necessary to
continue doing business.  These quality standards along with
environmental standards have rapidly gained  recognition within
the industry as being  instrumental to improving quality,
acquiring environmental acceptance and, as a result, maintaining
the industry s world market share.

6.  Canadian paper products have always enjoyed a reputation for
high quality which will only be maintained by producing
increasingly higher value paper grades and maintaining strict
adherence to internationally accepted standards, such as ISO
standards.  In addition, only large-scale investment in
computerized process control and other automation technologies
will help Canadian mills live up to their reputation.  Recent
Canadian statistics reveal that paper companies using at least
one type of advanced technology in their operations, such as
CAD/CAE systems, programmable controllers, manufacturing
information systems, for example, accounted for 86 percent of the
industry s shipments in 1993.  Those using at least 10
technologies already accounted for 23 percent of the shipments.
Canadian pulp and paper makers have presently achieved a
sufficient level of technological advancement to be well-
positioned in the international market place. To maintain that
advantage they are committed to constant up-grades to meet the
new challenges of the global economy.  This presents U.S.
manufacturers of goods and services for this industry with future
opportunities,  as it has with past ones in 1995.



7.  U.S. firms who can help Canadian pulp and paper makers
improve their production cost efficiency, quality and
environmental standards and their specialized employees  skills
will find excellent export business opportunities in the Canadian
market place. The Commercial Service  in Canada offers a direct
and cost-efficient assistance service to U.S. firms ready to
explore Canada's pulp and paper industry market with its  new
opportunities.  CS s Gold Key service is delivered by trade
specialists who arrange pre-screened appointments for each Gold
Key client.  This customized business service allows visiting
U.S. company representatives to develop an understanding of the
market in eastern Canada,  as well as in the rest of the country.

 CONSUMER TRENDS

 CONSUMER TRENDS

1. Summary:  A survey conducted by the Standards Council of
Canada (SCC) with more than 2000 Canadians provides, from a
unique angle, consumer profile information expressed through
consumers attitudes and expectations regarding standards
affecting the environment, health and other services, as well as
a number of consumer products.  An amazingly high 62 percent of
completed and returned survey questionnaires indicates that
Canadians express a high degree of interest for standards. The
survey concludes that Canadian consumers are most familiar with
products' safety and performance standards but lack familiarity
with standards affecting products  quality, environmental impact,
as well as with national and international standards in such
areas.  U.S. firms which market or intend to market consumer
products and services in Canada will want to learn more from this
survey by contacting SCC or any of the accredited standards
development organizations in Canada. (End summary)

2. Environment: The SCC survey indicates there is a clear and
significant priority attached to standards for drinking water
purity, waste disposal methods and air quality in buildings. In
addition to responding to the survey's environmental
standardization questions, 40 percent of respondents volunteered
comments on the subject. Many expressed concerns for insufficient
or inadequate standards in relation to forestry, outside air
quality, and motor vehicle emissions.

3. Health: The top three health-related standard priorities for
respondents were water safety and purity, food quality and
safety, particularly standards for levels of bacteria in food.
Most senior respondents gave high priority to presentation and
content of information standards concerning prescription and non-
prescription drugs. Other priorities identified in the survey's
section entitled "over 65" were standards for personal healthcare
equipment, personal monitoring or alarm systems for people living
alone, and standards regulating  print size on package labels.

4. Services: The SCC survey's under age 60 respondents showed a
strong interest in standards for education,  while day care
standards were a priority for more females than males in the
under 40 age category of respondents.  A priority regularly cited
by all age groups combined was that of the necessity of standards
for warranties and guaranties attached to products and services.

5. Products: In the SCC survey, Canadian consumers were asked to
indicate the level of importance they attach to standards for a
list of 23 products. Heat, smoke, and fire detection systems and
burglar alarms standards attracted the greatest frequency of
response. Following closely were concerns regarding proper
standards for child-resistant containers, tamper proof closures,
products for the physically handicapped, motorized vehicles and
equipment, circuit breakers and water treatment devices.

6. SCC concludes that the survey draws a portrait of a Canadian
population for which the level of knowledge about standards is
limited, even in areas of traditional consumer interest. Even if
respectively 70 and 57 percent of respondents claim  familiarity
with safety and performance standards, survey results indicate
that respondents are minimally familiar with quality,
environmental management, national, and international standards.
For example, 71 percent acknowledge their unfamiliarity with
international standards.

7. U.S. firms which intend to market their products and services
in Canada will learn more by contacting SCC or any of the
accredited standards development organizations in Canada. U.S.
firms may also decide to familiarize themselves with the Canadian
market through the help of the Commercial Service (CS) of the
U.S. Department of Commerce which operates offices across Canada.
The Gold Key Service, for example, is one of CS's many services
which offers a cost-effective and efficient way of initiating
business contacts in Canada. This customized business service
allows U.S. firms to develop an understanding of the Canadian
consumers market by having CS trade specialists in Canada arrange
pre-screened appointments and make potentially lucrative contacts
for company representatives.  The Gold key Service is offered in
Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Halifax.

 MOBILE TELECOM SERVICE EXPANDS
 FRANCE TELECOM'S MOBILE ACCOUNTS ARE IN THE RED

1.  FRANCE TELECOM'S MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES HAVE LOST
MORE THAN FF5 BILLION (USD 1 BILLION).  THIS IS PARTICULARLY
SURPRISING SINCE MOST PRIVATE MOBILE PHONE OPERATORS IN EUROPE
HAVE BEEN PROFITABLE.

2.  IN 1994, FRANCE TELECOM MOBILES RADIO TELEPHONE AND FRANCE
TELECOM MOBILES POINTEL LOST FF870 MILLION AND FF215 MILLION,
RESPECTIVELY.  THIS IS A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO 1993,
WHERE FIGURES SHOWED A TOTAL LOSS OF FF1.36 BILLION.  THE RADIO
TELEPHONE UNIT COMPRISES RADIOCOM 2000 AND ITINERIS, THE
OPERATOR'S ANALOG AND DIGITAL CELLULAR NETWORKS; POINTEL'S ONLY
BUSINESS IS THE BI-BOP TELEPOINT SYSTEM.  IN 1994, THE REVENUE IN
RADIO TELEPHONE AMOUNTED TO FF3.80 BILLION, WHILE THAT OF BI-BOP
TO FF120 MILLION.


3.  FRANCE TELECOM WAS CRITICIZED FOR NOT CREATING TWO SEPARATE
SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS MOBILE ACTIVITIES.  THE COUR DES COMPTES,
THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BODY THAT MONITORS THE FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE OF STATE-OWNED COMPANIES REPORTED THAT FRANCE TELECOM
HAS NOT MET THE TWO CRITERIA ESTABLISHED FOR MOBILE OPERATORS BY
FRENCH REGULATORS - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY, AND
FAIR COMPETITION BETWEEN COMPETITORS.  FURTHERMORE, THE REPORT
SHOWED THAT PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBTS ARE UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE
THE SAME RATIOS USED FOR FIXED NETWORK CUSTOMERS ARE USED FOR
MOBILE, A SECTOR WITH LESS CUSTOMER FIDELITY.

4.  FOR THE TIME BEING, FRANCE TELECOM RADIO TELEPHONE UNIT HAS
NO ALTERNATIVE THAN TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE RADIOCOM 2000
BUSINESS UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY DECREASES BY ATTRITION AND CLOSES
DOWN.  WITH THE INCREASE IN COMPETITION AND A DESIRE TO SIGN UP
SUBSCRIBERS 'AT ALL COSTS', ADVERTISING EXPENSES (WHICH
REPRESENTED 11 PERCENT OF RADIO TELEPHONE'S REVENUE AND 150
PERCENT OF POINTEL'S IN 1993) WILL CONTINUE TO GROW.  THEREFORE,
FRANCE TELECOM'S FORECAST THAT THE MOBILE BUSINESS WILL BREAK
EVEN IN 1996 OR 1997 MAY BE UNREALISTIC.

5.  DESPITE THIS SITUATION, THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF FRANCE
TELECOM'S MOBILE OPERATIONS ASSERTS THAT THE RADIO TELEPHONE UNIT
WILL BREAK EVEN NEXT YEAR WHILE THE BI-BOP WILL NEVER BE
PROFITABLE.  HOWEVER, FRANCE TELECOM CONTINUES TO PROMOTE BI-BOP
BECAUSE IT HOPES TO MIGRATE MANY TELEPOINT USERS TO THE MORE
EXPENSIVE CELLULAR SERVICES.

6.  FORMER FRANCE TELECOM PRESIDENT, MARCEL ROULET, BLAMED
EQUIPMENT VENDORS FOR THE OPERATOR'S FAILURE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT
MEET THE DEADLINES SET FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INSTALLATION.

7.  THE PENETRATION RATE OF RADIOTELEPHONE IN EUROPE, AS OF
AUGUST 31, 1995:  FRANCE: 1,86%, BELGIUM 1,89%, SPAIN 1,81%,

ITALY 5,60%, SWITZERLAND 5,94%, UNITED KINGDOM 8,18%, DENMARK

 CALCUTTA PORT PROFILE
IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF CALCUTTA AND HALDIA
PORTS, WEST BENGAL

1.  SUMMARY.  OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, CARGO HANDLED
BY THE PORTS AT CALCUTTA AND HALDIA (BOTH RIVER PORTS TO
THE BAY OF BENGAL) HAS INCREASED BY ALMOST 35 PERCENT.
THE NUMBER OF CONTAINER LINES CALLING AT CALCUTTA HAS
GONE UP FROM 20 IN 1988 TO 69 AT PRESENT AND THE NUMBER
OF CONTAINERS HANDLED HAS INCREASED 120 PERCENT.  THE
COMMISSIONING OF THREE NEW CONTAINER FREIGHT STATIONS AT
CALCUTTA PORT HAS REDUCED CONGESTION AND CONTAINER
HANDLING CHARGES.  LABOR RELATIONS THAT WERE EXTREMELY
TURBULENT DURING THE 1980'S, RESULTING IN FREQUENT
STRIKES, NOW ARE COOPERATIVE.  THE AVERAGE PRE-BERTHING
DETENTION OF SHIPS AT CALCUTTA IS LESS THAN A DAY, ONE
OF THE LOWEST AMONG INDIAN PORTS.  PORT FACILITIES ARE
BEING PRIVATIZED, AND PORT AUTHORITIES ARE SEEKING
PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO AUGMENT FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.
WITH INCREASING INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY IN EASTERN INDIA,
CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS ARE LIKELY TO HANDLE 30
MILLION TONS OF CARGO BY THE YEAR 2000.  END SUMMARY

2.  BACKGROUND.  CALCUTTA, INDIA'S OLDEST MAJOR PORT
(AND ONE OF TWO RIVERINE ONES), IS CURRENTLY CELEBRATING
ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY.  OVER THE YEARS THE DRAUGHT OF
THE PORT HAS DECLINED DUE TO SILTATION OF THE HOOGLY
RIVER (A BRANCH OF THE GANGES), AND LARGE SHIPS ARE
UNABLE TO REACH CALCUTTA.  HOWEVER, THE ADVENT OF
"FEEDER" VESSELS HAS BEEN A BOON, AND BOTH CONTAINERIZED
AND OTHER CARGO HANDLED BY CALCUTTA HAS INCREASED
CONSTANTLY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  TO OVERCOME THE
PROBLEMS OF LOW DRAUGHT AT CALCUTTA, IN 1977 A NEW PORT
WAS COMMISSIONED AT HALDIA, 83 KM. DOWNSTREAM FROM
CALCUTTA.  THE CALCUTTA PORT TRUST (CPT), A PARASTATAL
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, ADMINISTERS BOTH THE
CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS.

3.  CALCUTTA PORT.  CARGO HANDLED BY CALCUTTA PORT
INCREASED FROM 4.34 MILLION TONS IN IFY (APRIL 1 THRU
MARCH 31) 1988-89 TO OVER 5.17 MILLION TONS IN IFY
1993-94.  THE HANDLING OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO HAS
INCREASED EVEN MORE RAPIDLY.  AT PRESENT AN AVERAGE 70
PERCENT OF CARGO IS CONTAINERIZED, COMPARED WITH THE
ALL-INDIA AVERAGE OF 35 PERCENT.  THE NUMBER OF
CONTAINERS HANDLED BY CALCUTTA INCREASED BY OVER 120
PERCENT, FROM 50,815 TWENTY-FOOT EQUIVALENT UNITS (TEUS)
IN IFY 1988-89 TO 112,032 IN IFY 1994-95.  CONTAINER
TRAFFIC INCREASED BY ALMOST 17 PERCENT, FROM 96,007 TEUS
IN 1993-94 TO 112,032 TEUS IN IFY 1994-95.  DURING
APRIL-SEPTEMBER 1995, CALCUTTA PORT HANDLED 60,053 TEUS,
AND PORT OFFICIALS EXPECT THAT 130,000 TEUS WILL BE
HANDLED IN 1995-96.

4.  WHILE THE NUMBER OF SHIPS CALLING AT CALCUTTA
DECLINED FROM 840 IN IFY 1988-89 TO 780 IN IFY 1992-93,
THE NUMBER OF CONTAINER LINES OPERATING AT CALCUTTA HAS
INCREASED FROM ABOUT 20 IN 1988-89 TO 69 AT PRESENT.
THE AVERAGE PRE-BERTHING DETENTION OF SHIPS AT CALCUTTA
IS LESS THAN A DAY, ONE OF THE LOWEST AMONG INDIAN PORTS.

5.  IN SEPTEMBER, CALCUTTA PORT COMMISSIONED A NEW, RS.
250 MILLION, COMPUTERIZED CONTAINER FREIGHT STATION
(CFS), WHICH CAN HANDLE 75,000 TEUS ANNUALLY.  WITH
THIS, CONTAINER HANDLING FACILITIES HAVE EXPANDED BY
OVER 20 PERCENT AND CONTAINER HANDLING COSTS HAVE
DECLINED CONSIDERABLY.  OPERATION OF TWO ADDITIONAL
FREIGHT STATIONS (ONE PRIVATELY OWNED AND THE OTHER
OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA) HAS ALSO HELPED TO
REDUCE CONGESTION AT THE PORT.  AN OFFICIAL OF THE
AMERICAN PRESIDENT LINE TOLD US THAT OVER THE PAST
COUPLE OF YEARS, EFFICIENCY AT CALCUTTA PORT HAS
IMPROVED.  HE COMPLAINED, HOWEVER, ABOUT INADEQUATE AND
POORLY MAINTAINED PORT EQUIPMENT THAT OFTEN RESULTS IN
DELAYS.

6.  LABOR.  THE WORKFORCE AT CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS
HAS DECLINED FROM 26,000 IN 1990 TO 21,000 AT PRESENT
(16,000 AT CALCUTTA AND 5000 AT HALDIA).  IT IS
ESTIMATED THAT THIS LABOR FORCE STILL CONTAINS SOME
11,000 UNNECESSARY WORKERS.  AS NATURAL ATTRITION
ACCOUNTS FOR THE LOSS OF 1500 WORKERS ANNUALLY, THE
SURPLUS IS COULD BE ELIMINATED BY THE YEAR 2002.
TRADITIONALLY, CALCUTTA PORT WAS BEDEVILED BY TURBULENT
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LONG STRIKES.  FOR THE PAST
SEVERAL YEARS INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS HAVE BEEN CORDIAL AND
PRODUCTIVITY HAS IMPROVED.  HOWEVER, SPORADIC AGITATIONS
BY THE STAFFS OF CLEARING AGENTS, STEVEDORES,
TRANSPORTERS AND CONTRACTORS CONTINUE TO HAMPER PORT
OPERATIONS AT CALCUTTA.
7.  HALDIA.  HALDIA'S FORTE IS THE HANDLING OF CRUDE,
OIL AND LUBRICANTS (POL), PETROLEUM DISTILLATES, AND
BULK CARGO, INCLUDING FERTILIZERS AND COAL.  PRE-
BERTHING DETENTION AT HALDIA IS ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE
COUNTRY.  CARGO HANDLED BY HALDIA INCREASED FROM 9.88
MILLION TONS IN IFY 1988-89 TO 13.29 MILLION TONS
(INCLUDING 7.69 MILLION TONS OF CRUDE AND POL) IN IFY
1994-95.  ALTHOUGH CONTAINER HANDLING IS CHEAPER AT
HALDIA THAN CALCUTTA, THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS HANDLED
AT THE FORMER DURING THIS PERIOD DECREASED FROM 15,901
TO 5,745.

8.  NEW FACILITIES AT HALDIA.  A NEW BULK LIQUID
TERMINAL IS PLANNED AT HALDIA TO AUGMENT FACILITIES TO
COPE WITH THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN THE TRAFFIC OF CRUDE,
POL AND NAPTHA.  (NAPTHA WILL BE THE BASIC INPUT OF A
LARGE PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX BEING PLANNED NEARBY.)  WITH
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PIPELINE LINKING THE EXISTING
REFINERIES AT HALDIA AND BARAUNI (IN THE STATE OF
BIHAR), THE CRUDE HANDLED BY HALDIA (3.28 MILLION TONS
IN IFY 1994-95) IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ALMOST ONE
HUNDRED PERCENT IN IFY 1998-99.  TWO MULTIPURPOSE BERTHS
ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND A SECOND "ARM" AT THE DOCK HAS
BEEN EXCAVATED.  ON COMPLETION OF THE NEW FACILITIES,
HALDIA'S CARGO HANDLING CAPACITY WILL INCREASE TO AN
ESTIMATED 35 MILLION TONS PER YEAR.

10.  SHIP REPAIR YARD AT HALDIA.  A STUDY BY THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK HAS RECOMMENDED THAT A SHIP REPAIR YARD
WITH FACILITIES FOR UNDERWATER HULL REPAIR BE SET UP AT
HALDIA.  (HALDIA, BEING A RIVERINE PORT, HAS THE
ADVANTAGE OF BEING RELATIVELY INSULATED FROM CYCLONES.)
FOLLOWING THIS, THE CPT COMPLETED NEGOTIATIONS FOR A
PRIVATELY-OWNED SHIP REPAIR YARD AT HALDIA.  THE YARD
WILL HAVE TWO DRY DOCKS WITH FACILITIES CAPABLE OF
SERVICING SHIPS UP TO 80,000 DWT AND A LAY-BY WET BERTH
WITH SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE.  SEMBAWANG SHIPYARD OF
SINGAPORE WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.  THE
PROJECT IS AWAITING A GREEN SIGNAL FROM THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT.

11.  PRIVATIZATION.  IN RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC REFORM,
CALCUTTA PORT TRUST HAS BEEN PRIVATIZING AGGRESSIVELY.
AT CALCUTTA CPT HAS LEASED OUT TWO DRY DOCKS TO A
PRIVATE, BOMBAY-BASED COMPANY AND TWO BERTHS TO TWO
OTHER PRIVATE COMPANIES.  CPT HAS HANDED OVER
MAINTENANCE OF CONTAINER HANDLING EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING
TRACTOR-TRAILERS AND RUBBER-TIRE-GANTRY CRANES, TO THEIR
MANUFACTURERS.  AT HALDIA, CPT HAS LEASED OUT TWO BERTHS
AND PLANS TO LEASE OUT MORE.

12.  CPT IS KEEN TO CONTRACT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR
CONSTRUCTION OF 15 MORE BERTHS AT HALDIA ON
BUILD-OPERATE-TRANSFER TERMS.  UNFORTUNATELY, WHILE
OFFERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FOR THE TAKEOVER OF EXISTING
PORT FACILITIES SUCH AS BERTHS, SHEDS, WAREHOUSES AND
EQUIPMENT, THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED INTEREST IN BUILDING
NEW PORT FACILITIES.

13.  LONG TERM PLANS.  FOR THE PERIOD 1992-97, THE
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALLOCATED RS. 1.8 BILLION
(APPROXIMATELY USD 51 MILLION) FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
CALCUTTA PORT AND RS. 1.7 BILLION (USD 49 MILLION) FOR
THE DEVELOPMENT OF HALDIA PORT.  THE FUNDS WILL BE USED
TO ACQUIRE CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT, PILOT VESSELS, TUGS
AND RIVER LAUNCHES.  IN ADDITION TO THE TWO
MULTI-PURPOSE BERTHS AT HALDIA AN ADDITIONAL ONE WILL BE
CONSTRUCTED AT CALCUTTA.  AT HALDIA MODERNIZATION OF
COAL HANDLING FACILITIES AND INSTALLATION OF MECHANICAL
LOADERS, CONVEYOR BELTS AND AN EXTENSION OF THE STORAGE
AREA ARE PLANNED.

14.  COMMENT:  IN ADDITION TO THE RS. 3 BILLION (USD 86
MILLION) HALDIA PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX, A REFINERY AND A
POWER PLANT ARE LIKELY TO BE BUILT AT HALDIA.  SEVERAL
PIG IRON AND STEEL PLANTS THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE SET UP
IN WEST BENGAL WILL REQUIRE IMPORTS OF COKING COAL AND
COKE.  THE PIG IRON AND STEEL PRODUCED BY THESE NEW
PLANTS ARE LIKELY TO BE EXPORTED TO CHINA AND SOUTHEAST
ASIA.  INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY IN EASTERN INDIA IS GAINING
MOMENTUM.  DUE TO THESE FACTORS, CALCUTTA AND HALDIA
PORTS ARE EXPECTED TO HANDLE 25 MILLION TONS OF CARGO IN
IFY 1996-97 AND 30 MILLION TONS BY THE TURN OF THE
CENTURY.

 NEW CUSTOMS LAW
 New Customs Law for Indonesia

A new customs law for Indonesia has been enacted which is
expected to take effect on April 1, 1996, after implementing
regulations are issued.

The new law provides for a self-assessment system enforced
through random inspections.  Importers and exporters will provide
the customs office with information on the type, quality,
quantity, and cutoms value of the goods being transported, and
any applicable tariffs or export taxes.  The calculations and
payment of duties will similarly be left to the companies
themselves.  Customs officials and excise officers will carry out
post-clearance audits, checking the veracity of the information
provided.

The new customs law also allows the government to impose
countervailing duties and antidumping tariffs to protect domestic
industry from unfair foreign competition.  It is not yet clear
how these elements of the new law will be applied.

The new law will replace current customs rules based on pre-
shipment rather than on-arrival inspection.

 SAFETY EQUIPMENT TRADE SHOW
 PROTECTION '96 TRADE FAIR, STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN,
               SEPTEMBER 16-19, 1996

Northern Europe's most important trade fair for products, systems
and services within the field of security and safety will be held
in Stockholm, Sweden on September 16-19, 1996. This trade fair,
PROTECTION, is only held every third year and the '96 fair will
be the ninth on this theme. In 1993, the fair featured 282
exhibitors from 18 countries and attracted some 19,000 visitors
from Sweden, other Nordic countries and the Baltics.

According to a recent survey conducted by SWESEC (the Swedish
Security Trade Association) the 1994 total market for safety and

 RETAIL TRENDS
 Japan -- The Big Store Law leads to Structural
Change in the Retail Sector

1. In Japan, the Big Store Law (Daitenho) has changed the face of
retailing. The law has encouraged a reduction in the numbers of
high cost, privately owned, small retail stores.  In contrast,
there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of low cost,
publicly owned shopping center-type operations.  The process of
modernizing Japan's retail sector, however, is only half
finished.  Expected liberalization of the Daitenho in 1996 and
1997 will further accelerate the transition process.  End Summary

2. Statistics recently compiled by the Japan Development Bank
clearly indicate the inefficiencies of the Japanese distribution
system relative to its U.S. counterpart.

- From 1980 to 1993, the number of people engaged in wholesale
and retail trade in Japan increased only 1.43 million compared to
an increase of 5.05 million in the U.S. during the same period.

- Japan's wholesale/retail share of GDP was reduced from 14.3 to
14.1 percent compared to an increase in the U.S. from 13.5
percent to 16.6 percent, during the same period.

- Japan's wholesale/retail ratio is 2.1/1, compared to 1.1/1 in
the U.S.

- In the U.S., 60 percent of all retail stores were privately
owned in 1972.  This percentage fell to 36 percent by 1988.  In
Japan, 61 percent of total retail stores were privately owned in
1994.

3. According to 1994 MITI statistics, there are 1.59 million
retailers in Japan, of which small retailers with 1 to 4 workers
comprised 1.13 million or 71 percent of the total.  These small
stores have been disappearing at a rate of 47,000 stores per year
since a partial relaxation of the Daitenho in 1990.

4. At the same time, the number of large stores has been
increasing rapidly.  In 1989, before the implementation of the
relaxation of the Daitenho, the number of annual applications for
the establishment of large stores was 794.  In 1990, the number
of applications increased to 1,667.  In 1995, more than 1,900
applications to open large stores have thus far been submitted.

5. Since 1990, partial relaxation of the Daitenho has taken place
three times, as follows:

1990 --   Maximum length of the application processing became 18
          months.  (Implemented through an extended
          interpretation of the law.)

1992 --   Maximum length of application processing became 12
          months.  Adoption of procedural transparency
          (Implemented through partial amendment of the law.)

1994 --   Basic liberalization of stores with floor space less
          than 1,000 square meters.  Relaxation of store hours,
          number of holidays in a year, etc. (Implemented
          through an extended interpretation of the law.)

6. In the not too distant future, we expect incremental reform of
the Daitenho to continue.  Specifically, we expect that the
application process will be simplified.  Moreover, the time
required for approval will fall from the present 9 month period.
In 1997, it is likely that the government will announce further
liberalization of store operating parameters, including floor
space, business hours and number of vacation days.

7. At the same time, one should remember that there are many
forces working against the relaxation of the Big Store Law.  The
following associations have lined up in support of the present
highly restrictive legislation:
a)  Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry
b)  Federation of National Commerce and Industry
c)  Central Organization for National Small/Medium Sized Business
d)  Federation of National Shopping District Promotion
    Association, and
e)  8 other small/medium size business organizations.

Organizations that favor reform or abolition of the law are:
a)  Foreign Governments
b)  Large store corporations
c)  Japan Chain Store Association
d)  Federation of Economic Organization in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

8. Industry sources say that the restrictions of the Daitenho
have led to rapid development of a large number of suburban,
roadside stripmalls.  These stripmalls do not have any large
store tenants.  Rather, they contain a large number of small
retail outlets and therefore do not fall under the purview of the
Daitenho.  At the same time, these stripmalls do not enjoy the
same economies of scale, or low prices, as large shopping centers
with one or more large scale tenants.

9. As of now, while there are as many as 40,000 shopping centers
in the U.S., there are only 2,225 shopping centers with large
scale tenants in Japan.  An industry source estimates that the
number of Japanese shopping centers will increase by 20,000 over
the next ten years.

10. At the same time, there are 15,000 shop-lined streets in
Japan.  Almost all of the outlets along the "shopping streets"
are privately owned and managed as single store outlets.  They
are high cost operations and are the most likely to fall victim
to further liberalization of the Daitenho.  For example,
according to a recent article in "Distribution Service News," 7
of 33 three stores in Kamuma City's shop-lined street are closed.
This case is considered to be typical of many Japanese towns and
small cities.

11. The success of "Toys R Us" has is inspired similar large
scale, single category formats in other segments: electronics,
appliances, tools, men's wear and sporting goods.  The trend is
accelerating as Japanese companies anticipate further relaxation,
and ultimate abolition, of the Daitenho in the near future.

12. The structural shift in the retail industry in Japan is
taking place at a time when the "barriers to entry" for foreign
retailers are much reduced.  Land prices have dropped on the
average by 50 percent and rental is down by 40 percent.  This is
due to record levels of real estate vacancies (15 percent in
major cities).  In addition, companies that wish to build their
own properties will find that construction costs have also
declined up to 40 percent in some cases.  Most importantly, the
low value of the dollar gives companies that source abroad a
competitive advantage over Japanese competitors.  Now is a good
time for foreign retailers to re-consider entry into the Japanese
market.

 WATER QUALITY PLAN

1. SUMMARY: The results of a recent study, "Quality of Water in
Spain: Summary Report", published by the Ministry of Health and
Consumer Affairs, indicate that the quality of Spanish coastal
waters is good, whereas there are still problems with continental
waters, especially in Spain's central regions. The control
network established to measure the quality of water in Spain is
managed by Hydrographic Confederacies, which feed data to the
Ministry in Madrid through an automatic station network. This
network officially began working in March 1995 under the name
SAICA (Sistema Automatico de Informacion de Calidad de las Aguas,
Water Quality Information Automatic Network). This report
provides background information on the SAICA program and a list
of the Hydrographic Confederacies and Spanish firms that supply
equipment or services to SAICA, which is considered one of the
most sophisticated water quality information systems in the
world.

2.  The network established to control and measure the quality of
water in Spain is managed by the Hydrographic Confederacies,
which are independent governmental bodies located throughout the
country with responsibilities for monitoring and managing Spain's
water resources. These Confederacies have implemented a remote
system for measuring the quality of water (automatic stations
network) under the name SAICA (Sistema Automatico de Informacion
de Calidad de las Aguas). These stations can transmit monitored
data via satellite to the headquarters of each Hydrographic
Confederacy and to a central unit located in the Ministry of
Public Works, Transportation and Environment in Madrid. The data
transmitted through this network gives information on turbidity,
ph, carbon and metal content, oxygen content, phosphates and
ammonia. Each Confederacy has its own analytical laboratory, or
has special agreements with officially approved private
laboratories.

3. The SAICA system is considered one of the most sophisticated
systems of its kind in the world, and official Spanish sources
proudly say that it is the only system in the world established
on a country-wide basis. It covers all of the main river basins
in Spain and uses state-of-the-art technology. Total investment
in the SAICA system was Pts 10,000 million (USD 80 million) which
includes installation of 1,000 manual water quality control
stations and 200 automatic control stations. Investment was
partially funded through European Union Cohesion Funds (85% of
total investment).

For further information on the Spanish water quality control
system please see "IMI: Water Quality Measuring in Spain" dated
August 1995 and prepared by FCS Barcelona.

4. Interested U.S. suppliers of water quality control and data
transmitting equipment may wish to contact the Hydrographic
Confederacies directly (as they have responsibility for equipment
procurement in their regions) or contact the private firms which
provide equipment or are in charge of the SAICA network for each
major Spanish river basin.

 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS
 New Internet Provider in Indonesia

On November 30, 1995 a new Internet provider was launched. It is
the fifth Internet provider in Indonesia to date.
The provider is called CBNnet, established by P.T. Cyberindo
Aditama in cooperation with YPTI, Foundation of Technical
Education in Indonesia, a foundation under the Department of
Tourism, Post and Telecommunication.
Mr. Dani Sumarsono, president of P.T. Cyberindo Aditama,
informed U.S. Commercial Service Jakarta that Internet business
in Indonesia will grow steadily and competition will be based on
services, tariff rates, reliability and accessibility. Tariff
levels have been set by the government, so that each Internet
provider only has a narrow band within which to compete in price.
CBNnet has a maximum modem speed of 28.8 Kbps for individual
accounts (IP dial up) and 33.6 Kbps for corporate accounts (LAN
dial up). At this stage, its target market is the professionals
in the Jakarta area. With improving infrastructures, CBNnet is
optimist it could get at least 2,000 individual accounts in the
first year of operation. Mr. Sumarsono revealed that there has
already been a big jump in the number of Internet users in
Jakarta. In June this year, there were 8,000 users, but by
September there were 15,000 users. He expects it will take
several more years for the industry to become fully mature.
There are currently four other Internet providers : IndoInternet
(P.T. IndoInternet), Idola (P.T. Aplikanusa Lintasartha), Radnet
(P.T. Rahajasa Media Internet) and IBM Internet Connection (P.T.
Sistelindo Mitralintas).

         CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NEWS

         CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NEWS

1. Summary: Eastern Germany's large chemicals industry, which
accounted for 20 percent of total industrial output for the
nation before reunification, continues to confront the problems
of restructuring its large inefficient chemical concerns,
adapting to new markets, finding buyers, and cleaning up massive
pollution.

2. Background:  in the former GDR (Eastern Germany), 230 chemical
companies, encompassing petrochemicals, plastics, rubber, and
potash mining, were grouped into 14 huge conglomerates.  By 1994
over 200 of these companies had been privatized.  However, the
size of these privatized companies averaged under 300 employees.
The remaining chemicals firms had the overwhelming share of the
total employees in the industry.  The large companies also
suffered from antiquated equipment and continue to operate in the
midst of massive environmental damage. The most publicized
privatization case covered the three chemical production sites in
eastern Germany which Dow Chemical (Midland, Michigan) agreed to
buy in November.  This is the Buna Sow Leuna (BSL) conglomerate.

3. Interim Market Dynamics:  the output trend for inorganic and
organic chemicals clearly reflects changes in the eastern German
chemicals market.  The primary change is aimed at reducing
lignite processing and building up a petrochemicals base.  Since
the middle of 1990 over 150 antiquated production facilities in
the chemical industry have been shut down in eastern Germany.  In
Leuna, plants for ammonia, methanol high-pressure, and phenol
synthesis were shut down, and in the Buna facility, carbide-
acetylene production.  Until production of basic chemicals can be
restarted on a petrochemical basis, organic chemicals for further
processing are purchased from elsewhere.

4. Environmental Consequences: environmental cleanup is a high
priority for the Germans, accounting for one-third of total
investments in the eastern German chemicals industry.  The
Treuhand (federal privatization agency) originally provided Buna
with DM 300 million for the construction of an oxychlorinating
plant for pvc production and for an air separation plant.  For
Leuna the Treuhand provided DM 250 million for a hydrogen
production plant, a refinery water cleaning plant, a
desulphurization plant, and a tanker filling station.  For many
chemical companies, funds are being provided for disposing of
polluted waste dumps.

5. Dow Chemical: In November, 1995 the European Commission
reached a final decision to approve the privatization of the Buna
Sow Leuna (BSL) Olefin chemicals conglomerate in the eastern
German state of Saxony-Anhalt. To that end the EC Commission has
decided to allow up to 5.5 billion dollars of investment
subsidies to support the privatisation plan laid out by Dow
Chemical. Dow will own 80 percent of the BSL conglomerate with
the remaining 20 percent owned by BVS (the successor agency to
the Treuhand).  So far, ten companies have signed letters of
intent to join Dow at BSL, including the American plastics
molder, Ampacet Corp., Spanish-owned Grupo Coexpan, the Belgian
Ravago, Italy's ILPA, Manuli Group and Deribok.

6. Modernisation: Dow has plans to upgrade a number of existing
facilities.  The existing chlorine plant will be upgraded from
the current mercury-based process to a membrane process,
eliminating the use of mercury in these plants.  The ethylene
dichloride (EDC)  and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plant at Buna
will be upgraded along with an increase of VCM capacity to
330,000 tons per year.  The existing rubber production facilities
will be retrofitted and upgraded.  The low-density polyethylene
plants at the Leuna site will be upgraded to increase plant
safety.  And a general upgrade of the process instrumentation and
control systems is planned.  The Boehlen steam cracker which
produces the main building blocks for derivative plants at all
three sites will be upgraded and expanded to make the cracker
globally cost-competitive in technology and feedstock
flexibility.  Total capacity by the end of 1997 will be 450,000
tons per year.  The upgrade will include plant modifications such
as four new cracking furnaces, on-stream analyzers and
computerized process control.

7. New Equipment: new facilities are also planned.  A 210,000
ton-per-year plant for the production of DOWLEX(r) linear low-
density polyethylene at the Buna site will come on stream in late
1997, in coordination with the expanded production of the steam
cracker at Boehlen.  A 200,000 ton-per-year polypropylene plant
will be built at the Buna site and will come on stream during the
second quarter of 1998.  A 130,000 ton-per-year aniline plant
will come on stream in late 1998.  A 90,000 ton-per-year acrylic
acid and a 93,000 ton-per-year acrylic ester unit will be built
to obtain viable economics through scale and technology.  Several
facilities for the compounding and recycling of polymers will be
added to the Buna site.

8. Feedstock Pipeline: a new pipeline is also planned.  A 16-inch
multi-feedstock liquid pipeline from the deep-sea port of Rostock
to the Boehlen site has already been started by the Saechsische
Olefinwerke GmbH.  Planning and construction of this pipeline
will include the construction of required facilities such as
harbor facilities, terminals and pump stations.

9. Chemicals Industry Supplier Mission:  FCS Berlin is planning
for the Spring of 1996 a trade mission to eastern Germany, which
will include a stop at the Buna Sow Leuna facilities.  Those U.S.
firms that can benefit from new contacts in the chemicals
industry in eastern Germany are encouraged to participate.  The
mission will be coordinated with German authorities to insure
that the best contacts are made for the U.S. participants.  For
follow-up information and costs on the trade mission, contact:

 BICYCLE MARKET OVERVIEW
 TURKISH BICYCLE MARKET

1.  THE TURKISH BICYCLE INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO
MANUFACTURE 900 THOUSAND UNITS WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF
APPROX. $175 MILLION IN 1995.  WITH 64 MILLION POPULATION
AND 60% OF THE PEOPLE IN 0-30 AGES, TURKEY BICYCLE MARKET
OFFERS LUCRATIVE OPPORTUNITIES.  90% OF THE DEMAND IN
1995 IS EXPECTED FOR MOUNTAIN BIKE (MTB) TYPE.  BICYCLE
DENSITY IN TURKEY IS 8 UNITS PER 100 PEOPLE.

2.  LOCAL PRODUCTION: LOCAL PRODUCTION HAS MET OVER 95%
OF THE DEMAND UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO.  THE DEMAND WAS FOR
LOW QUALITY LOW PRICED BICYCLES.  LOCAL PRODUCTION
ADAPTED ITSELF TO THIS MARKET TREND FOR A LONG TIME.  THE
TREND HAS CHANGED ONLY RECENTLY WHEN IMPORTERS CAME INTO
THE PICTURE.  IMPORTS OF DIVERSE RANGE AND QUALITY OF
BICYCLES WHICH STARTED TO DRIVE THE MARKET, PROMPTED THE
LOCAL MANUFACTURERS TO FOLLOW SUIT.  SOME OF THEM SIGNED
LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH LEADING BRANDS, WHILE OTHERS
DIRECTED THEMSELVES TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY.  IN 1995,
LOCAL PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO REACH 900,000 UNITS AND
$175 MILLION.  LOCAL BISAN TAKES 50% SHARE FROM THE
MARKET. MARKET SHARE FOR OTHER COMPETITORS ARE BELDESAN
(25%), BIANCHI(25%), AND OZBELGE(10%).  BICYCLE PRICES
VARY BETWEEN $250-400 FOR STANDARD BICYCLES, WHERE THEY
CAN BE AS HIGH AS $2,500 FOR SPECIAL ONES.

3.  IMPORTS: BICYCLE IMPORTS DECREASED TO 58,487 UNITS
($2.8 MILLION) IN 1994 FROM 1993'S FIGURE OF 100,258
($5.2 MILLION) DUE TO A MAJOR ECONOMIC CRISIS IN TURKEY.
TAIWAN AND PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) TAKE THE
LION'S SHARE OF THE IMPORT MARKET.  BREAKDOWN OF IMPORTS
ACCORDING TO COUNTRIES IS AS FOLLOWS:

               1993                     1994
COUNTRY   QUANTITY  VALUE          QUANTITY  VALUE

TAIWAN    70,880    3,744,078      38,718    2,014,312
PRC       15,151      986,070      14,169      355,936
ITALY      1,514      141,182       4,865      353,061
U.S.          20        8,050         172       32,313
TOTAL    100,258    5,249,994      58,487    2,785,329

DESPITE THE DECREASE IN THE OVERALL BICYCLE IMPORTS IN
1994, IT IS OBSERVED THAT IMPORT FIGURES HAVE GROWN FOR
ITALY AND U.S.  ALTHOUGH RESPECTIVE QUANTITIES ARE QUITE
LOWER THAN THE FIRST TWO COUNTRIES, IMPORT VALUE PER
BICYCLE IS MUCH HIGHER.  THESE FIGURES IMPLY THAT THE
U.S. EXPORTERS SHOULD AIM FOR THE HIGH-END OF THE MARKET
DRIVEN BY HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND QUALITY.  MOUNTAIN BIKES,
FOR EXAMPLE, CONSTITUTE A GOOD MARKET FOR U.S. SUPPLIERS.

IMPORT TAX IS 3.8% FOR EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES AND 17%
FOR OTHERS.  IT WILL BE ZEROED FOR EU COUNTRIES WITH THE
CUSTOMS UNION WHICH WILL START IN 1996.  SOME DECREASE IS
EXPECTED FOR OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL.

4.  EXPORTS: BICYCLE EXPORTS FROM TURKEY OVER THE LAST
TWO YEARS WERE AS FOLLOWS:

1993: 36,497 UNITS ($2.4 MILLION)

1994: 82,628 UNITS ($4.8 MILLION)

MAJOR EXPORT MARKETS IN 1994 WERE: ITALY: 19,405,
GERMANY: 17,056, CZECH REPUBLIC: 11,990, POLAND: 7,676,
GREECE: 6,525.

CIBC
Mr. Paul T. Fisher, V.P. & Corporate Secretary
Commerce Court, Toronto, ON M5L 1A2, Canada
tel.: 416 980-3095; fax: 416 980 7012.

Listed Exchange(s):  Montreal

Business:   CIBC is a broadly based Canadian financial services  company
operating  on  a global basis.  In terms of assets, it is one  of  North
America's   largest   financial  institutions.   CIBC's   Personal   and
Commercial Bank provides a full range of financial services to 6,000,000
individuals,  farmers  and  businesses across Canada.   It  also  serves
retail  customers through one of the largest financial networks  in  the
West Indies and through private banking centers around the world.   CIBC
Wood  Gundy  offers  a  wide spectrum  of  credit  and  capital  markets
capabilities  to  several thousand corporate clients  and  institutional
investors  worldwide.   In  addition,  it  provides  a  wide  range   of
investment  services to individuals.  Employees throughout the group  of
companies  are  dedicated to building long-term relationships  with  all
CIBC  customers.   CIBC helps individuals and businesses  achieve  their
visions by anticipating and meeting their changing needs, and delivering
integrated  solutions.  This is how CIBC ultimately enhances  value  for
its shareholders.

News:   CIBC  became  stronger  in almost every  respect  in  1994.   It
generated  higher revenue growth and record earnings, and  significantly
improved  the  quality of its balance sheet.  CIBC  also  developed  and
refined its business strategies to ensure long-term growth and drive  it
toward its goal of becoming the pre-eminent Canadian financial  services
company.

Revenues  grew across the organization, reflecting gains in  traditional
product  lines as well as efforts to diversify sources of  income.   Net
income increased to $890 million, up from $730 million last year.   CIBC
achieved  record  net income of $255 million for the 1st  quarter  ended
January 31, 1995, an increase of $41 million or 19% from the same period
a  year ago and $19 million or 8% from the previous  quarter.   Earnings
per  share  increased to $3.52 from $2.99 last year.  Return  on  equity
climbed  to  11.7%  compared with 10.6% in fiscal 1993.   At  year  end,
CIBC's balance sheet and capital ratios were the strongest they've  been
in  many  years.   It  strengthened  the  balance  sheet  by  increasing
liquidity and improving the quality of the lending portfolio.  The level
of net non-performing loans decreased to $1.5 billion from $2.4  billion
the   previous   year.   In  the  last  year,   CIBC   accelerated   its
transformation into a broadly-based financial services company.

It  strengthened  the  core  franchise  and  moved  ahead  with  planned
expansions into new businesses and markets.  With the acquisition of The
Personal  Insurance Company of Canada, CIBC gained critical mass in  the
group  insurance  market.   And  the  merger  of  the  CIBC   Investment
Management  Corporation subsidiary with T.A.L. Investment  Counsel  Ltd.
provides  CIBC  with  a majority stake in what is now  one  of  Canada's
largest  institutional  investment managers.  Over the year,  CIBC  also
expanded its trust operations to 26 offices across Canada,  consolidated
a  leading  position in the Canadian credit card market,  added  to  the
volume  of  residential  mortgages and  consumer  loans,  and  increased
lending to small and medium-sized businesses.

Business:    Oki   Electric  Industry  Company  Limited  is   a   global
manufacturer  and marketer of leading-edge  telecommunications  systems,
information processing systems and electronic devices.

Spanning  more  than 11 decades, Oki Electric has imbued  a  progressive
spirit  of  enterprise into market-winning products and  services.   The
Company's  integrating  concept is People to  People  Technology,  which
embraces  multimedia, human interface systems and electronic devices  to
enhance communications worldwide.

Oki Electric is a responsible corporate citizen that contributes to  the
well-being of its host communities around the world.

The  Company  was founded in January 1881 and  established  in  November
1949.

News:   August  1995  Message from the  President  and  Chief  Executive
Officer, Mr. Jun Jinguji:

"Oki  Electric  attained consolidated net sales of yen657.0  billion  in
fiscal  1994, ended March 31, 1995.  Up 0.8% from a year  earlier,  this
result reflected increased demand for telecommunications  infrastructure
and  for semiconductors used in personal computers (PCs).   However,  we
improved our bottom line dramatically, recording a net income of yen32.3
billion,  or  yen52.70  per share, compared with a net  loss  of  yen1.8
billion, or yen2.85 per share, the previous period.  In fiscal 1995,  we
expect once again to achieve net sales on the order of yen650.0  billion
despite the strong yen and moderate outlook for economic growth.

"We  have  rebounded  from  our  fiscal  1992  low  by  implementing   a
restructuring plan from April 1993 that reorganized production,  sharply
reduced fixed costs and converted the operations for select  high-volume
products into separate entities.  Our printer and facsimile  operations,
for  example,  were established as an independent subsidiary,  Oki  Data
Corp.,  on October 1, 1994.  Our firm results for this year are  largely
attributable to the success of these restructuring measures.  To sustain
momentum and stabilize profitability, we are starting a second phase  of
the plan in fiscal 1995, aimed at further refining operating efficiency,
consolidating resources and focusing on select businesses.  We intend to
mobilize  Oki Electric's progressive spirit and corporate  strengths  to
realize the virtually unlimited opportunities of the emerging multimedia
era.

"Multimedia  systems  offer  robust  growth  potential  and  utilize Oki
Electric's  strengths,  making  them  a prime  focus  for  the  Company.
Advancing  in  this direction, we became an equity  partner  in  General
Magic,  Inc., a leading communications alliance, in December  1994.   We
are  using  its platform technologies to develop  innovative  multimedia
communications terminal systems.  We also launched sales of asynchronous
transfer mode switching systems and related products.  By  participating
in  numerous  service  trials,  we are  striving  to  commercialize  new
applications that will help determine the future shape of the multimedia
society.

"In recent years, demand for large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs)  has
grown with the expansion of the markets for PCs, peripherals and  mobile
communications equipment.  To respond to this demand, we completed Phase
1  construction  of  manufacturing facilities for  LSIs  at  Miyagi  Oki
Electric Co., in fiscal 1994 and scheduled production to commence in the
first quarter of 1996.

"The approaching 21st century is often described as the Age of Asia.  In
recognition  of the region's potential, we plan to expand  our  regional
production  and  marketing presence.  We have started  this  process  by
reinforcing our marketing and service network throughout Asia.

"Oki Electric has undergone a successful revitalization in the past  two
fiscal  years.   Our  task over fiscal 1995  is  to  further  streamline
operations, focus on key business segments and develop new  capabilities
to create a secure foundation for growth well into the 21st Century."

           liabilities 101,001,800      (group: 104,031,500)

News:  Postipankki has 5,761 employees; was established in 1886  and  is
the  third  largest  commercial bank in Finland.   In  addition  to  its
extensive domestic network and advanced payment systems, the Bank has an
international  network with branches in London, New York  and  Singapore
and  representative offices in Stockholm, Moscow and Tokyo.  Moreover  a
worldwide   network  of  correspondent  banks  in  the  most   important
industrial  and  business  centers ensures the speedy  handling  of  the
bank's  international business.  After suffering a prolonged  recession,
the Finnish economy took a turn for the better in 1993.  Though domestic
demand  continued to decline, exports embarked on an energetic  upswing.
The value of the markka weakened early in the year, but the unexpectedly
fast  decrease  in the current account deficit, mainly  due  to  Finnish
companies'  success  on  export markets,  gradually  began  to  generate
expectations  of  a revaluation.  The Postipankki Group  performed  much
better in 1993 than in 1992, but still showed a loss.  The  consolidated
operating  loss was FIM 354 million, i.e., FIM 287 million less than  in
1992.    Postipankki   Ltd's  operating  loss  was  FIM   372   million.
Consolidated net income from financial operations rose 12% to FIM  3,032
million,  against a mere 2% rise in 1992.  Net interest income stood  at
FIM 2,567 million, up 17% compared with the previous year's 4%.

           liabilities  175,345,000     liabilities   175,491,000

News:    Net  income  nearly tripled between 1993  and  1994  to  $1,169
million.   A significant factor behind the improved 1994 earnings was  a
$930  million, or more than 50%, reduction in the provision  for  credit
losses  and a 36% reduction in net non-accrual loans from  1993  levels.
Cost  control  initiatives  included  the  reduction  of  complement  by
approximately  3,500  employees and the closure of  130  branches.   The
integration  of  Royal  Trust which was acquired  in  1993  was  largely
completed on schedule and on budget.  Assets under administration in the
bank's  mutual fund business grew 25% from 1993, making Royal  Bank  the
second  largest  provider of retail mutual funds in  Canada.   The  bank
helped   create   a   new   world  class   venture   fund   to   support
commercialization  of  drug  products and devices  to  treat  brain  and
central  nervous system disorders.  As well, $125 million was  committed
to a risk capital fund created to finance the growth of small and medium
size  businesses.   Plans were announced for a telephone  banking  Super
Centre  that will provide customers with faster, more  flexible  service
from  anywhere in the country, 24 hours a day.  During 1994, the  bank's
brokerage  subsidiary, RBC Dominion Securities, recorded net  income  of
$133 million.  Effective November 1, 1994, John Cleghorn was named Chief
Executive  Officer  of Royal Bank, succeeding Mr. Allan  R.  Taylor  who
remains Chairman of the Board until the bank's annual meeting on January
26, 1995.

NEWS: GRANADA SET FOR FINAL TILT AT FORTE

Granada enters the closing stages of its campaign to buy Forte this
week with a harder job on its hands than many observers thought
probable when the hostile bid was launched.

In the face of Forte's skillfully marshalled defence, Granada must
decide by Tuesday whether to increase its cash offer of 321p per Forte
share - the City thinks at least 380p is needed - or to stick to its
guns. That means trying to convince investors that its brand of
management is what underperforming Forte needs. Unless the television-
to-motorway services group comes up with something eye-catching, what
started out with a bang risks ending with a whimper.

Forte surprised many this week by the robustness of its final offer,
according to stockbrokers' analysts. There is now a growing band which
reckons Granada must both increase its price and improve the quality
and detail of its argument.

It is not just the fact that Forte has found enough cash, thanks to the
proposed sale of its roadside cafes to Whitbread for pounds 1.05bn, to
launch a share buy-back worth pounds 800m (including the associated tax
credit). The pledge to distribute its stake in Savoy Hotels, worth 23p
a share, also increases shareholder value. After years of static
dividends, this week's promise to raise the payout 20 per cent a year
until the end of the decade was unexpected.

Forte claimed that to match the income provided under its latest
defence plan, Granada would have to raise its own dividend by 43 per
cent a year over the period. The bidder responded with its own estimate
of how easily Forte could live up to its promises. 'To cover the
dividend pledge Forte will have to double its profits over the next
three years,' said Granada finance director Henry Staunton. 'Given its
past record and the volatile nature of the business this is risky.'

Mr Staunton, questioning Forte's debt levels and highlighting the poor
returns it had made on its upmarket hotels, this week sounded
increasingly like a man preparing to tough it out, fighting on
Granada's skills and solid past record. This may be because increasing
the bid could push the bidder's debts to levels it would be
uncomfortable with. A cash bid of 380p would call for another pounds
500m, with pro-forma gearing already more than 200 per cent. Mr
Staunton and his chief executive Gerry Robinson may nevertheless regard
such debt levels as sustainable, with the cash-generating power of
Granada's ITV franchises (Granada and London Weekend) and interest
payments still covered roughly three times, as they would be at Forte.

This week Forte and its advisers stole their adversaries' rhetoric.
Whereas Granada's opening shot dwelt on the gulf in management
expertise and strategic focus between the companies, it's now Forte
which boasts that after its programme of disposals it will be the more
focused, growth-orientated company. Granada still has the option of
pledging to implement much of what Forte's management has agreed to do.
If it couples this approach with a higher offer, the argument as to
which of the two managements deserves support would be back on.

NEWS: MONEYBROKING - CITY CLUB LOSES ELITE STATUS

The New Year heralded a challenging new era for the hitherto exclusive
club of gilt market moneybrokers. Companies affected include Cater Allen -
owner of Sheppards, the largest moneybroking firm - Gerrard & National,
King & Shaxson and Union.

To help nourish the new market in gilt repos - agreements to sell and
repurchase gilts at a fixed price and on a fixed date - the Bank of
England has liberalised Stock Exchange moneybroking across the board,
with effect from 2 January, when repo trading got off to the gentlest
of starts. The Bank is keen for repos to thrive, as the ability to
issue them at will would help it fine-tune interest rate movements. In
the US, by comparison, the Federal Reserve intervenes daily in Treasury
bond repo markets.

Up to now, just eight firms have possessed a Stock Exchange
moneybroking license, allowing them to arrange for shares or gilts to
be borrowed or loaned on a short-term basis, principally by market-
makers wanting to balance their books at the end of each day's trading.
Now, any Stock Exchange member can act as a broker, and anyone can lend
or borrow. Merrill Lynch analyst Martin Green believes that, over time,
huge growth in the repo market should compensate the established
moneybrokers for a gradual loss of market share and erosion of profit
margins.

Among the quoted companies which must cope with the loss of their
'closed-shop' privileges, Cater Allen makes the most significant
proportion of its earnings from this market. In the year to last April,
43 per cent of the pounds 23.9m group profit before tax and exceptional
items came from Sheppards. Merrill Lynch forecasts pounds 20.8m this
year and a dividend of 30p, giving a PE ratio of 9 and a yield of 8.8
per cent; last year's 29p total dividend was almost twice covered.
Sheppards could be a business with appeal to an overseas buyer wanting
to move early and quickly into London's repo and related markets. Next
most exposed is Gerrard & National. It made 15 per cent of pre-
exceptional profits last year from its moneybroking franchise.

NEWS: LOOKING FOR CLUES ON THE TAKEOVER TRAIL

Industry leaders may moan about short-termism in the City, but the
plain fact is that investors love takeovers. And it's no wonder when
you look at what a determined bidder can do for the price of shares in
the target company. Last year, as ever, some of the happiest investors
were those who held shares in companies on the receiving end of
takeover bids.

Internet access provider Unipalm saw its shares rise more than four-
fold before US counterpart UUNet gained control. And shareholders in
more widely held stocks, such as Eastern Group (bought by Hanson) and
VSEL (GEC), saw bids lead to bumper profits.

Anyone who gets in ahead of the takeover action in 1996 will seriously
increase their chances of a prosperous new year. Here, then, are
Investors Chronicle's five companies most likely to attract a bid in
the coming months.

Kwik Save (500p) Dismal recent trading and a share price which has
lagged the market by almost a quarter over the past year make this a
prime takeover candidate. The group is being squeezed both by food
giants such as Sainsbury and Tesco and by foreign-owned discounters
like Netto and Aldi. Lead shareholder Dairy Farm (part of Hong Kong's
Jardine Matheson) is no longer bound by an agreement not to raise its
30 per cent stake. Even if it has tired of its poorly performing
investment, a suitor could pick up Kwik-Save at anything between 700p
and 800p.

Vosper Thornycroft (824p) The Southampton-based warship builder could
provide a tasty morsel for high- flying British Aerospace. BAe was
thwarted in its attempt to buy VSEL, and could be looking for another
catch to take it further into naval contracting. Vosper provides the
only challenge in this arena since VSEL and Yarrow are both part of
GEC. Although BAe is no longer desperate for cash, Vosper had a healthy
pounds 109m surplus at the last count. The shipbuilder also has a
healthy order book and is winning work away from shipbuilding too.

British Gas (256p) The shares plumbed new lows in 1995 as the market
digested the implications of its fixed-price take-or-pay contract
liabilities and fears over the new pricing regime for TransCo, the gas
transportation arm. Rumours of a predator surfaced late last year. At
pounds 11bn British Gas would be a mouthful for anyone. But TransCo
could be worth pounds 18bn, there is a valuable exploration division
and the company remains in a very strong position in the UK gas market.
Management would also have a hard job to defend its recent performance.

Crest Packaging (64p) It is increasingly difficult for smaller
packaging companies to compete. Without sufficient buying power and
economies of scale they need to grow significantly or be swallowed up.
Parkside and Ferry Pickering have already gone, and little Crest could
be next. It makes flexible packaging and cartons for consumer markets
and discussed a merger with Parkside last year. It has found it
difficult to pass on input price increases, and trading conditions
'remain tough'. Managing director Rodney Webb owns two-thirds of the
shares, so a buyer would need his consent.

Allied Domecq (537p) Vultures have reportedly been circling over Allied
for some time. Major restructuring and a number of changes in direction
have not produced significantly better performance either for the
business or the shares. Unless that changes soon, a buyer which fancies
its chances of running Allied's portfolio of spirit brands, pubs and
brewing activities could be hard to resist. Sir Christopher Hogg takes
over as chairman in April. He has to put some zip into Allied quickly
or it may be a short term of office.

NEWS: AMSTRAD - RESIGNATION HITS SHARES

Amstrad shares crashed almost 13 per cent in the quiet trading period
between Christmas and New Year as the consumer and business electronics
group belatedly revealed that its chief executive had quit. David
Rogers had served just 16 months of his three-year contract, which paid
him a salary of pounds 225,000.

The departure fuelled fears that Amstrad founder and chairman Alan
Sugar was once more taking hands-on control. Analysts also believe Mr
Sugar's thwarted plan of three years ago to take the company private
may be revived.

The City has never been convinced of Mr Sugar's commitment to serving
the interests of all Amstrad shareholders. 'No doubt he would be
happier if he was running Amstrad and owned it himself,' an analyst
commented. Mr Sugar's buy-back offer was worth the equivalent of 150p a
share. Now at 192p, the shares are worth 28 per cent more than Mr Sugar
offered - about the rate of growth achieved by the London market as a
whole. Mr Sugar's attempt to take Amstrad private ran aground because
shareholders felt their chairman was trying to get the company on the
cheap.

Mr Rogers was Amstrad's first chief executive. His decision to go
follows a crisis board meeting last month at which directors decided to
scale down Ace, the its ailing consumer electronics business, in order
'to reduce its cost base in line with its sales potential'. Ace brings
in about a fifth of Amstrad's turnover but has incurred losses for the
past three years. However since Mr Rogers joined Amstrad, Ace had been
brought to within a whisker of breaking even. Whether it could do
better than that is debatable given the intense competition in the
audio, video and satellite TV markets.

Almost a year ago, Mr Rogers told Investors Chronicle he would quit
Amstrad if he didn't get his way in the restructuring of the company -
but made it clear that he couldn't foresee such a situation arising.
'Alan Sugar is no different from any other entrepreneur,' said Mr
Rogers. 'All need great business acumen to get where they have. But
when it comes to running a business on a day-to-day basis all
entrepreneurs need help.'

NEWS: WATER COMPANIES - BLOW TO BID HOPES

Takeover bids for water companies could be stopped in their tracks if
regulator Ian Byatt succeeds in preventing full mergers between buyers
and their water subsidiaries. Mr Byatt is conducting a campaign to
ensure that future buyers of companies under his supervision retain a
separate stock market listing for the water business. The prospect
could put would-be predators off, analysts said this week.

A separate listing would involve making at least 25 per cent of water
shares available for trading. The water arm would have to maintain an
independent board, diluting the control of the acquiring company over
matters such as dividends paid.

Corporate activity in the water industry has been relatively meagre in
comparison to the frenzied electricity sector, with just Northumbrian
Water losing its independence (to French utility Lyonnaise des Eaux).
While this combined group has informally agreed to retain a separate
quotation for the UK water utility, North West Water and Welsh Water,
which are taking over electricity companies, have so far resisted
pressure to follow suit.

Mr Byatt maintains that separate share price information is needed to
provide the regulator with an adequate basis for performance
comparisons. Some analysts find Ofwat's stance baffling, however. 'To
try and change the rules halfway through the game is ludicrous and
raises questions about Ian Byatt's credibility,' said one of them.

Companies which buy water distributors but resist separate listings
could face changes in their licence, said Ofwat. Failure to agree would
mean a referral to the monopolies commission - a prospect which is
often enough to derail takeover bids.

NEWS: WATER COMPANIES - BURST PIPES BRING MORE BUSINESS

Ofwat this week called on water companies to explain why the loss of
water supplies to some weather-affected parts of the UK had lasted so
long. So far, though, the cost to water companies of the spate of burst
pipes looks likely to be slight. And the problem is even bringing extra
business to the hard-pressed building supplies sector. 'It's a nice
short-term boost but the overall impact is marginal,' said Steve
Webster, finance director of plumbing parts distributor Wolseley. 'The
rest of the market remains depressed.'

NEWS: SCHRODERS - MANAGER QUITS

Shares in the pounds 104m Schroder Japan Growth investment trust fell
by almost 5 per cent this week as fund manager Ed Merner announced his
resignation from Schroders for 'personal reasons'. A Schroders
spokeswoman denied there would be much effect on its funds, but Charles
Cade, an investment trust analyst at Merrill Lynch, warned: 'Ed Merner
is a big name and that supported the rating of the trust.' Mr Merner
also managed Schroders' pounds 229m Japanese Smaller Companies unit
trust.

The Japan Growth trust has performed well since its launch in July
1994. In the year to 1 November 1995 it was second-best of 12 funds in
the sector according to Micropal. The Smaller Companies unit trust has
been less successful, its performance in the five years to November
earning it 56th place among 73 funds.

Schroders appointed Andrew Rose, an institutional fund manager, to run
the unit trust and Jonathan Bolton, who currently manages another
Japanese unit trust, to run the Japan Growth Fund.

NEWS: FINANCE BILL - WRECKING CREW

Labour will attempt to derail the government's reforms of executive
share options and taxation as it tries to capitalise on John Major's
dwindling majority and amend the Finance Bill.

Labour believes the bill could be the key to its campaign to undermine
the government, which has a majority of five after the defection of
Devon MP Emma Nicholson to the Liberal Democrats.

Chancellor Kenneth Clarke announced in November's Budget speech that
profits on share options worth up to pounds 20,000 and granted to
employees since 17 July 1995 would be subject to capital gains tax
rather than income tax. The chancellor also said that share options
granted under a scheme approved by the taxman would escape income tax.
A spokeswoman for Andrew Smith, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,
said the government was watering down its support for recommendations
made in the Greenbury Report.

Labour will also use Finance Bill debates to try to delay the
introduction of the new system of self-assessment for tax. The new
system, due to begin in April, will cost business and the self-employed
an extra pounds 850m in the 1998-99 tax year, Labour claims.

IF Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's forecast of 3 per cent growth in GDP
comes through in 1996 something nice should happen to profits from
Airtours, the UK's second-biggest holiday operator after Thomson
Travel. Profits could recover strongly anyway from the level of 1994-95
when Airtours had its first profits fall since getting its listing in
1987.

The key will be how well Airtours manages to protect its profit
margins. The nature of the package-tour business is that too often it
is just too easy for operators to sacrifice margins in the pursuit of
extra volumes. When demand then fails to materialise - as was the case
in the UK last year - profits fall out of bed as they are still faced
with the sticky overheads of chartered air seats and booked hotel
rooms. The imperative of covering those overheads can turn into an
unseemly scramble and wipe out profits. Indeed, ABN Amro Hoare Govett,
stockbroker to Airtours, estimates that its profits per holidaymaker
from UK tour operating alone - stripping out the contribution from
Airtours' in-house airline - dropped from pounds 13 in 1991 to pounds 7
in 1994 and a loss last year.

However, just as operational gearing can take away, so it can also
give. On Hoare Govett's sensitivity analysis, pre-interest profits from
UK tour operating can swing from zero to pounds 37m depending in
particular on demand in the crucial holiday decision time in May and
June.

With this in mind, operators have cut capacity for the coming summer;
total market capacity is probably down by about 14 per cent.
Additionally, prices in the Airtours catalogues are up 8-10 per cent.
The first test will come this month, as January is the biggest booking
period of the year (though not the most important). A dull response
could mean that Airtours and others will go for a combination of
further capacity cuts plus some discounting. Such a scenario would not
be disastrous, but would result in the sort of outcome forecast in the
table opposite. A more optimistic view of demand would imply pre-tax
profits of pounds 75m or more.

Besides, Airtours has other things going for it: airlines and hotels
operations which, so long as they confine themselves to serving the
tour-operating side, keep extra profit in-house; a travel agency that
is to some extent contracyclical and an excellent Scandinavian tour
operator, which in its first full year as part of the Airtours group
contributed pounds 25m pre-tax against an pounds 80m acquisition cost.

As to how to play the opportunity, Airtours has an inviting convertible
which yields 7.1 per cent and trades at a mere 4 per cent premium to
the ordinary. It has marginally less gearing (pounds 1 of convertible
buys 96p of equity), but the income difference must mean it is the one
for income seekers. That said, either stock is worth buying.

RADIO advertising revenues continue to grow rapidly. Even if the pace
slows, radio will still grow faster than other advertising media. The
Advertising Association recently downgraded its forecast for total
advertising growth for 1996 from 11 to 8 per cent, but kept its
prediction for radio advertising at 17 per cent; that compares with an
estimated 25 per cent rise in 1995. One of the beneficiaries will be
Capital Radio. It is cash-rich and in a good position to grow. There is
also the added spice that relaxation of cross-media ownership rules
could make it a bid target.

At the start of the 1990s radio's share of display advertising was
under 3 per cent. It is now well on the way to achieving 6 per cent by
the end of the decade. Part of this growth has come from the launch of
national radio stations, but much is due to existing stations selling
the advantages of radio advertising. London has become particularly
competitive in recent years with new stations starting up. While
Capital has inevitably lost market share, it continues to dominate. In
the third quarter of 1995 38 per cent of radio listeners tuned in to
Capital Gold on AM or Capital FM each week. As the market leader,
advertisers still make a beeline for it. Last year, underlying revenues
for all the company's radio stations grew by 21 per cent. This was
partly due to better performances from its Midlands and Southern
stations.

Capital only has around 10 per cent of the available percentage points
used to guage market share in the industry. It can hold up to 15 per
cent, so there is plenty of scope for expansion with cash in the
coffers to finance it. It is looking at new regional licences that are
coming up for grabs.

Under proposed media ownership rules, any media company with less than
20 per cent of its own market can buy itself up to 15 per cent of
another sector. That makes Capital an ideal target for an acquisitive
company operating in another branch of the media.

Stockbroker Merrill Lynch calculates that every extra 1 per cent on
revenues is worth around pounds 370,000 in extra profit. Buy for
continued growth plus the takeover possibilities.

DE LA RUE has few friends. Two profits warnings last year led to a
slump in its shares and their subsequent demotion from the FT-SE 100
index. It is time to reassess prospects. De La Rue's ability to
generate cash and its strong market positions are not doubted while
National Lottery organiser Camelot is starting to make a contribution
to profits.

Acquiring paper maker Portals a year ago looked like management taking
its eye off the ball. Yet Portals already contributes strongly to
profits and peripheral activities, such as making tea bags, have been
sold.

The banknote market is growing at 4 per cent per annum. Taking a longer-
term perspective, the integration of banknote printing and paper-making
should help De La Rue gain business through improved anti-
counterfeiting technology. The current order book has improved although
this is at lower margins.

Payment and transaction systems were supposed to take up the running
from banknotes, but they have had problems. Garny is having to cope
with stiff competition in Germany and US bank mergers hit demand for
cash machines. The trend towards increasing automation of banking is
unchanged, though. Therefore demand for the company's cash-handling
equipment should continue to grow for the foreseeable future.

Management needs to convince cynical investors that it won't slip up
again. This will take time, but we expect it to achieve this by the end
of the year. Buy.

HOW will Greenalls exploit its augmented buying power in 1996?
Skilfully, suggests the management's record. The pounds 527m purchase
of Boddington in October adds 454 outlets to the pub estate, bringing
it to 2,300, of which 1,100 are managed in-house. Though this is only 4
per cent of the UK total, the group's pubs are much higher volume than
average. Given the 20 per cent overcapacity in UK brewing, Greenalls'
enhanced position as the largest chain among the independents (those
not owned by brewers) means it is better placed than ever to buy beer
cheaply.

Greenalls' main supplier is Carlsberg/Tetley, Boddington's is
Whitbread. There are long-term supply agreements in place, till 1998
with Carlsberg/Tetley, and till 2000 with Whitbread. There is, however,
plenty of room to vary contract terms which cover only part of the
retailer's needs. Assuming it can push Whitbread product through former
Boddington pubs, and do likewise with Carlsberg/Tetley brands in
Boddington outlets, the group is in a strong position to buy cheaper
liquid, especially as the brewers always face the temptation to sell
extra volume at a very low price to get that last drop of profit.

Greenalls' finance director, Alan Rothwell, points out that the group
does virtually no business with Scottish Courage, adding that the
regional brewers are a loose cannon in capacity terms. The fact that
brewers need to renew their contracts well ahead of expiry date gives a
retailer, like Greenalls, scope to secure good buying terms for the
present as well. Boddington was bought for 21.5 times its 1994
earnings, which is why the forecast numbers in the table below are so
tame. But the beer supply/demand picture suggest that growth will
rapidly become apparent.

Elsewhere, the hotels division continues to grow nicely. The off-
licence and wholesaling businesses fit with pubs, the 500 off-licences
giving the group buying power in spirits and wines, while the pubs give
the off-licences leverage in beer. Tavern, the wholesale operation
being combined with Boddington's Liquid Assets, also benefits from the
group's extra buying power. Though not as big as Matthew Clarke,
wholesaling could be better positioned as far as price is concerned.

The stock, No. 104 by stock market capitalisation, is tapping at the
door of the FT-SE 100 club. If Greenalls gets in, index-tracking funds
should give it a further lift. Meanwhile, Greenalls grows on many
fronts. Buy.

IT IS all coming together for Wescol, the Halifax-based structural
steelmaker. One of only two quoted structural steelmakers to survive
the last recession, Wescol is making the most of a strong market. It
has improved efficiency and will benefit from the growing success of
its patented cellular steel beam.

Demand for structural steelwork - used in football grounds and large
buildings such as factories and shopping centres - is expected to grow
almost 5 per cent in 1996. The growth in sales now follows a near-
catastrophic collapse in the market after a 1989 sales peak of 1.4m
tonnes. About 250 fabricators vanished from the industry. Wescol is one
of seven key survivors. The rest include the other quoted structural
steel company, Severfield-Reeve, the privately owned William Hare and
subsidiaries of Rugby and Amec.

Structural steelwork has escaped the worst of the problems affecting
the rest of the construction industry and prospects look good for the
next 18 months. Wescol is also working hard to build exports, which
should buffer the company from any collapse in UK demand. Exports
should chip in 15 per cent of sales in 1995-96. A joint venture with a
Singapore contractor gives Wescol a way into Asian-Pacific construction
contracts, particularly in China, and Wescol is considering further
joint ventures of this type.

In the UK the company has just quadrupled the space available in its
Halifax factory. However, Wescol will continue to sub-contract some of
its work. Sub-contracted work earns a lower margin, but it also
transfers some of the risk from the repeated delays common in
construction contracts.

Westok, the group's cellular beam maker, is 'going like a train' the
company says. Wescol invented the cellular beam - a steel beam with
holes that offers increased strength without increased weight. For now
Westok remains a relatively small part of the business, 8 per cent of
turnover, but the cellular beam is growing in popularity with engineers
and architects.

Marbank, the last bit of the group, is a niche contractor specialising
in work worth about pounds 500,000. It is doing well, against the
contracting trend in the UK, but is not a key part of the group.

Wescol had a gruelling time in the early 1990s. Its mistakes on bad
debts and rampaging gearing mean it has taken longer to recover than
Severfield-Reeve and the Yorkshire rival still tends to overshadow
Wescol's potential. But it has learnt its lesson and 1996 should be the
year Wescol proves its point. Buy the shares.

BETWEEN May 1993 and December 1995, Conrad Ritblat's net assets grew
from pounds 1m to pounds 34m. Chaired by property guru John Ritblat,
the company has in recent months paid Allied Domecq pounds 10.6m for
109 pubs that are let to Burtonwood Brewery, bought a portfolio of nine
properties from the Royal Bank of Scotland for pounds 9.9m and more
than doubled the size of its property consultancy operation with the
pounds 400,000 acquisition of rival Colliers Erdman Lewis (CEL).

Conrad Ritblat is a hybrid in the property sector in that its
activities include chartered surveying as well as property ownership
and rental. Not well understood, its shares fail to discount prospects
for rising profits in conjunction with asset growth.

Executive director Philip Lewis describes the CEL acquisition as a
'real coup'. Conrad Ritblat has managed CEL since a receiver was
appointed in October. Since then, it has downsized operations by
shedding staff and closing or rationalising regional offices. At a
budgeted pounds 12m, CEL's fee income will be sharply down in 1995. It
peaked at pounds 25m. But even at the reduced level, it will double the
turnover of Conrad Ritblat's estate agency business.

Having expanded this side of its operations, the company hopes to
funnel more business through it. It initiated both the Allied Domecq
and Royal Bank of Scotland deals and they were structured so that
Conrad Ritblat has been promised more of these companies' traditional
property consultancy work. As well as pounds 5.5m cash, Royal Bank of
Scotland received 16m Conrad Ritblat shares in exchange for its
properties. They were issued at 27.5p against a then market price of
23p. It will own 11.8 per cent of the enlarged equity.

Conrad Ritblat's existing properties in the City and West End are both
pretty much fully let. About 15,000 square feet of its premises at 9
Marylebone Lane are let to M&C Saatchi, the Saatchi brothers' new
advertising agency. It also owns properties in Glasgow and Leeds.

Ahead of February's interims, no forecasts were available for 1995-96.
In any event, the full impact of recent deals won't be felt until 1996-
97 when profits of between pounds 3m and pounds 4m are possible. Conrad
Ritblat looks a strong growth story; buy.

ELECTRONICS giant GEC's managing director Lord Weinstock, 72 in the
summer, is retiring this year, which should add some spice to the share
price. The shares will soar if a high-calibre recruit, preferably from
outside, is appointed to fill the void. GEC has some superb, if
underperforming assets. Its cash mountain, even after splashing out
pounds 800m on submarine builder VSEL last year, totals over pounds
1bn. Another pounds 1.3bn cash is in joint ventures. Some of this could
- and arguably should - be handed back to shareholders.

Trading-wise GEC is not in bad shape either. Its order book stands at a
record pounds 13.7bn while profits are expected to lift off a six-year
plateau this year. Marconi, its defence and aerospace electronics arm,
is going into the production phase on a number of key projects. Cost
overrun problems of the past seem to be resolved. Recovery prospects
from aerospace look good. Defence faces the challenge of slimmer
government budgets. But a major joint venture followed by restructuring
could bring beneficial effects. Its telecommunications and power
systems arms are already within joint ventures. Review of GEC's fourth
leg - a mixed bag of industrial operations - is long overdue.

The appointment of a worthy successor to Lord Weinstock could make a
big difference to sentiment. Buy ahead of the announcement.

Cairn's share price this year will be made or broken by what happens in
bangladesh. cairn has 100 per cent interests in two potentially
enormous gas fields there. drilling started in december and if the
results are good, industry analysts estimate the upside in cairn's
asset value at 100p per share plus.

Cairn's recent record suggests it has a better-than-even chance of
unlocking that potential. Since 1992 the company has transformed
itself, helped by its US subsidiary, CEUSA, hitting a massive gas field
in the Gulf of Mexico. CEUSA has since been sold for about pounds 32m
and the money used to build a portfolio of cash-generating assets in
the UK and Netherlands. These will fund the development in Bangladesh,
and other blue sky prospects in Thailand, Vietnam and China.

Ignoring anything that may happen in Bangladesh, house broker Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull estimates that Cairn's net assets are worth
95p per share anyway. Results of the first Bangladeshi well, offshore
on Block 16, are expected at the end of this month. The most optimistic
brokers' estimates suggest there is 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas in
both of Cairn's prospects. That could be worth up to pounds 160m or
pounds 2 per share to Cairn. Therefore there is the potential that
realisable net assets of almost pounds 3 will play a share price of
115p. By any criteria of buying assets for less than their face value,
that makes for an attractive prospect.

Admittedly the risks are big, too. Cairn has first to find the gas and
establish that it's feasible to extract it economically; then it must
negotiate a deal to build a power station to burn it and agree terms
with the government. But if the drilling news is good, the share price
will reflect the possibilities well in advance. The shares are a gamble
but also a buy.

PILKINGTON has been transformed from a sleepy family-run business prone
to strategic blunders to a fast-growing global glass maker. It has
untangled itself from its disastrous foray into contact lenses,
stripped out pounds 200m of overheads and expanded into developing
markets.

In the short term, recovery in the mature European and US glass markets
will power profits. Volumes should rise by 3 per cent next year and
prices have begun to harden. With its cost-cutting programme in full
swing, margins could increase from 8 per cent to 10 per cent over the
next two years.

Acquisitions will also fuel growth. The proceeds of a recent pounds
303m rights issue has been put to good use. Pilkington paid pounds 120m
to buy the remaining 50 per cent of Italian car glass manufacturer SIV.
The pounds 55m purchase of glass merchants Interpane also gives it a
foothold in the Swiss and Scandinavian markets.

Glass making remains a cyclical business and demand will peak by 1998.
But Pilkington's rapid expansion abroad leaves it well placed to ride
out any downturn. Developing countries currently account for a third of
profits, but earnings should rocket over the next few years. South
America is the fastest-growing market in the world and Pilks is already
the leading glass maker in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. There is also
huge potential in China and to build on its presence in Eastern Europe
from its stronghold in Poland.

Pilkington's resurgence is being helped by a range of new high-margin
products. Sales of insulating K-glass have soared and EZ-Kool, which
reflects infra-red rays, has proved popular with motor manufacturers.
Stockbroker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull forecasts that recovery
will push Pilkington's profits to pounds 310m in 1997, meaning that the
shares are only 10 times that year's expected earnings. Buy.

ABACUS is making all the right moves in the booming electronic
components market. Demand for non-computer electronics should increase
by at least 12 per cent in 1996. Although this is a slight slowdown on
last year, with UK inflation at under 3 per cent electrocomponents
remains one of industry's fastest-growing markets.

On past performance, Abacus is odds-on to outstrip that growth. Over
the last few years the group has been steadily winning market share.
Abacus aims to forge links with customers via regional sales offices
which look after just a handful of accounts. Abacus is the only large
distributor that sources components from both franchised manufacturers -
 Abacus has 34, including household names Siemens, Toshiba and
Panasonic - and overseas. This gives it an enviable spread of products
and the flexibility to offer dedicated stocks and just-in-time
supplies. In a market where customers are cutting back their number of
suppliers, Abacus's focus on service is spot-on.

November's pounds 36m acquisition of Polar looks a good fit. The two
have only one franchised supplier and just 10 per cent of their top 300
customers in common. Polar brings another 26 franchised suppliers and
doubles the number of customers to over 4,000, establishing Abacus as
the UK's fifth-largest distributor. With scope to increase
productivity, Abacus is looking to push Polar's 7 per cent margins
closer to its own 12 per cent in the UK. And Polar's technical strength
in component design adds a new element to Abacus's portfolio.

With minimal borrowings, even after Polar, expansion in Europe is next.
Last year's Scandinavian acquisition, Promax, is performing excellently
and Abacus has just opened an office in the key German market.

The share rating does not reflect Abacus-cum-Polar's strong UK market
position nor the benefits of expansion abroad. Buy.

MARKET STRATEGY: NOT A TIME TO JUNK THE LESSONS OF HISTORY

At year-end 1994, with the FT-SE 100 limping along near 3000, most
forecasters were quite restrained in their expectations for the year
ahead. This was despite the fact that a number of historical trends,
some running for most of this century, flagged a rise to 3700
(accurately, as it turned out) over the next 12 months.

Many of the same long-term trends are now warning of possible
disappointment to UK equity investors in 1996. Here are three worth
watching.

The dividend yield of the FT-SE-A All-Share index currently stands
below 4 per cent. From a historical perspective, this is quite ominous.

Since the All-Share was initiated in 1962, the dividend yield has ended
the year below 4 per cent on just five occasions. On four of these
occasions, share prices fell in the following year. The usual pattern
was for the bottom to be reached in mid-year, followed by a mild
recovery.

The year-end 1971 signal was a short-lived exception. Prices rose by 17
per cent in the next few months, despite the historical experience. But
the April peak turned out to be the start of the UK's worst-ever bear
market. Although shares held on to some of these profits at yearend,
the down-trend continued for two more years, ultimately dropping prices
by a mind-numbing 69 per cent.

Another important signal is provided by the cyclical indicators,
published each month by the Central Statistical Office to help
interested organisations and individuals to monitor the state of the UK
economy. Although the indices were not designed for this purpose, they
make an excellent tool for forecasting stock market ebbs and flows.

Two cyclical indices worth monitoring are the Shorter Leading Index,
which flags turning points in the economy six months ahead of time, and
the Coincident Index, designed to rise and fall in lock step with
actual economic growth.

Since 1959, when the series was first published, a late-in-the-cycle
rise on the Shorter Leading Index above the preceding month's score and
a reading above average on the Coincident Index has consistently been
associated with bull market peaks.

The signal sometimes flashes very early, as much as one year in
advance, so we can only use it as a rough timing guide even though it
is a powerful bear market signal. At present the message from the
cyclical indicators is quite clear. This stock market upturn will end
no later than April 1996.

The third signal - the most important of all - is the length of time
this rally has run. After a sharp price drop in the first half of 1994,
prices bottomed out in June and have been rising ever since, six
quarters in a row.

No-one knows when this upturn will end, but continuous rises for more
than four quarters are very rare. There have been just 12 in the UK
this century. No recent upward move has run longer than seven quarters
in a row. Using history as a guide, the odds are very low that the
current upturn will continue for much longer.

What will happen once the upturn ends? Here, too, history provides a
valuable clue. After continuous quarterly upward moves run their
course, shares usually decline, often for just three to six months,
followed by a recovery that lifts prices back towards the starting
point. When the smoke clears, generally nine to 12 months after the
uptrend is first broken, prices are, at best, close to their starting
point.

Putting it all together, history suggests a disappointing 1996 with the
path to the year-end more like a roller-coaster ride than a stroll
along a sleepy country lane. When the smoke clears 12 months from now,
look for a FT-SE 100 at around the 3700 level.

In the US, 1996 is a presidential election year. Politically, then, it
is a time of great excitement and uncertainty. But the stock market
will take no notice of this, following the same old patterns that have
applied in the past.

Since 1928, there have been 12 presidential election years that were
preceded with a share price increase of at least 10 per cent the year
before. 1995 is number 13 in the series. Wall Street rose each and
every time in the election year that followed. The average election
year price increase was 16 per cent, suggesting a rise to near 6000 on
the Dow Jones by December 1996.

The Tokyo stock market has been in free fall since 1990. History
provides two precedents for a stock market decline of such magnitude
and duration: the 86 per cent smash on Wall Street in 1929-32 and the
69 per cent London fall in 1972-74. Both recoveries began with very
sharp price increases, 38 per cent in each of two successive months in
New York, and a 51 per cent single month rise in London.

Tokyo is not following the norm despite the fact that it is a much more
volatile stock market than London or New York. So far, the recovery
from its mid-year low has been comparatively mild (the Nikkei 225 is up
by 37 per cent from the early July low). This raises the suspicion that
the bottom may not yet been reached.

For 1996, there are two possible scenarios for Tokyo. The market will
either continue to drift up as it has done in the second half of 1995,
or drop sharply in a bloody finale to the bear market that has consumed
most of the 1990s.

If it does drop sharply, the recovery will be equally breathtaking.
Either way, I forecast that the Nikkei will rest near 22,000 at year-
end 1996.

MARKET STRATEGY: JAPAN - WAITING ON THE LOCALS

THE Japanese stock market ended the year with a flourish. After briefly
hitting the 20,000 level for the first time in 14 months, the Nikkei
225 index finally finished at 19,868.

Although this was less than 1 per cent higher than the previous
December's close, it nonetheless represented a remarkable 37 per cent
gain on the year's low of 14,485 recorded in early July, when fears of
a re-run of the panic which prevailed in the summer of 1992 were at
their height.

Key factors in the second half's optimism included a sustained fall in
the yen against the dollar, a continued decline in short- and long-term
interest rates, further recovery in corporate earnings, and yet greater
fiscal stimulation by the government (the recently published draft
budget for 1996-97 does, moreover, propose the sharpest rise in public
spending for five years).

To add icing to the cake, worries about a banking crisis have receded
because of the government's involvement in the rescue package for
stricken housing loan companies.

Despite increasing confidence that, this time, Japan's economic
recovery will prove to be for real, it is nonethless striking that
domestic institutions continue to remain firmly on the stock market
sidelines. In 1995, as in 1994, locals were heavy sellers of equities.
If the market's latest rally is not to fizzle out, domestic
institutions will soon need to pick up the buying baton from
foreigners.

MARKET STRATEGY: THE BURSTING OF THE ASIAN BUBBLE

Having lost pounds 800,000 on his holdings of Thai stocks, Vivat
Srisammacheep walked onto the floor of the Bangkok Stock Exchange in
November and shot himself in the chin. His consternation, if not his
aiming, was understandable. Usually, when US stocks rise, Thai stocks
rise by more. Not in 1995, however. That was the first year since 1980
that the Thai market had fallen while the US had risen.

As goes Thailand, so go south east Asian equities generally. Their
falls last year mean that they are now back to the lows of 1992-93 when
compared with US stocks.

So why did these markets become decoupled from the US? The principal
reason lies in the fears of 'overheating' that struck the region. Rapid
economic growth has caused rising inflation (although in Malaysia and
Thailand this has been held down by stiffer price controls) and huge
trade deficits. Ng Bok Eng of Morgan Grenfell foresees the Malaysian
deficit rising to 9.3 per cent of GDP, and the Thai gap rising to 7.5
per cent. These are huge numbers; when the UK had its last balance of
payments crisis in 1989, the deficit was a mere 4.3 per cent of GDP. To
curb this overheating, interest rates have risen.

In itself, this need not have had disastrous effects upon the markets.
After all, the trade deficits were largely the result of purchases of
capital goods by Japanese companies which had set up in the area, so
the borrowing from overseas would be expected to pay for itself in due
course. And anyway, Malaysian stocks rose in 1991, when interest rates
rose by more than they did this year, as did Indonesian stocks in 1990.

Unfortunately, after the collapse of the Mexican peso last December,
overseas investors became particularly jumpy about trade imbalances.
Hence they sold the Indonesian, Thai and Malaysian markets even though
their deficits were no worse this year than in 1990 or 1991.

Once this selling had depressed the markets, other problems exacerbated
the decline. In Thailand, private investors like the hapless Mr
Srisammacheep, who had bought with borrowed money, were forced to sell
stock to meet margin payments. In Indonesia, investors feared that
looming privatisations would depress prices - fears which were borne
out by the unsuccessful sell-off of Tambang Timah. And in Malaysia the
circulation of forged share certificates and the drop in the price of
palm oil hit stocks.

With these markets now at two- or three-year lows relative to the US,
isn't it time to buy? Maybe not. Most expect further rises in interest
rates, and warn that the huge trade gaps may weaken the currencies.
Equally worrying, if not more so, last year's decoupling from Wall
Street may not be a permanent structural change. It could be the result
of temporary factors, such as the aftermath of the Mexican crisis and
overheating in the region. If so, then these markets would be
vulnerable to any weakness on Wall Street. Traditionally, when it has
sneezed, Asian markets have caught colds; in the two months after the
1987 crash, when US stocks fell 20 per cent, the Thai and Malaysian
markets halved.

Nevertheless, some predict good returns later in 1996. Alan Butler-
Henderson at Barings believes that overheating problems will fade next
year as capital spending slows down (particularly in Malaysia) whilst
growth outside the region picks up. Once this happens, he says,
'markets in South East Asia should enjoy a much better year' and we
should 'be prepared for an impressive run' in Malaysian stocks in the
second half of 1996. By the spring, the region's markets may appear a
lot more attractive than Mr Srisammacheep.

MARKET STRATEGY: UK SECTORS - PLACE YOUR BETS

Polarisation was the name of the sector game in 1995. At one extreme
were the beneficiaries of the favoured themes of international growth,
interest-rate sensitivity, and corporate activity. Pharmaceuticals and
financials (life assurance, banks and to a lesser extent insurance)
found themselves dominating the sector league table because they could
satisfy not merely one, but two, of these thematic requirements.

At the other extreme were the victims of the dread 'cyclicality'. The
worst-performing sector, gas distribution, was admittedly an exception
to this rule and owed its dunce's cap to the specific problems of
British Gas. Elsewhere amongst the laggards, however, so-called
'cyclicals' such as paper, packaging and printing, textiles, building
materials and the catch-all diversified industrials proved unable to
resist the mounting pressure of profit downgrades stemming from the low-
growth, low-inflation environment.

In the middle ground, with performances grouped around the All-Share's
19 per cent rise over the 12 months, tended to be the more defensive
consumer/services areas.

According to Goldman Sachs, the expected weakness in the UK economy in
the first half of 1996 means that investors should continue to follow
the sectoral lead already given - in a similar low-growth situation -
by the US.

On Wall Street, sector outperformance has been determined by what
Goldman describes as the holy trinity of technology, financial services
and growth. On its reading of US equities, these should still determine
outperformance in the UK. Banks, insurances, growth stocks in media and
drugs, and the smaller tech stocks are consequently on their buying
list, together with bid stocks.

Cyclicals, especially those which are price 'takers' as opposed to
price determiners (chemicals, packaging, components) are forecast to
remain out of favour.

In contrast, BZW believes it is time to look for opportunities within
the cyclicals, rather than dwell on past disappointments, because GDP
and earnings growth should be recovering in 1996, especially during the
second half as consumer spending becomes the major driving force.

After juggling with the three elements of inventories and costs (which
determine the margin outlook), and geographic exposure (the likely
source of volume growth) BZW selects building materials, diversified
industrials, and electronics as its top three industrial picks. For
exposure to the domestic consumer theme, general retailers, leisure and
wines/spirits are identified, at the expense of more defensive areas of
spending such as food retailing, food manufacturing or brewing.

Although 'international growth', epitomised by media and
pharmaceuticals stocks, should not be ignored, says BZW, they could
take a temporary back seat in favour of cheaper growth alternatives.
The hitherto high-performing banks sector is viewed with concern, on
the grounds that the banks are vulnerable to rising real interest
rates.

MARKET STRATEGY: WALL STREET - ADDING VALUE?

Most US-market watchers agree that in 1996 there will be low inflation
and modest growth. But if the value of goods and services produced
grows only slowly, how can the value of the companies making them rise
quickly? There are several reasons, all of which have combined in the
1990s to send equity prices rising far above money GDP. The share of
output going to profits has risen, thanks to strong productivity growth
and low wage growth. Lower bond yields and greater economic stability
mean these higher profits are discounted less heavily. And recently,
merger activity has - it is hoped - raised the efficiency with which
growth is delivered.

But it is doubtful whether these forces can persist. Stephen S Roach at
Morgan Stanley warns that, with unemployment now low, 'the days of
asking labour to keep sacrificing appear to be largely over'. A 'worker
backlash' would either squeeze profits or raise inflation, and hence
bond yields. Mr Roach expects the latter. 'Everything good is just
about priced into the market,' he says. 'As inflation fails to conform
to consensus prognostications, the next big move in yields is back
towards 7 per cent.'

But Edward Kerschner at PaineWebber says corporate restructuring is far
from complete. A theme of 1996, he says, will be 'disaggregation', as
peripheral businesses are sold off. 'Such deals,' he says, 'are often a
win-win proposition for shareholders. Spun-off businesses tend to
outperform the market and many companies initiating disaggregation also
tend to be strong performers; recent examples include AT&T and ITT.'

Unfortunately, if Mr Kerschner is right, the winners will be specific
stocks, whilst if Mr Roach is right, the losers will be the entire
market. Investors' best hope lies in the low inflation, low interest
rate consensus proving correct - even if this destroys earnings growth.

ANALYSTS' VIEWS: UK STRATEGY - THEMES FOR '96

The accepted orthodoxies of the Christmas season can all too soon
become the Aunt Sallies of the new year, according to BZW. This is a
particular risk at present, given how hard the stock market is buying
the low-growth, low-interest-rate argument.

With very much a 12-month view in mind, BZW chooses instead to stress
the following themes.

First, the 'pause' interpretation of the economy seems most tenable.
Growth is expected to recover sharply in the second half of the year,
led by consumers. Growth of 2.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent is expected
in 1996 and 1997, respectively. On this reading, base rate rises late
this year are on the cards.

Admittedly, there will be limited political appetite to raise rates
with a general election looming. However, BZW sees no benefit for the
financial markets if politics is clearly seen to prevail over
economics. Short-term interest rates may not rise, but in such
circumstances long-term rates surely would.

Moreover, the risks on the currency increase as the election gets
nearer. BZW anticipates a sterling/dollar rate of dollars 1.44 in 1996,
but a rally in the pound to DM2.30 when the US dollar strengthens.

As far as gilts are concerned, stronger nominal GDP growth is rarely
the friend of the market. Ten-year yields are forecast to move back to
8.25 per cent.

BZW's view of growth signals that the current weight of profit
downgrades may not be long-lasting. However, equities could remain
driven more by interest rates than earnings, with cash-financed
takeover activity less of a positive factor. A dull 1996 is
anticipated, with 3750 as the year-end FT-SE 100 forecast. Preferred
sectors are building materials, electronics and general retailers.

ANALYSTS' VIEWS: GLOBAL STRATEGY - MORE DIFFICULT

For 1996, Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley thinks that the crucial asset
allocation is to be underweight in US equities, pondering the sale of
US bonds, and overweight in Asia.

Although 1996 is likely to be a less happy year than 1995, a
synchronised bear market is not anticipated. At this point cash is
unattractive because the indicators of the liquidity cycle continue to
be very favourable, central banks are easing and interest rates are
falling.

At the same time it is evident that economic growth in Europe, Japan
and North America is at best sluggish. In Europe, the sluggishness is
spreading from the D-Mark bloc to the weak-currency countries on
Europe's periphery. In Japan, the latest Tankan report was only
superficially encouraging. In the rest of Asia, high real interest
rates are slowing growth.

Meanwhile, inflation in the developed world is very low, and the loss
of pricing power is becoming a serious problem for many companies.
However, Mr Biggs doesn't buy the story that the world is on the brink
of a deflationary episode that would be bullish for high-grade bonds
but bearish for equities.

Sometime next year, probably in the second half, the big-locomotive
economies of the industrial world - the US, Japan, and Germany - will
begin to revive. This will be good news for politicians and working
people, but bad news for investors, who will begin worrying about a
pick-up in inflation and higher interest rates. The best guess is that
the recovery won't be sufficiently synchronised, and that while it may
cause a cyclical bear market in the US, there will only be a correction
in what will by then be bull markets in Japan, emerging Asia and the
other emerging markets.

The other risk is that the excess liquidity currently being created
causes a bubble in financial markets that pops at the first indication
of Fed tightening, as happened in late 1993. The mania over technology
stocks and the high degree of bond-buyer bullishness gives some basis
for this worry, as does the fact that valuations are filthy rich,
particularly in the US. Nonetheless, the individual bubbles can
probably be pricked without precipitating a global bear market.

As far as currencies are concerned, the dominant force will be yen
weakness, as the Bank of Japan prints paper and Japan's trade surplus
falls rapidly. The dollar will have an upward bias, as will many
countries in emerging Asia.

ANALYSTS' VIEWS: SPAIN - STILL TIME TO BUY

Despite its recent outperformance relative to Europe (ex UK), Spain
will continue to outperform well into the first quarter of 1996,
according to Merrill Lynch.

The key factors are a continued rally in the bond market, falling
interest rates and the prospect of political change. Spanish earnings
momentum has been remarkably stable yet the stock market is still
trading at a 15 per cent discount to its historical average prospective
PE ratio of 13. As a result, the potential upside clearly outweighs any
downside risk.

The Spanish-German bond yield differential has narrowed sharply over
the past three months, and should narrow further. Although part of the
improvement in Spanish bonds has come from external factors, such as
the continuing strength of US bonds and the recent cut in German
interest rates, the rest will come domestically from the improving
inflation outlook and a reduced political risk premium.

Perhaps the biggest change in 1996 will be on the political front,
where early general elections are expected to be called for the second
half of March. The most recent poll shows the Partido Popular (PP) has
built up a 16-point lead over the Socialists. Although it will probably
be a minority government, the big issue is what policy changes the PP
would actually make and how far they would go in resolving Spain's
inflation, unemployment and budget-deficit problems. In reality it is
still too early to make an informed judgment.

While Spain would obviously be affected by a collapse in the US bond
markets and renewed concerns over European monetary union - or rather,
the lack of budgetary discipline that convergence criteria currently
provide - short-term performance will be most sensitive to the current
test case in France.

Nevertheless Merrill believes the market will run up between now and
the election, followed by a period of profit-taking.

After that, it depends on the market's belief in the political change
argument. One thing is certain: it won't be right to be neutral over
the longer term.

Tokyo-based Ed Merner has not had an easy time. The trust raised pounds
119m in July 1994 and immediately invested half that money - the trust
was 'in a hurry to get the money in' with much going into an overweight
position in smaller companies and banks. This made a deleterious impact
on asset value. The trust has recently geared up via a pounds 20m loan,
much of which has been invested in consumer-related and smaller company
shares. The trust has never hedged its currency exposure.

This Henderson-managed trust turned in a 'disappointing performance'
last year. partly because smaller Japanese companies underperformed but
also because, on the assumption that Japan was on the verge of
recovery, it hedged the currency and increased its gearing. But those
two factors could boost performance this year provided smaller company
shares start to perform: at end-July more than 90 per cent of the fund
was invested in companies with a market value below pounds 710m.

move. The trust made a number of changes last year and benefited from
'almost frenzied corporate activity'. At end-September half the
portfolio was invested in FT-SE Mid 250 shares and the balance in
smaller companies.

INVESTMENT SOFTWARE: A PACKAGE FOR LAID-BACK INVESTORS

INVESTORS are a varied bunch. From the bustle of the day trader to the
comparative inactivity of the long-term buy- and-hold strategist. The
last two reviews have examined sub-pounds 250 software packages
suitable for the investor who falls in the middle of this range. Both
programs (Windows on Wall Street and Metastock for Windows) assume that
the investor has access to daily data and a bias towards technical
analysis. Pricetrack, by contrast, is a small DOS-based program more
suited to the less active investor. Although certainly not as
sophisticated or visually attractive as the other two programs, the
software includes some practical features and includes a data service
in the price.

Although the program will run under a DOS extension from Windows,
installation takes place from the DOS prompt. The manual does, however,
recommend running the memory optimisation utility included with later
versions of DOS (Memmaker) before attempting to run Pricetrack. This is
because the software uses a lot of expanded memory and will run like a
snail if it is not available. In virtually every case, running Memmaker
and following the instructions provided will ensure smooth operation.
Pricetrack does offer mouse support, so you don't have to learn an
irritating selection of multiple keyboard commands in order to operate
it.

The program is structured around a set of Lotus spreadsheets and has
three main modules: the weekly share price system that allows database
manipulation and graphing; a reports section that collates fundamental
data on equities; and portfolio management. The largest module is the
weekly share price system which has four main menu sections (general,
sort, update and gain) and a separate set of charting commands. The
general menu allows switching into other menus and covers basic default
settings. Users can select whether they want keyboard or mouse control.
Pricetrack displays 'setpoint markers' on graphs that show year-ends.
These are quite obtrusive and can be disabled if required.

The gain menu uses the spreadsheet base of the program to best
advantage and allows ranking of shares according to a number of
criteria. The entire database (some 580 equities and indices) can be
sorted in order of gains made in the last one, four or 52 weeks,
obviously handy when checking the consistency of an equity's
performance. For those looking to balance a portfolio, it is also
possible to rank the equities within their individual FT sectors over
the same periods as well. The individual sectors are listed first in
the spreadsheet followed by the shares in each sector in performance
ranking for the period.

As with most sorting functions on a computer, the speed of this
operation will depend on your processor - on a 486DX66 it was virtually
instantaneous. The sort menu provides similar functions to the gain
menu but for different criteria. The entire database can be placed in
descending order for market capitalisation or dividend yield over the
last one, four or 52 weeks. The database can also be set in sector
order following the usual financial times groupings.

The update menu processes the data supplied by Pricetrack Ltd and adds
it to the database. As the full database is large, users can extract a
selection of equities for monitoring. This extract function is carried
out by marking shares in the main database with a number. Users can use
codes to classify equities. For example, shares already owned could be
marked with '2', those under consideration for purchase with '4' and so
on. When extracted, shares in each category will then be grouped
together.

The reports database module supplies fundamental equity data (where
available) for both the current and previous year. Data includes last
dividend payments, net profit, earnings per share, total dividend,
turnover and net asset value. There is a sort facility available, but
it is only available for alphabetical listing or date of last company
report. It would be helpful if this facility could be extended to some
of the other data fields. As the database is large, a 'find' utility is
included which will search for an equity based on the first few letters
of the name. This is something of a godsend.

The portfolio valuation system allows multiple portfolio files to be
created that can be updated from the weekly system disk or a manually
updated extract file. For professional advisers handling a large number
of portfolios, a separate price file can be created from the weekly
system that will dramatically speed up valuation or printing. A total
portfolio valuation is displayed at the top of the worksheet, while
next to each equity is a figure for individual gain in both cash and
percentage terms since purchase. Entries can also be made for dealing
costs and cash on deposit.

The charting facilities of Pricetrack are fairly basic, with a low
resolution graphic display, but still perfectly comprehensible.
Investors with a technical bias are unlikely to get very excited. The
software offers a certain amount of flexibility to the investor keen on
comparing a number of equities for relative performance. Equities can
also be plotted against the FT-SE-A All-Share index, FT-SE 100 or any
relevant sector index.

For those accustomed to the more intuitive atmosphere of Windows-based
software, Pricetrack will take a while to get used to. Although there
are on-screen help files, a comprehensive manual would be an enormous
help as some of the program's features take quite a bit of finding. It
would also be good if basic functions such as Quit could be assigned
the same F key in all modules. The cost of Pricetrack ranges from
pounds 40 per annum for 12 monthly updates to pounds 150 for 50 weekly
ones. In all cases the data supplied is the Friday closing price.

Technical analysts and more active experienced investors will probably
want to look elsewhere, but for the beginner or someone who only uses
fundamental valuation techniques on a long-term basis, Pricetrack is
ideal.

Pricetrack is available from: Pricetrack Ltd, Bicknell Farm, Near

POPULAR SHARES: BP GUSHES GOOD NEWS

British Petroleum is one of the great recovery stories of the past
three years. From dire straits in 1992 as worries over debt and
strategy mounted, the company is now firmly established as the top
explorer among the Seven Sisters - the giant European and US integrated
oil companies. All of the brokers we consulted were impressed with BP's
progress: the basic difference between the bulls and the bears is how
much further the recovery process can go.

At 537p, Morgan Stanley is a strong buyer. The strong exploration and
production portfolio (in Colombia, west of Shetlands, Gulf of Mexico
and Vietnam), and possible earnings enhancement from a restructuring of
the refining operations and continued cost reductions, mean BP is
undervalued relative to its peers. Earnings should grow by 42 per cent
to 38.5p for 1995 with a jump in the dividend to 15p (10.5p). EPS of
40.1p and 43.4p are forecast for 1996 and 1997. The chances of a
special dividend are good as cash flow improves, and the broker expects
the share price to go up to 580p.

ABN-Amro Hoare Govett is another buyer. It reckons the shares are cheap
compared with the sector as a whole. Finds like the recently announced
Algerian gas deposits also reinforce the company's position in other
markets.

Natwest Securities is also keen. It's more optimistic than most on oil
prices and expects overcapacity in the refining market to sort itself
out. BP will lead the way in solving it with refinery closures in the
new year.

Kleinwort Benson is more cautious. It says the outlook on oil prices
and the chemicals cycle is not in the company's favour. The shares are
a hold.

Panmure Gordon expresses a similar view. The recovery story has nearly
worked its way through the system. If there is no additional news it
will be hard for the shares to outperform. Shell looks the better bet
as its cost-cutting programme is at a much earlier stage.

Charles Stanley is the only outright seller. It expects chemicals
earnings to be significantly lower this year and dividend growth to
slow after that.

Howden's spread of international businesses has been the key to its
success. Expansion into the developing markets of South Africa and the
Pacific Basin made up for problems in Germany and North America. Almost
two-thirds of its business comes from supplying fans to power-
generation and industrial markets. It found European demand going from
strength to strength and won two contracts to supply power stations in
China. Raw material price rises pushed its North American offshoot into
the red. Tunnelling profits were flat and German tunnelling equipment
maker Wirth is still struggling to break even with margins flattened by
competition and a demand downturn. But an order for offshore drills
from De Beers is good news.

Overall orders are healthy, at pounds 243 up 26 per cent on last year.
Howden's recent fall from the FT-SE Mid 250 index has wiped 25 per cent
off its share price over the last three months as index-tracking funds
have sold up. The slump in the price has left it looking good value
compared with its peers. Broker Bell Lawrie White forecasts full-year
profits rising to pounds 33m giving an inexpensive forward PE ratio of
eight. Good value.

Burndene's shares plummeted 5p on these dismal figures. Profits from
making caravans and operating caravan parks dipped to pounds 3.07m
(pounds 3.76m). Burndene is still reorganising BK Bluebird, the caravan
holiday homes manufacturer it bought last June. The benefits from this
won't show through for several months. Burndene's Willerby Caravan
operation managed to boost exports by 11 per cent, taking overseas
sales to 40 per cent of the total. Pretty Legs Hosiery did well in
spite of hot weather, although second-half profits were slightly lower.
Same-again profits of pounds 3.7m put the shares on a prospective PE
ratio of 13. With the support of a forward yield of 7 per cent the
shares are fairly priced.

Eurotherm has enjoyed 18 months of excellent trading following
recession. Capital investment in the process and paper industries has
returned. Continental European markets are better, and there's been
steady improvement in investment in the plastics industries, fuelling
Eurotherm's product sales. Turnover growth accelerated during the year
under review. First-half sales were up 11 per cent, second-half ones up
20 per cent. But there's been little impact yet from new products. A
new temperature controller was launched in September. More recently
there've been new devices for controlling electric motors and gauges
for use by packaging makers. More products are in the pipeline, the
result of pounds 8.6m (pounds 7.4m) spent on development last year.
That looks set to rise again this year. Eurotherm can well afford it.
It's been criticised for maintaining a large cash pile. But it's
answered this by pushing up its dividend. It's also added a US-based
drives business for pounds 4.4m. Profits are heading for pounds 40m
this year. The shares, on a forward PE ratio of 18, are up with events.

These are the last results from Polar, following an agreed pounds 36m
takeover by rival Abacus, creating the UK's fifth-largest concern in
the trade. The two have complementary products and little customer
overlap. Polar gets the chance to expand into Europe and lends strength
in component design, now generating over a third of sales. The group
has a lead in display components and microcontrollers. With Abacus at
270p, the offer of 159.6 Abacus shares for 100 Polar values Polar at
431p. The partial cash alternative - pounds 60.08 plus 135.66 Abacus
for 100 - is worth 427p. Accept the partial cash alternative.

Like rival Airtours, First Choice suffered in its main UK market,
largely because of the hot summer, which encouraged more people to
holiday at home. It also signalled a cut in capacity for next year,
which will mean the industry as a whole will shave the number of
packages by 15 per cent. That still means that almost 9m holidays will
be on offer.

The past 12 months perfectly examplify what happens when overcapacity
and a hot summer combine to hit First Choice's largest operation,
holidays in UK and Irish Republic. Despite turnover rising 4 per cent
to pounds 702m, profits dived from pounds 15m in 1994 to a loss of
pounds 12m.

First Choice's pounds 44m October rights issue to fund acquisitions,
which will help shift the balance away from summer to winter, will have
relatively little effect on the overall picture at the moment. Even its
market-leading Canadian tour operator, where profits more than doubled
to nearly pounds 8m, provides little in the way of comfort.

The problem is that the year revolves around a couple of months in
summer. If the company gets it right it has no need to shift an
inordinate number of holidays at cut price and margins look healthy. If
not, margins are slaughtered as it's forced to sell holidays at
unacceptable rates. Merrill Lynch expects 1995-96 profits to rebound to
pounds 22m, giving a forward PE ratio of 14. The shares are fairly
priced.

Months after flagging his intention to turn former marquee hirer Black
& Edgington into a pharmaceuticals company, chairman Ian Gowrie-Smith
has announced a massive share issue to fund its first major deal. Mr
Gowrie-Smith will inject Gibraltar-based drug development group Krypton
- majority-owned by his family's trust - into B&E, whose name will be
changed to SkyePharma. Krypton specialises in developing generic drugs,
and is working on anti-diabetic and heart treatments. With no trading
record, SkyePharma is transferring from the USM to Aim, where trading
should begin on 9 January.

The deal more than doubles B&E's ordinary equity to 1.1bn shares. The
group is funding the pounds 12m cost of Krypton by issuing 300m shares.
A one-for-four rights issue plus a 75m share placing at 4p will raise
pounds 9.3m. There are also 10 free warrants for every placing and
rights share. The group now has pounds 3.4m debt, but negative net
assets. After clearing the debt it'll have pounds 6m cash. Investors
also face a future share issue at 4p to raise a pounds 15m deferred
consideration for Krypton. B&E's shares were suspended in November when
it sold its marquee business. The latest loss reflects a pounds 3.8m
provision relating to the disposal and a pounds 5.9m operating loss on
continuing operations. Fairly priced.

The near-pounds 7m acquisition of Clan Asset Management, and of
Baronsmead for about pounds 3m in shares, helped increase funds under
management by pounds 340m. This and injections of investment capital
from two of I&S's institutions helped raise total funds under
management from pounds 3.1bn to pounds 3.7bn. After the pounds 700m
fall in funds in I&S's last full year it's heartening to see the
improved investment performance reflected in greater confidence from
existing clients. Coupled with cost-cutting, which reduced fees paid to
agents steering funds its way by pounds 1m, the gloom of the past year
is lifting. But the more stable base it seeks is another 12 months
away. And replacing lost clients is proving hard to do. Bell Lawrie
White expects full-year profits of pounds 6m, for a forward PE ratio of
18. High enough.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: HOBSON/HILLSDOWN - FOLLOW YOUR LEADER

Hillsdown Holdings' 31p per share cash offer should be enough for the
acquisitive conglomerate to snaffle up small food manufacturer Hobson.
The pounds 121m offer is recommended by Hobson's management. It seems
unlikely now that a third party will intervene.

The price looks fair, but not generous. And there must be a tinge of
disappointment amongst those who backed Hobson's audacious pounds 111m
acquisition of the Co-op's food distribution arm FE Barber in May 1994.

That deal was engineered by Hobson's (then) 28-year-old boss Andrew
Regan. FE Barber was worth five times more than Hobson at the time of
the deal and great things were expected from Mr Regan. Supporters say
he has done everything he promised. Three businesses have been sold,
others closed and overheads slashed. Brokers expect Hobson to make
profits of about pounds 17m in 1995 compared with Barber's pounds 10m
in 1993.

But rumoured deals with Geest and Albert Fisher never materialised. The
shares also remained stuck beneath the 27p price of the pounds 73m
rights issue that funded the Barber purchase.

Talks with Hillsdown apparently have been under way for some time. Mr
Regan's stake in Hobson is worth 'between pounds 2.5m and pounds 3m'.
His recommendation to jump ship now is probably a pretty good
indication that the really hard work still lies ahead. Follow his lead.
Accept.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: GUINNESS PEAT SELLS STOCKBROKER

Sir Ron Brierley's investment vehicle Guinness Peat has finally sold
Brown Shipley Stockbroking (BSS), one of the UK's largest private
stockbrokers. Birmingham-based stockbroker Albert E Sharp will pay
pounds 7.4m. BSS has 30,000 clients and pounds 2bn of funds under
management. It made pre-tax profits of pounds 532,000 in 1994. But a
slump in stock market volumes hit earnings in the first half of 1995.
Guinness Peat bought BSS for only pounds 5.6m two-and-a-half years ago
and since then has netted pounds 2.7m from the sale of its unit trust
and asset management businesses.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: FIRST HYDRO - FOURTH FORCE

There is a new force in UK electricity generation. US-based Mission
Energy is paying pounds 652.5m for First Hydro, the National Grid's
former pumped storage business. The bid beat others, including one from
Scottish Hydro-Electric. At the time of the National Grid flotation
last December First Hydro was valued at pounds 443m.

First Hydro operates two pumped storage stations in North Wales which
provide electricity in periods of peak demand. They pump water into a
reservoir at night and release it to generate power during the day. It
has 2,088MW of generating capacity and in the year to March 1995
profits rose from pounds 45.2m to pounds 74.7m.

Mission has the backing of its parent California-based SCECorp which is
worth nearly pounds 4bn. It already has investments in two gas-powered
generation stations in the UK and is one of four bidders in the running
for the 4,000MW generation capacity being sold by National Power. If it
is successful Mission will become the fourth-largest generator in the
UK and be a major competitor for National Power and PowerGen.

Regional electricity distributors will receive the cash in proportion
to their pre-flotation stakes in the National Grid. The windfall will
total pounds 680m.

NEW ISSUES: CLUBHAUS - WATCH THE BIRDIE

The chance of investing in golf clubs presents itself later this month.
Clubhaus, a golf club operator, is coming to the stock market via a
placing and open offer. Investors still have the chance to climb
aboard. They have until 26 January to buy shares in Ex-Lands, which is
demerging Clubhaus. In exchange for an existing Ex-Lands share, holders
will gain one new share in Ex-Lands plus one in Clubhaus. Dealings in
both new shares will start trading on 12 February.

Currently Ex-Lands' shares are changing hands at 20.5p, leaving some
scope for a first-day premium. Basic assets per share in Ex-Lands
according to the listing particulars is 26.8p.

Ex-Lands new shares should settle around 21.2p if its shares mirror
valuations of other property groups where the average discount to NAV
is around 20 per cent.

The new Clubhaus shares come virtually for free. Shareholders may wish
to top up holdings in this new company. A placing price around 7.5p is
expected. But doing so would inevitably expose investors to greater
risk. The placing should raise around pounds 5m. Even so Clubhaus will
still be nearly 90 per cent geared after taking account of Ex-Lands'
loans.

Clubhaus' golf clubs are mainly in Europe. Of its six clubs, three are
operational - Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart - but none were before
June 1994, so the trading record means little.

Former golf champion Jack Nicklaus designed the Hamburg and Brussels
courses. Golf is still in its infancy, relatively speaking, in Germany
and France.

Further expenditure of at least pounds 22.8m is planned, more than pro-
forma net assets post demerger. The other clubs, or clubs in waiting,
are at Vichy, Brussels and Duke's Dene near London.

Membership revenues come in large blocks, making it difficult to spot
any pattern of recurring fees. As such an investment in Clubhaus
remains speculative.

NEW ISSUES: FIRST MEDIA INVESTMENT TRUST - PLUGGING INTO MULTIMEDIA

Raphael Zorn Hemsley is launching an investment trust specialising in
the media sector. First Media Investment Trust will invest in both
listed and unlisted companies involved in the 'content' side of the
industry. This includes multimedia, computer games, TV broadcasters and
programme producers, music, radio and on-line services.

The trust intends to keep away from direct investment in hardware
makers, although its investments will, of course, use new hardware and
technology. Around 40 per cent of the fund will be invested in the US
with the rest being placed in the UK and Europe.

First Media plans to hold up to 30 per cent of its portfolio in
unlisted shares. The initial intention was to hold half of the assets
in unlisted investments but potential investors were happier with the
lower figure, at least for the time being. The trust will take stakes
of up to 49 per cent in these businesses which are likely to be based
in the UK or Europe. This is where it can really make its money by
getting in early in the life of a business. Much of the uplift in the
value of this kind of business can already have happened before the
shares are floated.

The key, of course, will be picking the right businesses and paying the
right price for a holding. John Scaife, who will be responsible for
identifying investments, has more than a decade of experience of media
investments in corporate finance roles and through his own media
consultancy. His experience should reduce the chances of the fund
making the wrong investment although the greater risk involved in
unlisted investment, especially start-ups and young companies, means
that not all investments will go as planned. First Media needs to make
sure that the successes outweigh any failures.

The aim is to raise up to pounds 100m via a placing at 100p per share -
there will be one warrant for every 10 shares. The minimum subscription
level is set at pounds 40m. The stock exchange has insisted that as the
investment manager, Raphael Zorn Hemsley cannot also be the trust's
sponsor. A sponsor is being sought and the placing should take place by
the end of January.

SMALLER COMPANIES: HARTONS' FLEXIBLE FRIEND

Hartons, the debt-laden Sheffield plastics distributor, has missed its
preference dividend for the last three years, is heavily exposed to the
building trade and, even after a refinancing, faces a long haul to
better trading. So why was its pounds 3m open offer over-subscribed?
The answer is that shareholders had the right to subscribe for all the
shares on offer. And Schuttersveld, the Dutch plastics group backing
Hartons' refinancing, did just that. But even after scaling back to
give other investors a chance, Schuttersveld ended up with 96 per cent
of the new shares. Suter, the industrial conglomerate which owns 30 per
cent of Hartons' preference shares and blocked Hartons' earlier attempt
at a refinancing, did not take up its rights. The result is that the
Dutch company, now with almost half the voting shares, has launched a
mandatory bid for Hartons at 8.5p for each ordinary share. It is
offering a measly 17.71p for each convertible preference share. That is
based on the existing conversion rights and makes no allowance for the
unpaid preference dividends. The offer document, still to go out, will
fill in the details. But even if ordinary shareholders grab their money
with thanks, preference shareholders will be slower to accept the bid.

SMALLER COMPANIES: ENNEMIX ON THE SLAB

Ennemix, the troubled Nottinghamshire aggregates group, is on the
shopping list of building materials giant Redland. The larger company
has bought a 29.99 per cent stake in Ennemix from venture capitalist
Nash Sells & Partners, one of the original shareholders, at 32p a
share. That is almost half the 63p placing price of September 1994 and
a third less than its 48p net asset value. Since flotation the company
has tripped up on acquisitions, seen former employees set up in
competition, faced an unfair dismissal claim from one of its senior
managers, and lost a key planning appeal. The growing dominance of the
big aggregates groups has also raised problems. But at the last count
Ennemix had about 14m tonnes of unconsented reserves. It has told
shareholders to sit tight, although the share price recovery to 36p
from its 20p doldrums must be tempting. Redland has yet to confirm
whether it will bid.

SMALLER COMPANIES: DOMESTIC BLISS

Shareholders in Residential Property Trust lobbed the company's
advisers a chunky cash Christmas present. Over 40 per cent, or pounds

in its December placing and open offer will go to the professional
advisers. The lucky few include merchant bank Hill Samuel, stockbroker
Credit Lyonnais, auditor Arthur Andersen and lawyer Morgan Bruce. The
cash will help pay for the pounds 2.75m acquisition of property
management company PKL. Finance director Chris Eales says: 'The costs
were certainly at the high end and obviously were something we tried to
lessen as much as possible. But in effect this was a reversal and means
a relisting of the shares. We were relaunching the company.' The shares
are suspended at 105p until the deal is done.

SMALLER COMPANIES: ENVIROMED STALKED?

EN plc is tightening its grip on healthcare group Enviromed. Associated

its interest to an 18 per cent stake. Mr Zwanziger is believed to be
acting in concert with other former Enviromed directors. Enviromed
chairman Sir Geoffrey Allen has had discussions with EN though its
intentions are still not clear. Enviromed, which suffered a pre-tax
loss of pounds 4.9m in the six months ended March, last month sold a
big chunk of its Cambridge Veterinary Sciences (CVS) business for
pounds 510,000. CVS was acquired for pounds 1.1m a year ago. Enviromed
retains CVS's fluoroimmunoassay technology, whose acquisition was a
principal reason for the original deal. Enviromed managing director Tom
Murphy wants the company to focus on diagnostics businesses in specific
areas.

Lep has been in trouble since the early 1990s. It fell into loss in

plan left banks with 85 per cent of the company. But the remaining debt
still proved too much to handle.

base and recovery in trading. Given OIS's poor track record, it's
likely to have an uphill battle to convince investors not to accept the

SMALLER COMPANIES: WATER HALL - DISSENTING VOICES

EDWARD Weiss, chairman of quarry services group Water Hall, is fighting
for his job. Fellow director Raschid Abdullah has called an EGM for 25
January to remove Mr Weiss and replace him with Anthony Smith, formerly
with Wagon Industrial. Given the chairman has a casting vote, Mr
Abdullah and Mr Smith could then effectively take control of Water
Hall's four-man board.

Mr Abdullah has fallen out with Mr Weiss and Water Hall's other
directors about the future direction of the company. Whereas Mr Weiss
would prefer to see Water Hall stick with its existing businesses, as
was the intention at the time of a rescue refinancing a year ago, Mr
Abdullah wants to turn it into a cash shell ahead of a move into the
industrial or distribution sectors.

The contest is likely to be close. Including the interests of his
brothers Ahmed and Osman, the latter was previously the company's chief
executive, Mr Abdullah already has the support of shareholders owning
10.37 per cent of the company. Arab investors control about 45 per cent
of the shares though it's unclear how these investors will vote.
Another potential stumbling block is that Water Hall is supposed to
roll over its banking facilities in about a fortnight. Whether bankers
are prepared to continue their support following a board share-up isn't
known.

SMALLER COMPANIES: MIGHTY WEETABIX

Despite the pressures on supermarket shelf space from own-label
cereals, fed in part by fierce price competition among the multiples,
full-year figures from Weetabix were excellent. Pre-tax profits rose a
tenth to pounds 31.3m on sales up a similar amount at pounds 240m.
Weetabix also had to contend with high world wheat prices and with a
proliferation of new products in the market. Despite continuing high
levels of advertising spend to support its range of brands, net cash
rose by pounds 8.8m over the year. Alpen increased its sales nicely
thanks to the introduction of Alpen Nutty Crunch, while Frosted Chex
and Honey Nut Chex, launched in 1994, have both achieved good
distribution. Overall, Weetabix is clearly managing to balance the
tricky equation between selling its own brands and having to supply
supermarkets with own-label products. Weetabix Limited was awarded the
Gold Medal of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors for 1995, a
credit to the company but also a reflection of just how hard it has to
work to keep profits moving forward. The businesses in North America
performed strongly; the investment programme there has led to a
considerable improvement in the gross margin. Until Ofex started, the
shares were traded under 4.2(a). A year ago they were at pounds 18.60,
so have done better than the market. Weetabix may not be able to buck
the pressure the own-label trend is putting on its brands indefinitely.
At pounds 26.25, high enough.

'promoting it like mad'.

SMALLER COMPANIES: ONE-OFFS HIT NPC

Hot summer weather reduced demand for city-centre parking spaces
according to National Parking Corporation (NPC), the owner of National
Car Parks and Green Flag, the vehicle breakdown recoverer and repairer.
NPC is the largest company whose shares are traded on Ofex. The costs
of the increased borrowings taken on as a result of last year's 155p
special dividend also hit its figures for the 28 weeks to mid-October
1995. A change in accounting policy which means NPC now charges
depreciation on its buildings lopped another pounds 3.5m off profits.
Pre-tax profits slipped from pounds 27.4m to pounds 21m on turnover up
7 per cent to pounds 168m. Stripping out these costs, though, the
underlying performance of the businesses improved despite the summer
heatwave. Operating profits were 4 per cent higher than in the
corresponding period last year. England football team sponsor Green
Flag continues to rise. Recognition of the Green Flag name is growing
and the company intends to utilise this by launching new services under
this brand. NPC is a strong cash generator and this will enable it to
pay off the borrowings incurred to pay the special dividend. Following
the breakdown of buyout talks last year, NPC plans to obtain a full
listing in 1999. The shares are currently 465p valuing the company at
pounds 547m. About right.

JUST, the character licensing group traded on Ofex, expects 1996 to be
an exciting year. It hopes to announce some major deals and talks are
in progress with a number of big companies. At this stage, Just is coy
about releasing details.

About half of Just's sales are currently generated from its successful
In My Pocket range. It owns the rights to this range. Beginning with
Puppy In My Pocket in 1994, the concept has been extended to cover
Kitty, Pony and more recently Teddy In My Pocket figures. Over 60
million of these figures have been sold to British children, impressive
market penetration. Last month, it signed a new three-year deal with
toy maker Vivid Imaginations. Royalties from the deal could be worth
around pounds 2m. The In My Pocket range is also being expanded
internationally with distribution in 35 new territories this year. And
Just is considering the potential of an animation series.

In addition, Just acts on behalf of brand owners, licencing out rights
to third parties. Licences include BMG's The Wind in the Willows
Collection, Cadbury's parrot, Bertie Bassett and Jelly Babies. It also
handles corporate brand merchandising for Cadbury's, Raleigh and
Matchbox.

The next leg to Just's expansion could be funded by a mixture of debt
and equity. Alternatively it could consider joint ventures to ease its
shares of the financial burden. In 1995, it is likely to generate pre-
tax profits of about pounds 300,000 on turnover of pounds 2m, which
puts the shares on a PE ratio of less than 7.

Just is in the early stages of its development. The shares have
speculative appeal; good value.

ANALYSIS: POLYMASC'S MEDICAL SOAP OPERA

Polymasc Pharm'l - PEGylation technology developer

POLYMASC is a spin-off from London's Royal Free Hospital School of
Medicine. The medical school and the founding scientists, who own over
half the company, stand to become biotechnology millionaires if the
company's technologies, used to make it easier to treat conditions
ranging from kidney failure to cancer, reach their intended market.

The science boils down to a technique - called molecule altering
structural chemistry or MASC - for attaching a polymer, polyethylene
glycol (PEG), to some types of drug, specifically proteins, peptides
and liposomes. The PEG disguises the drugs from the body, allowing them
stay in the body longer. The result is happier patients because they
need lower doses and fewer injections.

The company argues that other types of PEGylation all have drawbacks.
So far the technique has watered down the benefit from the drug itself
or has needed a potentially toxic coupling agent to tie up the drug.
The gains from beating these problems and applying the result in
oncology, haematology, gene therapy and the treatment of genetic and
enzyme deficiencies make a compelling story.

But it will take time to develop. The first market will be in replacing
existing drugs with its own PEGylation technologies. Polymasc will not
disclose what it is developing, but it has three development contracts
under way. It does say that it has already applied its technologies to
two drugs - erythropoietin (Epo) and GM-CSF, used in treating anaemia
and white blood cell deficiency respectively.

Shares in Polymasc, placed at 100p, started trading at 127p just before
Christmas. Polymasc is using pounds 750,000 of the pounds 4.47m raised
in the placing to buy assets from the medical school. In theory,
Polymasc should have enough money to keep going until it hits breakeven
in 1997, but the risk remains that losses will continue for longer than
expected and the company will need to raise more money. One US company,
Enzon, already works in a similar field and Polymasc must show that its
technologies go one step further along. Even if all goes to plan, the
first products should only reach the market in 2001. But for investors
who understand the enormous risks of the biotechnology game and the
long wait for results, Polymasc is good value.

SMALLER COMPANIES: J&S STRENGTHENS

Abrasive machine tool designer and maker Jones & Shipman is building on
the recovery experienced in the second half of 1994-95. In the six
months ended September, it generated pre-tax profits of pounds 619,000
(pounds 897,000 loss) on sales up by nearly half to pounds 8.9m. J&S
generates more than three-fifths of sales overseas and reports strong
levels of business in North America, more than a quarter of group
sales, and France. But on a more cautious note, the company says there
has been a slowdown in the rate of growth in its order book in recent
months. That's hardly surprising given its strong rise over the last 12
months or so. And although November was a little disappointing,
December was J&S's best month in around seven years. House broker
Albert E Sharp is sticking with its full-year profits forecast of
pounds 1.3m. With the shares off the boil at 46p, the forward PE ratio
is 13 assuming a full tax charge. Good value.

SMALLER COMPANIES: TOTAL DISAPPOINTS

Life is proving difficult for software writer and supplier Total
Systems. In the six months ended September, it made a pounds 55,000
loss (pounds 7,000 profit). Sales rose 16 per cent to pounds 1.3m, a
smaller increase than Total would have liked. Another drag on profits
was investments Total has made in new software products. Just over a
third of sales go to the insurance market and chairman Terry Bourne
says Total has developed new software products in general insurance
systems that are 'state-of-the-art'. Even so, he complains of too much
resistance to change among information technology specialists. Total
hopes to return to the days when it was considered a high flyer. But
that won't happen in 1995-96 when it will be lucky to break even. At
21p, high enough.

There's been a bust-up at Quayle Munro after which co-founder Michael
Munro has left suddenly, leaving behind chief executive Ian Jones. The
company, though, has got steadily busier since March. That can be seen
in better second- half results for 1994-95 following a 10 per cent fall
in interim profits. Boosting this year's figures will be a gain on the
sale of shares in Parkside following its recent takeover by British
Polythene.

Tuskar's latest accounts are quiet about exploration projects in
eastern Europe as several discussions have come to nothing. So its
short-term turnover remains dependent on its near 1 per cent production
interest in BP's mature Buchan Field. But it should soon know the
results of Mobil's deep well being drilled on a North Sea gas prospect
off Yorkshire - there it has a 5 per cent interest.

Last year Rangers won its seventh consecutive Scottish Premier League
Championship with an unbeaten run from November to January. That
success, coupled with capacity crowds at most home games, gave a big
boost to turnover and made up for an early exit from European
competition. Profits also benefited from a fall in the net cost of
players' registrations. But four recent transfer deals, including Paul
Gascoigne, suggest a return to losses this year.

Transense's non-contact torque sensors aim to make it economical to put
power steering into small cars with engines below 1,600 cc. But short
term the motor industry has switched to the cheaper hybrid technology,
electrohydraulic power steering, which may speed up the use of
Transense's sensors in the production of volume cars. It's produced a
number of EHPS prototypes and road tests have been completed on a
Renault Clio.

Anglesey's new-look board is keen to reactivate mining on Parys

structure, as its main shareholder, a Bermudan company, owns 29 per

1.79m at end-March) - fees due to professional advisers come next.
Parys Mountain has been mined since Roman times and has significant

The jump in sales and increased house completions from 172 to 292 shows
how hard Bellwinch tried to increase profits in 1994-95. But weak
demand and margins squeezed by higher land costs and rising raw
material prices largely thwarted it and led to results much below early
1995 expectations. Bellwinch reports a poor first quarter this year.

In June software supplier DCS bought a larger private rival, Computing
Services for Industry, for pounds 8.2m in shares. That deal reduces the
company's 80 per cent reliance on motor industry customers and
increases market share for manufacturing and distribution software. On

Greenspan Sneezes, IPO's Catch Cold

Once again the Federal Reserve is proving it writes the script for Wall Street.
In a Thursday night speech to the American Enterprise Institute, Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan sent warnings that stock prices could be overvalued and the Feds
might take steps to cool the market off. The words weren't lost on anybody.
Money managers don't sell in the face of soaring stock prices, and all were
looking for a reason to run for the exits. The Fed Chairman has just given them
their excuse, sparking the fuse worldwide for investors to cash out and take
profits.

The choppy waters of the IPO market swam in a different undercurrent this past
week. What got priced were several small-cap issues underwritten by
little-known investment bank whose names are difficult to find in Wall Street's
directories. Not too surprising, given small underwriters' historically proven
ability to push small deals, the aftermarket performance was spectacular.

Such underwriters as Coburn & Meredith and Werbel-Roth led the way as Wall
Street's giants stepped to the sidelines. Nine IPOs were priced from Friday,
November 29 to Thursday, December 5, and seven were winners. There were no
losers and the two IPOs that were unchanged (see Launching Pad - page 2) were
underwritten by the well know and respected Oppenheimer & Co.

The biggest moonshot of the week came from the syndicate desks of Werbel-Roth
and co-manager Millennium Securities. On Tuesday, the underwriters offered
700,000 shares of Translation Group (NASDAQ:THEO), a deal that had been on the
IPO calendar for several weeks, at $6 a share and 1.3 million warrants at $0.20
a warrant. The first day's trading was curious. The stock opened at $7 and then
exploded to the day's high and closing price of $14, up 133%. The warrants
followed a similar path in opening at $1, then zooming to $7.25 before closing
at $6, up 2,900%. And the company? It is located in Pennsauken, N.J., and is
engaged in the translation of documents and software.

On December 5, Coburn & Meredith with its co-manager, Shamrock Partners, priced
1.0 million shares and warrants of Websecure (NASDAQ:WEBS and WEBSW,
respectively) at $8 a share and $0.20 a warrant. Both soared. The common stock
opened at $14.50 share, traded between a range of $15.25 and $12.50, and closed
at $14.75, up 84.4%. The warrants opened at $4, sold low at $3 and closed on
their high of $5.88, up 2,837.5%. The development-stage company, based in
Saugus, Mass., offers Internet access and support services for secure
commercial transactions.

In a not-too-shabby third place finish was the Advanced Aerodynamics &
Structures (NASDAQ:AASIU) offering of DH Blair. On Thursday, 6.0 million units
consisting of one common share, one class A warrant and one class B warrant
were priced at $5 a unit. The securities were traded three ways: as units, as
common stock and as warrants. The units opened at $7.75, sold to a high of
$9.50 and closed at $8.50, up a nifty 70%. The company, located in Long Beach,
Calif., is engaged in the design and manufacture of prop and jet aircraft.

Normally, when a hot IPO market become dominated by the small fries, it is a
sign of a top. However, the new issue market is not frothy. Despite the
record-setting volume figures this year, the IPO market is far from sizzling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average have soared over 25% this year to a November
top of 6,547 while the new issue market (see ranking charts page 13) squeaked
out a modest gain of 13.6% in the 12 months ending November 29.

Now that the Fed has spoken and profit taking hit the market, a new and
stronger securities market will emerge. It always has, and the Fed Chairman
doesn't want to go down in history as the father of another 1929-type stock
market crash that led to the Depression of the 1930s. The stock market is here
to stay, and so are IPOs.John E.Fitzgibbon,Jr.

Oakmont Flue Shut As Shapiro Delivers

Mary Shapiro, regulations president of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, began handing early Christmas presents last week.

Her first stop, Lake Success, N.Y., where she left bad brokerage firm Stratton
Oakmont a lump of coal and an expulsion from the securities industry.

Over the past seven years, Stratton Oakmont has been repeatedly disciplined,
fined, sued and reprimanded by securities regulators and customers.

Charges to the company have included excessive mark-ups on stock offerings,
illicit sales practices, fraud and business ethics abuses.

An unaudited accounting of the total amount of fines owed by the firm could
exceed $25 million, sources familiar with the situation said.

This latest action centers on allegations that the firm instituted essesively
large mark-ups in the securities of pink-sheeted Master Glazier's Karate
International, and charged buyers over and above standard transaction costs to
do trades.

Besides closing the firm's doors, at least for the holidays, the expulsion
specifically bars Stratton's president Daniel Porush and Steven Saunders, its
head trader, from any securities dealings.

Neither Porush or Saunders could be reached for comment at presstime.

The expulsion also affects the trading of two initial public offerings that the
firm managed to underwrite this year and the proposed launch of one other.

In January Stratton Oakmont, offered stock and warrants totaling $10.15 million
in proceeds for Paramount Financial (NASDAQ:PARA) at $3.50 per unit. At press
time the shares closed at $1 on a volume of 82. The warrants, trading
separately, closed at 7/32 on volume of 105. Paramount is a consumer and
business financial services firm.

In May, the firm offered stock and warrants totaling $6.5 million in proceeds
for n-Vision (NASDAQ:NVSN) at $5 per unit. At press time the stock closed at 1
5/16 and the warrants at 3/8.

n-Vision makes and markets proprietary virtual reality applications for a
variety of applications including medicine, simulation, and industrial design

Trading, such as it is, in these stocks will continue through clearing agent
J.B. Oxford., which has had no charges leveled against it

Another proposed issue has been filed with SEC but has been in a state of
perpetual postponement, which now is more unlikely than ever to be lifted.

In April, e-Net, an Internet service provider, filed for an IPO calculated to
generate $14 million in proceeds. Based in Gaithersburg, Md., e-Net executives
did not return telephone calls.

Inside sources at the NASD say that the move against Stratton Oakmont is

Shapiro's first significant crackdown on brokerage abuses since she took office
earlier this year. More are expected.

12-Month Rankings Have Bear Tracks

Bear, Stearns (NYSE:BSC) is hoping the underwriting of First Virtual Holdings
(Proposed NASDAQ:FVHI) this week performs as well as the 14 other deals the
firm has done over the 12 months ended November 30.

According to statistics from Securities Data Co., Bear, Stearns is the number
one manager of positive performing initial public offerings during the rolling
12-months began in December 1995.

During the period, Bear, Stearns brought a total of 14 IPOs to market. As of
the close on Nov. 29, they averaged a hefty 49.9% increase over their offer
prices. This compares impressively to the mediocre 16.91% average increase
notched by all IPOs priced in the time frame.

No doubt the success of several high profile issues, such as Planet Hollywood
(NASDAQ:PHII), Guangshen Railway (NYSE:GSH), Sabratek (NASDAQ:SBTK) and Suiza
Foods (NASDAQ:SWZA) helped lift Bear, Stearns from fifth place in the October
to October rankings ran last month to first place for the 12 months ended
November 30.

In New York, staffers at Planet Hollywood are still cordoning off the sidewalk
for tourists to gape at the  film industry's eatery/media memorabilia shop.

Offered at $18 ($2 above the high end of the filing range), PHII has closed as
high as $32.125 since its April IPO. The Class A shares posted a recent close
of $23.

Guangshen, China's in-country railroad, offered more than 11 million American
Depository Shares at $19 in May. The ADSs  hit an all-time high of $21.50, and
landed a recent close near offer price of $19.75. Not great, but tight and
consistent.

Sabratek, the electromedical equipment manufacturer, came to market in June at
$10. The IPO price was $1 below the original $11 to $13 filing range, and yet
investors snapped up the all 2.5 million shares and have booted the share price
as high as $16.75. A recent close lists the shares about $2 off that high but
still $4 above the offer price.

Suiza, the Puerto Rican milk products and fruit drinks producer, was offered at
$14 (smack dab in the middle of its filing range) posted a recent close of
$18.625. That isn't far from its all-time high of $19.25.

Price spreads among these issues may be tight compared to some other issues
offered this year, but, as one BSC staffer said, "they're tight but they're
right for the market."

Indeed, the IPO Managers Aftermarket chart shows on average, BSC has priced its
IPOs more than 3 1/2% below the stated filing range, only to have the shares
soar nearly 10% at the end of their first day of trading.

Unlike number three ranked Hambrecht & Quist (NYSE:HMQ), BSC has stayed away
from any industry-based underwriting niche.

Where Hambrecht has carved out a solid place among technology issues, BSC's
equity participations are an eclectic mix of transportation, food, and even
consumer financial services such as United Payors & United Providers
(NASDAQ:UPUP). Offered in July at $11, the shares have been as high as $15,
although a recent close of $12 has wiped out those gains.

The "one from column A and one from column B" approach is classic conservatism
for investors. It is also vintage Bear among deal makers on Wall Street.

BSC's, mix of industry sectors has allowed it to take advantage of the stars in
a range of niches.

As the IPO Industry Aftermarket chart shows, credit institutions have turned in
a surprising 73% increase over offer price.

BSC managed the underwriting of RAC Financial Group  (NASDAQ:RACF) in February
at $17. While the shares have dipped as low as $8.75, they have also been as
high as $30.75, with a recent close of $23.125.

Again, issues in this sector have been priced an average 4 1/2% below the
stated filing range, but closed the first day of trading up more than 14%.

For individual investors, the scenario where an issue comes to market cheaper
that expected and then spirals higher than could have been hoped for is better
than the converse.

Consider specialty investors of application  software products over the last 12
months.

With their sexy Internet intros and promises to make life on the PC easier and
more exciting, these issues come to market priced at a premium.

According to Securities Data, software applications that target home users have
been priced on a steep average of 15% higher than the stated filing range.

While there is heavy, almost too-good-to-be-true activity for about a month
after offer, these stock have settled at or below offer price and show no
tangible sign of returning  to former short-lived glory.

Volatility in this sector is not only a matter of broken promises. A quick and
informal pol of industry analysts reveals that a good story might get some
venture capitalists interested, but for long-term investors the company has to
have a product that has the potential to become an industry standard.

"As computer usage becomes more commonplace among individuals," said one
analyst. "Users are finding out that they do not have to have ever single new
software package that comes out, as soon as it comes out."

The same quick rise and quicker fall is true for software applications that
target business customers (see chart).

"These issues don't represent the games or a lot of the educational mark," said
one industry analyst. "They do represent a lot of the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
wannabe's who ultimately can't compete with the established leaders in
spreadsheet, word processing, etc. . Unfortunately, the market is a bit
gullible about what a company or product promises it can do." By Gracian Mack

* Many institutions have creative names for these accounts, i.e.,
statement savings, performance fund, liquid asset savings, and so on.
There often are "tiers" whereby a higher yield will be paid on
progressively higher balances.  Finally, it is important to point out
that these are federally insured bank offered accounts, and are not to
be confused with "money funds," which are broker issued mutual funds
and NOT federally insured.  The top money funds (taxable and tax free)
for the week can be found by selecting item 4 on RateGram's main menu.

SEC Proposes New Disclosures
About Derivatives

The SEC has proposed for comment amendments to require disclosure
of the accounting policies used for derivatives (Rel. Nos. 33-7250,
34-36643, IC-21625, December 28, 1995).  Comment also is sought on
proposed amendments to require qualitative and quantitative
disclosure outside the financial statements about the market risk
associated with derivatives.

The SEC conducted a review of about 500 registrants in 1994 and
1995 to assess disclosure practices with respect to market risk
sensitive instruments.  The disclosures reviewed in 1995 were more
informative than 1994, largely due to improved guidance by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the staff concluded.
However, three significant disclosure issues remain.   The release
addresses those issues.

The proposed amendments would require enhanced descriptions in the
footnotes to financial statements of accounting policies used for
derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity
instruments.  The materiality of such disclosure would be
determined by the fair values of the instruments at the end of each
reporting period and during each reporting period.

The SEC proposed a new Item 305 under Regulation S-K to require
disclosure outside the financial statements of qualitative and
quantitative information about derivatives and other financial
instruments.  In complying with the proposed amendments requiring
disclosure of quantitative information about market risk,
registrants could select from three alternatives.  One option is to
use a tabular presentation of expected future cash flow amounts and
related contract terms categorized by expected maturity dates.

A second option is to use a sensitivity analysis expressing the
possible loss in earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market
risk sensitive instruments from selected hypothetical changes in
market rates and prices.  The final option is to use value at risk
disclosures expressing the potential loss in earnings, fair values,
or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from market
movements over a selected period of time with a selected likelihood
of occurrence.

The proposed qualitative information about market risk would
include a narrative discussion of primary market risk exposures and
how they are managed.  Registrants are reminded to include
information about derivatives that directly or indirectly affect
reported items to the extent such information is material and
necessary to prevent the disclosure about a reported item from
being misleading.

The SEC reported its intention that forward looking disclosures
under new Item 305 and Item 9A of Form 20-F be subject to an
appropriate safe harbor.  The staff is considering how to craft an
appropriate safe harbor in light of the recently passed Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act.  The Act amends the 1933 and 1934
Acts to include a safe harbor for forward looking information.  The
SEC will issue a release in the near future to propose that dis-
closures to be required by Items 305 and 9A be made subject to safe
harbor provisions.

The SEC noted that it recognizes the evolving nature of market risk
sensitive instruments and will continue to monitor disclosure
related issues.  If the proposals are adopted, the SEC expects to
reconsider the effectiveness of the rules and the need for
additional proposals in about five years.  The comment period for
the proposed amendments is 120 days.

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS

JAMES MCCURRY, FORMER COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND OPERATIONS MANAGER
OF BIEDENHARN INVESTMENT GROUP, INC., BARRED

On December 29 the Commission issued an Order Instituting
Proceedings, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
against James McCurry (McCurry), formerly the compliance officer
and operations manager of Biedenharn Investment Group, Inc.
(Biedenharn), a now defunct broker-dealer formerly registered
with the Commission.  McCurry consented to the entry of the
Order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings,
except the entry of a permanent injunction against him which was
admitted.

The Order makes findings that McCurry participated in the offer
and sale to investors of over $36 million of note securities
issued by Towers Credit Corporation and Towers Financial
Corporation (Towers) by means of a general public solicitation
through mailings of form letters, which made materially
misleading statements to investors concerning the relative
safety of an investment in Towers notes; the risks associated
with the investment; the ratings on the securities offered by
Towers; and the collateralization for and/or insurance for the
Towers obligations.  The Order makes further findings that
McCurry was permanently enjoined by consent in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (Shreveport
Division, SEC v. James McCurry and William E. Powdrill, III)
from violations of the securities registration and antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the
offer and sale of note securities offered and issued by Towers.
The Order bars McCurry from association with any broker, dealer,
investment adviser, investment company or municipal securities
dealer.  (Rel. 34-36654)

WILLIAM POWDRILL, FORMER REGISTERED SALES REPRESENTATIVE OF
BIEDENHARN INVESTMENT GROUP, INC., BARRED

registered with the Commission.  Powdrill consented to the entry
of the Order without admitting or denying the Commission's
findings, except the entry of a permanent injunction against him
which was admitted.

The Order makes findings that McCurry participated in the offer
and sale to investors of over $36 million of note securities

provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the
offer and sale of note securities offered and issued by Towers.
The Order bars Powdrill from association with any broker,
dealer, investment adviser, investment company or municipal
securities dealer.  (Rel. 34-36655)

The Commission announced the institution and settlement of
administrative proceedings pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Rules
of practice against Edward F. Duffy and Michael N. Karp.  Duffy
and Karp were previously named as defendants in SEC v. Anthony
Sarivola, et al., a civil injunctive action filed by the
Commission on October 31, 1995 in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York.  The Commission's complaint
alleged that Duffy and Karp participated in a fraudulent scheme
masterminded by Anthony Sarivola while they served as counsel
for and directors of certain companies controlled by Sarivola.
On November 17, 1995, the court permanently enjoined Duffy and
Karp, on consent, from future violations of certain antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws.

Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Duffy
consented to be permanently denied the privilege of appearing or
practicing before the Commission, and Karp consented to be
denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the
Commission with a right to apply to resume appearing or
practicing after two years.  (Rel. 34-36664)

FINAL JUDGMENT OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION ENTERED AGAINST JAMES
MCCURRY AND WILLIAM POWDRILL

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the entry
of Final Judgments of Permanent Injunction on December 19, 1995
in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana
against James McCurry (McCurry) and William E. Powdrill, III
(Powdrill) which permanently enjoined Powdrill and McCurry from
violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the
federal securities laws.  Based upon the defendants' inability
to pay, disgorgement and prejudgment interest was waived as to
Powdrill and civil penalties were not imposed against either
defendant.  McCurry and Powdrill consented to the entry of the
Final Judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in
the Commission's complaint.

The Commission alleged that McCurry and Powdrill violated the
antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal
securities laws.  According to the Commission's complaint, from
at least April 1988 until September 1992, McCurry and Powdrill
raised $12.8 million through the offer and sale of notes issued
by Towers Credit Corporation and Towers Financial Corporation
(Towers), of which $5.2 million subsequently defaulted.  The
Commission also alleged that McCurry and Powdrill misrepresented
the safety of the notes, which were speculative and subject to
numerous risks and that they falsely claimed that certain of the
notes were covered by insurance or were fully collateralized.

In a related action on February 8, 1993, the Commission filed a
civil action against Towers and certain of its principals
alleging antifraud and registration violations of the federal
securities laws.  See LR-13514.  [SEC v. James McCurry and
William E. Powdrill, III, USDC/WD, LA/Shreveport Div, Civil
Action No. CA-95-0552-S] (LR-14768)

DAVID SCHWARTZ SETTLES INSIDER TRADING CASE CONCERNING
SECURITIES OF DESOTO, INC.

The Commission announced today that the Honorable John G. Koeltl
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York signed a final judgment against defendant David P.
Schwartz permanently enjoining him from future violations of
Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
14e-3 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $3,063.83 in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and $14,833.00 as a civil
penalty under the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud
Enforcement Act of 1988.  The judgment was entered on December
14, 1995.  Defendant Schwartz consented to the entry of the
final judgment without admitting of denying the allegations in
the complaint.

In this action the Commission alleges that on November 9, 1989,
while in possession of material, nonpublic information relating
to the tender offer for DeSoto, Inc. announced later that day,
defendant Schwartz, at the time an employee of Morgan Stanley &
Co. Inc., tipped defendant Edward A. Cantor, who then purchased
35,000 shares of DeSoto, Inc. for a total cost of about
$1,443,750.  Defendant Cantor previously settled with the
Commission without admitting or denying the allegations.

Disgorgement and prejudgment interest paid by defendants Cantor
and Schwartz is being held by the Court for the benefit of
persons who submit valid claims within one year after the date
of entry of the final judgments.  The Commission intends to
petition the Court to appoint a special claims master to develop
a distribution plan.  The litigation is pending against
defendant Michael Levine.  For further information, see LR-14329
(November 9, 1994) and LR-14678 (October 4, 1995).  [SEC v.
Cantor, et al., 94 Civ. 8079,JGK, U.S.D.C. S.D.N.Y.  filed
November 8, 1994] (LR-14769)

Balancing The Deal

By Frederic Rubinstein, Kelley Drye & Warren, 
New York, NY; and Marc Morgenstern, 
Kahn Kleinman et al., Cleveland, OH
Business Law Today
November/December 1995, Pgs. 26-31

Overview:  Airs the unavoidable tension between the private placement issuer
and the investors it hopes to attract.  Highlights alternatives in structuring
private placements, which balance investors' risk/reward incentives and the
company's managerial concerns.

Choose financing vehicle.  The first issue a company must consider when
structuring a private placement is whether to sell debt or equity.  Proceeds
of an equity offering increase the company's net worth, thereby improving its
borrowing capacity and ov erall financial strength.  Although debt expands the
company's capital base, it does not increase the net worth and it must be
repaid.  Debt subordinated to the company's primary lending institution may be
viewed as equity by the lender (i.e., to satisfy the lender's
debt-to-equity-ratio requirements), but trade creditors may not share that
view.  While interest accruing on debt is booked as an expense, thereby
increasing liabilities and decreasing profit and net worth, accrued but unpaid
dividends on equity securities do not reduce income and have no impact on net
worth until paid.

Ascertain investors' goals.  To ensure liquidity for their investment,
investors in a private placement need an exit strategy.  As compensation for
the increased risk and longer holding periods of a private placement,
investors generally seek a high rate of return (an anticipated compounded
internal rate of 30 to 45 percent) as well as the ability to maximize their
probability of achieving a return of capital.  Therefore the investment is
often structured as preferred stock, convertible debt, or subordinated debt
with an equity feature.  To maintain control over their investment, private
placement investors often negotiate seats on or control of the company's board
of directors, limits on executive compensation, antidilution provisions, and
the ability to control certain transactions outside of the ordinary course of
business.

Consider the alternatives.  Before purchasing preferred stock, investors
should focus on the following negotiable features:  a liquidation preference;
a dividend preference, preferably cumulative; a conversion right into common
stock; a forced redemption feature; voting rights equal to the number of
common shares into which the preferred stock can convert; demand or piggyback
registration rights; a right of first refusal allowing pro rata participation
in any future offering; a "come-along" right to ensure the preferred investor
receives whatever the inside stockholders get for their shares; a "take-along"
that forces the inside shareholders to go along if the investor wants to sell
the entire company; and negative covenants restricting actions that diminish
the preferred stock's value without the investor's consent.

Compare rates of return.  The form of the security issued in a private
placement can have a dramatic effect on the investor's return, should the
company fall short of its stated performance goals or greatly exceed them.
For example, an investor purchasing $100,000 of common stock that represents
one-third of the company would receive $83,333 if the company were sold five
years later for $250,000 - a loss of $16,333.  On the other hand, an investor
purchasing 8 percent cumulative convertible preferred stock with a $100,000
liquidation preference, convertible into one-third of the company's common
stock, would receive $140,000 ($40,000 of accumulated dividends and the
$100,000 liquidation preference) if the company were sold five years later for
$250,000 - a gain of $40,000.

Going Public: Implications For The Question Of Minimizing 
Discrimination In The Residential Real Estate Industry

By Richard Bennett
Capcar Enterprises, Ltd., Bermuda
Real Estate Law Journal
Vol. 24, No. 2, Pgs. 122-145

Overview:  Describes several ways by which real estate developers can raise
equity.  Worries that the securities laws may not deter developers from
discriminating when making construction decisions.  Discouraging
discrimination.  If funding comes from a federally insured or funded
institution, such as a bank, developers cannot use it for discriminatory
purposes and the lender retains an interest in and control over the use of
funds.  Federal antidiscrimination laws do not, however, apply to funds raised
in the equity markets.  The shareholders, through the market, exercise control
by selling, which drives down the stock price.  Therefore, equity-funded
developers may feel pressured to focus on the bottom line and build only
higher-cost housing.  Although the SEC scrutinizes the financial disclosures
of a public company, it does not prohibit these discriminatory building
practices.

The MBS dilemma.  Real estate developers are increasingly accessing the
securities markets - through MBSs and REITs - rather than seeking traditional
bank loans to provide their working capital.  Mortgage-backed securities are
instruments that bundle mortgages together and create a security backed by the
cash flow from the mortgage payments.  A notable problem is the unevenness of
the cash flow.  Similar to bonds with a call feature, the underlying mortgages
may be (and often are) prepaid when interest rates fall, but investors cannot
ascertain the exact conditions that will prompt prepayment and cannot plan for
its occurrence.  Investors might value the MBS investment higher if they had
detailed disclosures about the underlying mortgages, including information
about the borrowers.  Unfortunately, the same information that would allow
them to calculate the probabilities of prepayment would also permit
discrimination against certain borrowers and certain neighborhoods.

With few strings attached.  Many developers use a real estate investment trust
to issue stock.  To qualify as a REIT, the trust cannot be closely held and
must attract at least 100 investors.  The REIT must derive its income from and
hold its assets only in defined areas, and it must pay a preset dividend.  A
typical REIT provides large amounts of cash to the developer, with few strings
attached.  The REIT's main advantage is that it is not subject to federal
income tax for the portion of its capital gains distributed to shareholders,
thus avoiding the double taxation of the corporate form.  The developer that
finances solely with debt runs a constant risk of financial difficulty; adding
REIT equity decreases the risk and may increase the developer's value.

Developers' decisionmaking.  Equity funding ideally would free a developer to
make decisions based purely on economics.  Theoretically the developer's ideal
portfolio contains a mixture of high, moderate, and low-income housing.
Affordable housing stock provides a steady stream of rental income, which will
look good on quarterly disclosure statements, ensures working capital, and
allows for the payment of regular dividends.  The fear is that developers
might not make decisions based purely on economic considerations, but rather
may shun low-income housing that does not increase profits for public
shareholders.  A statutory gap exists, one that allows developers to
discriminate when building residential housing.  The government should fill
this vacuum by extending the reach of the fair-housing laws to cover the gap
or adding new features to the securities laws.

How To Draft Financial Representations And Indemnity Provisions 
In Acquisition Agreements

By Leigh Walton
Bass Berry & Sims, Nashville, TN
ALI-ABA Course Materials Journal
Vol. 20, No. 2, Pgs. 39-48

Overview:  Outlines the representations of financial condition and the
indemnification clauses commonly used in acquisition agreements, including
draft model provisions prepared by an ABA committee.  Provides guidelines for
negotiating and drafting them.  Contrasts the arguments each side might use in
negotiations.  Basic representations.  The seller's representations about its
financial condition are critical elements in an acquisition agreement.
Representations are generally based on financial statements.  As early in the
process as possible, a buyer should review the audit report to see if the
seller's financial statements conform to GAAP.  Sellers are wise to represent
only that the financials "fairly present" the company's financial condition
"in accordance with GAAP" and not that they are "complete and correct."  A
seller's representation that interim financials conform to GAAP should include
proper qualifications, for example, that they are subject to "normal recurring
year-end adjustments."  In turn, the purchaser should require a further
representation that the effect of any qualifications will not "individually or
in the aggregate, be materially adverse."

Tailoring representations.  Sellers can resist or modify a buyer's requests
for additional financial representations.  A common request is a
representation that the target's records are complete, correct, and in
conformance with valid business practice.  The seller may respond that GAAP
financials alone are sufficient; however, if it does agree to give that
representation, it should add a materiality qualification.  Frequently buyers
request representations on specific line items in financial statements,
perhaps to avoid the seller's qualifications (such as materiality).  For
example, the buyer may seek assurance that the accounts receivable are
collectible.  The seller should object because doing so would constitute
giving a guarantee.  Other common line item representations involve inventory
and undisclosed liabilities.

Carving out indemnification.  Multiple sellers might agree on
joint-and-several liability, with or without an allocation agreement.
Alternatively, each seller's degree of liability could depend on its
proportionate share of the sale price, its role in the business (i.e., active
or passive), or the specific representation or covenant involved.  A seller
should indemnify beyond the representations' scope only on a known problem for
which a clean representation seems impossible.  Careful drafting can resolve
in advance any questions of whether tax benefits, insurance proceeds, and
found assets will offset losses.  Any clause setting an indemnification
deductible should indicate whether reaching it entitles the purchaser to every
dollar of loss or only every dollar over the deductible.  Parties should also
clarify how the clause intersects with materiality limitations in specific
representations.  A buyer should not consent to the seller's typical request
for an indemnification maximum equal to the purchase price unless it can carve
out appropriate exceptions (e.g., taxes and intentional conduct, such as
fraud).

Ancillary aspects of indemnity.  Sellers should not agree to indemnify against
breaches of representations and covenants from documents other than the
acquisition agreement and its schedules.  A buyer concerned about the seller's
creditworthiness could negotiate an escrow as a nonexclusive remedy, a letter
of credit, or a right of set-off against postclosing payments it owes the
seller.  An indemnification's time limit depends on the nature of the business
and the sufficiency of the financial statements provided, but the buyer should
demand at least enough time for one postclosing audit.  A seller should insist
that the indemnity is the exclusive means of asserting claims; in turn, the
buyer should demand that any exclusivity clause apply only to money damages.
Because this clause would not bar recourse under Rule 10b-5 (or other fraud
laws), a seller could counter the scienter element of a possible 10b-5 claim
by documenting the buyer's opportunity to perform due diligence.

An Argument For Invalidating Change Of Control Covenants

By Thomas Marko
University of Iowa College of Law
Journal of Corporation Law
Vol. 20, No. 3, Pgs. 475-496

Overview:  Analyzes change-of-control debt covenants, focusing on their
defensive use as a tactic to entrench current management.  Argues that these
covenants fail to satisfy the test for determining the validity of management
defensive tactics and therefore are illegal.

Protection or defense.  Courts traditionally refuse to recognize a fiduciary
relationship between management and bondholders and are generally unwilling to
find a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under
bond contracts.  Accordingly, bondholders often require bond instruments to
include a change-of-control covenant, which typically will give the bondholder
the right to put the bond back to the company or receive a higher interest
rate, should a designated takeover-related event occur.  The
change-of-con-trol covenant is usually triggered by a hostile attempt such as
a tender offer or successful proxy contest.  Because the triggers apply only
to transactions not approved by management and do not necessarily take into
account whether bond values will be adversely affected by the change of
control, these covenants are used most often by incumbent management as a
defensive entrenchment tool.

Unocal test applies.  The Delaware Supreme Court in Unocal Corp.  v.  Mesa
Petroleum Co.  established a two-pronged inquiry for determining the validity
of management defensive tactics:  1) the directors must have reasonable
grounds to believe that another entity's ownership would pose a danger to
corporate policy and effectiveness; and 2) the defensive measure is reasonable
in relation to the purported threat.  Although it has never been judicially
applied to determine the validity of change-of-control covenants in bond
instruments, the Unocal test seems the appropriate standard to apply.

Threatening corporate policy.  Delaware courts assessing management's
responses to hostile tender offers have recognized three potential threats to
corporate policy and effectiveness:  (i) opportunity loss (the tender offer
may deprive shareholders of the opportunity to select a better alternative);
(ii) structural coercion (the risk that fear of disparate treatment of
shareholders not accepting the tender offer may affect shareholders'
decisionmaking); and (iii) substantive coercion (the risk that shareholders
who disbelieve management's good-faith predictions about future value may be
led to accept the tender offer).  A change-of-control bond covenant triggered
by a hostile tender offer survives the first prong of the Unocal test.
However, only a proxy contest joined with a tender offer presents a legitimate
risk to shareholder interests.  Thus, a change-of-control bond covenant
triggered by a proxy contest alone would not survive the first Unocal prong.

Matching remedy to threat.  Even if a change-of-control covenant could survive
the first prong, the second prong requires that the covenant must be
reasonable in relation to the alleged threat.  By giving bondholders a put or
an increased interest rate, a change-of-control covenant benefits only the
bondholders and not the shareholders, who would be deprived of the opportunity
to choose between competing offers.  In proxy contests, dissidents would find
it much more difficult convincing shareholders to vote in their favor.  Thus,
a change-of-control bond covenant triggered by either a hostile tender offer
or a proxy contest fails the second prong of the Unocal test and should be
invalidated.

Dealing With State Securities Regulators

By Michael Missal, Stephen Topetzes, and Marc Bryant
Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, Washington, DC
Review of Securities & Commodities Regulation
Vol. 28, No. 20, Pgs. 203-213

Overview:  Explores recent trends in state securities law enforcement.
Explains the scope of state enforcement, focusing on actions against
securities professionals.  Contrasts state and federal powers and
investigative strategies, and suggests response tactics for targets.

State enforcement.  State securities regulators possess a wide panoply of
enforcement powers and remedies (including several not available to or used by
the SEC).  They often issue cease-and-desist orders in settling disputed
antifraud cases or other alleged registration infractions.  Most states permit
public (as well as discreet or secretive) investigation of securities
violations.  This public process can seriously injure a securities firm's
reputation, even absent any eventual finding of wrongdoing.  Because state
agencies have small staffs and frequent personnel turnover, they often resort
to processes that are informal, not fully documented, and not procedurally
safeguarded (compared with SEC investigations).

Collateral damage and coordinated enforcement.  State regulators often issue
stop orders revoking the effectiveness of registration statements they find
misleading or otherwise in violation of the registration or prospectus
requirements.  Given the cooperation between regulators in multiple states and
the nearly universal presence of "bad boy" provisions in blue sky laws,
sanctions in one state will generate sanctions in other states for a
multistate offering or one involving a regional or national securities firm.
Counsel for regulatory targets must therefore be sensitive to collateral
consequences when attempting to settle proceedings in the initial state and
are wise to maintain a more national viewpoint and strategy.

Strategize to prevent runaway liability.  When defending or settling state
enforcement actions, counsel should attempt as soon as possible to establish
cordial, cooperative relations with the regulators, who often serve
simultaneously as investigator, prosecutor, judge, and executioner.  During
the informal period, counsel should push to create ground rules for producing
documents and exchanging information, while keeping other states' regulators
at bay pending resolution of the initial action.  Losing in the "court of
public opinion" before succeeding with a legal defense can be a costly error.
The issuer should develop a broad-scale plan for making whatever corrective
action might be necessary in multiple states.  Because of the state agency's
high public profile, the regulators often demand that settlements include
restitution and administrative costs, fines, strengthening of internal
policies and procedures, further reporting, management changes, and other
supervisory requirements.

Current issues in state enforcement.  Many state securities administrators
have adopted a more aggressive posture in cases that combine a securities
firm's failure to disclose significant risks - notably of derivatives
investments - with allegations of its failure to make suitable recommendations
or to supervise.  State regulators demonstrate an increasing interest in
cooperative ventures with other states to attack regional or national
securities firms on matters at the cutting edge of securities liability,
without waiting for definitive SEC guidance.  In registration cases, the
states now often insist that issuers produce "stickered" prospectuses and add
special legends to sales literature to highlight, beyond SEC requirements, any
enhanced investment risks that the regulators perceive in the investment.

Regulation Of Canadian Capital Markets In The 1990s: The United States 
In The Driver's Seat

By Prof. Cally Jordan
McGill University Faculty of Law
Pacific Rim Law & Policy Journal
Vol. 4, No. 3, Pgs. 577-632

Overview:  Summarizes the Canadian system of securities regulation and
contrasts it with the US system.  Explores the development of US/Canadian
multijurisdictional regulation, and evaluates its impact on the Canadian
system.  Appends two detailed narratives summarizing Canada's regulatory
systems and enforcement provisions applicable to domestic and foreign issuers.

Subtle differences underlie.  Canadian securities regulation, constitutionally
relegated to provincial rather than federal control, resembles US federal
regulation, but it adds subtle adaptations and differs slightly in its
emphasis.  The legislation, especially in Ontario (the de facto
standard-setter), is drafted in a simpler, more modern style, while Canada's
regulatory structures have developed largely outside the formal statutory
provisions, on a more consensual, nearly ad hoc basis.  The extrastatutory
regulatory system in Ontario fell to a legal challenge in 1993, resulting in
the 1994 adoption of legislation authorizing SEC-type rulemaking.  A notable
contrast in the countries' emphasis appears in Canada's treatment of
registration exemptions:  unlike the subjective tests of investment intent
that SEC rules impose, Canada favors clear, bright-line rules.  For example,
no prospectus is required under the Ontario private placement rules for a
single purchase of securities worth over Cdn $150,000.

Multijurisdiction's disadvantages.  The 1991 implementation of the US/Canadian
Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) significantly impacted Canadian
securities regulation.  Under the MJDS, an issuer can rely on disclosure
documents filed in its home country to satisfy the other country's
requirements.  Canadians find the system more complex than they had hoped,
because the US did not ease its liability rules for the prospectus.  Thus, a
Canadian prospectus used in the US under the MJDS still looks very much like a
US prospectus.  The chief Canadian beneficiaries of the system so far have
been issuers of high-grade debt securities, whose primary disclosures consist
of third-party ratings.  The MJDS's greatest impact to date is seen in
Canada's harmonizing adoption of US practices such as shelf registration.

Ontario's aggressive recognition policy.  The Ontario Securities Commission
has forged new ground in applying MJDS principles on a unilateral basis.  In
its draft National Policy No.  53, the OSC has proposed permitting a
substantial foreign issuer of global offerings to use its domestic filings
from any country to comply with Ontario requirements.  The policy would have
permitted even exempt transactions such as Rule 144A offerings to use only
offering memoranda in Ontario, but under pressure the OSC has now retreated
from this policy extension.  The OSC also issued a ruling allowing limited use
of US and UK private offering memoranda in Ontario private offerings.  This
private placement ruling may pose a problem because of the common-law
mechanisms by which persons claim damages for misrepresentation, at least
until the Ontario legislature enacts a statutory remedy.

Editor's Note:  The full text as well as a summary analysis of the current
securities laws and regulations for Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec are

publication available from Bowne.  Updated quarterly, the Handbook also

The Duties And Liabilities Of Lead Managers In Syndicated Loans

By Gautam Bhattacharyya
Denton Hall, London, England
Company Lawyer
Vol. 16, No. 9, Pgs. 259-263

Overview:  Considers the common-law and statutory liabilities of loan
syndication managers in the UK.  Reviews recent cases on misleading
informational memoranda in the UK and elsewhere.  Addresses the use and
effectiveness of exculpatory clauses in underwriting agreements and
information memoranda.

Liability of syndication managers.  The lead lender in a syndicated commercial
loan usually undertakes the preparation of an informational memorandum to
solicit interest from other potential lenders.  This prospectus-like document
draws its content largely from the borrower, but by preparing it, the lead
manager can become liable for common-law negligence or deceit and, under
special statutory provisions in the UK, for any misrepresentations.  A person
ordinarily is liable only for negligent misrepresentations made to those in
contractual proximity; for example, in the UK, auditors are not liable to the
general public for misstatements in a company's financial statements.  Lead
managers, however, have the requisite proximity to the other members of the
loan syndication.  Their special relationship permits recovery for negligent
misrepresentations in the information memorandum on which the other members
relied.  Under the UK's Misrepresentations Act of 1967, a syndicate member
that made a loan based on an erroneous memorandum merely needs to allege a
misstatement; this shifts the burden of proof onto the lead manager, which
must then show the absence of negligence.

Harder cases:  deceit and fiduciary duty.  In contrast to proving common-law
negligence and statutory liability for contractual misrepresentations,
syndicate members would have a more difficult time proving a lead manager's
liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.  The plaintiff in a case of deceit
must show scienter or reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the
misstatement.  Despite occasional court dictum to the contrary, British and
other Commonwealth courts have declined to find a fiduciary relationship
between a lead manager and the syndicate members.  Courts tend to view
commercial banks in these transactions as sophisticated parties, acting at
arm's length, well able to protect themselves without the benefit of the
special relationships of trust imposed in the absence of particular
contractual clauses.

Exclusionary clauses to limit liabilities.  Lead managers commonly seek to
avoid negligence liability by disclaiming it in syndication agreements and in
the information memorandum itself.  Such clauses generally fail to protect
against liability for fraud.  Their effectiveness against liability for
negligence depends on their status under the Unfair Contract Terms Act of 1977
(the "UCTA").  The UCTA states that the disclaimer must be reasonable and the
affected party must receive advance notice of the liability disclaimer,
thereby raising doubt over the effectiveness of disclaimers that exist only in
the memorandum.

In a 1993 Australian Supreme Court case, NatWest Australia Bank Ltd.  v.
Tricontinental Corp.  Ltd., the court found such a clause ineffective where a
syndicate member had specifically inquired about certain borrower accounts and
had received specific assurances from the lead lender.  Other British cases
that refused to enforce liability disclaimers rest on the parties' unequal
bargaining power, suggesting that ordinary syndication situations will not run
afoul of the UCTA.  As an agent for the other lenders, the lead manager may
owe some duty of due care and skill when preparing the loan documentation, but
recent decisions have characterized the problem as "poor draftsmanship" and
too remote to permit recovery.

London Market Starts Up

By Derham O'Neill
Clifford Chance, London, England
National Law Journal
December 4, 1995, Pgs. C1-C4

Overview:  Describes the advent of a new, second-tier securities market in the
United Kingdom.  Compares its listing and reporting criteria to those of
earlier "unlisted" markets and the NASDAQ.  Analyzes the new market's
potential impact on issuers and investors.

Europe needs a NASDAQ.  Because other European efforts to emulate the success
of the US's floorless exchange - NASDAQ - have not succeeded.  the London
Stock Exchange is replacing its Unlisted Securities Market with the
Alternative Investment Market (AIM).  AIM is the first of several second-tier
markets planned for Europe; one in Paris and a Europe-wide market known as
EASDAQ are under development.  The objective of these markets is to create an
environment for newer, small-cap companies that offers regulatory and
disclosure standards adequate to reassure investors but not so complex or
expensive that issuers will forgo the benefits of public listing.  The
Exchange intends for AIM eventually to supplant not only the Unlisted
Securities Market but also the quasi-unregulated "Rule 4.2" market, although
currently the latter continues in existence.

Listing criteria favor new issues.  Since the AIM primarily wants to serve
newly public companies, its listing requirements do not cover trading history,
past public float, or minimum public share holdings.  This contrasts with the
major exchanges and even NASDAQ, whose "small-cap" listing requires $1 million
in publicly held shares.  To list on AIM, a company must have freely tradable
shares, publish financial statements in compliance with US, UK, or
International GAAP, and designate an exchange-approved "nominated advisor" and
a "nominated broker."  A nominated advisor verifies compliance with the entry
requirements, advises the issuer on the listing and reporting rules, and
confirms the issuer's internal due diligence program, but need not certify the
issuer's working capital.  A nominated broker (which must be an Exchange
member) is not a marketmaker but must use its best efforts to find trade
matches if no marketmaker exists.

Reporting and notification obligations.  AIM-listed companies must publish
prospectuses complying with the European Union's Public Offering Prospectus
Directive of 1989, but AIM does not review the prospectuses in advance of
publication.  AIM companies must disclose certain acquisitions and
related-party transactions, but at higher thresholds than regularly listed
companies must observe and without obtaining prior shareholder approval.
Because of the prevalence of newly public companies on AIM, directors and
employees must agree not to sell their shares for one year following admission
to listing.  The UK's new insider-trading regulations apply to AIM companies,
which must adopt codes of conduct that prohibit insider trading at least for
specified key periods during the year and must report transgressions to the
new exchange.

Prospects for success mixed.  The key investors in Europe remain institutions,
which historically have resisted illiquid investments.  It may turn out that
AIM's lack of capitalization threshold, compared to the relatively small
thresholds on more established markets, will raise resistance in these
investors.  AIM shows promise as a "nursery" for newly public companies, which
may later avail themselves of the LSE's upgrade privilege to list on the main
exchange after two years on AIM without having to issue new listing
particulars.  The development of additional second-tier markets in Europe
indicates that many securities professionals believe Europe is ready for a
NASDAQ-like opportunity for public trading of smaller and newer companies.

Editor's Note:  Bowne's International Securities Laws Handbook includes the
full text of the European Union's securities-related directives, the current
UK Financial Services Act and insider trading laws, other UK securities laws,
and a summary of UK securities regulations and listing rules.  In addition, it

Joint Ventures And Opportunity Doctrine Problems

By Stephen Glover
Fried Frank et al., Washington, DC
Insights: Corporate & Securities Law Advisor
Vol. 9, No. 11, Pgs. 9-17

Overview:  Speculates on how joint ventures will test the opportunity
doctrine's limits.  Discusses the factors that courts consider when evaluating
the doctrine.  Suggests ways that joint venturers can tackle the problem when
establishing an enterprise.

Testing the limits.  The corporate opportunity doctrine, an element of the
duty of loyalty, protects an enterprise from self-dealing by its fiduciaries.
The increasing use of joint venturing between well-established companies will
test the parameters of the doctrine.  Directors, officers, and significant
shareholders (or the partners in a partnership) cannot divert business
opportunities to themselves that "belong" to the company.  This doctrine can
create problems for venturers when their own businesses are closely related to
that of the joint venture.  For example, a telecommunications company and a
software company might form a joint venture to develop products for
interactive television.  The telecom company might want to use the technology
created by the joint venture in the telecom field generally, but the corporate
opportunity doctrine seems to bar it from doing so.  A similar problem arises
if an officer of the telecom company who sits on the joint venture's board
learns of an opportunity that could be exploited by either the company or the
joint venture; that person faces a conflict of fiduciary duties.

The doctrine's parameters.  Several courts have articulated tests for the
doctrine.  Delaware calls its analysis the "line of business" test.
Fiduciaries cannot pursue opportunities that fall within the corporation's
line of business and that the corporation financially could develop.
Regardless of how they describe the doctrine, most courts consider six factors
in deciding whether a fiduciary may pursue an opportunity:  1) whether the
opportunity falls within the company's present or planned line of business; 2)
whether the company values the opportunity; 3) if corporate assets developed
the opportunity; 4) if the fiduciaries learned of the opportunity while acting
in their corporate capacities; 5) whether the company possesses the financial
wherewithal to exploit the opportunity; and 6) if the parties had any
agreement, express or tacit, on using such opportunities.  Cases applying the
factors tend to be fact-specific and provide only limited guidance for others.
Courts have, however, followed one clear rule:  Fiduciaries may pursue
something when they disclose the opportunity to the company and it expressly
allows the fiduciary to proceed, or if the corporation knew of the fiduciary's
activities and did not take steps to halt them.

Tackle the problem in advance.  Companies forming joint ventures should
address opportunity conflicts at the outset.  Carefully define the business
that the joint venture will address.  Consider including a precise description
of the venture's purpose in its corporate charter (this will render ultra
vires any activities outside the prescribed purpose and thus will settle
conflicts by requiring a charter amendment before the venture can proceed).
As a corollary, participants might enter into covenants not to compete with
the joint venture in its prescribed business.  Identify and allocate, in
advance, specific opportunities that might arise.  Determine in advance what
use each participant can make of technology developed by the joint venture,
perhaps through licensing and royalty arrangements.  Design a consent
procedure to be followed when opportunity problems arise.  Clarify how
fiduciaries of both parent and venture will disclose opportunities, and
exculpate them for disclosures made in accordance with the procedure.

Partnerships and LLCs.  Partners owe a duty of loyalty to one another.  Courts
consider factors similar to those considered for the corporate setting, but
they give particular weight to the partnership document itself.  Because
partnerships are contractual in nature, partners have more latitude to
establish the boundaries of their duties to one another than the corporate
setting allows.  The opportunity doctrine also applies to limited liability
companies.  Because this structure is relatively new, the parameters of the
doctrine's application to LLCs have not been defined and almost no case law
exists.  LLC venturers are well-advised to proceed under the assumption that
LLC members owe one another a duty of loyalty, similar to that in the
corporate and partnership settings.

Catalog of Corporate and Securities Law Publications.  Call 800-370-8402 for a

LOMAR/ILFM Survey Offers Latest Data on Staff Pay

     Last month law firm staff probably received a welcome
surprise after their year-end salary reviews. With firms
seeing the first real economic gains since the start of the
decade at least according to most of the key industry
benchmarks it stands to reason that administrators and
managing partners were less apprehensive about approving
larger pay hikes for support staff in 1996.

     As LOMAR previously reported, salary increases for 1996
were generally expected to stand in the range of 4%, with
firms of fewer than 500 employees likely to award 4.24%, and
those with 500 to 1,499 granting raises of about 4.04%. But as
all law firm administrators and managing partners know, staff
salary increases don't always follow predictions. 

     Sharing the wealth. In 1995, for the most part,
compensation increases for law firm support staff exceeded,
and in many cases handsomely exceeded, cost-of-living hikes,
according to the just-released 1995 Law Office Management &
Administration Report (LOMAR)/Institute on Law Firm Management
(ILFM) Compensation and Hourly Billing Survey. Across the
board, support staff, secretaries, and word processors fared
better in the smaller firms than they did in the larger ones.
In fact, secretaries and word processors fared least well in
the largest (75-plus attorney) firms (see partial Table 1
below--complete version in printed newsletter only).

     LOMAR's analysis of the data relating to a number of key
law firm positions, including secretaries, word processors,
and other support staff, reveals some interesting trends which
are described below:

     Secretaries. In this category 1995 pay ranged from a low
of $19,000 to a high of $33,000, depending on firm size, years
of experience, and reporting duties.

     o Legal secretaries with less than three years'
experience were hit the hardest in all size firms, with three
sizes cutting their total compensation by as much as 17.4% and
others holding steady at 1994 pay levels.

     o Those with more than three years of experience fared
better, with three sizes of firms reporting increases (one by
as much as 20%) and the other two holding steady.

     o Across the board, secretaries who work for two
associates earned less than those shared by a partner and an
associate, but the dual-associate secretaries reported a
higher percentage pay increase than did any other category of
secretary.

     o Secretaries who report to partners were paid the most
in large firms ($33,000), but were ompensated at nearly the
same level ($32,000) by firms with only two to eight
attorneys.

     Word processors. Pay for this position ranged from a low
of $22,000 at firms with two to eight attorneys to a high of
$31,000 at firms with 75-plus lawyers. Firms that gave this
position the largest hikes in 1995 were those with nine to 20
lawyers (a 9.1% increase) and those with 41 to 74 attorneys
(6.1%).

     o Average salaries for word processors in the smallest
size firms, however, dropped substantially in 1995.

     Other support staff. LOMAR's analysis of a few of the
many positions reveals that accounting managers/controllers,
for the most part, failed even to keep up with cost-of-living
increases in 1995. The largest salary hike, given at firms
with 41 to 74 attorneys, was 6.3%. But other than that,
increases hovered around 1% to 2%. In the case of firms with
two to eight attorneys, the average salary dropped
substantially.

     o Pay hikes for switchboard operators/receptionists
ranged from 0% to 25% (the latter, once again, in firms with
41 to 74 attorneys). Pay levels for 1995 ranged from $18,000
in firms with two to eight attorneys to $25,000 in firms with
41 to 74 lawyers.


     o Personnel director pay scales hovered in the
$37,000-to-$40,000 area for smaller firms. However, those with
41 or more attorneys earned $48,000 to $60,000. The LOMAR/ILFM
survey did no year-to-year comparisons on this title, computer
positions, and several others because the sample size was not
large enough (see Table 2 for positions with counts of less
than 75--table available in print version only). Therefore, no
percentage differences are listed on Table 1. 

     Nonetheless, the size of the salary paid to those in the
personnel administrator position does reveal that more law
firms are recognizing the importance of this position for both
controlling costs and keeping the firm in compliance with this
increasingly complex area of administration.

     o As for automation personnel, in firms large enough to
support a local area network (LAN) coordinator, pay ranged
from $39,000 to $47,000.

     In-house computer trainers were paid less than
receptionists at the smaller firms, reflecting the fact that
many of these posts now work part-time. Firms reported MIS
director pay scales from $30,000 to $65,000, with levels
largely tied to firm size.

     Regional variations. The Pacific and South Atlantic
regions generally paid their secretaries the most. Pacific
firms took top honors except for secretaries who are shared by
two associates and those who serve a partner/associate/legal
assistant team. In those instances, firms in the South
Atlantic states paid the most.

     Billing coordinators fared best in the Middle Atlantic
states, where firms paid$34,000. This contrasts sharply with
the Central and Plains states where they were more commonly
paid $22,000.

Could This Be It: A Partner Compensation Plan That Really
Works? 

     Few issues in today's law firm can spark as much raw 
emotion or portend real damage to the spirit of the
organization as partner compensation. While a few firms may
have managed to devise systems that equitably reward all
partners, most are still struggling to strike that delicate
balance.

     The Cyber Chapter members who took part in a recent
Association of Legal Administrators' online forum via
CompuServe seemed all too aware of the many subtle pitfalls
associated with partner compensation. "Rewarding fee
generation alone tends to be divisive, works contrary to
collegiality, and doesn't properly reflect the contributions
that are essential to the continuation and growth of the
firm," one participant asserted.

     True, indeed. Just ask anyone who's followed the accounts
leading up to the demise of Mudge Rose, which just months ago
voted to dissolve after 126 years of existence. Surely most
observers were surprised--to say the least--when The Wall
Street Journal reported that the firm's demise was
precipitated, in part, by an inability to reach consensus on
whether to retain "unproductive" partners and how best to
compensate "productive" members of the firm. 

     If Mudge Rose--which up until last year had earned enough
in gross revenues to regularly assume a spot on The American
Lawyer's annual ranking of the nation's richest firms--
couldn't hold it together, what does it mean to others coping
with similar issues relating to partner compensation?  

     "Giving and awarding credit for attorney origination is
not as easy as you would think," another administrator noted
online. "It is clear that when you bring in a client you
should get some credit for the origination, but how about the
additional tasks from that client that are created by the good
work of another attorney?" 

     The same administrator continued: "Also, when you bring
in a transactional client who has lots of small files, how
long does the originating attorney receive credit for the
ongoing shipment of small files, how do you factor credits....
Does an attorney whose major role is origination [need] a
different compensation plan? If you have advice, I'd love to
see it." 

     Exploring alternatives. Administrators and managing
partners are fully cognizant that no generic compensation
system is perfect for every law firm. Partners will always
perceive inequities and partner compensation schemes are, for
the most part, driven by intangibles, like firm culture and
personality. But, since some system is obviously necessary,
examining the so-called model plans is a logical first step. 

     Outlined below is part of a compensation plan devised by
John Iezzi, consultant and president of Richmond, Va.'s Iezzi
Management Group and a LOMAR contributor. While the sampling
embodies the basics of Iezzi's plan, readers can receive a
free copy of the complete Compensation Plan for Owners of
Professional Service Firms and all applicable exhibits by
contacting the IOMA Fax Retrieval System at 212-244-0360 #250.
Request Document #2 and it will be faxed to you immediately.
Questions and comments on the specifics of the plan should be
directed to John Iezzi at P.O. Box 1711, Richmond, VA 23214-
1711; 804-342-1206; Fax: 804-342-1209.

     Iezzi's compensation plan is based on both objective and
subjective criteria. In addition to rewarding individual
achievements based on attorney productivity and business
development, the plan also takes into account the activities
and contributions that a partner makes to the good of the firm
which may not be so easily quantifiable.

     Since firm data can change regularly, it is suggested
that once the plan is in effect, the information used in the
formula should be based on a three-year moving average. Thus,
until the three-year period can be determined, certain
adjustments may have to be made to account for significant
events which occur during the year being reviewed. Adjustments
will also need to be made for those owners who do not have a
three-year history of activity on which to draw. 

     At the end of a 12-month period, (not necessarily
corresponding to the firm's accounting year), information
would be generated on the total amount of working attorney and
originating attorney credits assignable to each partner. 

     Iezzi's plan is based on three major criteria:

     1. Working attorney credits. These are receipts (not
billable hours or billings) from work performed by the
individual partner. Working attorney points would be created
by determining the percentage that each partner's working
attorney credits bore to the working attorney credits of all
the other partners. Using an example of a firm with $2 million
in revenues, $933,500 came from the five partners. Partner A
had $210,000 of the total, so received 22.5 compensation
points.

     2. Originating attorney credits. These are receipts
(again not billable hours or billings) from work performed on
all files that can be identified as having been originated by
a particular partner. Figuring originating attorney points,
again using the example of the $2 million firm: $1.9 million
could be identified as having been originated by the current
group of five partners. In this case, Partner A was credited
for $496,000 of the total, or 26.1 compensation points.

     ln the above two situations, the points can be "weighted"
based on the value that the firm perceives is attributable to
these factors. In this case, both the working credits and the
originating credits have been given a factor of 1.0. There is
no magic to this; they can be whatever the firm's partners
decide. Thus, under this scenario, Partner A received 26.1
originating attorney points.

     3. Subjective criteria. This last group of factors is
developed to reward a partner's contributions to the firm
outside of the objective data. Elements to be considered
include firm management, associate training/mentoring,
cooperativeness with staff and firm procedures, bar
activities, community/civic activities, speaking and
publishing, financial management effectiveness (i.e., billings
management), and technical skills. 

     Each partner submits a self-evaluation report which is
reviewed by all the other partners or the compensation
committee. The partners or the committee then grade their
other partners on these criteria, based on a 100-point total.

     The criteria are individually weighted. The averages of
the ratings are then used to determine the points attributable
to this category. In the event the firm finds it difficult to
allocate the 100 points to each partner for the subjective
criteria, it could instead assign a value which could then be
easily translated into a percentage.

     These values would then be weighted, totaled, and a
percentage developed to establish the subjective element of
the compensation plan, along with the working-attorney and
originating-attorney components. The total points, after
application of the weighting factors, are then determined.
     Special considerations. There are certain problems that
occur with this type of system (all of which are also
described in the full report). While none is insurmountable,
each does need to be considered. 

     For instance, at some point, particularly for the larger,
general practice firms, this type of plan may be inapplicable-
-specifically as it relates to the issue of origination
credits. Larger firms owe many of their new clients not to any
person but to the firm as an institution which has built a
reputation that attracts clients. In addition, marketing
programs have changed to the point where teams rather than
individuals are often responsible for obtaining new clients. 

     But no compensation plan is perfect nor can any respond
to the totality of the compensation requirements in a firm.
Iezzi's plan has been designed to recognize as many of the
issues as possible, with the understanding that certain
modifications will need to be made before the final
percentages can be developed.

Nine More Ways to Reduce Firm Costs in the New Year

     Law firm administrators and managing partners are
constantly looking for new cost-control ideas, or at least
ways to continue improving existing programs in the coming
year. Here are nine cost-control areas in which firms tell
LOMAR they've had success:

     1. Temporary staff. To get temps up and running as
quickly as possible, one firm has developed a brief "Temporary
Employee's Procedure Manual." It includes a simple office
layout, showing whose office is where; a brief style manual
for letters and other simple documents; details about how the
firm wants the phone answered; where supplies are located; the
firm's break policy; and several things that the firm does not
want the temp to do.

     2. Health care costs. All firms have taken steps to
control these expenses in recent years. But it's interesting
to note that a survey of human resource executives by Ernst &
Young ranked the popularity of cost-cutting options as
follows: First, increasing employee contributions (26%);
second, introducing a PPO (preferred provider organization)
arrangement (17%); three options tied for third--adding a
flexible benefits program, changing the insurance
carrier/administrator, and introducing POS (point-of-service)
arrangements (9% each); sixth, adding an HMO (7%); and
seventh, reducing benefits coverage (6%).

     3. Faxes. Pitney Bowes suggests curbing high fax-related
phone costs by buying a faster modem. About 70% of fax
machines are equipped with a 9.5 Kbp modem. A switch to a
14.4-units (or faster, though reception times may interfere
with the improvements) model would reduce the average
transmission time of a five-page document by 64%. This could
cut phone costs by up to $1,450 per year per fax machine.

     4. Firm brochures. Beware of too-low bids when looking
for a typesetter and printer. Some typesetters will quote a
break-even price, and then charge for each correction, knowing
full well that they will profit enormously on the many changes
that law firms typically make. Printers may give you an
extremely low quote, and then pull a "switcheroo" on the paper
you've selected, replacing it with a lower-quality stock
that's less expensive. 

     5. Cellular phones. Keith Fetridge of Aronson Fetridge &
Weigle (Bethesda, Md.) suggests negotiating the cost of your
monthly fee and the add-on services. Some providers will
eliminate these fees for large users. It also pays to audit
your monthly phone bills. Research concludes that up to 30%
contain at least one error.

     6. Online services. To control costs, limit the number of
staff and attorneys who are given online access. And write and
distribute a policy that specifies that online services must
be used only for purposes that benefit the firm or its
clients. 

     7. Staff management. Surprisingly, a quick staff meeting
may be less expensive than writing a memo. Studies show that
routine memos are written once and then rewritten 4.2 times.
And it typically takes 54 minutes to plan, compose, and edit
the first draft alone.

     8. Copiers. Saving money by purchasing less-expensive
paper can backfire by causing chronic paper jams. Most copiers
are designed to handle 20-lb. bond paper that is uniform. The
cheaper the paper, the greater the variation (in stiffness,
density, size, and so on) from sheet to sheet. And
inconsistencies lead to paper jams.

     9. Lawyers' offices. Today's standard offices are smaller
than ever. According to architects, the optimum office for
senior partners is now 150 to 225 sq. ft. For partners, it's
150 to 180 sq. ft. And for associates, it's just 100 to 150
sq. ft.

What Can Law Firms Learn From Others About Marketing?

     Chances are your firm's marketing staff is fully aware of
the benefits of benchmarking and is already informally engaged
in the process. Many are members of the National Law Firm
Marketing Association or the Association of Legal
Administrators and have ample opportunity to share tactics at
national and local meetings.

     Those firms that want to enhance their "casual"
benchmarking efforts, however, must begin the ever-expanding
quest to identify "best-in-class" organizations that have
achieved excellence in areas in which the firm too would like
to excel. And these don't have to be law firms. Other
professional service firms, corporations, even clients may be
helpful in helping your firm's marketers and attorneys to
develop so-called external benchmarks.

     Why are external benchmarks important? For starters,
consider that without them, your firm's internally focused
marketing team has access to few new ideas that can lead to
creative solutions. Without knowing what is outside, the focus
of the team is limited and the results can be average at best.

     Recognizing that external benchmarks can be useful to law
firms trying to educate themselves about alternatives, a
recent study, Benchmarking the Best Practices in Client
Development, set out to compare the most effective initiatives
used by law, accounting/management consulting, and other
professional services firms. The study's legal component--
spearheaded by Julie Savarino, attorney and director of
Detroit's Business Development, Inc., was based on
questionnaires completed by 1,200 leading firms of all sizes
in the U.S., Canada, England, and Australia. Follow-up phone
calls and focus groups were then conducted to identify some of
the best practices used.

     Key findings. The information is outlined below:

     o Best practices. Participants reported that 10 types of
marketing efforts yield positive results. They are:
newsletters/bulletins; individual marketing plans; seminars;
one-to-one communications; consulting services;
industry/target/niche efforts; referrals; community
involvement; responding to proposals; and brochures. Most of
the law firms queried, however, still rely on what Savarino
terms "first-generation" marketing efforts which include the
use of tools such as seminars, newsletters, and publicity.

     Although accounting/management consulting and other
professional services firms gave industry/target/niche
marketing high marks, law firm respondents remained
unconvinced. According to the report, however, many law firms
plan to add industry-defined practice areas or groups to their
firms' organizational structure (see Figures 1 and 2 on page
3--bar charts available in printed version only).

     o Marketing departments. Only half of the law firms that
responded had dedicated marketing staff or an in-house
marketing department. By comparison, 70% of
accounting/management consulting firms and more than 80% of
other professional services firms had in-house marketers.

     And those law firms that do have marketers use them to
support a larger number of professionals than do
accounting/management consulting and other professional
services firms. Overall, the average marketing staff to
professional ratio is 45 to 1; in law firms the average ratio
is 65 to 1, the highest (see Figure 3 on page 3--printed
version only).

     But half of all responding firms plan to increase the
size of their marketing departments in coming years, with most
adding coordinator/support staff-level professionals. Almost
one-third of responding law firms plan to add sales/client
development professionals to their departments. About 45% of
responding firms plan to maintain the size of their marketing
departments.

     Impediments to effective marketing. In law firms, the
lack of commitment by attorneys was cited as an obstacle twice
as often as the corresponding professionals' level of
commitment in accounting/management consulting and other
professional service firms. Asked what it would take to
overcome marketing barriers, the respondents listed: greater
involvement of firm leadership; marketing training and
education; monetary incentives; time management; use of
marketing plans; creating marketing department efficiencies;
and using marketing budgeting tools.

Records and Files: The 'Status Quo' Can Be Expensive

     Law firm administrators and managing partners putting the
finishing touches on their organizations' agendas for the New
Year will probably overlook one issue that's generally taken
for granted: records retention. But the hidden costs
associated with time wasted by staff searching for hard to
find files (not to mention the obvious legal implications and
their potential costs) should prompt those firms that have
been gathering client records and files for storage, moving
records from partners' desks to the file cabinets, or keeping
documents off-site indefinitely to make more frequent reviews
of their record-retention policies.

     Where to begin? Statutes of limitations and state and
governmental agency requirements vary from state to state, of
course, and firms must determine what requirements hold for
the states in which they practice--for client as well as firm
records. In addition, the Association of Legal Administrators'
minimum document retention guidelines provided in the sidebar
on page 4 should prove useful as a starting point for firms
assessing their current policy.  

     Other considerations. While few firms employ full-time
records-management personnel, most find it efficient to assign
one person this additional responsibility, often within
practice areas. 

     Although new records-management technology, e.g., optical
disk imaging, may seem expensive, firms that have used it
report lower labor costs. 

     When it's time to move records off-site, firm
administrators can contact the Association of Commercial
Record Centers (ACRC), a nonprofit trade association for off
site information management companies. For a list of members
in your area, call 800-336-9793.

Mastering Powerful Leadership Without Uttering a Word (Or 
Becoming a Dictator)

     For managing partners and administrators, failing to
strike a balance between wielding power and providing
effective leadership can prove disastrous. As most will
readily attest, few in the law firm environment respect
authority simply because one demands it. On the contrary, many
of the "difficult" lawyers LOMAR knows respect those leaders
who consider their input before taking action.

     Although there are no management courses entitled "Law
Firm Listening 101," perhaps there should be. A recent study
by the American Management Association confirms that listening
is number one among the top 10 management activities. And
eight of the 10 activities involve attending to what others
say. Providing a vision, giving direction, training others,
conducting meetings, and communicating decisions, for example,
all require a keen ear. Another management study found that
listening takes up 53% of a typical executive's day, followed
by reading (17%), speaking (26%), and writing (14%).

     What issues have an adverse impact on communication in
law firms? Managing partners and administrators queried by
LOMAR indicate some common obstacles:

     o "As a lawyer, my tendency is to do the same thing [in
managing the firm] that I do when I'm trying a case, which is
to reinforce a position," the managing partner of a midsize
firm confided. "We're all trained to do a kind of active
listening with witnesses which makes it difficult to
communicate effectively at other times."

     o A managing partner with a New York City-based firm, who
admits that he is determined to build his listening skills,
offered this observation: "When you're feeling stretched in
all directions, taking the time to stop and listen can be
extremely difficult. I do everything possible to put aside my
practice problems and talk, but still it's hard to do. I work
at it, quite frankly, because that's my role as managing
partner."

     Listening is an active art that involves two functions:
Finding out what people know and finding out what they don't
know. Although the latter is the more important skill, it is
difficult to cultivate. The key, say a majority of the
administrators and managing partners LOMAR interviewed, lies
in listening between the lines--and above the cacophony of
other demands and practice-related stresses. (See the sidebar
below for tips on enhancing others' perceptions of these firm
leaders' power and authority.)

     The consensus of those interviewed is that the strong,
silent types who can lead their firms "through burning
buildings--and worse" tend to share the following
characteristics:

     1. They find areas of common interest. This is not the
same as being a consensus-builder. As one lawyer in a
Southeast firm says, "Our managing partner asks a lot of
questions, but he can process responses with incredible speed.
He sifts through it all and assists us in identifying the
chaff and the wheat."

     2. They judge the content and overlook style. They don't
tune out the dull, laconic, or loquacious messengers or the
dry, seemingly tedious topics of discussion. Instead, they
seek out whatever is of value to the group or the firm as a
whole, no matter where it may originate.

     "Our managing partner is quick to defend others who are
summarily shot down or ignored because of lack of presence,"
one practitioner remarks. "He restates the good ideas from
their comments and enables us to focus on them in a way the
original speaker couldn't."

     3. They hold their fire--even under attack. They don't
argue or respond until they fully understand the objections
that have been made. And they never answer a question until it
is fully asked. Confrontations are met with calm and reason
and followed up with rational points. 

     4. They look for and address breakdowns in communication.
"In my firm, probably like most, we had an unwritten policy
that the administrator would handle staff problems and I would
look after the lawyers," the New York-based managing partner
explains. "I know now that [the policy] actually worsened our
communications problem. You don't turn people away that
readily. Now I ask, 'Why did you come to me instead of our
administrator or your practice group leader, and what can I do
to facilitate matters?'" 

     5. They don't fake attention. "We had one managing
partner who wanted to be 'powerful' but just came off as phony
and insincere with his overly solicitous manner," one
practitioner told LOMAR. "People know from your tone, body
language, and so forth whether your interest is genuine."

     6. They are open-minded and inquisitive. People tend to
construct reality, so paying careful attention to the
perceptions of others takes on added importance. The New York
partner recounts the case, which he admits he could have
handled better, of a partner taken aback when a move to a
branch office left him temporarily in an office without a
window.

     "When you're dealing with lawyers, you know that if
you're not careful an argument is always possible," he quips.
"I explained the mistake, but what I was saying was completely
misinterpreted, and I lost my temper." What could he have done
to defuse the problem? In the managing partner's mind, the
issue was frivolous and he dismissed it summarily when active
listening, asking questions, and being more sensitive to the
situation  might have averted the confrontation.

     In the end, if there's a benefit to being a "strong,
silent type," it's that sooner or later, people start to pay
attention. Or, as many of the administrators and managing
partners that LOMAR interviewed concluded about their most
influential peers: When they speak, others listen.

[-Five Communication Enhancers for Managing Partners and
Administrators-]

     1. Identify your communications style. Some managing
partners and administrators communicate more effectively
through conversation and others through written communication.
And some respond better to one form than the other. It all
depends on the individual. It's important to identify and
understand how you are most effective.

     2. Recognize varying styles. Everyone has a different way
of communicating. In addition to understanding your style,
make an attempt to identify the recipients' without making
snap judgments based on intangibles such as personality and
appearance. Remember that law firms have a myriad of
personality types--from the silent ones and belligerent
tyrants to the apple polishers and sensitive soldiers. You
can't effectively communicate with each in the same manner.

      3. Be consistent. Once you identify your style of
communicating, it will confuse your messages if you stray from
it. If you routinely go to others to discuss issues in person,
don't start calling meetings in your office when minor matters
are involved. Use "unusual" communications techniques only
when all else fails.

     4. Limit technological exchanges. With the proliferation
of voice mail, e-mail, and telecommunications, many managing
partners and administrators have little incentive to
communicate face-to-face. Try to strike a balance between
personal contact and "impersonal" electronic conversations
that may limit your ability to get information across
effectively. Routine communications--along the line of 'I
thought you might like to know'--might be made via phone or e
mail, but crucial discussions should be conducted face-to-face
and in the listeners' environment. 

     5. Say it in person. It may be easier to give someone bad
news or to criticize in writing, but such serious
communications must be issued in person. Follow up with
written confirmation of what was said to avoid
misunderstandings. Written communication is most useful when
the same message must be given to more than one person.

LOMAR Law Office Cost Index

     Each month LOMAR updates its Law Office Cost Index for
major cities nationwide. This exclusive LOMAR monthly feature
is aimed at helping accounting firm managing partners and
administrators monitor relevant office cost changes within
their area and compare them with other regions.

     This index excludes lawyers' salaries, benefits, and
profit shares.

     The index covers all other major cost factors in the
accounting office including: rent and other space expenses,
equipment, support personnel, stationery, insurance, phone,
etc.

     The index is derived from data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the American Chamber of Commerce, and Statistics
Canada. The base of 100 is for the national average in the
first quarter of 1992. Current figures follow actuals by 90
days.

LOMAR News Briefs

       o Three suggestions for law firm administrators
awaiting long overdue performance evaluations.
Managing partners who overlooked such appraisals
should also take note of the comments gleaned from
the Association of Legal Administrators' (ALA; 708-
816-1212) online forum via CompuServe and, if
necessary, start the ball rolling as soon as
possible. 
  
       1. Pursue the matter. "Only once in my five
  years with this firm have I received a review
  [though] every year I prepare the form and send it
  out. Last year the managing member walked into my
  office, handed back the review, [and] said 'You want
  a review, you're here aren't you? That's your
  review,'" one administrator lamented. "I gave up.
  After five years they finally got to me."
  
       2. Apply gentle pressure. "At the same time as
  everyone else's review and salary decisions, I would
  provide partners with a document that detailed all
  the things they said they wanted to accomplish over
  the year and what was the result. The list was
  primarily from the prior year's review and included
  items that came up at partner meetings," explained
  one administrator. "Also added to the list were
  things that were by my own initiation.... I felt the
  document worked for both the partners and myself
  because they also had a list of things that I had
  accomplished."
  
       3. Put the process in motion_quickly. "I passed
  out an evaluation form from the ALA and had all the
  partners fill it out. It took me 90 days to get it
  done," offered another law firm administrator who
  had gone almost two years without an official
  evaluation. "We did the basic accomplishments and
  goals...they even interviewed staff to get their
  opinion and gave me a great raise. The only thing
  [the firm] didn't do was make the raise retroactive
  back to my anniversary date like everyone else. What
  I learned was to start 90 days in advance."
  
       o Time to honor exceptional effort. The ABA's
  Standing Committee on Lawyers' Public Service
  Responsibilities is seeking nominations for its 1996
  Pro Bono Publico Awards. Five awards will be
  presented at the ABA's annual meeting in Orlando,
  July 31-Aug. 4. For details on the nominating
  process, contact Dorothy Jackson at 312-988-5766.
  West Publishing (Eagan, Minn.) is also accepting
  nominations for its Excellence in Private Law
  Librarianship Award. Librarians who have
  distinguished themselves in managing and providing
  effective access to information are eligible for
  consideration. For more information contact Todd
  Daubenberger at 612-687-5638.
  
       o Kudos to LOMAR's publisher. The Institute on
  Management and Administration's (IOMA) Web site was
  recently described by Inc. magazine as "by far the
  best business-resource site we've ever seen," and
  was cited by PC Week for its "comprehensive listing
  of business information." For access, point to
  http//www.ioma/com/ioma or e-mail Kathy Fitzgerald
  at Kathie@ ingress.com for help. 
  
       o Remember client confidentiality when
  outsourcing. Firms must make a reasonable effort to
  ensure that the outside companies they retain know
  when confidential material is involved, cautions a
  recent opinion by the ABA's Standing Committee on
  Ethics and Professional Responsibility. Formal
  Opinion 95-398, issued in response to a request to
  consider the implications of a firm's arrangement
  with a maintenance company which had been given
  access to client files on its local area network,
  recommends setting up written agreements to prohibit
  outside service providers from disclosing client
  information they might see. 
  
       o Free help with new ERISA guidelines. The 1995
  Guide to ERISA Reporting and Disclosure is being
  offered by the Human Resource Advisory Group of
  Coopers & Lybrand LLP to help those in search of the
  latest information on ERISA's new reporting and
  disclosure requirements. Copies are available free
  of charge by contacting Coopers & Lybrand
  Publications at 212-536-3257.
  
       o Partners specializing in administrative law
  command top dollar. And with their average annual
  compensation of $237,714, these practitioners
  outpaced their peers in other practice areas,
  according to Altman Weil Pensa's 1995 Survey of Law
  Firm Economics (Newtown Square, Pa.; 610-359-9900).
  
       o New alternatives for NALFMA membership. In
  response to recommendations that it review its
  membership qualifications, benefits, and costs, the
  National Law Firm Marketing Association (NALFMA;
  Chicago, 312-245-1592) has added new "firm" and
  "individual" membership categories. Firm membership
  has its advantages. With this latest option, if a
  marketer leaves a firm, his or her rights of NALFMA
  membership are transferrable to the new
  firm_assuming it continues to pay annual dues and
  provides the association with written notice. In
  addition, members of the same firm, regardless of
  geographic location, may also join at a reduced
  rate. Cost: $275 per year for the firm's member
  representative and $150 for additional members. A
  $50 initiation fee is assessed for each new member.  
  
       o LOMAR online. Subscribers in need of, say,
  that LOMAR article on partner billing rates that ran
  back in December can now access it on their
  computers. Two months of back issues are currently
  available through NEWSNET and new issues will be
  added soon after they are published. For information
  on this online service, which also offers a number
  of other legal publications, contact: NEWSNET, 945
  Haverford Rd., Bryn Mawr, PA 19010; 800-334-0329.
  Coming soon: A LOMAR archive on WESTLAW. Users will
  also be able to access back issues of LOMAR's sister
  publications: Compensation and Benefits for Law
  Offices and Partner's Report for Law Firm Owners.

September 1994

NICOTINE PATCH CLASS SUIT ALLEGES PERSONAL INJURY, SD CA RULES

     U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez of the Southern
District of California on Sept. 22 dismissed the RICO-based class
complaint lodged by nicotine patch users against the major
American tobacco concerns, finding their nicotine addiction
claims to be, at bottom, for personal injury, and therefore
incompensable under the statute (Allman et al. v. Philip Morris
Inc. et al., SD CA, No. 94-0504-IEG (CM).

     The plaintiffs had argued that they were not seeking
recovery for injury to their person, such as for pain and
suffering, emotional distress or increased risk of cancer, but
rather only for the money they were forced to spend to break
their addiction to cigarettes -- an addiction, they added, that
the defendant tobacco companies caused.  They asserted that these
damages constituted statutory injury to property.

     "Although theoretically it is not always easy to distinguish
a personal injury from an injury to property," Judge Gonzalez
wrote, "for the purposes of bringing an action under RICO the
courts have been clear that even the economic consequences of
personal injuries are not compensable under RICO....

     "[A]lthough plaintiffs characterize the injury as pecuniary
and thus an injury to their property," she continued, "the Court
is unable to ignore that the core injury alleged in the complaint
is addiction to nicotine."  The judge noted that all courts faced
with the issue have recognized that expenses stemming from
personal injury are not recoverable under RICO.  "Had Congress
intended to create a federal treble damages remedy for cases
involving such claims, it could have enacted a statute referring
to injury generally, without any restrictive language," she
wrote.

     The judge found that the plaintiffs had cited to no cases
that allow recovery of medical expenses under RICO.  She also
rejected the claimants' argument that money is considered
"property" under California law, and that expenditures for
nicotine patches therefore constituted injury to property.
"[T]he Court will not adopt a state interpretation of 'property'
that will contravene Congress' intent in enacting RICO," Judge
Gonzalez stated.
               The defendant tobacco companies' July 15 dismissal motion
had also asserted that the plaintiffs failed to allege that they
were injured by the use or investment of the money the companies
supposedly received from alleged racketeering conduct, as
required under RICO Section 1962(a).  The plaintiffs had rejoined
in their Aug. 15 response that they adequately alleged injury
under Section 1962(a) by asserting that the defendants'
investment of the proceeds of their cigarettes sales, which
occurred due to defendants' racketeering activity, caused injury
to the class.

     The plaintiffs are represented by William S. Lerach, Patrick
J. Coughlin and Randi D. Weinberger of Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes & Lerach in San Diego and by Melvyn I. Weiss and Patricia
Hynes in the firm's New York office.

     Counsel for the defendants include Maurice A. Leiter, Andrew
C. Callari and Richard A. Ward of Arnold & Porter in Washington,
D.C.; Christopher Norgaard of the Los Angeles office of Mudge
Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon; Robert G. Steiner and
Christopher Healy of Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps in San
Diego; Robert C. Wright of Wright & L'Estrange in San Diego;
Elwood G. Lui and Scott D. Bertzyk of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue
in Los Angeles; Robert C. Weber and William T. Plesec in the
Cleveland office of Jones, Day; and R.J. Coughlan Jr., Michael L.

9TH CIR.: PATIENTS CAN'T SHOW INJURY FROM OVERBILLING SCHEME

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 19 affirmed
a Nevada district court's dismissal of RICO claims lodged by a
group of hospital patients against a doctor and hospital for
conspiring to overbill their health insurers, finding that the
plaintiffs failed to demonstrate concrete financial loss (Steele
et al. v. Hospital Corp. of America. et al., 9th Cir., No. 92-
17035).

     Dr. Stuart Wyckoff, director of the adolescent psychiatric
care unit at Truckee Meadows Hospital, was among the parties sued
by four former patients and their parents.  The plaintiffs
alleged that Wyckoff and the hospital conspired to bill their
health care carriers for services that went unprovided, or were
inappropriate.

     The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada granted
summary judgment to the defense, determining that the plaintiffs
lacked standing.  The lower court reasoned that the insurers, and
not the plaintiffs themselves, were injured by the fraudulent
billing.  The trial court further found that the plaintiffs
failed to show that they paid out any money of their own as a
result of the scheme.

     In affirming, the Ninth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs'
assertions of injury due to depletion of insurance benefits.  One
parent asserted that he could have used some of the benefits for
himself; the panel rejoined that he had "not described a concrete
financial loss, but rather a speculative injury, contingent on
actually seeking medical care for himself....  [S]peculative
injuries to not serve to confer standing under RICO, unless they
become concrete and actual."

     Another parent claImed that he had to cover the entire bill
when his son was admitted to another facility because of
exhausted coverage.  "[P]roof of this payment would be
insufficient to confer RICO standing," the Ninth Circuit replied,
"because it alone does not show that the payment was caused by
the alleged billing scheme..., as distinguished from some other
cause."

     While the record revealed direct payments made by two of the
patients to the hospital, the panel found that the record "does
not reveal what these payments were for and there is no
explanation of how those charges were related to the allegedly
fraudulent overbilling scheme."

     The Ninth Circuit also affirmed the lower court's
application of the same reasoning in granting summary judgment on
the Nevada state RICO allegations.

     C. Frederick Pinkerton, Reno, NV, represents the appellants.

     Mark H. Lynch of Covington & Burling, Washington, DC, and
Theodore D. Gamboa of Osborne & Gamboa, Reno, represent the
appellees.

CO. TO HIGH CT.: CUSTOMER BILLING SCHEME DIDN'T INJURE COMPETITOR

     The telecommunications company whose summary judgment on a
competitor's RICO claims was overturned by the Fourth Circuit
last March on Aug. 19 filed a petition for writ of certiorari
with the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the appellate panel
improperly found a causal link between the petitioner's alleged
fraud on its customers and the injury claimed by the respondent
(Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. et al. v. Mid Atlantic
Telecom Inc., U.S. Sup. Ct., No. 94-319).

     The petitioner Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. (nee
Long Distance Services Inc.) and respondent Mid Atlantic Telecom
Inc. make wholesale purchases of time on the transmission lines
of common carriers and resell them to their customers.  After a
1986 systems error caused the loss of a weekend's worth of data
concerning customer use, LDS President Richard J. Rice
commissioned the drafting of a computer program that would
randomly pad the length of its customers' billable calls.

     Mid Atlantic sued LDS and Rice in the District of Maryland
in 1992, arguing that LDS continued to utilize the program even
after its losses had been recouped.  Mid Atlantic asserted that
the program enabled LDS to offer artificially lower rates, and
thereby entice away Mid Atlantic's customers, when in fact it was
overbilling said customers.  The plaintiff alleged to have lost
revenues from engaging in a pricing war, as well as customers.

     The trial court granted summary judgment to LDS, finding no
proximate cause linking the alleged conduct could not have
proximately caused the claimed injuries per the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1992 ruling in Holmes v. SIPC.  In reversing and
remanding for further discovery, the Fourth Circuit noted that
the complaint alleged Mid Atlantic's elimination as a competitor
as an end goal of the alleged scheme.  The appellate panel stated
that its findings were consistent with Holmes, noting that Mid
Atlantic was not seeking to vindicate the rights of its ex-
customers, and that Mid Atlantic's claimed injuries were not
derivative of its ex-customers.

     In its certiorari petition, LDS asserted that the underlying
predicate acts alleged "are the use of the mails and wires to
commit a fraud....  These allegations, plainly, are directed
exclusively toward the users of long distance service, the
customers.  There are no allegations that LDS intended to deceive
Mid Atlantic or that Mid Atlantic was defrauded by the fraudulent
billing practice."

     Regardless of whether it intended this alleged fraud on the
customers to also harm the respondent competitively, argued the
petitioner, Mid Atlantic's injury was not directly caused by the
fraud.  "Mid Atlantic's injury is a byproduct, whether intended
or not, of the injury to the customers," LDS argued.

     "RICO, as construed by this court, requires a cognizable
connection between the offending acts and the claimed injury,"
the petitioner contended.  The respondent alleged that one of the
purposes of the scheme was to steal Mid Atlantic's customers; the
petitioner rejoined that "unfair competition of that nature,
however unacceptable it is deemed under state law, is not
prohibited by the federal mail fraud statute."
               The petitioner asserted that "RICO does not, and was
never intended to, prohibit anticompetitive conduct, even in its more
virulent forms, without more.  RICO was aimed at a different
evil."

     Edgar N. James and Martha Walfoort of Guerrieri, Edmond &
James, Washington, DC, submitted the certiorari petition on
behalf of Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. and Richard J.
Rice.

     Harry Martin Rifkin and Franklin T. Caudill of Semmes, Bowen
& Semmes, Baltimore, represent Mid Atlantic Telecom Inc.

ND IL REFUSES TO DISMISS FORCED-PLACED INSURANCE CAR LOAN CLAIMS

     U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo of the Northern District
of Illinois on Aug. 11 refused to dismiss the RICO claims of
three car loan borrowers against First of America Bank Champion
N.A., sustaining the plaintiffs' allegations that the lender
obtained unnecessary forced-placed insurance on their vehicles
for the purpose of imposing additional loan obligations (Bermudez
et al. v.  First of America Bank Champion N.A., ND IL, No. 93 C
3653).

     The three plaintiffs had each purchased an auto financed via
a motor vehicle retail installment sales contract.  Each sales
contract was immediately assigned to Champion.  The sales
contracts' terms required the borrowers to keep the vehicles
insured against loss or damage, and authorized Champion to obtain
loss/damage insurance if the borrower failed to do so.  The cost
of any such "forced-placed" insurance would be charged to the
borrowers' loan balance.

     In their cases, the plaintiffs urged, Champion, without
authorization, procured insurance that would also cover any
default on their loan obligations.  All three of the plaintiffs
here refused to pay the extra premiums that were added to their
balances due and all had their cars repossessed by the lender.
Their claimed injuries included loss of their vehicles, injury to
their credit and the creation of fictitious indebtedness.

     Champion never provided the borrowers with copies of the
forced-placed policies, and nothing in the "certificate of
insurance" transmitted to each plaintiff suggested that the
insurance also covered default.  The policies also covered
imposition of mechanic's liens on the collateral, and against the
borrower absconding with or secreting the collateral.

     The plaintiffs' complaint was grounded in RICO, the Truth in
Lending Act and numerous state counts.  Champion made multiple
arguments in its bid to dismiss the RICO claim, including lack of
RICO "injury," lack of proximate causation, running of the
statute of limitations, failure to adequately plead fraud,
failure to allege pattern, and immunity under the McCarran-
Ferguson Act.

     Judge Castillo disposed of the McCarran-Ferguson argument
first, concluding that the defendant's unauthorized procurement
of coverage (and passing such costs along) was not part of the
"business of insurance."  The judge found that this practice does
not involve the transferring or spreading of Champion's risk, nor
is it an integral part of the policy relationship between carrier
and policyholder.  Nor were the challenged practices limited to
entities in the insurance industry, the court noted.

     In addressing Champion's RICO standing arguments, the court
noted that the lender "does not dispute that repossession of
plaintiffs' vehicles and payment of money for unauthorized
premiums constitute compensable injuries under RICO."  The judge
rejected Champion's contentions that the plaintiffs suffered no
injury because they did not pay the additional premiums.

     He further rejected the lender's assertion that the car
repossessions were not proximately caused by its conduct.  One
plaintiff had not paid any insurance premiums, much less the
added charges, Champion argued; another was in default for an
amount beyond the premiums.  Judge Castillo found that the
present record "does not permit a parcelling of charges [into]
authorized and unauthorized components," and that the other
plaintiff could possibly "establish facts proving that Champion
would not have repossessed his vehicle if not for the fact that
his outstanding balance was so great."

     The judge rejected the lenders' contentions that the
borrowers in fact benefited from the additional coverage, or that
the coverage would not have been forced-placed but for the
plaintiffs' failure to obtain their own insurance.  The
borrowers, the judge noted, did not complain about the
defendant's procurement of authorized insurance.

     In turning to the time-bar argument, the court noted the
plaintiffs' contentions that their claims accrued in February
1993, when they obtained documents showing that Champion had
procured the unauthorized insurance.  Champion asserted that the
claims began to run in 1988-1989, when the borrowers received
their "certificates of insurance."

     Judge Castillo refused to find that the certificates put the
plaintiffs on notice.  "The statement that the certificate is a
condensed version of the policy and that there are additional
terms and conditions does not suggest to the ordinary consumer
that there is coverage beyond that described in the certificate,"
he wrote.

     He also found that the plaintiffs' authorization in the
contracts did not void their ability to allege fraud.  After
reviewing the documents, the judge refused to hold as a matter of
law that they "authorized Champion to purchase insurance in
addition to that for damage or loss to the vehicles."

     The court also found the pleadings to sufficiently allege
pattern.  The allegations, noted the judge, satisfied the
relatedness inquiry by claiming a course of conduct running at
least five years; the possibility of thousands of victims;
similar injuries (repossession, overpayments); and multiple
fraudulent uses of the mails.

     Continuity was also demonstrated, found the judge, by the
allegations that these were the lender's "normal ongoing
practices" and that such practices had occurred for several
years.

     The judge refused to dismiss the TILA claims as time-barred
under the statute's one-year limitations period, finding the
plaintiffs to have sufficiently averred fraudulent concealment.
The court also rejected the substantive TILA challenge.  Judge
Castillo found that if the default coverage was unauthorized,
then the charges for the coverage would not constitute a charge
for actual unanticipated default, but a finance charge subject to
the statute.

     The judge ordered the submission of a motion for class
certification by Sept. 1 and a defense response by Sept. 29.

11TH CIR. ADOPTS PERSON/ENTERPRISE DISTINCTION IN REVISED OPINION

     The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 19 modified
its April 1994 ruling that permitted members of the United
Steelworkers of America to bring RICO claims against their union
and USX Corp. over a swap of labor concessions for perks to union
negotiators.

     While the modification did not invalidate the claims of the
plaintiffs here, the 11th Circuit has ostensibly voided its 1982
ruling in U.S. v. Hartley, which had rejected the commonly-held
requirement that a defendant entity cannot be both a RICO
"person" and "enterprise" under 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(c) (Cox et
al. v. Administrator United States Steel & Carnegie et al., 11th
Cir., Nos. 91-7215, 92-6218).

     The litigation, which was brought in the Northern District
of Alabama by 38 former union employees of USX's Fairfield mill,
stemmed from a 1983 collective bargaining agreement between USX
and the union.  Leading the negotiations for the Steelworkers
were District 36 director Thermon Phillips and district sub-
director E.B. Rich, both former USX employees.  As alleged,
Phillips and Rich sought to have USX grant them (and other ex-USX
employee/union reps) retroactive leaves of absence, in order to
become eligible for USX pensions.  The negotiators purportedly
made any labor concessions contingent on their receiving
pensions.

     The CBA that was struck contained considerable concessions,
including the elimination of 500 jobs, the abolition of local
working conditions rules, and the dismissal of all pending
grievances and complaints.  USX subsequently amended corporate
policy to grant indefinite retroactive leaves of absence for
employees who had left to work for the union.

     While Phillips, Rich and four other union reps (the
"Fairfield Six") began receiving pension payments, no other
potential beneficiaries under the policy change did.  After
rumors of the Fairfield Six's arrangement surfaced, potential
beneficiaries made demand on USX's pension fund.  USX, Rich and
Phillips were ultimately convicted under 29 U.S.C. Section 186
for their bargaining activities.

     The Northern District of Alabama had granted summary
judgment to the defense on the plaintiffs' RICO and Labor
Management Relations Act claims.  The trial court determined that
the employees did not demonstrate any causal link between the
negotiations that led to the pension grandfathering and their
claimed injuries.

     The 11th Circuit reversed last April 5.  The panel
determined the plaintiffs' RICO claims valid after exhaustive
review, finding that the employees had properly alleged pattern
and that a jury issue could be made that Rich and Phillips'
pursuit of their self-interests resulted in some dollar amount of
concessions in the CBA.  The appellate court also found that the
plaintiffs could pursue arguments under theories of respondeat
superior and aiding/abetting to establish the union's RICO
liability for the negotiators' acts.  The defense sought
rehearing and rehearing en banc from the 11th Circuit.

     While the panel rejected the defense petitions in all other
respects, it altered the text of Section II.B.1.b.  In its
earlier ruling, the court had rejected USX's argument that it
could not be both a 1962(c) "person" and "enterprise" by simply
citing back to Hartley.  The revised portions of the opinion
removed all citations to Hartley.

     The revised opinion found that the plaintiffs' claims did in
fact make a person/enterprise distinction.  "[T]he plaintiffs
have alleged only that USX conducted the affairs of the Fairfield
Works, the Union, District 36 and the Fund through a pattern of
racketeering activity -- not that USX conducted its own affairs
through a pattern of such activity."

     The panel also determined that the pension fund was an
enterprise distinct from USX.  "The pension fund has a separate
corporate existence; it is a nonprofit membership corporation.
Its existence is not dependent upon USX....  Although both USX
and its employees have a role in the pension fund, the role of
each is distinct from the respective role each has in the
corporation itself."

     The amendments also eliminated all reference to Hartley from
the context of its vicarious liability overview at
Section II.B.3.a.

7TH CIR.: POWER TOOL DISPARAGEMENT CLAIMS FAIL TO PLEAD FRAUD

     The Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 13
affirmed the dismissal of the RICO-based trade disparagement
claims brought by a Taiwanese power tool maker and its American
distributor against Makita Corp. and its subsidiaries, agreeing
that the averments of fraud fail to meet the particularity
requirements of FRCP 9(b) (Jepson Inc. et al. v. Makita Corp. et
al., 7th Cir., No. 93-1606).

     The action is rooted in an April 1988 complaint to the
International Trade Commission by the defendants (collectively,
"Makita") alleging that the distributor Jepson Inc. and some 30
other parties had engaged in unfair trade practices with respect
to the importation and marketing of Taiwan-made power tools.
That August, the ITC began an investigation into possible
breaches of the Tariff Act of 1930.

     While the investigation ensued, Makita allegedly contacted
Jepson customers, apprising them of the ITC activity and
disparaging Jepson's products as low-quality, infringing goods
that would be ordered removed from their shelves.  Makita also
arranged the placement of stories in the trade press concerning
the investigation and predicting that Makita would prevail in the
matter.  One story identified Jepson and the co-plaintiff
manufacturer Ko Shin Electric and Machinery Co. Ltd. as two of
the companies that Makita was seeking to block.  In July 1989,
the ITC found in favor of all but one of the companies named to
Makita's complaint.

     Jepson and Ko Shin filed a RICO complaint with the Northern
District of Illinois in 1990, asserting that Makita's acts were
part of a conspiracy dating back to 1986 calculated to drive
Taiwanese power tool manufacturers from the market.  The
plaintiffs alleged substantial sales losses over 1986-1990, along
with erosion of market position, customer base, and potential for
growth.  The plaintiffs sought a base recovery of $10 million
plus treble damages.

     The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice on
various grounds; the Seventh Circuit's affirmance focused on the
lower court's FRCP 9(b) analysis.  With respect to the phone
calls and mailings to Jepson customers and the trade press, the
Northern District found the plaintiffs' allegations to "fail to
provide any indications of who made the communications or when
they took place."
               The lower court also determined that the plaintiffs'
allegations were not within the scope of the wire and mail fraud
statutes.  As construed by the Seventh Circuit, the Northern
District "thought that the gist of the alleged scheme -- to
disparage Jepson's products and frighten away its customers --
did not fall under the rubric of fraud."  While the statutes are
concerned with property rights, the plaintiffs "had not
identified  damage to a cognizable property interest."

     The Seventh Circuit's analysis opened by finding
"considerable persuasive force" to this latter argument.  The
panel declined to address the issue at length, however, because
it agreed with the lower court's 9(b) findings as grounds for
affirmance.  The panel found the allegations concerning the
communications to Jepson's customers to be "the most glaringly
deficient....

     "Although the amended complaint identifies the general
nature of the purported misrepresentations made to these
customers," the panel continued, "no detail beyond that is
supplied."  The court found that there was no issue present as to
whether the facts were in the sole possession of the defense.
"[E]ven if they learned of the contacts through other sources,"
wrote the panel, "they have as much access as the defendants to
the customers who can flesh out the circumstances of the mailings
and wire communications involved."

     While finding the allegations concerning the communications
with the trade press "not flawed to the same degree," the
appellate panel still found the complaint void of detail
concerning the content of any such communication.  From the face
of the articles that appeared in the trades, the Seventh Circuit
wrote, "we detect only one or two statements that might be
characterized as misrepresentations."

     The panel rejected the plaintiffs' allegations concerning
the article that implicated them in the ITC investigation.  "We
do not see what is false or misleading about such a statement,"
wrote the court.  "Jepson and Ko Shin were, so far as we can
determine, targets of Makita's complaint, and the complaint did
seek an order of the kind described."

     The court found the statements made by Makita's counsel to
the trades "fall within the range of opinions predictions that
parties and their attorneys routinely make while legal
proceedings are underway."  The references made in the trades to
"rip-offs" and "poor-quality copies" of Makita products did not
rise to fraud, stated the panel; Makita did obtain a conviction
against one manufacturer, indicating there were in fact inferior
copies of their products in circulation.

     "Labels like 'poor quality,' 'cheap,' and 'lookalike' may be
offensive to the companies whose products are being described,"
the panel concluded, "but they are also inherently subjective
expressions that are ill-suited as the basis for mail and wire
fraud claims."

4TH CIR.: PTL SHARES ARE 'SECURITIES,' DEFENSE RICO WIN AFFIRMED

     The Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 23
overturned the directed verdict granted to Jim Bakker on the
federal securities fraud claims levied against him by a class of
subscribers to "lifetime partnerships" in PTL, determining that
the partnership interests constitute "securities" under federal
law.  The balance of the North Carolina federal court and jury's
findings, including Bakker's liability for common law fraud and
the defense verdict on federal and state RICO claims, were upheld
(Teague et al. v. Bakker et al., 4th Cir., Nos. 91-2101, 91-2120,
91-2121, 91-2122).

     The "partnerships" solicited by the former televangelist's
organization between 1984-1987 promised benefits that included
annual lodging at PTL's Heritage Village theme park.  Bakker sold
roughly 153,000 partnerships that included lodging benefits,
raising at least $158 million.  The partnerships were oversold;
most of the proposed additional facilities at the park went
unconstructed, and the partnership investments went to PTL's
operating expenses and the support of Bakker's lifestyle.  Most
members never received the promised lodging benefits.  Bakker was
criminally convicted for this conduct.

     A class suit was lodged in late 1987 in the Western District
of North Carolina, naming Bakker; PTL accountants Deloitte,
Haskin & Sells; and various individual PTL principals.  The
complaint was grounded in federal and state securities law,
federal and state RICO, the South Carolina Timeshare Act
("SCTSA"), common law fraud and common law negligence.

     The trial judge granted a directed verdict on the securities
fraud claims, determining the partnership interests not to be
statutory "securities."  The jury determined Bakker to be liable
on the common-law fraud count and found for the defense in all
other respects.

     In overturning the directed verdict on the securities
claims, the Fourth Circuit found that the case turned on the
third inquiry established by SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (U.S. Sup. Ct.
1946) as to whether the partnerships are statutory "investment
contracts, e.g. whether the investment was made "with an
expectation of profits 'solely' from the efforts of others."

     The lower court found that the investors were attracted
solely to acquire lodging, and not for a financial return on the
investment.  The appellate panel noted that PTL's promotional
materials "represented that the value of the privileges lifetime
partners would receive far exceeded the $1,000 LTP purchase
price."  The court found that the defense representations "can be
read to suggest that LTP purchasers would receive an economic
benefit in the form of discounted lodging privileges at PTL
facilities."

     The defense pointed to the testimony of class members who
stated that they purchased with personal use as their primary
motivation; the panel found such evidence "cannot be dispositive
in the face of evidence that the promoter of the scheme in
question marketed the scheme by emphasizing the potential for
profit."

     The appellees contended that the partnerships are not
transferrable, and that the partners could therefore never
realize capital appreciation.  The Fourth Circuit found there to
be record evidence that the partnerships could be transferred on
an annual basis.

     The panel affirmed the dismissal of the claims against
Deloitte, Haskin for aiding and abetting Bakker's alleged federal
securities violations, finding this theory invalidated by the
Supreme Court's 1994 opinion in Central Bank of Denver v. First
Interstate Bank of Denver.  The panel found Central Bank
persuasive, if not dispositive, in affirming the rejection of the
plaintiffs' comparable state counts.

     The panel also agreed that the partnerships were not
"vacation time sharing plans" for the purposes of the state
timeshare act.  The Fourth Circuit found no abuse of discretion
by the court below in denying new trial on either the claims
against the accountants on the aiding and abetting of Bakker's
common-law fraud, or on the plaintiffs' federal and state RICO
claims.

     The plaintiffs had asserted on appeal that the jury was
improperly allowed to decide if Bakker had committed the alleged
RICO predicates.  They argued that Bakker's criminal convictions
collaterally estopped any such debate issue as to whether he had
committed the RICO predicates; the panel found that this argument
had never been proffered below, and was inappropriate here.

     The partners also argued that the RICO jury instructions
were flawed in three respects.  They asserted that the
instructions erroneously referred to RICO predicates as "crimes";
the panel found this to be harmless error, as the trial court at
no time imposed a "beyond reasonable doubt" proof burden.

     The court had instructed the jury that the North Carolina
RICO statute requires proof beyond reasonable doubt.  The
plaintiffs found this proper with respect to Bakker's primary
violation, but erroneous with respect to Deloitte, Haskin's
aiding and abetting of the primary violation.  The panel found
harmless error here as well, because Bakker was exonerated on the
primary violation.

               The plaintiffs lastly challenged the instruction
concerning 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(b).  They contended that the
instruction wrongly required the jury to find that Bakker acquired an
equity ownership in the enterprise.  The court found that, in its
entirety, the instruction ultimately required a finding that Bakker
had "actual day-to-day involvement in the management and operation of
PTL."

     The panel rejected Bakker's appeal on the fraud count, as
well as the attempts of Deloitte, Haskin and Bakker aide David A.
Taggart to recoup their costs from the plaintiffs.

ND CA DISMISSES SECURITIES FRAUD ACTION AGAINST OMNITRITION

     Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong of the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California on July 25 dismissed a
securities action against Omnitrition International Inc. and its
top officials, finding that the company is not an illegal pyramid
sales scheme as alleged by the plaintiffs  (In re Omnitrition
International Inc. Securities Litigation, ND CA, MDL No. 965,
No. C-92-4133-SBA).

     Judge Armstrong granted a motion for summary judgment filed
on May 11 by defendants Omnitrition, Jim Fobair, Roger Daley and
Charles Ragus, holding that the structure of Omnitrition's system
does not lend itself to the definition of an illegal pyramid
scheme.

     "As a threshold matter," the judge said, "the participants
in the company, [Independent Marketing Agents], do not pay money
to obtain sales and/or recruiting rights....  [T]here is no
charge for joining the company.  Once the application is
approved, the participant obtains the right to buy Omnitrition
products at a 20% discount, and the right to sell Omnitrition
products."

     Plaintiffs in this action, individuals who obtained
distributorships with Omnitrition between 1989 and 1992, filed a
complaint against the defendants alleging violations of federal
securities laws, RICO and state fraud laws in the creation,
promotion and marketing of Omnitrition and its distributorships.
Omnitrition allegedly markets a line of health food products.
However, plaintiffs claim that Omnitrition did not engage in or
encourage retail sale of these products.  Rather, plaintiffs
state that Omnitrition actively recruited distributors of the
products, who would in turn be encouraged to recruit more
distributors.

     However, Judge Armstrong said the recruitment of others into
a program does not constitute a pyramid scheme, at least not
until the recruits make any retail sales.

     "More significantly," the judge said, "an IMA does not
obtain the right to earn rewards for recruiting other
participants into the scheme that are unrelated to product sales.
A participant in Omnitrition does not receive any payment or
reward for merely recruiting others into the program.  These new
recruits must make retail sales.  If the recruiter has achieved a
sufficient sales volume to qualify for overrides and/or bonuses,
and the new recruits make retail sales, the recruiter receives a
payment from Omnitrition based upon a percentage of the retail
sales of his downline.

     "Thus," the judge said, "Omnitrition provides rewards for
recruiting participants that are directly related to product
sales.  In fact, the reward is conditional on product sales, and
the amount of the award is based upon the amount of product sales
that occur."

     Judge Armstrong also ruled that the defendants' alleged
misleading statements and omissions are not actionable under the
federal securities laws.  The judge cited the Ninth Circuit's
ruling in In re Apple Computer Sec. Litig., 886 F.2d 1109, 1113
(9th Cir. 1989).  In Apple, the appeals court said that a
projection or statement of belief contains at least three
implicit factual assertions:  (1) that the statement is genuinely
believed, (2) that there is a reasonable basis for that belief
and (3) that the speaker is not aware of any undisclosed facts
tending to seriously undermine the accuracy of the statement.  A
projection or statement of belief may be actionable to the extent
that one of these implied factual assertions is inaccurate.

     "Plaintiffs have challenged every statement [of the
defendants] on the ground that Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme
that was destined to collapse, and that each defendant knew this
to be true," Judge Armstrong said.  "However,...Omnitrition does
not meet the legal definition of an illegal pyramid sales scheme.
Accordingly, plaintiffs' claims that Omnitrition is inherently
destined to collapse are unsupportable.

     "Moreover," the judge said, "defendants have each submitted
declarations in which they maintain that they genuinely believed
and continue to believe that every statement they made is true.
Defendants have therefore met the first prong of the Apple test."

     The judge also noted that each defendant testified that he
had a reasonable basis for believing the statements to be true.
"Plaintiffs have not forwarded any evidence or argument
suggesting that defendants' bases for believing their statements
to be true were unreasonable, thus, defendants have met the
second prong of the Apple test," she said.

     "Finally," the judge said, "plaintiffs have not forwarded
any evidence suggesting that any defendant was aware of
undisclosed facts tending to seriously undermine the accuracy of
each statement.  Thus, the third prong of the Apple test is met."

               In addition, Judge Armstrong found that the
plaintiffs have not sufficiently proven their allegations that the
defendants engaged in RICO predicate acts.  "Plaintiffs maintain that
since they have proven Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme, they need not
prove specific intent," the judge said.  "However,...plaintiffs have
failed to demonstrate or otherwise establish a triable issue of fact
concerning whether Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme.  As there is
otherwise no evidence of specific intent on the part of the
defendants to defraud anyone, plaintiffs' RICO claims are fatally
deficient."

SD NY: BRIBERY ALLEGATIONS DON'T REQUIRE FRCP 9(b) REVIEW

     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern District
of New York on Aug. 17 refused to dismiss the RICO action brought
by CNBC Inc. against a commercial printer that it claims
corrupted an ex-employee into arranging inflated compensation for
the defendants' services.  The judge rejected the defense's
contentions that the alleged predicate acts of commercial bribery
must be pleaded with FRCP 9(b) particularity (CNBC Inc. v.
Alvarado et al., SD NY, No. 93 Civ. 2261 (JFK)).

     The cable programmer alleged that in a period spanning 1989-
1993, Avalon Group Associates Ltd. and its president, Robert
Alvarado Jr., conspired with then-CNBC employee Joyce Gibney to
embezzle from the plaintiff.  Over 1991-1993, Gibney received
some $111,000 in bribes and kickbacks to direct some $3 million
of CNBC business to the defendants, the plaintiff alleged; Gibney
was also supposedly named to Alvarado's will.

     Gibney also purportedly gave the defendants inside
information on CNBC's bidding process; the plaintiff alleged that
this resulted the submission of falsely inflated invoices that
overbilled for over $500,000.  The plaintiff seeks this amount,
plus $100,000 for the loss of Gibney's loyal services and for
compensatory damages, plus an additional $2 million in punitives.
The complaint listed 18 faxed communications as predicate acts of
wire fraud and also claimed the bribery of Gibney as a predicate.

     In rejecting the defense's dismissal motion, the court
rejected Avalon's argument that the bribery allegations must
comport with FRCP 9(b).  The defendants argued that the stricter
standard should apply, because the damage from the alleged
bribery stemmed solely from the fraudulent invoices.
"[P]laintiff," the judge rejoined, "alleges that it was damaged
not only by the invoices, but also by the loss of a loyal
employee."

     The judge found the bribery allegations sufficiently pleaded
under the standard of FRCP 8(a).  The allegations of the fraud
predicates were determined to be sufficient under FRCP 9(b).
While acknowledging that CNBC failed to specify the content of
either the invoices or the faxes, the court noted that the
defendants and Gibney are the only persons with actual knowledge
as to their content.  Noting that the plaintiff will need further
discovery, and had established motive and opportunity for fraud,
the judge refused to dismiss.

     Nathaniel H. Akerman of Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &
Geraldson, New York, represents the plaintiff.

     Arthur J. Golder III of Golder & Golder, Trumansburg, NY,
represents the defendants.

ND IL ALLOWS 1962 (c),(d) CLAIMS AGAINST POWER BUYING CLUB

     U.S. District Judge Harry D. Leinenwebber of the Northern
District of Illinois on Aug. 17 declined to dismiss the RICO
fraud class claims lodged under 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(c) and (d)
by a member of a consumer "power buying" club against the club's
organizers and operators.  The plaintiff's allegations under
Section 1962(a) were dismissed for failure to demonstrate
investment injury (Crawford v. Payne et al., ND IL, No. 93 C
7303).

     Charlie Crawford lodged the instant suit against the
operators of the Combined Purchasing Association Inc. Buyers
Club, which induced memberships by representing that it could
obtain merchandise at substantially below-retail prices.
Memberships were solicited via at-home demonstrations and follow-
up calls; the required membership fee was upwards of $1000.
Crawford alleged that the defendants sought to reap these fees,
while concurrently defeating the efforts of the members to obtain
merchandise at discount prices.

     The plaintiff alleged three separate clusters of defendants:
the individual "designers" who set up the overall enterprise; the
individual "operators" who implemented the scheme on a day-to-day
basis; and corporate defendants that acted in direct concert with
the designers.

     In reviewing the defense's dismissal motion, the judge first
addressed the assertion that Crawford's predicate fraud
allegations failed to plead a scheme to defraud.  The court found
that the tiers of operation alleged by the plaintiff, if proven,
would "constitute an 'elaborate attempt at concealment.'"   The
judge also found the defendants' sales pitches as alleged by the
plaintiffs constituted "specific misrepresentations or half-
truths." He also determined that the allegations demonstrated
scienter and a sufficient link between the alleged fraud and the
use of the mails and wires.

     In rejecting Crawford's 1962(a) count, Judge Leinenwebber
found him to be "in effect...claiming that defendants reinvested
racketeering proceeds into the entities it created to operate the
Buyers Club."  The court cited to the Seventh Circuit's April
ruling in Vicom v. Harbridge Merchant Services (see Civil RICO
LR, April 1994, P. 9,484) for the principle that mere
reinvestment of proceeds, without proximate causation of injury,
is insufficient to create 1962(a) standing.

     The judge denied the defense's attempt to dismiss the
1962(c) count, however.  He found the fraud allegations to be
pleaded with sufficient FRCP 9(b) particularity, noting that
Crawford included a copy of the Buying Club sales pitch
materials, and notified each defendant as to his role in the
alleged fraud.  The court also determined the plaintiff to have
sufficiently identified an enterprise comprised of the three
clusters of defendants.

     Judge Leinenwebber further ruled that Crawford had
sufficiently alleged pattern.  The relationship prong was
satisfied, he found, as each prospective plaintiff was defrauded
by the same misrepresentations.  The judge also noted that the
Buyers' Club's activities are allegedly ongoing, and ruled that
open-ended continuity was therefore established.

     The judge found the conspiracy allegations under 1962(d)
sufficiently pleaded.  He denied the defendants' bid to strike
any claims accruing prior to Dec. 3, 1989 (four years before the
filing of Crawford's suit), as time-barred.

2ND CIR. PROPERLY FOUND NO DAMAGES, MILKENS ARGUE TO HIGH COURT

     Michael and Lowell Milken on Aug. 17 responded to the
certiorari petition lodged by investors in the restructuring of
Ivan Boesky & Co. whose federal securities and RICO claims were
denied by the Second Circuit, arguing that the appellate panel
was correct in finding the petitioners "had no damages in light
of their 100% recoupment (plus a profit)" (Commercial Union
Assurance Co. et al. v. Milken et al., U.S. Sup. Ct., No. 94-
153).

     In 1986, the plaintiff investors bought $10.5 million worth
of partnership interests in Ivan F. Boesky & Co., L.P.  The
plaintiffs opted into the March 1987 lawsuit against Boesky and
debt underwriter Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; that suit was
amended in 1989 to name the Milkens, who had worked with Boesky
on the reorganization as principals of DBL, as defendants.

     After the respondents were brought into suit, the investors
began to cash distributions from Boesky & Co.'s liquidation
trustee.  By April 1992, the petitioners had received
distributions totaling $12.047 million, or over 114% of their
original investment.  The petitioners opted out of the March 1992
global settlement that the Milkens arranged with Boesky
investors, and brought an amended complaint against the
respondents.

               The Milkens obtained summary judgment from the Southern
District of New York in May 1993.  The trial court's finding of
failure to plead compensable damages was affirmed last March by
the Second Circuit, which wrote that "damages as compensation
under RICO Section 1964(c) for injury to property must, under the
familiar rule of law, place appellants in the same position they
would have been but for the illegal conduct.  Here, appellants
have already been placed in that position."

     The investors asked for certiorari on July 15, arguing that
the Second Circuit in effect resuscitated the "racketeering
injury" requirement rejected by the high court in Sedima v. Imrex
Co.  The petitioners asserted that under such reasoning, a RICO
claim for mail, wire or securities fraud "will not ripen until
all or part of its underlying investment is proved worthless and
its damages are finally determined to be uncollectible."

     In their response brief, the Milkens argued that the
appellate panel's ruling "is fully consistent with the precedents
of this Court and other circuits, and raises no question of
constitutional magnitude or national importance."

     The respondents asserted that Sedima was "simply irrelevant"
in the instant context.  "[T]he Sedima majority emphasized that a
RICO plaintiff 'can only recover to the extent that he has been
injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting
the violation [emphasis added]," they argued.  "[P]etitioners
suffered no injury in their business or property, whether caused
by the Milkens' alleged predicate acts or otherwise."

     The Milkens further deemed the investors' uncertainty of
accrual argument "a red herring.  The decision below did not even
reach the issue of when petitioners' purported RICO claim
accrued, much less the standard stated by petitioners."  The
respondents also rejected the petitioners' reliance on antitrust
precedent that holds a plaintiff damaged even when capital is
recovered.  Those cases, the Milkens argue, involve plaintiffs
that passed their overcharges along to their clients;
"Petitioners here did not recover their alleged losses by
'passing them on' to someone else."

     The Milkens further argued that the investors' bid for
attorneys' fees was never before the courts below, and improperly
raised on appeal.  The respondents asserted that the petitioners
were otherwise unentitled to fees, as they did not suffer a RICO
injury.

     Mark A. Belnick, David L. Kornblau and Steven Pacht of Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, New York, submitted the
response on behalf of Michael Milken.  Michael O. Finkelstein of
Lord, Day & Lord, Barrett Smith, New York, submitted the response
on behalf of Lowell Milken.

     George D. Reycraft and Debra Brown Steinberg of Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft, New York, represent the petitioners.

SD NY: FRAUD SUIT AGAINST NY BLUES BARRED BY FILED RATE DOCTRINE

     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern District
of New York on Aug. 17 dismissed the RICO counts raised by two
health insurance purchasers against Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield
of New York for allegedly submitting fraudulent applications for
rate increases to the state insurance department ("NYSID") over
1990-1993, determining the alleged claims to be barred by the
filed rate doctrine (Fersco et al. v. Empire Blue Cross/Blue
Shield of New York et al., SD NY, No. 93 Civ. 4226 (JFK)).

     In the years at issue, Judge Keenan noted, the defendants
obtained rate increases of no less than 13.7% and as much as
25.5%.  The plaintiffs asserted that Empire obtained these
increases through "an intentional scheme of deception and
misrepresentation."  Empire, they alleged, exaggerated its
community-rated losses, understated its experience-rated losses
and exaggerated the impact of competition from large commercial
carriers in its filings with state regulators.

     In granting the defense's bid for summary judgment, Judge
Keenan looked to the Second Circuit's May ruling in Wegoland Ltd.
v. NYNEX Corp. (see Civil RICO LR, May 1994, P. 9,578) in finding
the claims barred.  "There is no dispute that Empire is a
regulated utility whose rates must be approved by a governing
regulatory agency, the NYSID," he noted.

     The plaintiffs' fraud allegations were "of little import,"
the judge found, as Wegoland v. NYNEX expressly rejected a fraud
exception to the filed rate doctrine.  The plaintiffs asserted
that they did not ask the court to engage in the rate-making
process, but only to ascertain whether the increases should have
been granted at all.  The court rejoined that it could not
determine "either the pervasiveness of the fraud or the
reasonableness of the rates existing prior to the increase
without a thorough understanding of the factors involved in
ascertaining a reasonable rate."

     The judge rejected the plaintiffs' citation to County of
Suffolk v. LILCO (2nd Cir. 1990), noting that the Wegoland panel
expressly rejected the earlier ruling as a bar to the filed rate
doctrine in RICO suits against utilities.  He concluded that the
plaintiffs "must pursue their claims through 'the proper
government officials,' who may challenge these rates 'in
appropriate circumstances.'"

NY JUDGE APPROVES $100M SETTLEMENT IN SALOMON BROTHERS ACTION

     Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. of the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York on Aug. 5 approved a
$100 million settlement of claims in the Salomon Brothers
Treasury Litigation (In re Salomon Brothers Treasury Litigation,
SD NY, No. 91 Civ. 5471 [RPP]; see Civil RICO LR, March 1994,
P. 9,410).

     The defendants in the case include Salomon Brothers Inc.,
Steinhardt Management Co. Inc. and Caxton Corp.

     The suit was filed by investors who were allegedly injured
by defendants' (1) rigging the bids in auctions of Treasury two-
year notes conducted in April, May and June of 1991 and
(2) engaging in a squeeze on the market for those securities from
April 1991 to September 1991 in violation of Sections 10(b) and
20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sherman Act, the
Commodity Exchange Act and RICO.

     Under the terms of the agreement, Salomon will contribute
$66 million to the settlement fund; Steinhardt Management and
Caxton will pay the remaining $34 million.  The judge also
awarded the plaintiffs $25 million in attorneys' fees.

     Representing the plaintiffs are Stanley M. Grossman of
Pomerantz Haudek Block & Grossman and Jules Brody of Stull, Stull
& Brody.  Counsel for Salomon is Cravath, Swaine & Moore;
representing Steinhardt Management is Schulte Roth & Zabel; and
counsel for Caxton is Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.  All of the
above firms are located in New York City.

11TH CIR.: INTRODUCING BROKER, AGENT CANNOT COMPEL ARBITRATION

     An introducing broker/dealer and its agent were not third-
party beneficiaries of an arbitration agreement between the
plaintiff and a clearing broker and, therefore, cannot compel
arbitration of the plaintiff's securities, racketeering, common
law fraud, breach of fiduciary obligation and, under the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act, negligence and conspiracy
claims against them, said the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
on Aug. 19 (Taylor v. Investors Associates, Inc., et al., 11th
Cir., No. 93-5049).

               The panel said that the defendants did not qualify as
third party beneficiaries because an intent to benefit them was not
apparent from the construction of the arbitration agreement "in light
of all surrounding circumstances."

     According to court documents, co-defendant Mitchell
Goldberg, as agent for co-defendant Investors Associates, Inc.
(IAI), solicited plaintiff Don Taylor to buy and sell stock from
IAI.  On Jan. 6, 1992, Taylor purchased stock through IAI and,
the next day, signed a client's agreement with Prudential-Bache
Securities, which was to serve as clearing broker in the trading
arrangement.

     Taylor subsequently filed suit against IAI and Goldberg,
alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934; Rule 10(b)(5); Section 12(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933; RICO; Texas Blue Sky Law; Texas Business and Commerce
Code; and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act.  The
defendants moved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration or
dismiss the action.

     The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
concluded that the defendants could not compel arbitration, and
the appeals court panel affirmed in a per curiam opinion, which
adopted the trial court's decision.

     In his opinion below, U.S. District Judge William Justice
first noted that the arbitration clause did not mention IAI or
Goldberg by name or function, nor did those parties sign the
document.  Judge Justice rejected the defendants' contention that
they were included as parties to the pact through the use of
"you" (referring to Prudential) in the client's agreement,
because IAI allegedly supplied Taylor with the agreement.

     Second, Judge Justice said that the intent of the parties to
the arbitration agreement was manifest -- to arbitrate claims by
or against the clearing house concerning its handling of Taylor's
account.  In addition, a letter from Prudential, explaining that
it was not Taylor's broker, but his broker's clearing firm, makes
it clear that the defendants were independent from Prudential,
said the judge.

     Third, the defendants cannot rely on agency principles to
support their argument that they are entitled to enforce the
arbitration agreement, said the court.  Unlike the fact
situations in the cases cited by the defendants, here, the
disputed transaction did not involve the liquidation of stock
whereby the clearing house's services were employed, which might
make the clearing house a party to the suit, Judge Justice noted.
No claims in the suit pertain to Prudential's or Taylor's
accounts there, he said, and, hence, there was no contingent
right for the introducing broker to invoke the arbitration
agreement.

               Finally, with respect to the defendants' third-party
beneficiary argument, the defendants are not mentioned in the
arbitration agreement and no consent to arbitration with Goldberg
or IAI may be implied based solely on the relationship between
the introducing broker and the clearing house, said the court.

DE HIGH CT. SAYS APPRAISAL
RIGHTLY BARRED IN WRITTEN
CONSENT TIME WARNER MERGER

     If the "market out" exception would otherwise apply, the
fact that a merger is accomplished through the use of written
consents instead of a shareholder meeting is irrelevant, so an
objecting shareholder had no appraisal rights when he dissented
from the much litigated merger of Warner Communications, Inc.
into Time Warner Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court decided Dec. 18
in an issue of first impression.  Klotz v. Warner Communications,
Inc. et al., No. 222-95, (DE Sup. Ct.); see Corporate Officers &
Directors LR, June 7, 1995.

     The high court panel disagreed with the dissenting
shareholder's argument that equated merger by written approval
with short-form mergers under Section 253 of the Delaware General
Corporate Law.

     After the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of
Paramount Communications, Inc.'s challenge to the Time-Warner
deal, the merger was accomplished in a two-step process:  first,
Time purchased 100 million shares of Warner common stock to give
Time Warner, Inc. " as Time was then renamed " a 59.3% control of
Warner's outstanding shares.  Warner and Time Warner then
approved a merger agreement by written consent without a meeting
of the stockholders, who were informed that they were not
entitled to appraisal rights under the "market out" exception to
Section 262(b)(1) of the DGCL.

     Plaintiff Howard Klotz filed suit claiming that that
instruction is misleading since mergers approved by written
consent cannot fall within the market out exception.  According
to Klotz's reading of the statute, stockholders are entitled to
vote at the shareholders' meeting to act upon the agreement, or
else they get appraisal rights.  He said the procedure for
perfecting appraisal rights assumes that mergers approved by
written consent always trigger appraisal rights.

     The court agreed with defendant Warner's contention that the
entire lawsuit relies on a strained reading of Section 262 that
cannot be reconciled with the plain meaning for the statutory
language.  "Section 262(b)(1) denies appraisal rights for shares
of 'stock, which, at the record date fixed to determine the
stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the
meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were traded in a public market,'" the court wrote.
"An action taken by written consent has a record date, which can
substitute for the stockholders meeting for purposes of Section
262(b)(1)."

     Section 262(b) unambiguously describes two circumstances
under which the market out exception does not apply, the court
said.  "First, Section 262 restores appraisal rights denied by
Section 262(b)(1) when stockholders receive consideration that
does not meet the requirements enumerated in Section Section
262(b)(2)(a)-(d).  Second, Section 262(b)(3) assures appraisal
rights to shares not owned by the parent corporation in all
mergers pursuant to 8 Del.C. Section 253."

     On appeal to the state Supreme Court, a panel led by Justice
Joseph Walsh agreed with the lower court's reasoning.  Justice
Walsh noted that the structure of the applicable subsection of
Section 262 places the market out exceptions in separate
paragraphs.  "Had the drafters intended to provide an additional
exception, they likely would have also included it in a separate
paragraph," but "...the exception proposed by Klotz is in the
same sentence which defines the market out."

     The panel was not persuaded by Klotz's argument equating
short-form mergers under Section 253 of the DGCL with mergers by
written approval.  "The General Assembly provided in an
additional paragraph that shareholders of a company that was
merged pursuant to Section 253 are entitled to appraisal," but
"despite other similarities between the short-form merger
procedure and merger approval by written consent, the lack of
such a paragraph granting appraisal in the latter circumstance is
a crucial difference," Justice Walsh wrote.

     Finally, no policy objectives would be served by adopting
Klotz's interpretation, the panel held.

     The plaintiff is represented by Pamela Tikellis of
Chimicles, Jacobsen & Tikellis in Wilmington, and by Daniel
Krasner and Edward Dietrich of Wolf, Haldenstein, Adler, Freeman
& Herz in New York City.

     Defendants are represented by Charles Richards Jr. and

OFFICERS OF FAILED
CA THRIFT AGREE TO PAY
$8.5 MILLION RESTITUTION

               The former owner, president and chairman of the board of a
failed California thrift and his wife, a former executive and
board member of the institution, have paid $8.5 million in
restitution and have been prohibited from working for any
federally insured banking institution, the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) announced on Dec. 18.  In the Matter of Russell
M. Jedinak and In the Matter of Rebecca Manley Jedinak, Nos. SF-
95-023 and SF-95-024 (OTS).

     Russell and Rebecca Jedinak, the former officials of failed
Guardian Savings and Loan in Huntington Beach, CA, agreed to the
restitution in consent orders with OTS and a concurrently
executed settlement agreement with the Resolution Trust Corp.
(RTC).  The couple paid the $8.5 million restitution to the RTC
as receiver for Guardian.

     OTS accused the two of multiple offenses including breach of
duty, conflict of interest, unsafe and unsound conduct that
caused substantial loss to the thrift, and violation of banking
laws and regulations.  In consenting to the orders, the Jedinaks
neither admitted nor denied the OTS charges.

     Guardian, with assets of $682 million, was placed in
conservatorship in June 1991 and subsequently into receivership
six months later.  The Jedinaks were removed from their positions
with the institution under the terms of a 1991 cease and desist
consent order.

     The OTS accused the Jedinaks of violating their fiduciary
duty by having the thrift provide them with credit at no interest
or at artificially low interest rates.  The OTS said the breach
of duty allegations extended to a number of personal trips the
Jedinaks billed the thrift for as well as the cost of maintaining
their personal property.

     In addition, the OTS said the Jedinaks did not adequately
underwrite the origination and modification of several large real
estate loans, causing a substantial loss to Guardian.  The
Jedinaks also personally benefited from several loans, the OTS
said.

     The OTS further claimed that the Jedinaks did not have
Guardian provide a reserve for certain loan losses and failed to
perform due diligence on certain asset acquisitions and
commercial loans.  The OTS also claimed that the Jedinaks had
Guardian pay an unauthorized dividend that was unsafe and unsound
and then had the thrift misreport its financial condition in its
books and records.

ONLY TRUSTEE CAN ASSERT
ALTER EGO CLAIMS AGAINST
PRINCIPALS, SAYS NC COURT

               A creditor cannot pursue alter ego claims against a debtor's
alleged controllers unless the bankruptcy trustee has abandoned
the claims, a federal judge in North Carolina held Nov. 30,
dismissing derivative charges of unfair and deceptive trade
practices against third parties who allegedly controlled a
bankrupt corporation to avoid personal liability.
Trans-Continental Meats Inc. v. Shaw Food Services Inc. et al.,
No. 5:94-CV-875-BO (ED NC).

     The right to sue the defendants under an alter ego theory
vests exclusively in the trustee, not in a creditor, where state
law provides that such a claim belongs to a debtor corporation,
the judge said.

     North/South Meatpackers Inc. bought products from
Trans-Continental Meats but failed to pay for them.  An
involuntary Chapter 7 petition was filed against North/South in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina.  Trans-Continental then filed a U.S. District Court
complaint against four individuals and three companies that
allegedly controlled North/South.  The defendants moved to
dismiss for lack of standing.

     Judge Terrence W. Boyle granted the defense motion and said
Trans-Continental cannot reassert its claims unless they are
abandoned by North/South's trustee.

     The right to sue the defendants under an alter ego theory
vests exclusively in the trustee, not in a creditor, where state
law provides that such a claim belongs to a debtor corporation,
Judge Boyle said.  In this case, the trustee has decided to
pursue the claims through an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy
court, he noted.

     In addition, he said, an identity-type alter ego action
arises from general injury to the creditors of a corporation that
lacks a separate and distinct corporate identity and operates as
a mere shell.  Nor was there an allegation that the defendants
used North/South as an instrument to defraud Trans-Continental in
particular, he said, even if North/South was undercapitalized and
controlled by the defendants to avoid liability.

     As a result, he said, Trans-Continental's claims are deemed
assets of the debtor's estate and subject to an automatic stay.

TN CT. WILL NOT REHEAR
DECISION ON AMENDMENT TO
SUIT AGAINST EX-DIRECTORS

     In a Dec. 1 ruling, the Tennessee Court of Appeals rejected
the plea of the ex-directors of a defunct insurance group to
reconsider its decision that the Tennessee Insurance
Commissioner's breach of duty charges against them should not
have been dismissed without leave to amend the complaint.  United
Physicians Insurance Risk Retention Group v. Belisomo et al.,
No. 01-A-01-9595-CH-00189 (TN Ct. App.).

     The ex-directors unsuccessfully argued that the appellate
panel permitted the addition of a bad faith allegation to a cause
of action whose summary dismissal it has affirmed and added
issues and defendants after substantial discovery had been
completed.

     The action was brought by the office of the Tennessee
Commissioner of Commerce and Insurance as liquidator/receiver for
United Physicians Insurance Risk Retention Group to recover
damages allegedly suffered by the company as a result of
misconduct by the defendant directors.  The original complaint
filed in June 1993 charged that each of the defendant-appellees "
John Fuhrman, Allan Gibofsky, Richard Goodman, Claude Moorman,
Stewart Reuter, Daniel Shirey, Donald O'Sullivan, Richard Tyler,
Michael Victor and Cyril Wecht " breached a fiduciary duty by
abdicating their authority to the executive committee.

     The trial court granted the appellee directors summary
judgment after finding that plaintiff's second amended complaint
did not allege a breach of duty against them.

     The appellate panel said the allegation that appellees
delegated powers to an executive committee that may have
committed acts of disloyalty does not assert disloyalty on the
part of appellees; therefore, the complaint was properly
dismissed.

     However, as to the denial of the motion to file an amended
complaint with specific charges of how the directors profited
from their actions allegedly to the detriment of the company, the
appellate court said it "takes judicial knowledge that an outside
receiver of a corporation is at a distinct disadvantage in
efforts to discover the causes of insolvency including the search
of voluminous records and extensive discovery."  The order
denying leave to file an amended complaint was vacated.

     The ex-directors sought rehearing of the panel's decision to
allow the filing of an amended complaint on grounds that the
panel's opinion (1) incorrectly states the material facts
established by the evidence; (2) is in conflict with prior
decisions and other principles of law; (3) overlooks or
misapprehends a material fact or proposition of law; and
(4) relies upon matters of fact and law upon which the parties
have not been heard and that are open to reasonable dispute.

     The proposed amended complaint that the panel allowed to be
filed contains additional allegations that were not the subject
of the court's opinion, including a charge of bad faith stemming
from the breach of duty charge, which the panel previously ruled
was properly disposed of on summary judgment, the ex-board
members contend.  The opinion could permit plaintiff to present
new allegations against new defendants and would necessitate the
reopening of discovery, appellees aver.

     The appellees also took issue with the panel's
characterization of the Insurance Commissioner as being at a
disadvantage in discovering the causes of the defunct
corporation's insolvency.

     "Indeed, the various pleadings in the record reflect that
appellant has had not only the resources of the Tennessee
Department of Commerce and Insurance, but also the legal services
of two outside law firms from the outset," the ex-directors
maintained.  "Here, whether or not 'an outside receiver of a
corporation is at a distinct disadvantage in efforts to discover
the causes of insolvency'...are not, as required for judicial
notice, facts so universally known, of such universal notoriety,
and so generally understood that they are within the common
knowledge of every person."

     The panel's ruling on rehearing made minor changes in the
Oct. 13 opinion but declined to reconsider the decision.

     Plaintiffs are represented by William Hubbard and Brenner
Van Meter of Weed, Hubbard, Berry & Douchty in Nashville.

     Defendant appellees are represented by Aubrey Harwell Jr.,
D. Anne Davis and John Beiter of Neal & Harwell in Nashville.

CT.: CO. INFO COMPILED BY
ATTY. WHO WASN'T COUNSEL
NOT PROTECTED BY PRIVILEGE

     Corporate documents that were prepared by an attorney who
was not acting as the company's counsel in anticipation of
litigation are not protected by the attorney-client or work
product privileges, said Vice Chancellor Myron Steele in a
Dec. 15 ruling in Delaware Chancery Court.  Lee v. Engle,
No. 13323 (DE Ch. Ct.); Frank v. Engle, No. 13284 (DE Ch. Ct.)

     The memorandum opinion granted the discovery requests of the
shareholder derivative plaintiffs and rejected the defendant
directors' attempted use of the Illinois accountant-client
privilege, but it found no reason to compel the production of
draft versions of documents that were later filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

     Richard Frank and Robert Lee brought separate actions
against certain officers and directors of several corporations
related to what is now Sunstates Corp., alleging waste of
corporate assets and breach of duty.  (Frank's action also
charged failure to pay dividends and violations of disclosure
duty with regard to a proxy statement.)  The court consolidated
the suits for discovery dispute purposes.

     In deciding plaintiffs' motion to compel production of
documents withheld on the basis of privilege, the vice chancellor
said the chancery court has followed the reasoning of Garner v.
Wolfinbarger, 430 F.2d 1093 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401
U.S. 974 (1971), which implies a three-part test to decide
whether the attorney-client privilege should be invoked:  (1) the
nature and colorableness of the claim, (2) the necessity of and
alternate access to the information, and (3) the extent to which
the information is identified.

     In this case, although much of the disputed information was
generated by Sunstates' secretary and vice president " who is an
attorney " he was not the in-house counsel and was not acting as
legal counsel to Sunstates.  "Therefore, he cannot avail himself
of the protection associated with the attorney-client or the work
product privilege," the court held.  However, the court added
that even assuming that the officer acted as the company counsel,
"[p]laintiffs have shown good cause necessitating production of
certain withheld documents.  First, plaintiffs are minority
shareholders of Sunstates seeking information related to
transactions they challenge as breaches of fiduciary
responsibility."

     Second, the court said, "[t]he withheld documents may lead
to the discovery of information relevant to the transactions
plaintiffs contest as breaches of fiduciary duty.  Furthermore,
these documents may be the best evidence of the facts they
contain which otherwise would be unavailable from any other
practical source," the court wrote.  "Third, the record does not
leave me with the impression plaintiffs' request for document
production constitutes a blind 'fishing expedition.'"

     As to defendants' attempt to use the Illinois accountant-
client privilege to protect some of the documents, the court
noted that "Delaware does not recognize the accountant-client
privilege; nor do the Federal Courts....  Nevertheless,
defendants argue this court should apply Illinois law...because
Illinois is the state with the most significant relationship to
the communications in issue.  I disagree."

     Sunstates knowingly incorporated in Delaware, which
"...constitutes a knowing and voluntary request for the widely
recognized benefits and advantages flowing from the application
of Delaware general corporate law...," the court pointed out.
"Besides, Illinois' only connection with Sunstates is that
Illinois accountants originally generated or received the
documents defendants want to protect," it added.

     However, the court found no reason to compel draft versions
of disclosure documents that the company intended for public
disclosure.

               The Frank plaintiffs are represented by Kevin Gross of
Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess and Robert Goldberg of Biggs
& Battaglia, both in Wilmington.  The Lee plaintiffs are
represented by Stephen Lowey and Sherrie Brown of Lowey,

DEMAND EXCUSED BY MAJORITY
HOLDER'S INFLUENCE ON
BOARD MEMBER, SAYS DE CT.

     A shareholder plaintiff was excused from making pre-suit
demand on the board of York Research Corp. by a Delaware state
court judge who on Dec. 4 found that a majority of the board
lacked independence due to a dominant director/shareholder's
ability to exert "considerable influence" over a swing vote
director.  Friedman v. Beningson et al., No. 12232 (DE Ch. Ct.).

     In his memorandum opinion, Chancellor William T. Allen
rejected a motion to dismiss breach of duty and insider trading
charges from Delaware Chancery Court, finding that in order to
allege lack of independence, it was not necessary to show that
the swing vote director's continued employment and remuneration
hinged solely on the whim of the controlling director.

     At issue in the derivative suit by Irving Friedman was the
decision of York Research Corp. " a Delaware company that
develops, constructs and operates co-generation power plants " to
issue interest-free loans to several of its directors and
officers so that they could buy large blocks of stock in the
company.  According to the complaint, the directors and officers
then made false statements regarding revenue growth and future
business prospects to inflate York's stock price and sold their
shares before announcing that revenues would be significantly
below projections.

     Friedman alleged that the defendant officers and directors
not only misused corporate office but cost the company a $500,000
settlement used to obtain the dismissal of shareholder securities
suits in federal court in New York City.

     After the suit was amended, defendants in July 1993 moved to
dismiss it for failure to make demand on the board before
initiating the action.  Friedman contended that he was excused
from making pre-suit demand because the majority of the three
board members lacked both independence and disinterest.  He said
defendant York director/president Robert Beningson was the
mastermind of the interest-free loan and insider trading scheme
and that he exerted a controlling interest over board member John
Ellis through his control of his remuneration.

     The court said it need only address the first prong of the
two-prong test used in Aronson v. Lewis, DE Sup. 473 A.2d 805,
814 (1984), i.e., whether plaintiff has alleged particularized
facts creating a reasonable doubt whether those directors could,
under the circumstances, exercise a judgment on the suit and
demand that would qualify for the deference of the business
judgment rule.

     "This inquiry may include the subject whether some or all
directors are 'beholden' to or under the control, domination or
strong influence of a party with a material financial interest in
the transaction under attack, which interest is adverse to that
of the corporation," the court wrote.  "Such circumstances alone
may sometimes raise a reasonable doubt that directors in such a
situation could exercise judgment on behalf of the corporation
concerning the transaction involving such dominant or influential
party."

     The court noted that the state Supreme Court held in Rales
v. Blasband, DE Sup. 634 A.2d 927, 936 (1993), that "although the
director/officer's continued employment and remuneration did not
hinge solely on his relations with the defendant directors, the
official authority of the defendant directors 'placed them in a
position to exert considerable influence over the director
officer.'"  Ellis's continued receipt of consulting fees,
"...when considered in the context of the other facts alleged,
represents a substantial interest subject to possible corporate
retribution had he exercised judgment in a way displeasing to the
financially interested shareholder/CEO," the court concluded.

     The court also noted that Beningson's ties to York's
principal client empower him in relation to the other directors,
"...since they must remain cognizant of and sensitive to his
ability to affect York's business prospects."  The chancellor
also noted (1) the size of the loans " the loan to Beningson was
greater than the company's net revenue that year; and (2) York's
settlement of the federal class actions without any director
contribution, despite the profits earned by Beningson.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Joseph Rosenthal and John Day
of Rosenthal, Monhait, Gross & Goddess in Wilmington; and Ronald
Futterman and Michael Behn of Futterman & Howard, Chtd. in
Chicago.

     Defendants are represented by Richard Elliot Jr. and Thomas
Beck of Richards, Layton & Finger in Wilmington; and Roger
Waldman and Philip Zimmerman of Moses & Singer in New York City.

6TH CIR. REINSTATES SUIT
DESPITE FAILURE TO PRODUCE
OFFICER FOR DISCOVERY

     The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 reinstated
a breach of contract complaint although the plaintiff repeatedly
failed to produce an officer for depositions.  Roots Contracting
and Trading Co. v. Creighton Ltd. et al., No. 94-5752 (6th Cir.).

     The panel said if the suit is again dismissed, the trial
court must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other
reasons to support the inference that Roots engaged in a course
of conduct to evade deposition and it must explain why lesser
sanctions were rejected.

     Roots Contracting and Trading, a Qatari limited liability
company, contracted for a joint venture with Creighton Ltd., a
Cayman Islands corporation headquartered in Nashville, to build a
government-sponsored hospital in Qatar.  The Qatari government
terminated the construction contract due to Creighton's work
deficiencies and delays.

     Roots sued Creighton and other defendants in the Middle
District of Tennessee for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,
dissolution of the joint venture, breach of contract and an
accounting.

     During the Persian Gulf War, two codefendants noticed the
Nashville deposition of Abdullah Hamad Al-Attiyah, who chaired
Roots' board of directors and served as managing agent.  At the
time, Al-Attiyah was chief of the cabinet of the Qatari Interior
Ministry.

     Roots opposed the deposition, contending Al-Attiyah was
merely a passive minority shareholder who performed no managerial
duties, received no salary and knew nothing about the company's
business operations; Roots also said its general manager, who was
deposed, had the same knowledge as Al-Attiyah about the hospital
project.  However, the defendants offered evidence Al-Attiyah was
a policy maker and an operational factor in Roots.

     Al-Attiyah failed repeatedly to appear.  Roots argued that
the Qatari interior minister had refused to allow him to leave
the country; meanwhile, he rose to become minister of energy and
industry and president of OPEC.  Ultimately, Chief Judge John T.
Nixon granted a defense motion to dismiss the complaint as a
discovery sanction.

     The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded in a per curiam
opinion.  Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize
dismissal as a sanction for the refusal of an officer, director
or managing agent to provide discovery, this particular dismissal
was an abuse of discretion, the panel held.  Judge Nixon failed
to articulate sufficient findings of fact to justify the
sanction, it said.

     If Judge Nixon again dismisses the complaint on remand, he
must provide findings as to willfulness, bad faith or other
reasons for Roots' failure to produce Al-Attiyah to support the
inference that Roots engaged in a course of conduct to evade
deposition.  Those findings also should explain why lesser
sanctions were rejected, it said.  In addition, it said there
should be findings as to how the defendants would be prejudiced
if they cannot depose Al-Attiyah in Nashville.

HYPERION TRUST INVESTORS
URGE SECOND CIRCUIT
TO REINSTATE THEIR SUIT

     The plaintiffs in the Hyperion Securities Litigation argued
to the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Oct. 23 that the
district court erred in dismissing their suit over investment
losses involving the Hyperion Trusts.  In re Hyperion Securities
Litigation, No. 93 Civ. 7179 (SD NY); see Corporate Officers &
Directors Liability LR, Oct. 4, 1995.

     T111plaintiffs, Marilyn Olkey and others, labeled as
"without foundation" the district court's holding that, as a
matter of law, the interest rate bias and risks to capital posed
by the Trusts' investment strategy were adequately disclosed.
The plaintiffs said the court focused "upon fragmented and
isolated statements to reach that conclusion" and "completely
discounted as mere 'expectations' defendants' repeated
representations that they would design 'balanced' portfolios."
The court ignored the crucial fact that the defendants never made
such an effort, even though the prospectuses stated clearly that
each Trust "has designed the initial composition of the Trust
portfolio and will manage the portfolio on an ongoing basis in an
attempt to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on
the net asset value of the portfolio."

     This and similar representations of a balanced portfolio
were made through each prospectus, the plaintiffs said, but the
district court completely ignored the fact that investors
bargained for one thing but received something quite different.
The plaintiff said the court ignored its duty under McMahan & Co.
v. Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., 900 F.2d 576 (2nd Cir. 1990,
cert. denied, 1991)[see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Oct.
4, 1995, 18,274) to read the prospectus as a whole.  The court
also disregarded its obligation to construe the complaint in the
manner most favorable to the plaintiffs, they said.

     The plaintiffs contended:  "In fact, the court drew all
inferences, however strained, in defendants' favor.  The court
wound up with a conclusion that lacked any real world
sensibility:  investors knowingly invested in a low yield, high
risk investment."

     The plaintiffs further argued that the various authorities
relied on by the district court provide no support for its
decision.  "The 'bespeaks caution' doctrine mentioned by the
court is only a new label for describing what a reasonable
investor should have understood based upon the representations
made," the plaintiffs said.  Moreover, they said, the decisions
cited by the district court involve fact patterns far removed
from this one.  Here, the plaintiffs said, conservative risk-
adverse investors were told repeatedly that there would be an
attempt to balance the portfolio to attempt to neutralize the
impact on capital of movements in interest rates.  In fact, they
said, no such effort was made, and as a result, the defendants
"destroyed much of the capital that had been placed with them."

     The plaintiffs claim to have lost more than $325 million as
a result of putting their money in securities offered by three
closed-end investment companies known as the Hyperion Trusts.
The Trusts' assets consisted of zero coupon securities,
collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed
securities.  The defendants include the three Trusts; Hyperion
Capital Management (HCM), which served as investment advisor and
administrator for the Trusts; individuals who were officers and
directors of the Trusts and of Hyperion Capital; and nine
underwriters that participated in the Hyperion offerings.

     The district court ruled on July 12 that the plaintiffs have
no case because the offering materials disclosed both the Trusts'
investment strategy and the attendant risk.  The second amended
complaint was dismissed without leave to replead.

     The three defendant Trusts and four individual defendants "
Rodman L. Drake, Garth Marston, Harry E. Petersen Jr. and Leo M.
Walsh Jr. (collectively the Trust Defendants) " told the court in
a Nov. 30 appellee brief that the plaintiffs have "no facts at
all" that would warrant their "conclusory allegation" that the
Trust managers, instead of constructing and managing each
portfolio so as to minimize the impact of changes in interest
rates on the net asset value, intended to construct portfolios
that would do well when interest rates rose and do disastrously
when interest rates fell.  The lack of a factual basis to support
this contention, the Trust Defendants said, renders the
plaintiffs' pleading deficient under First Nationwide Bank v.
Gelt Funding Corp., 27 F.3d 763 (2nd Cir. 1994, cert. denied,
1995).  In addition, the Trust Defendants said, the assertion is
"inherently implausible."

     The Trust Defendants said the plaintiffs' assertion is based
on the opinion of experts who looked at the list of securities in
the initial Trust portfolios.  "What methodology these experts
used to arrive at this conclusion, and what assumptions may have
been, are matters that plaintiffs have steadfastly refused to
disclose," the Trust Defendants said.

     The Trust Defendants argued:  "The fact is that the task
plaintiffs claim their experts have performed " divining the
Trust managers' long-term investment objectives from a scan of
the first day's list of securities " is not capable of being
done.  The initial securities list could change the next day or
minute.  Indeed, the prospectuses themselves made painstakingly
clear that the managers would restructure the portfolios as often
as necessary to react to changing economic conditions."

     As for the plaintiffs' reliance on a Hyperion 1999 semi-
annual report statement that the initial portfolio was designed
"with a bias toward a rising interest rate environment," "the
fact is," the Trust Defendants said, "that the Hyperion 1999
prospectus (as well as the [Hyperion] 1997 and 2002 prospectuses)
stated the same proposition."

     The Trust Defendants said the plaintiffs' contention that
the Trust prospectuses failed adequately to warn investors of
possible capital losses "is simply divorced from the reality of
these prospectuses, which issued such warnings again and again."

     Hyperion Capital Management and five individual defendants "
Lewis S. Ranieri, Kenneth C. Weiss, David R. Odenath Jr.,
Patricia Sloan and Alan M. Mandel (collectively the HCM
Defendants) " argued to the court in an appellee brief also filed
Nov. 30 that since the outset of this putative class action, the
plaintiffs have drafted innumerable complaints, all in search of
a viable securities law claim.  The plaintiffs' quest, the HCM
Defendants said, has been stymied by one major obstacle: the
plaintiffs cannot identify a material misrepresentation by the
defendants because the prospectus for each trust disclosed every
risk that the plaintiffs have asserted as the basis for their
claims.

     "Moreover," the HCM Defendants said, "the prospectuses
described those risks with clarity in the very circumstances that
came to pass: a substantial decrease in interest rates that
triggered a large volume of mortgage prepayments."

     The Underwriter Defendants argued in a brief, also filed
Nov. 30, that the district court properly held that the
prospectuses fully disclosed all the relevant risks of investing
in the Hyperion funds.

     The Underwriters stated:  "Plaintiffs also complain of the
selection and management of the Hyperion Funds' investment
portfolios subsequent to their initial public offerings.  As a
matter of law the Underwriter Defendants bear no responsibility
for the manner in which the Funds' post-offering portfolios were
designed and managed after the initial public offerings; whatever
continuing responsibilities there were belonged to the Funds,
their managements and advisors after they obtained the proceeds
from the initial public offerings."

     The Underwriter Defendants are Smith Barney Inc.; Prudential
Securities Inc.; Kidder, Peabody & Co., Inc; Merrill Lynch & Co.;
Oppenheimer & Co Inc.; Dain Bosworth Inc.; Advest Inc.; Paine
Webber Inc.; and Crowell, Weedon & Co.

SUITOR CLAIMS TARGET BOARD
MADE FALSE STATEMENTS IN
PROXY AND 'ROADSHOW'

     Hostile suitor and proxy opponent Kidsco Inc. claims in a
suit filed Dec. 1 in federal court in Wilmington that the board
of target The Learning Co. has violated federal securities laws
by making false and misleading statements about Kidsco and its
proposal in a proxy solicitation and in "roadshow" presentations
to investors.  Kidsco Inc. et al. v. The Learning Co. et al.,
No. 95-733, (D DE).

     In July, The Learning Co. (TLC), a Delaware corporation that
produces and distributes educational personal computer software
products, agreed to merge with Broderbund Software, Inc., a
Delaware corporation that develops and distributes personal
computer software for home, school and small businesses.  Three
months later, SoftKey International, Inc. (SII), a producer of
children's educational software, launched a tender offer for TLC
through its subsidiary Kidsco Inc., and a proxy campaign to
replace the TLC board with nominees who would dismantle the
company's takeover defenses.

     The TLC board, which had signed no-shop and good-bye fee
agreements with Broderbund, declined to examine the SII offer but
secured a more favorable stock-swap exchange ratio from
Broderbund.  It told the shareholders that the synergy inherent
in a merger with Broderbund offered greater long-term value.
When SII began soliciting the backing of the minimum 10% of TLC
shareholders in order to demand a special meeting at which it
would attempt to depose the board, the TLC board amended the
company bylaws to the effect that SII's special meeting could not
be held until after the meeting at which the shareholders were to
vote on the Broderbund offer.

     Suits filed in Delaware Chancery Court by both SII and by
shareholders Ernest Hack and Irving Kas, which were consolidated,
charged that the directors breached their duty by failing to
consider the superior SII bid and asked the court to invalidate
the bylaw change.

     In the federal suit, Kidsco and SII charged that TLC
officers and directors violated federal securities laws by "false
and misleading statements denigrating SoftKey's business,
management and prospects in violation of Sections 14(a) and 14(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."

     In numerous "roadshow" presentations to investors, TLC
officials have supplied false and incomplete information on the
financial status of SII and on the prospects for a combined
SII/TLC entity, the suit claims.

     A proxy for an upcoming shareholder meeting leaves
shareholders unclear as to whether the board thinks it can vote
proxy cards sent in for a previous meeting that was canceled, the
suit asserts.

     SII is represented by Edward Welch and Andrew Turezyn of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Wilmington; by Jay
Kasner, George Zimmerman and Steven Kollney of that firm's New
York City office; and by Stephen Lamb of Law Offices of Stephen

SEC'S PA SUIT CLAIMS CABLE
DIRECTOR BOUGHT STOCK ON
INSIDE INFO ABOUT MERGER

     A federal lawsuit filed Dec. 6 in Philadelphia by the
Securities and Exchange Commission charges cable television
magnate Harold Lenfest with insider trading in connection with
the attempted merger of his company's parent corporation and Bell
Atlantic Corp.  Securities & Exchange Commission v. Lenfest and
Lenfest, No. 95-7597 (ED PA).

     The suit alleges that, as a director of Liberty Media Corp.,
Lenfest was warned against trading on or disclosing the
information that Liberty " which had recently been reacquired by
ex-parent Tele-Communications Inc. " would be part of a merger
with Bell Atlantic in 1993.  Nevertheless, he revealed the
information to his wife, Marguerite, who was also an officer of
Liberty, and she instructed her son Chase to buy stock in either
TCI or Liberty.

     Two days after Chase bought large blocks of TCI stock for
his mother and himself, Bell Atlantic announced the merger plan,
and TCI stock skyrocketed, the SEC claims.  On paper, the
Lenfests earned a profit of $120,750 on 35,000 shares.

     The SEC charges that both Harold and his wife violated both
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and their
fiduciary duty as officers of Liberty.  The suit also asks the
court to order the two to disgorge their profits and to pay civil
penalties.

     The SEC is represented by Thomas Newkirk, Associate Director
in Washington, DC, and Senior Trial Counsel Richard Levan in
Philadelphia.

     The Lenfests are represented by Richard Morvillo of Crowell
& Moring in Washington, DC.

DEFENDANTS IN MI CASE
SEEK PROTECTIVE ORDER,
NOTE DISAGREEMENTS

     The defendants in the Mutual Savings Bank Securities
Litigation moved the federal court in Detroit on Nov. 13 for a
protective order covering what they describe as "a small portion"
of the more than 25,000 pages of documents the defendants have
produced in response to the plaintiffs' requests.  In re Mutual
Savings Bank Securities Litigation, No. 95-CV-71590-DT (Judge
John Feikens) (ED MI, Southern Div.).

     The defendants " Mutual Savings Bank and co-defendants "
said the parties have worked on drafting a proposed protective
order but have run into two areas of disagreement.

     The first area, the defendants said, involves their request
that in addition to informing a nonparty (including an expert
witness) of the existence and nature of the protective order, any
such person to whom confidential documents are shown should be
required to sign a written undertaking to abide by the order.
The defendants said this will eliminate any later dispute
regarding whether a person was or was not informed of the
provisions of the order, and the act of signing an
acknowledgement should serve to reinforce the obligations imposed
by the order.

     The defendants said there is no reason for the plaintiffs'
opposition to the signed acknowledgement because the order
proposed by the defendants would not require the plaintiffs to
submit all the signed acknowledgements to defendants, i.e., the
plaintiffs would not be required to disclose the identity of
persons, such as potential expert witnesses, to whom they
provided any confidential material unless an issue arose
regarding misuse of the information.  The defendants said:  "The
requirement of the signed acknowledgement is a reasonable
prophylactic measure which imposes no material burden.  It should
be embodied in the protective order."

     The defendants said the second area of disagreement relates
to the protection that will be given information included in
confidential documents when that information is recounted in or
attached to a document filed with the court.  The defendants said
they recognize that there is a distinction between the
protections afforded to the fruits of discovery and to materials
filed with the court.  "Yet if plaintiffs can unilaterally file
confidential material in the public court file," the defendants
said, "any protection to which the information may be entitled
would be mooted."  The defendants said they request that the
plaintiffs provide reasonable advance notice of an intention to
file such material, thereby giving the defendants the chance to
seek relief from the court.  "If the requirement of advance
notice is burdensome," the defendants said, "an alternative would
be to permit the material to be filed under seal subject to the
producing party filing, within a specified short date, a motion
to retain the material under seal."

     In a Dec. 4 brief opposing the motion, the plaintiffs said
the requirements proposed by the defendants would impose
"unnecessary and undue burdens" on the plaintiffs in a situation
where the defendants have not even attempted to meet their
initial burden of establishing that such documents should be
treated as confidential.

     The defendants, the plaintiffs said, seek a provision that
would require all class members and non-parties (including
consultants and expert witnesses) to execute signed
acknowledgments that they have received the proposed protective
order, prior to reviewing any documents that the defendants may
have unilaterally designated as "confidential."

     "Contrary to Defendants' assertion that this requirement is
a reasonably prophylactic measure which imposes no material
burden on Plaintiffs," the court was told, "this provision
effectively 'chills' Plaintiffs' ability to pursue and obtain
relevant discovery by (i) potentially subjecting every person
shown a 'confidential' document to the jurisdiction of this court
through, vis-a-vis, their signed acknowledgement, and
(ii) imposing an additional burden on Plaintiffs to obtain,
maintain and produce, if required, all such acknowledgements."

     Similarly, the plaintiffs contended, they object to the
proposed provision that would require a party intending to file a
document unilaterally designed by defendants as "confidential" to
give four business days notice to the opposing party of intent to
file, and file such document under seal.  The plaintiffs said
case authority shows that a protective order that so restricts
public disclosure, prior to a court finding that the information
sought warrants protection, is a prior restraint on the First
Amendment right of expression.

     (Copies of the plaintiffs' opposition brief and the
defendants' motion for a protective order are available from
Andrew Document Access Service.)

     On Oct. 20, the parties stipulated that Count IV of the
complaint, alleging negligent misrepresentation, should be
dismissed without prejudice.

     The litigation was initiated by three shareholders in Mutual
Savings Bank, who allege that the bank and its co-defendants
concealed the risky nature of Mutual's investments, particularly
the interest rate-sensitive nature of investments in mortgage-
backed derivatives.  The plaintiffs claim the defendants also
misrepresented the success of the bank's new loan origination and
loan service business and that the defendants artificially
inflated the market price of the stock during the purported class
period " Nov. 30, 1993, through Nov. 14, 1994.  In addition, the
plaintiffs allege that certain of the defendant directors reaped
substantial profits from their sale of bank stock, based on their
private confidential negative information, not available to
members of the investing public.

     The defendants are represented by Allan Horwich, Eugene J.
Geekie Jr. and Adam C. Smedstad of Schiff Hardin & Waite in

Hills, MI.  The plaintiffs are represented by Elwood S. Simon and

PA CLAIM AGAINST QUAD HAS
MORE SUBSTANCE THAN U.S.
HEALTHCARE SUIT, CT. TOLD

     Citing a ruling by the same court in J/H Real Estate Inc. v.
Abramson, plaintiffs in a class action alleging securities
manipulation and fraud by Quad Systems Corp. and three of its
officers on Dec. 27 told the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia
that their claims are more specific than those the court refused
to dismiss in the suit against officers of U.S. Healthcare.
Pozzi v. Smith, No. 95-1454 (ED PA); see Corporate Officers &
Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995.

     Plaintiff Diane D. Pozzi purchased 1,000 shares of Quad in
February 1992 at $13.25 a share.  By March 8, the stock price had
fallen to $7.25, triggering the instant suit.  Quad,
headquartered in Warminster, PA, manufactures surface-mount
assembly equipment used to make printed circuit boards.  In
addition to the company, the complaint names Quad president and
CEO David Smith; David Young, a founder and member of the board;
and Anthony Drury, senior vice president and CFO.

     The complaint asserts that Quad officers misrepresented
company revenues and shielded the public from the fact that a new
product had developed problems and had not brought in expected
revenues.  Although company officials wrote a letter Jan. 30,
1995, notifying shareholders that the company was experiencing
"some software issues with regard to ease of use" of a main
product, it was not distributed until a later date, Pozzi
charged.

     In support of their original motion to dismiss, defendants
argued that the "bespeaks caution" doctrine adopted by the Third
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals compels dismissal because the
uncertainties of software development were adequately disclosed
by the company.  However, in his Dec. 1 opinion, the judge noted
that "even though Quad made certain cautionary statements about
software limitations and bugs (which it soft-pedalled by
describing them as not unusual), it was simultaneously hiding the
effect of those problems on the company's business."

     Defendants moved to reargue the decision, but plaintiffs
countered that the complaint in J/H Real Estate Inc. v. Abramson
et al. (see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995,
P. 18,687), in which a class has been certified and allegations
of negligent misrepresentation have survived motions to dismiss,
lacks the specificity contained in the charges against Quad, its
president, one of the company's founders and its chief financial
officer.

     Pozzi's allegations contain more detail than the complaint
sustained in Abramson, plaintiffs assert. The need for
individualized proof of reliance should not direct trial courts
toward denying class certification, plaintiffs argued, adding
several citations.  Defendants' efforts to induce the court to go
outside the pleading to analyze plaintiff's reliance is
inappropriate in the context of a motion to dismiss and factually
inaccurate, plaintiffs stated.

     On Jan. 31, 1995, plaintiffs stated, defendants conducted an
analysts' conference and misinformed them regarding any
significant functional problems with the company's software.  At
least one stockbroker reiterated its recommendation to buy Quad
stock based on that conference call, plaintiffs argued.  Pozzi's
testimony demonstrates that she relied on defendants' statements
made to the broker, plaintiffs argued.

     Defendants are represented by R. Nicholas Gimbel of the
Philadelphia firm of Klett Lieber Rooney & Schorling.

     Plaintiffs are represented by Dennis J. Johnson of
Havertown, PA, and by Barbara Podell of the Philadelphia firm of
Savett Frutkin Podell & Ryan.

RI BREACH OF DUTY CLAIM
AGAINST GENERAL PARTNERS
FAILS; DISCLOSURE ADEQUATE

     Finding that defendant general partners made all the
necessary disclosures to the limited partners, a state court
judge in Providence, RI, has rejected conversion and breach of
fiduciary duty claims by several limited partners against two
general partners who negotiated a sale of the partnership's only
asset.  Epstein et al. v. Dimeo et al., No. 94-2368 (RI Super.
Ct., Providence Cty.).

     In 1978, the plaintiffs bought a limited partnership unit in
a partnership that built, maintained and managed a housing
development.  In 1991, the general partners notified the limited
partners of a purchase offer.  Under the offer, the partnership
would receive payment partly in cash and partly in a 15-year
unsecured nonrecourse note; in addition, the general partners
would separately sell their management rights.

     It took two years, repeated solicitations to the limited
partners and modification of the offer before the general
partners obtained the consent of the required two-thirds of the
15 partnership units.

     The plaintiffs filed a Superior Court complaint alleging
breach of the partnership agreement, violation of the Rhode
Island Limited Partnership Act, breach of fiduciary duty,
conversion and unjust enrichment.

     A defense motion for summary judgment was granted.  First,
the court found no provision in the agreement or statute that
prohibited the general partners from accumulating the required
consents through repeated solicitations.

     Next, it found no breach of fiduciary duty because the
general partners fully disclosed all material facts regarding the
transaction.  The letters sent to the limited partners clearly
indicated how the proceeds of the sale were to be allocated.

     Third, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that
unanimous consent of the partnership units was required before
the nonrecourse note could be distributed.  Acceptance of the
nonrecourse note did not increase the limited partners' personal
liability, so unanimous approval was not necessary, the court
said.

MO COURT: PARTNERS CAN BE
SUED FOR INTERFERING WITH
BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS

     Two partners who made false financial-related statements
about their other partners and their corporation to banks can be
sued for intentional interference with the corporation's business
expectations, the Missouri Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5.  21
West Inc. et al. v. Meadowgreen Trails Inc. et al., No. 65978
(MO Ct. App.).

     In a unanimous decision, the panel said the defendants used
improper tactics to safeguard their own economic interests.

     The complex litigation involved Joe and Carol Layton, their
ex-partners John and Ann Gorse and several interlocking
corporations involved in land development and home construction.
Relations between the Laytons and the Gorses deteriorated,
including a dispute over who would be officers of Meadowgreen
Trails Inc., a development company of which each couple owned
50%; the Gorses prevailed.

     The Laytons and their corporation, 21 West, filed a petition
in equity to liquidate Meadowgreen and filed a notice of lis
pendens as to property owned by the company.  There also were
claims against the Gorses individually.

     The Laytons wrote to all financial institutions and banks in
the St. Louis phone book, objecting to any loans made to
Meadowgreen or to the Gorses on behalf of Meadowgreen.  At least
two banks had prior dealings with the company, and one bank cited
the Laytons' letter in denying a $475,000 loan to Meadowgreen.

     The Laytons and 21 West filed a petition in St. Louis County
Circuit Court alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, misappropriation of corporate funds,
intentional interference with business expectancies, liquidation
and other causes of action.  Meadowgreen and the Gorses
counterclaimed, alleging tortious interference and other causes
of action.

     After a bench trial, Judge Herbert Lasky awarded the Laytons
$1.582 million for their share of Meadowgreen.  At the same time,
he offset that award in full for what he assessed the Laytons as
owing Meadowgreen and the Gorses for intentional interference,
breach of fiduciary duty and trespass.  He also ordered the
Laytons to convey their interest in Meadowgreen to the
corporation.  Cross-appeals were filed.

     The Court of Appeals, Eastern District, modified slightly in
an opinion by Judge Gary Gaertner.

     The panel upheld the offset, saying the trial judge could
disregard the corporate entity where justice requires.  The
Laytons controlled and were sole shareholders, directors and
officers of one of the corporations that committed misconduct, it
said.  In addition, it cited an exception to the general
requirement for mutuality of parties in setoffs where there is no
prejudice and where a setoff discharges a judgment against a
nonmutual party.

     Next, it upheld the Laytons' liability for tortious
interference, finding sufficient evidence that their letters to
the banks contained factual misrepresentations about Meadowgreen
and that the Laytons used improper means to protect their
interest in Meadowgreen.  There also was enough evidence of
Meadowgreen's valid business expectancy, which the Laytons knew
about, and of damages, it held.

     The trial judge's decision was modified to make parts of the
award in favor of Meadowgreen rather than in favor of the Gorses
individually.

     On other issues, the court upheld the Laytons' liability for
breach of contract in connection with the sale of lots,
prejudgment interest and unjust enrichment.  The Laytons'
challenge to the award of contempt damages was dismissed because
there was no attempt to execute on that order.

     Counsel were Michael F. Roche and Thomas Cummings of St.
Louis for the Laytons and John L. Gianoulakis and Lori J. Baskins
of St. Louis for Meadowgreen.

NC JUDGE SAYS STATE COURT
SHOULD DECIDE DIRECTOR
LIABILITY FOR DEFAMATION

     A federal judge in North Carolina on Nov. 29 ruled that a
state court should hear a defamation and emotional distress suit
against Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) Inc., Rev. Pat
Robertson, the executive director of Christian Coalition and
corporate directors of CBN.  Peterson et al. v. Robertson et al.,
No. 6:95CV00450 (MD NC).

     The judge rejected a defense argument that one officer had
been fraudulently joined in an effort to avoid complete
diversity.

     Mark Peterson was hired as a supervisor in a CBN subsidiary
that sold discount coupon books, long-distance phone service,
vacation rentals and other consumer services.  He was promoted in
November 1991 by Robertson to president of the subsidiary,
American Benefits Plus, but was fired in December 1992 when the
directors became concerned about finances and customer
complaints.

     Critical comments about Peterson were made in an August 1993
press release from Robertson, in a September 1994 "Prime Time
Live" interview with Ralph Reed, executive director of
Robertson's Christian Coalition, and in a September 1994 letter
from CBN to "Prime Time Live"; the comments referred to
Peterson's business operations and alleged theft of donor lists
and documents for personal profit.

     A complaint was filed in state court against CBN, Reed, the
directors and Robertson, alleging defamation, emotional distress
and loss of consortium.  The defense removed the case to the
Middle District of North Carolina, asserting that director Paul
A. Holcombe Jr. was a North Carolina resident who had been
fraudulently joined as a defendant to defeat diversity.

     Judge James A. Beaty Jr. granted Peterson's motion to remand
to state court, finding a lack of complete diversity.  Holcombe
was not fraudulently joined, and it is possible for Peterson to
prevail against him on the merits in state court, the judge held.
Holcombe belonged to the board from September 1993 to March 1995
and can be held liable for corporate acts or breach of his
statutory duty during that period.

     The complaint adequately pled facts in support of Peterson's
defamation claim against Holcombe based on statements by Reed and
the letter from Robertson and CBN to "Prime Time Live," allegedly
authorized and ratified during Holcombe's tenure on the board,
Judge Beaty said.

     As for defense arguments that Holcombe is immune from suit
under Virginia law as a director of a tax-exempt corporation, the
judge found a material factual issue as to whether Holcombe was
compensated for his services and whether CBN is tax-exempt.

BANK OWNER WAS NOT
'UNJUSTLY ENRICHED,'
SUP. CT. RESPONDENT SAYS

     Robert D. Rapaport, a majority shareholder in Great Life
Savings Association, should not be liable under 12 U.S.C. Section
1818(b)(6)(A) for failing to honor the bank's net worth agreement
because the government produced no evidence that he was "unjustly
enriched" in the process, Rapaport argued in a Dec. 11 brief
opposing a U.S. Supreme Court certiorari petition filed last
month by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).  U.S. Dept. of
the Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision v. Rapaport, No. 95-
738 (U.S.) see Corporate Officers & Directors LR, Nov. 16, 1994.

     Rapaport had personally guaranteed Great Life's net worth by
signing a net worth maintenance agreement with OTS.  However, he
refused to pay the agreed-upon monies when the bank's funds
dropped below minimum federal levels.

     "[Section] 1818(b)(6)(A) requires evidence of unjust
enrichment " a personal benefit, something more than a failure to
make a monetary payment under contracts " as a prerequisite to
the recovery of money in an administrative proceeding," Rapaport
argued.

     In 1984, Great Life was seeking federal depositors
insurance.  The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which was later
succeeded by OTS, approved Great Life's application for insurance
with one caveat " Rapaport, who owned 70% of the bank's stock,
was required to guarantee the bank's net worth.

     The bank's net worth, however, dipped below minimum federal
levels and in 1989 the OTS notified Rapaport that he was
obligated to shore up the bank's weak financial condition.
Rapaport failed to make the requested payments and the following
year OTS filed an administrative proceeding to collect the money.

     In 1993, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found Rapaport
liable for violating the agreement.  The OTS acting director
affirmed the ALJ's decision, finding that Rapaport's failure to
honor the agreement had unjustly enriched him under Section
1818(b)(6)(A).  The acting director said that Rapaport had been
unjustly enriched by retaining the money he had promised to pay.

     The District of Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in
reversing the OTS decision, said that a definition of "unjust
enrichment" was limited to personal benefit under common law
torts.  Under this reading, the D.C. Circuit found that
Rapaport's failure to pay did not evidence that he had gained
personally.  The OTS filed for certiorari.

     "OTS cannot show unjust enrichment in this case, because
Respondent reaped no personal benefit," Rapaport's opposition
brief argues.  "If OTS has a remedy against Respondent, that
remedy lies in an Article III court, not in an administrative
forum.  To hold otherwise would be to give OTS an unfettered
power to engage in administrative enforcement, and that is a
power Congress never intended it to have."

     Rapaport is represented by Frank J. Eisenhart, Arthur W.
Leibold Jr., Julia J. Tyler and Neil R. Crowley of Dechert, Price
& Rhoads, Washington, DC.  The OTS is represented by Carolyn J.
Buck, Thomas J. Segal and Aaron B. Kahn, Washington, DC.

     An officer of an Oregon holding company, which owned a
securities dealer but did not sell securities, argued in a
Nov. 24 opening brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
that the National Association of Securities Dealers stretched
beyond its jurisdiction by sanctioning him for a snafu involving
a misdirected securities account deposit.  Alderman v. Securities
and Exchange Commission, No. 95-70609 (9th Cir.).

     "The use of NASD's power to sanction in this context exceeds
the power delegated to it by the Malone Act since it seeks to
impose sanctions over a person not engaged in the investment
banking or securities business for his alleged failure to act in
his corporate capacity with a non-member private corporation,"
according to the brief.

     Daniel Joseph Alderman, an officer and director of Portland-
based Peregrine Holdings Limited, focused his argument on
allegations that the NASD had trammelled on state corporations
law by imposing federal regulatory proceedings over a state-
chartered, non-NASD member private business.

     "The governance of internal corporate affairs [is] reserved
under the Constitution to state law," Alderman argued.
"Corporations such as Peregrine are creatures of state law and
the relationship created thereby are entrusted entirely to state
law....  As a result, state laws govern the internal affairs of
private corporations and federal law shall not intrude into those
internal affairs."

     According to the brief, this case stems from a check for
$3,193.23 that was mistakenly deposited into a Peregrine
corporate account instead of into the account of a Peregrine-
owned securities dealer, American Interstate Financial Corp.
(AIFC).  Peregrine discovered the mistake and issued a check for
the full amount to the AIFC customer.

     The NASD claimed that Alderman deliberately withheld payment
for two whole months.  Alderman said the NASD allegation was
unsupported.

     The deposit snafu eventually resulted in the filing of a
disciplinary action against Alderman by the District Business
Conduct Committee (DBCC) of the NASD.  In addition to being an
officer and director, Alderman was Peregrine's executive vice
president.  He was also a director of AIFC.  The DBCC found
Alderman to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.

    Article III states:  "A member, in the conduct of his
business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade."

               According to the brief, the DBCC censured Alderman and fined
him $3,000.  Alderman sought review of the decision by the NASD's
National Business Conduct Committee (NBCC), which affirmed the
DBCC.

     The $3,000 case found its way further up the appeals ladder
when Alderman asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
review the NBCC's finding.  The SEC affirmed.  Alderman appealed
to the Ninth Circuit.

      The brief, citing O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct.
2048, 2053, 129 L.Ed.2d 76 (1994), argued that state law " not
the NASD " governs Alderman's actions as a Peregrine officer.
Specifically, Alderman pointed out that ORS Chapter 60.371
allowed Peregrine to delegate day-to-day operations of the
company.  In this instance, responsibility for Peregrine's bank
accounts fell to a vice president for finance and not to
Alderman, the brief argued.

      "The standards to which directors are held are established
by state law," Alderman argued.  "A director must be diligent and
prudent in managing the corporation's affairs.  It is clearly
recognized that the Board's responsibility is limited to
overseeing the operation."

     Alderman is represented by Allan A. Fulsher of Portland, OR.
The SEC is represented by Randall W. Quinn, Senior Litigation
Counsel for the SEC in Washington, DC.

FINES TOTALING $258,000
LEVIED BY NASD AGAINST
WORTHEN RESPONDENTS

     The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)
announced Nov. 7 that it has assessed fines totaling $258,000
against Worthen Investments, Inc. of Little Rock and several of
its officers and registered representatives in connection with
the sale on bank premises of mutual funds containing risky,
derivative instruments.  Worthen Investments, Inc. and Related
Cases, Complaint No. C05950057 (NASD Dist. 5, New Orleans).

     Investors who bought the funds have filed suit against
Worthen and its new holding company, Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
The investors allege the mutual funds were falsely touted as
safe, government-guaranteed investments.  Many of the mutual fund
sales allegedly took place inside branches of Arkansas' Worthen
banks, which were acquired by Boatmen's earlier this year along
with Worthen Investments.

     NASD is the self-regulatory organization for The NASDAQ
Stock Market and the over-the-counter securities markets.

     NASD said that Worthen and all of the individual
respondents, without admitting or denying the allegations against
them, consented to the NASD disciplinary action taken by the
Association's New Orleans District Business Conduct Committee.

     The respondents, NASD said, consented to findings that they
made, or caused to have been made, misleading statements to their
customers about the characteristics and safety features of the
mutual fund investments at issue.  NASD said that in addition to
conducting many of the mutual fund sales on bank premises,
Worthen "failed and neglected to perform adequate due diligence
in connection with the promotion and sale of certain mutual fund
products."  NASD said that Worthen also failed to keep copies of
all customer correspondence and failed to establish and maintain
an adequate supervisory system.

     Worthen itself was censured and fined $200,000.  In
addition, NASD said, Worthen agreed to a number of additional
sanctions, including a promise to conduct a complete audit of all
internal policies and an agreement to form an investment
committee to meet regularly to review the methods used by Worthen
personnel to market all securities.  The committee is to
especially consider the suitability of sales literature to
promote the sale of the securities, NASD said.  The results of
the independent audit and investment committee reviews are
subject to NASD inspection.

     Among the individuals sanctioned were Patrick D. Miller,
Worthen's former president, and Frank M. McGibbony, Worthen's
executive vice president and former compliance officer.

     NASD said Miller agreed to a $10,000 fine, a five-year
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify in all
capacities.  NASD said Miller consented to findings that he bore
responsibility for misleading and inaccurate statements to public
customers.  Through written solicitations approved by Miller,
NASD said, at least seven registered Worthen representatives sent
misleading sales correspondence to public customers that
misstated the characteristics and safety features of mutual fund
investments.  Miller also failed to supervise employees who use
such correspondence, NASD said.

     NASD said McGibbony agreed to a $5,000 fine, a 30-day
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify as a
principal.  According to NASD, McGibbony consented to findings
that he approved certain items of misleading sales correspondence
that misstated the safety features of the mutual funds.  In
addition, NASD said, McGibbony failed to ensure that copies of
customer correspondence were properly maintained in the firm's
files and failed to establish an adequate supervisory system.

     Higher fines were levied against the seven representatives
who were sanctioned.  Jamai W. Weber was fined the highest
amount, $70,300, suspended in all capacities for three months,
and required to requalify in all capacities.  Altogether, the
seven representatives were fined $130,900.

     Five individuals employed by Worthen Bank & Trust Co., which
was the Worthen parent company, also were censured and fined.

     NASD said that Boatmen's cooperated fully with the
investigation "and promptly instituted new policies and
procedures at Worthen to assure compliance and to prevent future
violations."  (Boatmen's changed the name of the Worthen banks
but did not change the name of the investment company after
acquiring the Worthen enterprises.)

CONGRESS OVERRIDES VETO
OF RESTRICTIVE SECURITIES
LITIGATION LEGISLATION

     By a convincing margin, Congress overrode President Bill
Clinton's Dec. 19 veto of legislation restricting shareholders'
lawsuits alleging securities fraud " a bill generally condemned
by trial lawyers and praised by publicly held companies.  "The
Securities Litigation Reform Act," H.R. 1058.  (See Corporate
Officers & Directors LR, Dec. 20, 1995).

     H.R. 1058, The Securities Litigation Reform Act, makes
numerous changes that proponents say will cut down on frivolous
lawsuits.  For example, safe harbors for forward-looking
statements are strengthened, while damage awards for plaintiff
investors are tightened.

     Opponents of the Act, including trial lawyers, regulators
and consumer groups, say the legislation gives companies too much
"wiggle" room while, at the same time, increases risks for small
investors.  Under the Act, for example, companies are less liable
for their forward-looking statements and are under no duty to
make continuing projections.  These kinds of changes, however,
have generally been applauded by high-technology companies.

     The high-tech industry has complained that it is especially
hard hit by frivolous lawsuits because of the unavoidable
volatility of their stock prices.

     An entire section of the Act is reserved for "prevention of
abusive practices that forwent litigation."  The section includes
the elimination of bonus payments to named plaintiffs in class
actions, restrictions on professional plaintiffs, disclosure of
settlement terms to class members, and a prohibition against the
payment of referral fees by attorneys to brokers, dealers or
associated persons.

     The Act also contains a break for accountants, who are often
named as co-defendants, by providing steps to follow for
disclosing wrongdoing and by limiting their liability in fraud
cases.  The Act states, "No independent public accountant shall
be liable in a private action for any finding, conclusion, or
statement expressed in a report made pursuant to paragraph (3)
[Notice To Commission; Response to Failure to Notify] or (4)
[Report After Resignation]."

UZBEKISTAN WELCOMES FOREIGN INVESTORS

Uzbekistan has put in place a legal framework conducive to encouraging
foreign investment. Elena Kirillova of McKenna & Co, London summarises
the key aspects of Uzbek legislation which a potential investor will
need to consider.

Uzbekistan is at the crossroads of Central Asia and a landlocked
country completely surrounded by countries which are also landlocked.
Despite its geographical position, since independence in 1991 its
relative political and economic stability, coupled with the
government's encouragement of foreign investment has resulted in a
steady increase in interest from foreign investors.

The legal framework is a key factor in encouraging investment in an
emerging market. In Uzbekistan, legislation has been changing to adapt
to the post-Soviet market reforms.

The Law On Foreign Investments

Article 11 of the Law On Foreign Investment dated 5 May 1994 provides
for a legislative guarantee that where laws are passed adversely
affecting foreign investment, "the laws in force on the day of initial
investment shall be applicable to foreign investments for 10 years".
This provision does not apply to "defence, national security, social
disorder and environmental protection".

This is an ambiguous provision, which can be interpreted as meaning
that such protection can be granted for a period less than 10 years. In
practice, the government authorities in Uzbekistan are interpreting
this provision as applying for a 10 year period.

A foreign investor's rights are "protected by law". Article 7 of the
Law provides that such protection is to be on "no less favourable terms
than those accorded to local entities". However, foreign investments
may be subject to expropriation in the case of "national calamities,
accidents and epidemics".

Compensation "adequate for the damages suffered" will be paid, although
the method for calculating this is not determined by existing
legislation.

Financial regulations and tax

Article 13 of the Law contains guarantees allowing investors to
"transfer abroad profits ... earned from legally authorised activities,
without any restrictions".

However, profits earned locally will not automatically be convertible
into hard currency. Due to government policy and a shortage of hard
currency, converting any significant amounts of local currency is
extremely difficult. Investors' profits can be "reinvested ... or used
in any other manner at the proprietor's discretion".

Accounts may be opened in any currency although the use of foreign
currency is restricted. Cash payments are not allowed and there is a
15% tax on gains from foreign currency sales.

Goods and equipment imported for production purposes or the personal
needs of foreign employees are exempt from customs duties.

Companies which are more than 30% foreign owned and which specialise in
the agricultural, construction and consumer industries are entitled to
a two year holiday from income tax.

Companies included in the Priority Investment Programme are entitled to
a five year income tax holiday. Inclusion in the Priority Investment
Programme is a matter of discretion exercised by the Cabinet of
Ministers.

According to the Enterprise Tax Law of 22 December 1995, the basic rate
of profits tax for companies with less than 30% foreign capital is 37%
and 25% for companies with more than 30% foreign capital.

Exporters receive further benefits in the President's Edict of 18 June
1994 "On measures to stimulate the activity of enterprises towards
broadening of export potential". Under this Edict, income tax is
payable at half the standard rate where exports comprise 30% of a
company's total output.

Additionally, certain benefits are available against tax levied on hard
currency revenues earned from exports, where exports have increased.

Further, export tariffs are reduced by 50% where goods are exported for
hard currency.

The Law On Concessions

The Law On Foreign Investments provides for concessions to be granted
to foreign investors wishing to exploit natural resources. The Law On
Concessions was passed on 30 August 1995 and provides a general
framework for concessions.

Under this Law, concessions are awarded to a company upon winning a
tender organised by the state management bodies of the relevant
industry sector. Also, the Cabinet of Ministers may allow a concession
agreement to be negotiated without a tender. Concession agreements are
usually valid for 15 years, with the possibility of extensions by the
Cabinet of Ministers.

There are some contradictions within the Law On Concessions. For
example, authorisation to enter into a concession is granted
simultaneously by authorised state management bodies and local
management bodies. The Law does not state which has responsibility in
particular circumstances.

Article 8 provides that the Cabinet of Ministers can determine priority
areas of concessionary activity, although no such determination has yet
been made. The registration procedure for concessions has not been
determined, although the Law states that concessions come into effect
from the moment of registration. The taxation regime is also not yet
developed regarding concessions.

It is also not clear if a foreign investor who is party to a concession
agreement is required to form a legal entity in Uzbekistan. Moreover,
some activities permissible under a concession agreement will require
additional licensing.

Legal structures

One of the issues facing foreign investors is the choice of appropriate
legal structure in Uzbekistan.

- Representative offices

Investors who do not propose to undertake income producing activities
can set up an accredited representative office. This is effectively an
extension of the parent company and, as such, has no separate legal
personality.

The kind of activities which a representative office would normally
undertake include the negotiation of co-operation or licensing
agreements on behalf of the parent company, undertaking marketing and
promotional work and by holding an export licence or obtaining visas or
customs exemptions for the parent company and its employees.

Representative offices are not entitled to trade. However,
representative offices can become liable for payment of income tax
where the parent company receives income as a result of its activities
in Uzbekistan.

The parent company will be responsible for the debts and obligations of
its representative office.

- Legal Entities

Two types of corporate structure are commonly used by investors: the
joint stock company and the limited liability company. There are some
notable differences between these structures.

In the case of a joint stock company, the charter fund (share capital)
is divided into shares. Each shareholder is allocated a certain
percentage of these which have a nominal value ascribed to them in the
company's founding documents.

A joint stock company can be either open (where shares are freely
transferable) or closed (where shares are distributed among founders,
and any change in the identity or number of founders will require the
execution of a new founders agreement and the re-registration of the
company).

The Presidential Decree of 21 January 1994 provided that the Cabinet of
Ministers develop a Programme for the Intensification of the
Denationalisation and Privatisation Processes which included enacting
regulations for closed joint stock companies to be transferred to open
joint stock companies. This Edict reflects the presidential policy of
encouraging wide public ownership of shares.

In contrast, limited liability companies do not issue shares. Instead,
each member, or "participant", takes an "interest" in the charter fund.
An interest is akin to a share, with similar rights and obligations
attached. Subject to the terms of legislation and to the founding
documents, "interests" may be sold to other participants, to outside
third parties or they may be redeemed by the company.

The framework of management is also different between the two forms of
company. The minimum requirement for a limited liability company is a
general meeting of participants (to be held at least twice per year)
and a directorate or general director. This latter body acts as the
executive organ of the company with full power to carry out the
decisions of the general meeting and to oversee the day-to-day running
of the business.

A joint stock company is required to have both a general meeting and
directorate or general director as well as a supervisory board. The
specific powers allocated to each of the three organs of the company
and their inter-relationships are to some extent set out in the
relevant company legislation.

However, there is still a degree of uncertainty as to how the three
bodies work in practice and the division of their spheres of
responsibility. For example, the roles of the directorate, which
handles the daily business of the company and is responsible for
implementing executive policies, and the supervisory board, which
oversees the activities of the directorate, seem to overlap and
problems can arise in practice if the founding documents of the company
are not sufficiently specific.

Registration

Both entities must be registered with the Ministry of Justice. In
addition, joint stock companies must register all issues of shares with
the Ministry of Finance and the National Depository, which makes the
accreditation process for such companies more complex.

The initial charter fund for both types of company must be paid in full
within one year of state registration. Each participant in a limited
liability company must pay up 30% of its cash contribution prior to
registration. This requirement does not apply to joint stock companies.

All documents required for the registration of an enterprise in
Uzbekistan should be submitted initially to the Ministry of Justice and
should include a feasibility study of the proposed venture.

If the proposed entity will involve state property, a resolution of the
State Committee for Property and the Support of Entrepreneurship will
be necessary.

However, the accreditation of companies with assets in excess of US$20
million, and all enterprises with 100% foreign investment must also be
notified to the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Ministry of Justice cannot register the company without the prior
approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. In practice, all companies with
foreign investment will require such approval.

Where the investment contemplated is of significant size or of
strategic importance to the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Cabinet of
Ministers may issue a decree approving the investment.

The decree procedure may allow an investor to seek additional
exemptions or guarantees, not available in existing legislation.
Additionally, companies must register with the Ministry for Foreign
Economic Relations when engaged in "overseas economic activity".

Practical considerations

The choice of corporate structure and the availability of additional
exemptions and guarantees will depend on the perceived importance of
the potential foreign investment to the Republic of Uzbekistan. While
the government encourages foreign investment, negotiations can take a
long time, in what is still a developing legislative environment.

A company wishing to invest in Uzbekistan will need to come to grips
with a great body of legislative and regulatory provisions. Each
significant new investment is still something of a precedent for the
Republic of Uzbekistan and there will be aspects which are not properly
regulated in the existing framework, and matters where the legislation
will be silent.

It is thus likely that the enactment of project-specific decrees will
remain a necessary part of structuring foreign investment in Uzbekistan
in the immediate future.

Companies need to be prepared to take an innovative and pragmatic
approach to succeed in this potentially rewarding market.

COMING TO GRIPS WITH SLOVAKIA'S LANGUAGE LAWS

A law regulating the use of the Slovak language is now in force in
Slovakia. Strict implementation of its provisions could lead to
increased costs for some businesses. By John Loughey of Squire Sanders
& Dempsey, Phoenix.

The Act on the State Language of the Slovak Republic (the Language
Law), Act No. 270/1995, passed by the National Council of the Slovak
Republic on 15 November 1995 and signed into law by President Michel
Kovac on 25 November 1995, has generated considerable controversy in
its short life, primarily relating to concerns about the effect of the
new law on Slovakia's Hungarian speaking ethnic minority.

Much less attention has been paid to the effect of the new Language Law
in international business and commerce. Although, for the majority of
businesses, the Language Law is unlikely to have a significant impact,
it may require major adjustments for businesses in certain industries
in Slovakia.

The Language Law, effective since 1 January 1996, provides that Slovak
is the official language in the Slovak Republic and takes priority over
other languages used in the Slovak Republic. It provides that official
use of the Slovak language must be in conformity with the codified form
of the language to be promulgated by the Slovak Ministry of Culture.

The main intent of the Language Law is to require the use of Slovak as
the official language in all government functions.

Although the Language Law specifically states that it is not intended
to regulate the use of languages of national minorities and ethnic
groups, and indeed Premier Vladimir Meciar and his government have
pledged to promulgate regulations dealing with the use of minority
languages, the Language Law's provisions requiring the use of Slovak in
education and government proceedings and making Slovak language ability
a pre-condition for government employment have generated the most
controversy among ethnic minorities.

These provisions are unlikely to be of concern to most foreign
investors. Other provisions of the Language Law, however, may have a
direct effect on certain businesses in Slovakia.

Mass media, broadcasting and publishing

The Language Law will have a significant impact on those businesses
operating in the broadcasting and publishing fields.

It provides that Slovak is the official language to be used in all
radio and television broadcasting in Slovakia. Foreign language radio
and television broadcasting with subtitles in Slovak or "otherwise
satisfying the requirement of basic comprehensibility from the
standpoint of the official language" are permitted, as are broadcasts
of music in the official language, foreign language transmissions by
Slovak Radio intended for foreign countries, and television and radio
broadcasting for the purposes of teaching a foreign language or for
similar purposes. (Presumably, the BBC and similar broadcasters who
broadcast foreign language programming from within Slovakia will be
permitted to continue such broadcasts on the rationale that they are
intended to teach foreign languages.) Radio and television broadcasting
operators, announcers, moderators and editors must use Slovak in their
broadcasts.

The Language Law does not provide any guidelines as to how a broadcast
would "otherwise satisfy the requirement of basic comprehensibility".

However, the "basic comprehensibility" exceptions in the Language Law
were added by last minute amendments as a result of lobbying by Czech
language interests.

It appears, therefore, that the intention of the exceptions is to
permit Czech language broadcasts. The Slovak language is similar to
Czech and many broadcasters in Slovakia use Czech subtitles or dubbing
on other foreign language programming. This practice will apparently be
permitted under the Language Law.

If strictly enforced, however, the Language Law may still have a
drastic effect on television broadcasting and cable companies operating
from within Slovakia. A strict interpretation of the Language Law would
prohibit local cable operators from retransmitting on their cable
systems such popular foreign language satellite programming as the
English language CNN or the German language RTL Plus without Slovak or
Czech dubbing or subtitling.

In addition, Slovak broadcasters would be unable to broadcast
programming from such international services without dubbing or
subtitling. Given the cost and practical difficulties of dubbing or
subtitling, Slovak broadcasters and cable operators, if faced with
strict enforcement, are likely to discontinue such programming, thereby
reducing the range of choices available to Slovak viewers. (The Slovak
National Council is currently considering a bill that would apply
similar restrictions to video taped films distributed in Slovakia.
Provided Czech dubbing or subtitling is permitted for these films, the
practical effect of the proposed law is likely to be minimal, because
most major video taped films distributed in Slovakia are either
subtitled or dubbed in Czech or Slovak).

Further, programming for children up to the age of 12 must be dubbed in
Slovak. Subtitles are not permitted nor is Czech dubbing. As a result,
the range of children's programming available in Slovakia may be
reduced.

As with the broadcast industries, the print and publishing industry
will be affected by the Language Law, which provides that periodical
and non-periodical publications must be published in Slovak. The "basic
comprehensibility" exception does not apply to such publications.
Consequently, publishing companies may face the additional expense of
producing Slovak translations of publications when, in the past, they
have sold only the Czech translation in Slovakia.

Lectures, seminars and cultural events

Organisations that sponsor lectures, seminars or other educational,
training or cultural events will also be affected by the Language Law.
Such events must be held in Slovak or, if in another language, in a
manner in which the "basic comprehensibility from the standpoint of the
official language is satisfied".

Again, the Language Law provides no guidance as to what meets the
requirement of "basic comprehensibility". Presumably, however,
translations of foreign language presentations into Slovak should
satisfy this requirement in addition to presentations in Czech.

An exception is provided for touring foreign artists, cultural events
of national minorities and ethnic groups, and musical works in their
original language, provided such programs are first introduced in
Slovak. (Paradoxically, the Language Law would permit Slovak rock bands
to perform the music of an American rap group in English, but would ban
a Slovak based theatre group from performing Shakespeare in English).

Participants at lectures have the right to express themselves and
present speeches in Slovak. Printed materials for cultural events and
other special occasions, including programs for cinemas, theatres and
concerts must be issued in Slovak. They may, however, contain
translations in other languages.

If the Language Law is strictly enforced, those organisations that
sponsor seminars and lectures in Slovakia may face additional expenses
in these operations. These organisations may be required to provide
Slovak translators for any programs held in Slovakia, even if all
participants in the program are fluent in the foreign language in which
the program is conducted.

Contracts and similar documents

The Language Law will require several types of contracts and other
documents to be in Slovak that the parties might not otherwise execute
in Slovak.

All employment contracts and other agreements related to labour
relations must be in Slovak. This requirement would apply even in
employment contracts between a foreign-owned Slovak company and its
Slovak resident foreign employee if those contracts are entered into in
Slovakia.

All financial and technical documentation must be in Slovak. Although
the requirement prior to the Language Law was that financial statements
used for official purposes such as tax returns were to be prepared in
Slovak, other financial statements, such as those prepared according to
international accounting standards and used for international purposes,
were often prepared only in English and another foreign language.

The official language of court proceedings will, of course, be Slovak,
and non-Slovak speaking foreigners will continue to have a right to use
interpreters.

Of major significance to international business, however, is the new
requirement that, in any proceeding before public authorities
(including courts) relating to a contract, only the Slovak version of
the contract will be recognised.

It is common practice in international transactions for the contracts
to be prepared either in both a foreign language and in Slovak, with
the foreign language version controlling, or only in the foreign
language.

The Language Law mandates that the court must recognise only the Slovak
language version of the contract, despite any clear expression that the
intent of the parties is to the contrary.

This provision of the Language Law may lead to an increased use of
arbitration in international transactions in an effort to avoid the
application of this particular provision of the Language Law.

Product packaging and documentation

The Language Law requires that all information and documentation for
consumer goods, foods and medicines, including the listing of the
contents, instructions for their use, and warranty conditions, be in
Slovak. Presumably, this documentation may also be in other languages.

This particular provision would not be a major change from existing
practice for most (but not all) importers. Most importers provide
Slovak language documentation in order to reach the widest possible
market in Slovakia. This provision of the Language Law would, however,
prohibit the use of Czech documentation in place of Slovak language
documentation, as has sometimes been the practice for companies in
order to save the cost of translating materials into Slovak.

Computer software

The provisions of the Language Law relating to product documentation
may have a major impact on producers and distributors of computer
software, although the Language Law has no provisions expressly
applicable to computer software. According to Milan Ferko, the Director
of the Section of State Languages and Scripts of the Slovak Ministry of
Culture, (the ministry with responsibility for supervising compliance
with the Language Law), producers and distributors of computer software
must provide Slovak versions of computer programs. In addition, the
computer programs must permit the use of the Slovak alphabet. This
requirement may limit Slovakia's access to new programs when the
expense of developing a Slovak language version is deemed to be too
high by the software producer.

Advertising

Signs, advertisements and notices in stores, sporting arenas, cafes,
streets, airports, train stations and means of public transport must be
in Slovak. Other languages may be included, provided such other
languages follow the Slovak text and are not larger than the Slovak
text. The current practice of some advertisers of using slogans in a
foreign language only will no longer be permitted. This will require
advertising campaigns especially developed for the Slovak market.
Further, the Slovak language must be used even if the advertising is
directed solely to foreigners, as is commonly seen in advertising at
airports.

Penalties for violations

Although the Language Law came into effect on 1 January 1996, the
provisions of the Language Law relating to penalties for its violation
will not come into effect until 1 January 1997. After 1 January 1997,
the Ministry of Culture will have the authority to impose fines up to
SKK 250,000 (US$8,500) for most violations. For violations of the
provisions imposed upon broadcasters relating to children's programming
and local television and radio broadcasting, fines can be imposed up to
SKK 500,000.

Increasing the costs of business

Despite the controversy concerning the effect of the Law on minorities
in Slovakia, the Language Law will not have a significant impact on
most businesses.

In some instances, however, the new Language Law, if strictly enforced,
may increase the cost of doing business in Slovakia because of
requirements for translation into Slovak of documentation, broadcast
programming, lectures and presentations, advertising and, possibly,
computer software programs. Given the relatively small market of Slovak
speakers, some businesses may feel that the additional cost thus
imposed is unjustified and decide to forego the Slovak market as a
result. Other businesses might pass the increased cost on to Slovak
consumers. As with the effect of the law on minorities, the real impact
of the Language Law will depend on how it is implemented and enforced.

BULGARIA: NEW EXPORT RESTRICTIONS SET TO BE INTRODUCED

The government has issued new trade regulations containing revised
restrictions on the import and export of commodities.

The main features are as follows:

- export of the following products are banned until the end of this
year:- wheat, flour, cooking oil, oil-bearing crops and crops used for
animal feed. The ban on wheat exports is likely to create problems for
Bulgaria in its efforts to join the World Trade Organisation;

- new quotas have been set for duty free imports of wheat, flour,
maize, sunflower seeds and beef while there are no longer any quotas on
ice cream imports;

- imports of sausages and powdered milk must be registered;

- in accordance with its obligations under EU trade agreements, customs
duties on Bulgarian industrial goods to the EU will be abolished this
year. Textiles are, however, not included and will continue to attract
duties at least until 1997;

- the ban on the export of some metals (eg, zinc, aluminium and nickel)
will be replaced by export duties. Trade in metals with the EU is
subject to licensing requirements while scrap exports remain banned;
and

- EU quotas on the import of live sheep and live goats have been
increased.

MOLDOVA: DEVELOPMENT OF SECURITIES MARKET AND STOCK EXCHANGE

Integral to the success of Moldova's mass privatisation programme,
which has entered its second phase, is the development of a functioning
stock market.

The Moldova Stock Exchange (MSE) opened in May last year with five
listed companies. That number is expected to grow as privatised and
other qualifying companies seek listings.

A legislative framework has also emerged, although a number of
significant changes are in the pipeline. Preparation began with the May
1993 Law on Circulation of Securities and Stock Exchanges (as amended,
the Securities Law) which creates a basic framework of securities
market regulation. Recently ratified amendments to this law, along with
corresponding amendments (still awaiting passage) to the Law On Joint
Stock Companies (the JSC Law), reflect anticipated use by companies of
stock market mechanisms. A more comprehensive securities law is under
consideration, although its passage has been delayed by debate over the
establishment and operation of over-the-counter markets.

Scope of Securities Law

Securities are defined as instruments representing equity rights and
certain debt obligations, which usually provide the holder with
periodic or defined dividend or interest payments and are transferable.

Securities may exist in materialised or dematerialised (book-entry)
form, and may be issued in registered or bearer form. The exchange of
securities includes their purchase and sale and other activities
defined by law where a change of ownership is or may be effected (which
would embrace such instruments as options or futures contracts).

Securities registries must be maintained to reflect the issuance,
exchange and pledge of securities.

Competent securities issuers are joint stock companies, banks and state
bodies, although others may be designated by law. Subject to certain
regulatory requirements, foreign institutions and individuals may
participate in the market on a par with Moldovan entities.

Only specified domestic securities may be issued or circulate in the
Moldovan market under the Securities Law. These include shares and
bonds issued by joint stock companies, bonds issued by other types of
enterprises and such other securities designated by the SCSM.

Foreign-issued securities may also be allowed onto the Moldovan market,
although this is subject to a number of regulatory requirements
including authorisation from the National Bank of Moldova.

Other forms of securities include:

- government bonds;
- treasury or treasury-like bonds;
- bank certificates;
- promissory notes and bills of exchange;
- other documentary evidences of commercial obligation; and
- special MPP enterprise-specific securities.

The following are not debt security instruments:

- simple debt receipts;
- testamentary dispositions;
- lottery tickets; and
- insurance policies.

The issuance of state securities is regulated by the Ministry of
Finance and the NBM, and their exchange by the Securities Law. Some
bank-related securities, such as bills of exchange, may be under NBM
jurisdiction.

Chief among the Securities Law amendments is the creation of securities
registry systems. A registry must contain details of owners or nominal
holders of securities. Amendments to the JSC Law set out obligations of
joint stock companies in relation to the establishment and maintenance
of registries. Issuers may maintain their own registries or use the
services of an independent SCSM-licensed registrar. Nominal securities
holders, who must also be SCSM-registered, may also perform registry
functions. Securities transfers are valid only when all registration
requirements under the law have been completed.

Securities issuance

Securities issues must be registered with the SCSM and given a public
file number. Thirty days prior to registration of the issue, the
following documents must be submitted to the SCSM:

- the registration application describing security type, quantity and
face value;

- an extract from Ministry of Justice Enterprises Registry certifying
the issuer's existence;

- certified copies of the issuer's constituent documents;

- security specimens; and

- the issue prospectus.

The prospectus must be approved by the SCSM prior to distribution to
potential investors. The SCSM will review the prospectus, which must be
current to within three months of publication, and may require
additions or deletions to it.

A copy of the prospectus must be made available to each interested
investor. Any amendments made during the securities offering period
must approved by the SCSM and provided to investors holding prospectus
copies. During the initial offering period (which is not defined),
securities must be sold at face value. The SCSM may suspend or declare
invalid an issue in the event of a breach of legislation, false
information in the prospectus or a material change in the condition of
the issuer or issue terms and conditions. This decision is subject to
judicial review. The Securities Law sets out detailed reporting
requirements, which include keeping details of all corporate activities
and filing annual reports with the SCSM.

Securities exchange

Securities exchange activities may only be undertaken by persons
licensed by the SCSM. Banks and companies whose sole corporate activity
is securities dealing may apply for a trading licence from the SCSM.
They must be able to demonstrate professional competence in the
activities they wish to pursue and may not be more than 10% owned or
controlled by another SCSM licence holder.

A bank may engage in dealing for its own account only and may not deal
in securities of issuers which are bank customers or clients.

Recent amendments to the Securities Law and JSC Law concern large-scale
securities issues, the operation of independent registries, over-the-
counter trading and disclosure requirements.

A large-scale securities issue is one where the number of registered
securities holders exceeds 300 (individual shareholders of nominees
counting against the limit).

Open joint stock companies involved in such issues must register the
issue with the MSE. Issuers of such securities are obliged to contract
responsibility for issuance and exchange registration activities to an
SCSM-licensed independent registrar. Such a registrar is defined by
amendments to the JSC Law as a legal person whose sole corporate
activity is engaging in issuance and registry activities. An
independent registrar is precluded from transacting in client
securities or sub-contracting any of its clients' responsibilities.

OTC exchange activity in large scale securities issues by joint stock
companies must be performed by the SCSM licensed persons who must
report to the regulator the manner and volume of trades executed.
Disclosure requirements, which are still to be determined by the
government, will bind persons engaged in securities issuance and
dealing.

The stock exchange

The MSE is established as a closed joint stock company and is therefore
subject to the JSC Law in relation to internal corporate governance.

Stock exchange activities are subject to SCSM supervision.

Founders of the Moldova Stock Exchange, whose number shall not exceed
ten, must be SCSM-licensed market participants.

The founders must establish a general guaranty fund to which exchange
members must contribute. Assets of the fund may not be used to cover
the general debt obligations of an exchange member (except as
prescribed by exchange regulations) where membership is terminated
because of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise. The MSE has a priority
claim over the former member's guaranty share to satisfy obligations
associated with exchange activity.

MSE members must be SCSM-licensed market participants. They must
satisfy MSE regulations regarding financial and operational capacity
and agree to abide by the MSE charter and rules.

Members are not obliged to hold shares in the MSE. Membership may be
sold or voluntarily relinquished. The MSE may cancel a member's
licence, suspend its activities or revoke membership for failure to
abide by MSE regulations. Appeal lies with the SCSM.

MSE income is used to defray exchange operational expenses. Conflict of
interest provisions prohibit the holding of management or other
official positions in the MSE by persons holding shares in a MSE
member.

No MSE employee may also be employed by a securities issuer, including
government treasury bond issuers.

The MSE shall cease to exist by a vote of the general assembly of
shareholders, where membership falls below ten persons and within the
preceding six months no new members have been admitted, or upon SCSM
revocation of the MSE's licence.

Investor protection

Investors are protected against losses suffered as a result of false
information provided to them in the initial share offering -
presumably, only by reference to the issuer's published prospectus.

Where a licensed market participant knowingly certifies as true false
information on the issuer, the participant and the issuer shall be
liable to the investor. Investor remedies include compensation or,
where the investor files the claim within a month of the affected
securities purchase, revocation of the securities sales contract. As
regards initial share issues, the issuer and other market participants
involved in the transaction must maintain purchase monies received by
them in escrow until such time as they are satisfied that no violation
of the investor protection provisions is likely to occur. A person
purchasing 5% or more of a company's voting stock or increasing an
existing holding through voting share purchases by 5% or more, must
report such activity within five days of its occurrence to the SCSM.

Joint stock companies purchasing their own stock on the open market
must inform the SCSM within 15 days of the completed transaction.

As regards open market share buy-backs by joint stock companies, the
proposed amendments to the JSC Law requires the company charter to
specifically authorise such buy-backs as well as approval of the action
by the board of directors. The board may only approve the buy-back
where the company is unlikely to become insolvent or where the buy-back
would not provoke insolvency. Repurchased shares must be retired to
treasury. A company may not purchase shares in a primary issue. The
foregoing directives are not specifically provided for, but may be
deduced from current JSC Law read with the Securities Law and general
civil law principles of corporate governance.

Insider trading is prohibited to certain listed categories of persons
associated with an issuer, subject to an exception clause which
seriously undermines the prohibition's effect.

Persons having access to "official information" (an undefined term) of
an issuer, who are forbidden from engaging in insider trading activity,
are categorised as follows:

- "issuers authorities", a grouping which includes member of a
company's supervisory council or board of directors and administrative
personnel;

- officials engaged in auditing functions in connection with issuers or
the MSE;

- SCSM authorities or officials; and

- authorities and officials of the MSE and professional SCSM-licensed
market participants.

"Authorities" and "members" are not defined. Such persons and members
of their families may purchase securities of associated issuers
provided that they sell or transfer them within six months of purchase.
Banks issuing securities may not provide credit to investors in those
securities. It is prohibited to disseminate false information about an
issuer with a view to profiting from a resultant share price swing.

Investors suffering losses may bring a claim against the individual or
company disseminating the information by reference to as yet undrafted
legislation. Any pledge of securities must be recorded in the issuer's
share registry.

Securities watchdog

The SCSM is the main regulator with its mandate expanded under
Securities Law amendments giving it wider regulatory and investigatory
powers.

Recently added powers include:

- approving new MSE rules;

- investigative authority over activities by market participants with a
view to uncovering or pursuing suspected irregularities or illicit
behaviour, coupled with documentary and written deposition subpoena
powers; and

- certain proactive remedial powers.

Appeal from SCSM orders lies with the general and arbitral courts by
reference to the order's terms.

Transitional provisions

The government is directed to submit draft amendments to the JSC Law to
Parliament for approval and to bring regulations under the JSC Law and
Securities Law into compliance with the amended Laws.

As mentioned, amendments to the JSC Law are still under discussion.
Regulations are being updated to reflect recent changes to the
Securities Law and discussions on a second wholly redrafted securities
law are well advanced.

RUSSIA: REGISTRATION IN ST PETERSBURG

Russian companies with foreign investment located in St Petersburg
(including their branches and representative offices), as well as
branch offices of foreign companies, are now registered in the same
manner as most other local Russian commercial entities by the St
Petersburg Registration Chamber.

Under prior legislation, companies with foreign investment and branches
and representative offices of foreign companies were registered at a
separate registration chamber at the Committee of Foreign Relations of
the Mayor's Office (the CFR). Now only representative offices of
foreign legal entities need be CFR registered.

The new registration process has formally been in effect since the
publication on 25 July 1995 of the Order of the Mayor of St. Petersburg
Executive Organs in Relation to State Registration of Juridical
Entities as well as Physical Persons Engaged in Individual Commercial
Activities Not Having Formed a Juridical Entity in the Form of an
Individual Enterprise (Order 692-p), which attaches the new Regulation
of the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber. However, its provisions
were not implemented immediately and its interpretation by the
Registration Chamber and CFR became clear only recently.

Order 692-p establishes that the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber
has responsibility for registering and maintaining a unified registry
of all new and reorganised juridical entities in St. Petersburg
(including those with foreign investment) as well as branches and their
representative offices, including the branch offices (but not
representative offices) of foreign entities. Specifically included in
the competence of the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber is the right
to register all of the aforementioned entities as well as to confirm
either the amendments to the foundation documents or the liquidation
balance in case of the dissolution of any entities previously
registered by the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber or the CFR.

As to the timing of the registration process, previously, the CFR
reviewed the application documentation over a 21-day period in
accordance with the provisions of the Law on Foreign Investment in the
RSFSR of 4 July 1991 and the Regulations on the Order of Registration
of Enterprises with Foreign Investment on the Territory of St.
Petersburg as attached to Order of the Mayor of St. Petersburg no. 219-
p of 14 March 1994 On the Registration of Enterprises with Foreign
Investment which Order 692-p partially repeals.

Subsequently, the legality of this waiting period was brought into
question by Decree No. 1482 of the President of 8 July 1994 On the
Order of State Registration of the Subjects of Entrepreneurial Activity
(Decree 1482) which requires that the registration organ complete the
registration process no later than three days after submission of the
required documentation.

The wording of Order 692-p appears to ignore Decree 1482, by implicitly
granting to the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber the right to review
application documentation over a 21-day waiting period as well.
Experience since the publication of Order 692-p has been that in some
cases, where all documents have been in order, registrations have been
completed within several days following their submission. The
documentation required to register a Russian company with foreign
investment (including its branch and representative offices) or a
branch office of a foreign company remains unchanged, except for the
application letter, which must now be addressed to the St. Petersburg
Registration Chamber. Also, as before, companies having foreign
investment in the charter capital exceeding Rbs 100 million must
complete the registration process at the Registration Chamber of the
Ministry of Economics in Moscow.

PERSONAL LIABILITY
FOR ADA VIOLATION
REJECTED BY VA COURT

     An individual supervisor cannot be held personally liable
for personnel decisions under the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), a federal judge in Alexandria, VA, ruled on Dec. 17,
granting summary judgment in favor of a supervisor accused of
discriminatory remarks and behavior.  Stephens v. Kay Management
Co. Inc. et al., No. 95cv470-A (ED VA).

     The judge rejected the plaintiff's argument that the
supervisor qualified as an "employer" under the ADA because of
the supervisor's role as an agent of the employer who exercised
significant control over hiring, firing or conditions of
employment.  He said that the "agent" wording of the statute
merely incorporated the principles of respondeat superior, not
exposure to personal liability in discrimination cases.

     Plaintiff Marian Stephens worked in management positions for
Kay Management Co., a real estate management firm, from 1983
until 1993.  A 1992 stroke affected her ability to walk and climb
stairs but did not prevent her from those activities, which were
part of her job as a resident manager of an apartment complex in
Fairfax, VA.

     According to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia complaint, the property manager, Stephens'
supervisor, made comments about Stephens' "handicap" and refused
to allow Stephens to accompany her and a male employee on walking
tours of the property.  Stephens was terminated despite the
absence of prior performance complaints and without the warning
or counseling required by Kay Management's employment policies.
A person 20 years younger than Stephens was then hired to replace
her.

     The complaint named the company and property manager, Susan
Pool, as defendants.

     Judge Robert E. Payne granted the property manager's motion
for summary judgment by dismissing the complaint against her.

     There is no individual liability on a supervisor for
employment-related decisions of a plainly delegable nature, he
said, unless the supervisor also independently meets the ADA
definition of "employer."  He cited case law in which courts
reached a similar conclusion under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act and Title VII.

     In addition, Congress could have directly imposed new and
expansive liability for individuals in the statutory definition
of "employer," he said, rejecting the argument that Congress did
so by implication through ADA provisions regarding recoverable
compensatory and punitive damages.

     At the same time, he said, absolving the property manager of
personal liability does not encourage discrimination because of
the employer's respondeat superior liability.

     Candace S. McCall of Fairfax appeared for Stephens.  David
M. Estabrook of Gordon Estabrook & Yenas in McLean represented
the defendants.

11TH CIR. SAYS FAILURE
TO HIRE MAY HAVE VIOLATED
RIGHTS OF GAY WOMAN

     The withdrawal of an offer of employment by a Georgia state
agency to an openly homosexual candidate may have violated her
intimate association rights and her right of expressive
association, a divided 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled
on Dec. 20, vacating a lower court grant of summary judgment to
the defendant in the case.  Shahar v. Bowers, No. 93-9345
(11th Cir.).

     The majority concluded that the district court should apply
strict scrutiny to a review of whether the decision to withdraw
the job offer when the candidate announced her intention to
engage in a religious marriage ceremony with her partner was
"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest."

     Joy Shahar was offered and accepted a job with the
Department of Law of the State of Georgia.  Before she began
work, she announced her intention to engage in a marriage
ceremony with her female companion.  The attorney general of
Georgia learned of her plans and terminated the offer of
employment by letter in July 1991.  He stated that he could not
approve of "this purported marriage," as doing so would
"jeopardize the proper function of this office."

     Shahar filed suit in October 1991 against the AG under
42 U.S.C. Section 1983, alleging violation of her right of
intimate association, of her freedom of religion, and of equal
protection and substantive due process.  She claimed that
engaging in a religious ceremony recognized by the
Reconstructionist branch of Judaism, to which she adheres,
conferred upon her and her partner a religious-based status which
was separate from civil marriage in Georgia, which does not
recognize same-gender marriages.  The U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia entered summary judgment for the AG.

     The appeals court panel, in a majority opinion delivered by
Senior Judge John Godbold, concluded that the district court had
erred in applying a balancing test to determine whether Shahar's
right to intimate association had been violated.  However, the
court affirmed summary judgment for the AG on Shahar's free
expression and equal protection claims.

     Judge Godbold first emphasized that Shahar's intimate
association claim was based in a long-standing commitment to
religious principles; that she and her partner were active in
their synagogue; and that the couple had been counseled by a
rabbi prior to their marriage.  He stated that, while the
marriage between Shahar and her partner did not involve marriage
in a civil, legal sense, it was "inextricably entwined with
Shahar's exercise of her religious beliefs."  Therefore, that
intimate relationship was constitutionally protected, and
deserved strict scrutiny, not a balancing test review, he said.

     Next, the court remanded Shahar's expressive association
claim, on a finding that the district court erred in not
addressing the issue because of its overlap with her free
exercise claim, and the court's conclusion that the expressive
association claim required no greater constitutional protection
than her intimate association claim.  Judge Godbold noted that
the right of expressive association " the right to associate for
the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the
First Amendment, including religious expression " may be limited
by regulations which serve a compelling state interest.

     Senior Judge Lewis Morgan concurred in part, taking issue
with Judge Godbold's opinion that Shahar's association and equal
protection claims require strict scrutiny.  He stated that Shahar
had not presented an equal protection claim based on a
fundamental right of religious freedom.  In addition, the
evidence does not support an equal protection claim because the
job offer was not revoked because of Shahar's sexual orientation
but because the AG believed that she invoked the legal and civil
significance of being married to another female, which is
inconsistent with Georgia law.

     Judge Phyllis Kravitch concurred in part and dissented in
part.  She stated that, although she disagreed with the
majority's holding that strict scrutiny ought to be applied in
this case, applying a balancing test led her to conclude that the
emotional and religious bond between Shahar and her partner is
entitled to constitutional protection.  Although the "unique
status" of the AG's office made this a close case for Judge
Kravitch, Shahar's "constitutional interest in pursuing her
intimate association outweighed any threat to the efficient
operation of the Georgia Department of Law," she stated.

VA COURT SAYS SUPERVISOR
MAY BE PERSONALLY LIABLE
FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT

     A supervisor may be held personally liable for sexual
harassment in a Title VII case, a federal judge in Roanoke, VA,
has decided.  Frye v. Virginia Transformer Corp. et al.,
No. 95-0399-R (WD VA).

     The court concluded that a supervisor can be held liable for
sexual harassment where (1) the supervisor has a significant
degree of control over the employee and (2) the sexual harassment
is conducted by the supervisor for his own benefit and not for
that of his employer.

     Defendant Jeff Clark was one of Sarah Frye's supervisors at
Virginia Transformer Corp.  He allegedly sexually touched Frye
and made suggestive sexual comments; he also reportedly sexually
harassed other female and male employees.  Frye did not complain
personally to the company about Clark until company investigators
approached her after hearing rumors of the incidents.  She told
them she did not want Clark fired and would handle the situation
herself; she declined to provide a written statement and
resigned.

     The company continued its own investigation, reprimanding
Clark and requiring sexual harassment training for all
supervisors.  The decision to reprimand, rather than terminate,
was based on the fact that Clark denied the allegation; there
were no prior complaints against Clark; and Frye had asked that
Clark not be fired.  Frye was notified of the reprimand, but
refused several invitations to return to work at Virginia
Transformer.  Her request for post-traumatic stress workers'
compensation was denied, and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission issued a no-cause determination.

     Frye filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Virginia, alleging sexual harassment by Clark and
Virginia Transformer, assault and battery by Clark, and negligent
retention by Virginia Transformer.

     Chief Judge Jackson L. Kisor refused to dismiss the
Title VII claim against Clark but dismissed the negligent
retention cause of action against the company.

     First, Judge Kisor ruled an individual supervisor may be
liable under Title VII for sexual harassment conducted for the
supervisor's own benefit, not for the benefit of the employer.
In concluding that there are situations where a supervisor should
be held individually liable under Title VII, he differentiated
between an age discrimination suit where the discrimination is
"relatively benign" and a Title VII suit involving "more
egregious sexual harassment."  He also noted that Title VII's
"rationale of solicitude" for small businesses should be
inapplicable is cases such as this.  Therefore, Frye should be
given the opportunity to prove that Clark exercised the requisite
degree of supervisory control to warrant Title VII liability, he
said.

     Next, he let stand the Title VII claim against Virginia
Transformer, despite the company's arguments that (1) it was
unaware of Clark's misconduct; and (2) Clark harassed both male
and female employees, so his conduct was not "based on sex."
However, he dismissed the negligent retention claim, holding
that, although state law recognizes the tort of negligent hiring,
it does not recognize the tort of negligent retention:  "employer
liability in this analysis centers only on the decision to hire;
it goes no further once the employee is actually retained."

     Terry Neill Grimes of King, Fulghum, Snead, Nixon & Grimes
in Roanoke represented Frye.  Defense counsel were Clinton
Stephen Morse and Todd A. Leeson of Woods, Rogers & Hazlegrove in
Roanoke and Agnis Chandra Chakravorty of the Center for
Employment Law in Roanoke.

10TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS
SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR
K-MART IN HARASSMENT CASE

     An employee who claimed that K-Mart should be held liable
for her sexual harassment by a co-worker cannot avoid summary
judgment in favor of her employer because she failed to show that
the company knew about, but did nothing to remedy, the alleged
hostile workplace, the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has
held.  Ulrich v. K-Mart Corp., No. 94-3267 (10th Cir.).

     The panel affirmed the decision and reasoning of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Kansas, noting that, although
the alleged harasser had the title of "manager," there was no
evidence that he used any supervisory authority to facilitate his
sexual harassment of the employee.

     Terry Ulrich worked in the layaway department at K-Mart.
She worked regularly on inventory checks with Larry Denney, who
held the title of "loss prevention manager."  In August 1991,
Ulrich reported to K-Mart's personnel manager a number of
incidents of sexual harassment by Denney, who allegedly grabbed
her breasts and other areas of her anatomy, and kissed her
against her will.

     K-Mart responded to the report by instructing Denney in
writing to stay away from Ulrich during investigation of the
incidents, all of which took place within one week during July
1991.  Denney was later fired.
               Ulrich filed one charge with the state human rights
commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and
later filed a second charge claiming that K-Mart retaliated
against her for the first charge.  Ulrich said that her
assignment after her return from a leave of absence was a
"demotion."  K-Mart countered that the temporary assignment about
which Ulrich complained was not a demotion, as Ulrich continued
to receive the same rate of pay and benefits as she had prior to
her leave of absence.

     The complaint alleged sexual harassment and constructive
discharge/retaliation under Title VII and the Kansas Acts Against
Discrimination, assault and battery, negligent retention,
invasion of privacy, breach of duty to provide a harassment-free
workplace, and failure to properly hire and train.

     U.S. District Judge Monti Belot entered summary judgment in
favor of K-Mart.  He found that, although Denney's conduct
constituted hostile environment sexual harassment, K-Mart could
not be held liable.

     First, K-Mart was not liable for the harassment because
(1) the "grabbing, hugging and fondling" were not within Denney's
job description; (2) the employee handbook expressly stated that
sexual harassment was prohibited; and (3) the handbook definition
of sexual harassment covered Denney's conduct.

     Second, the court rejected Ulrich's contention that K-Mart
had actual or constructive notice of Denney's harassment of other
employees because he had been involved in three adulterous
affairs with female co-workers.  Judge Belot said that, even if
K-Mart had known about the affairs, the evidence clearly
indicated that the relationships were consensual.  The sexual
advances must be unwelcome to trigger a duty on the employer to
act to prevent them, he stated.  In addition, the company acted
promptly to remedy the situation with Ulrich, observed the judge.

     Third, the company cannot be held liable for the harassment
because Denney did not purport to be acting as K-Mart's agent at
the time of the misconduct.  While Denney held the title of
"manager" with respect to the store's surveillance and security,
he did not hire or fire anyone, did not discipline anyone and did
not control other employees' schedules or their wages.  More
importantly, Ulrich does not claim that Denney used any
supervisory authority to press his sexual harassment of Ulrich,
said the court.

     Turning to Ulrich's constructive discharge/retaliation
claims, Judge Belot said that Ulrich had failed to show that the
temporary assignment she was given after her return from a leave
of absence made her working conditions so intolerable that she
was forced to quit.  The court said it was the fact that Ulrich's
pay and benefits remained the same and not her subjective view of
the "atmosphere or dignity" of her employment which determined
whether Ulrich had been constructively discharged.  "A reasonable
person in Ulrich's position would not view having to perform the
duties of door greeter and checker for limited periods of time as
intolerable," said the judge.

     Finally, Ulrich's negligent retention and failure to
properly hire and train were rejected by the district court.  K-
Mart's personnel director testified that, until Ulrich herself
reported Denney's misconduct in August 1991, the company had no
knowledge of the problem, said Judge Belot.

CALIFORNIA JUDGE CLEARS
LOS ANGELES COUNCILMAN OF
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGES

     A California state court judge has rejected the claims of a
former secretary that her boss, a Los Angeles city councilman,
two of his employees and the city itself were responsible for
hostile environment and quid pro quo sexual harassment.  Beyda v.
City of Los Angeles et al., No. BC083850 (CA Super. Ct., Los
Angeles Cty.).

     In his Nov. 27 ruling, the judge stated that the
councilman's condominium, where some of the alleged harassment
took place, did not constitute a "workplace":  there was
insufficient evidence that the visits by the secretary were work-
related, or that the defendant had exerted "some kind of power"
over the plaintiff to get her to come to the apartment.

     According to Marlee Beyda's August 1993 complaint, she was
hired as Councilman Nate Holden's secretary in April 1991.
Shortly thereafter, she was allegedly subjected to sexual
harassment in the form of unwanted touching of her; forced
touching of Holden; forcible removal of her clothing; requests
for unwelcome sexual interaction as a condition of continued
employment; and sexually explicit conversations in her presence.
The harassment took place not only in the "sexually charged"
atmosphere of the office, but also in Holden's condominium, where
Holden tried to convince Beyda that she "owed" him sexual
activity after all he had done for her, she claimed.

     Beyda claimed that two of Holden's employees either joined
in the verbal harassment or cooperated in Holden's misconduct in
an attempt to get her " the only white female and/or Jewish
employee in Holden's office " to quit.  Beyda also said that
African-American males were given preference with respect to work
hours, assignments, trips out of the city and application of
office policies.  The harassment and the preferential treatment
of men constituted unlawful discrimination on the basis of
gender, race, ethnicity and religion, and forced her to quit her
job, she claimed.  She requested $1 million in damages on her
claims of discrimination, wrongful termination, breach of
contract, negligent supervision, assault, battery and invasion of
privacy.

     In her trial brief, Beyda argued not only that she was the
target of sexual harassment, but also that she was subjected to
harassment by having to witness the harassment of other female
co-workers.  Hostile environment can be found when a "supervisor
obtains sexual favors from subordinates other than the
complainant," she contended.  She urged the court to hold the
defendants liable for knowledge of Holden's harassment even
though she did not report each and every incident of misconduct.

     In their post-trial brief, the three individual defendants
argued that Beyda failed to meet her burden of showing that the
harassing conduct "altered her working conditions and created an
abusive working environment."  Beyda's working environment did
not extend to Holden's private residence, as she herself admitted
that she was not asked to work at the apartment and did not work
there, they argued.  In addition, Beyda could not support her
contention that she was, as were deputies, on call 24 hours per
day, and, therefore, that she was "working" at Holden's apartment
whenever she went there after normal office hours.

     Second, there was no evidence that Holden had the authority,
or misused that authority, to coerce Beyda to come to his home,
said the defendants.  However, even if the apartment were
considered an extension of the work environment, there was no
evidence that any sexual harassment occurred there.  For example,
Beyda never complained to anyone in authority about Holden's
treatment of her; she visited the apartment even after she
resigned; and her demeanor and performance at work did not
display any of the depression or other emotional distress of
which she complained, said the defendants.

     Third, Beyda did not establish the elements of a qui pro quo
harassment claim, argued the defendants.  Her attendance of work-
related events was not curtailed in any way, and she did not
demonstrate that Holden conditioned her "putting out" or having
sex of any kind on raises, promotions, pay, demotion, termination
or any other adverse job consequence.

     Beyda was represented by Dan Stormer of Hadsel & Stormer in
Pasadena and by J.L. O'Donnell of O'Donnell & Mandrell in Los
Angeles.  Counsel for the individual defendants were Louis Miller
and Michael O'Connor of Christensen, White, Miller, Fink, Jacobs,
Glaser & Shapiro in Los Angeles.

LEGAL SECRETARY CLAIMS
FORMER LAW FIRM LIABLE
FOR HARASSMENT, DEFAMATION

     A legal secretary has filed suit in California state court
against her former employer, alleging that she was sexually
harassed by one of the firm's partners, and that the rest of the
firm conspired to cover up the misconduct and force her out of
her job when she complained.  Van Sloten v. Chase, Rotchford,
Drukker & Bogust et al., No. BC139859 (CA Super. Ct., Los Angeles
Cty.).

     The complaint also contains claims for sexual battery,
defamation, negligence, breach of oral contract and wrongful
termination.

     Plaintiff Martha Van Sloten began working for the firm of
Chase, Rotchford, Drukker & Bogust in 1977 and, in 1978, was
assigned to work for firm partner Howard Slavin as his personal
secretary.  She says that Slavin made "offensive and off-color
sexual remarks" to her, including several requests for sexual
intercourse and descriptions of his sexual fantasies; touched her
in a sexual manner; and finally raped her in December 1992 and
December 1993.

     The rest of the firm knew about the incidents of sexual
harassment by Slavin, but took no action to remedy the situation,
claims Van Sloten.  This failure to stop the harassment amounted
to an "authorization and ratification" of Slavin's misconduct by
the officers and directors, says the complaint.  In addition, the
firm and Slavin conspired to increase the harassment in an
attempt to damage her health and force her to quit, says Van
Sloten.  Allowing Slavin to occupy "positions of trust and
authority at a time when they knew or should have known about his
improper conduct" amounted to negligence on the part of the firm,
she says.

     The basis of the defamation claim are false statements
allegedly made by the firm concerning Van Sloten's "inadequate"
job performance, again in an attempt to force her out of her job.
The defendants also breached their oral contract with Van Sloten
by failing to ensure that she worked in an environment free of
sexual harassment, says the complaint.  According to the
complaint, Van Sloten was terminated in violation of public
policy because her 16-year career with Chase Rotchford gave her
"the present ability to testify to facts which implicated
defendants Chase Rotchford and Slavin in acts which violated the
provisions of the state bar act...."

     Van Sloten has requested the award of double her lost
earnings as well as unspecified general damages for mental
distress, punitive and exemplary damages, an injunction against
the firm, an order that mandates sensitivity training and
publicly posted statements at the firm to inform employees that
sexual harassment violates state and federal law.

     The complaint was filed by David Smith Bates of Beverly
Hills.

8TH CIRCUIT THROWS OUT
$500,000 PUNITIVE AWARD IN
CREDIT CARD SNOOPING SUIT

     The Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 19 reversed
a punitive damage award of $500,000 to a former Amoco Oil Co.
employee who claimed that he was fired because of his age, and
that Amoco invaded his privacy by inspecting his credit card
records for days when he had called in sick.  Pulla v. Amoco Oil
Co., Nos. 94-4001 and 95-1047 (8th Cir.).

     The court concluded that, given the "limited offensiveness"
of Amoco's actions and the "unlikelihood of any serious potential
harm" from its conduct, the 250,000-to-1 ratio of punitive
damages to actual damages was "excessive, unreasonable and
violative of due process."

     The dispute began when Thaddeus Pulla, a 15-year Amoco
employee, was told that performance in the company's credit card
department was unsatisfactory.  He was demoted in July 1989, and
replaced by a 45-year-old female.  Pulla, who was 48, filed suit
under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), supporting
his claim with several ageist comments by his supervisor.

     Pulla later amended his complaint to allege that Amoco had
retaliated against him for the ADEA filing and had also violated
state tort law by invading his privacy.  The basis of the
invasion of privacy claim was the company's inspection of his
credit card records after one of Pulla's co-workers decided that
she was tired of covering Pulla's shift when he called in sick.
Pulla had missed two months of work in 1991.  The co-worker
discovered that Pulla had used his credit card at a number of
restaurants and bars on the days when he had called in sick, and
reported these findings to their mutual supervisor.

     The co-worker was admonished but not disciplined for
reviewing the credit card records, and Amoco subsequently
retrieved the information and made it a part of Pulla's personnel
records.  Finally, the supervisor referred to Pulla's absence
problem in his next evaluation, and singled him out for the
unique requirement of having to obtain a physician's note before
submitting any claims for sick leave.

     The jury found in favor of Amoco on the age discrimination
claims, but found in favor of Pulla on the invasion of privacy
claim.  The award was $1 for actual damages for past pain and
suffering and $1 actual damages for future pain and suffering.
However, the jury concluded that the company had acted "willfully
and wantonly" in violating Pulla's right to privacy and awarded
him $500,000 in punitive damages.

     The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa
rebuffed Amoco's motion for j.n.o.v., a new trial and remittitur.

     The appeals court panel, in an opinion by the Honorable
Byron White, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, sitting
by designation, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

     First, Justice White found no error in the district court's
conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to support the
jury's finding on the invasion of privacy claim.  Therefore, he
said, there was no abuse of discretion in denying in its entirety
Amoco's motion for a new trial.

     Next, there was no error in the district court's conclusion
that Pulla failed to present sufficient evidence to support his
breach of contract claim, i.e., that Amoco's employment policies
constituted an exception to Iowa's employment-at-will doctrine.
The evidence included:  (1) a progressive discipline policy which
managers "should follow"; (2) a merit employment policy that
managers "should follow"; (3) statements by Amoco that it will
"follow the law and maintain equal opportunity in employment";
and (4) statements that the workplace should be "friendly and
cooperative."  These were not sufficiently definite or mandatory
to constitute a binding contract, said the appeals court panel.

     Finally, Justice White addressed the issue of the
constitutionality of the punitive damages award, stating that the
U.S. Supreme Court has twice stated that the appropriate
framework to employ is a "general concern for reasonableness."
This concern "requires that the award be 'rational in light of
its purpose to punish what has occurred and to deter its
repetition,'" he stated.

     Based on this framework, the $500,000 punitive damages award
was unreasonable and violated Amoco's substantive due process
rights, said the panel.  The district court erred by
misperceiving the nature of the potential harm, said Justice
White.  Because Pulla did not present any evidence that the
company put any other individual's privacy at risk, the potential
harm from the search of his credit card records can be analyzed
only in terms of the very limited way it affected him.  The
appeals court contrasted Pulla's situation with one where a
manufacturer puts several thousand potentially dangerous products
" such as breast implants " into the marketplace.

     In addition, Amoco's conduct was not as offensive as
perceived by the district court because there was no indication
that the supervisor's conduct in retrieving Pulla's credit card
records reflected a company policy or practice.  There was no
evidence that this was anything more than an "isolated and rare"
incident, said Justice White.

DE COURT ENTERS
PARTIAL DISMISSAL OF
CLAIMS AGAINST DUPONT

     U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson has ruled that a group of
DuPont employees may proceed with some of their Age
Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Americans With
Disabilities Act (ADA), and Employee Retirement and Income
Security Act (ERISA) claims against their former employer, E.I.
DuPont de Nemours & Co.  Adkins et al. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours
& Co. et al., No. 95-315-SLR (D DE); see Employment LR, July 11,
1995.

     Ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss the ERISA and
pendent state law claims, Judge Robinson allowed the ERISA
wrongful discharge claims to remain, but dismissed those ERISA
claims which relied on allegations of fraud with respect to the
severance plan.  The state law claims were also dismissed.

     Court documents contained the following background
information:  A group of 180 DuPont employees filed a 12-count
purported class action suit against the company, alleging that
DuPont tried to force out older employees by instituting a cross-
training program and by reducing the workforce by almost half to
avoid paying full pension benefits.

     The complaint states that shortly after the company
instituted a High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) program, the
workers were threatened with termination if they did not comply
with its requirement that each employee learn how to perform each
job at the plant.  The employees also claim that older employees
were intimidated into leaving their jobs and accepting a
reduction in pension benefits.

     The employees also allege that the company refused to
accommodate the vision or physical impairments which those older
employees had, and instead intentionally placed them in jobs
which they were not able to perform.  The company violated the
ADA, says the workers, by creating only four ADA "slots," light
duty positions which were filled on the basis of seniority rather
than need.

     At the time that the HPWS program began, an enhanced
severance benefits program was also announced.  In contrast to
the DuPont early retirement plan, which provided for 100% of
pension benefits even though an employee may not have attained
the age or years of service generally needed for full retirement
benefits, the severance plan paid less than 100% of the pension
benefits, said the workers.  By coercing the older employees to
enter the severance program, DuPont was able to substantially
reduce its pension benefits obligations, says the complaint.

     In addition to alleging violations of the ADEA, ADA and
ERISA, the complaint alleged negligent misrepresentation, breach
of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, fraud and promissory
estoppel.

     Judge Robinson first ruled on the employees' ERISA claims,
holding that those portions of the claims charging DuPont with
having made false statements and misrepresentations regarding the
severance plan "relate to" an ERISA plan, and, therefore, are
preempted under 29 U.S.C. Section 1144(a).   However, while the
judge dismissed so much of those claims which allege fraud and
constructive fraud, she refused to dismiss the remainder of the
ERISA claims.

     Next, the court addressed the employees' contention that
DuPont breached its fiduciary duty with respect to its handling
of the severance and pension plans.  Judge Robinson dismissed
this claim because the plaintiffs were seeking only monetary
relief for an alleged breach of duty under ERISA.

     Third, the court allowed the claims of fraud and
constructive fraud to remain, provided that the employees amend
them to meet the requirements of FRCP 9(b).  The defendants
argued, and Judge Robinson agreed, that those claims were not
pleaded with sufficient particularity, and failed to show the
"nature and scope" of efforts to obtain the information needed to
plead with particularity.  The employees contended that details
were not available because "defendants are in a much better
position to know the details of the fraudulent conduct" and they
were not about to provide such information.

     Finally, Judge Robinson rejected the defendants' statute of
limitations argument with respect dismissal of the ERISA wrongful
termination claims.  She said that, although the one-year
Virginia limitations period applies to this claim, the
limitations period could be equitably tolled based on the
allegations of fraud in the complaint.

     The employees are represented by Robert Jacobs and Douglas
Canfield of Jacobs & Crumpler in Wilmington; by J. David Flowers
and James Rion of Ness Motley Loadholt Richardson & Poole in
Greensville, SC; by Gary Kendall and Denise Linsford of Michie
Hamlett Lowry Rasmussen & Tweel in Charlottesville, VA; and by
Kenneth Henley of Michie Hamlett's Bala Cynwyd, PA, office.

     Counsel for the defendants are Dupont corporate attorneys
Richard Paul and Catherine Thompson and Hill Wellford, Particia
Epps and Wood Lay of Hunton & Williams in Richmond.

6TH CIR. SEES NO ERROR
IN DENIAL OF DOCTOR'S
DISCRIMINATION CLAIM

     A unanimous panel of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
has found no basis to overturn a federal jury's verdict that a
Michigan cardiologist was not discriminated against on the basis
of his age or Mexican heritage.  Muzquiz v. W.A. Foote Memorial
Hospital, Nos. 94-1088, 94-1089 and 94-1420 (6th Cir.).

     The panel held that the dismissal of the doctor's antitrust,
breach of contract and other claims was based on a lack of
evidence or compelled by legal precedent.

     Moses Muzquiz is a medical doctor of Hispanic descent who
practiced cardiology in Texas and Mexico for many years prior to
establishing a practice in Michigan in 1985.  He became a member
of the provisional staff of W.A. Foote Memorial Hospital in 1989.
When Foote established a cardiac catheterization laboratory in
1991, Muzquiz applied for invasive cardiology privileges.
Muzquiz was the oldest member of Foote's staff to apply.

     The review of his credentials ran into some difficulty as
Muzquiz had performed cardiac catheterizations only in Mexico.
As a result, Foote's Credentials Committee had to rely on
translated patient charts obtained from a Mexican hospital.  The
requested films of catheterizations and the original charts were
not available.  The Credentials Committee recommended that
Muzquiz be granted provisional cardiac catheterization privileges
based on favorable evaluations of his first 10 cardiac
procedures.

     However, Foote's Medical Executive Committee rejected that
recommendation, opining that Muzquiz's time away from
catheterization procedures required that his first 25 procedures
be proctored.  Foote's Board of Trustees adopted the Medical
Executive Committee's recommendation on Jan. 22, 1992.

     Muzquiz subsequently objected to the 25-procedure
requirement, as well as to Foote's selection of proctors for his
procedures.  Muzquiz viewed the physicians selected by Foote as
direct competitors.  On March 17, 1992, Muzquiz formally rejected
the conditions placed on his provisional catheterization
privileges.  On March 25, 1992, Foote's Board of Trustees
withdrew the provisional grant of privileges to Muzquiz.

     Muzquiz filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan on Sept. 21, 1992, alleging violations of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Elliot-Larsen
Civil Rights Act.  Muzquiz's suit also advanced antitrust and
breach of contract claims that were dismissed by the district
court.  After two days of deliberation, a jury found that Muzquiz
had not been discriminated against on the basis of his age or
national origin, although it said that "[w]e would hope that
Foote Hospital and Muzquiz would go forward speedily to honor his
residence requirement of ten cases."

     Foote's post-judgment motion for attorneys' fees under the
Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) was denied by the
district court on March 24, 1994.

     Muzquiz appealed the district court's judgment.  Foote filed
a cross-appeal, as well as an appeal of the district court's
denial of attorneys' fees.

               The Sixth Circuit panel unanimously affirmed both the
verdict against Muzquiz and the denial of attorneys' fees.

     The panel said that the district court did not err in
refusing to allow Muzquiz to question witnesses in an attempt to
prove that Foote's credentialling process, while facially
neutral, had a disparate impact on protected groups under
Title VII.  The panel said that, at most, that line of
questioning would show bias against Muzquiz's medical training in
Mexico, but not bias against people of Mexican heritage.  The
panel also refused to assign error to the district court's
refusal to allow other testimony on the discrimination claim.
The panel said that this testimony either did not indicate a bias
based on Muzquiz's heritage or was "simply not probative of
discriminatory animus."

     Muzquiz's assertion that the district court erred in
dismissing his antitrust and breach of contract claims was also
rejected by the panel.  The panel followed the teaching in Nurse
Midwifery Assn. v. Hibbert, 918 F.2d 605 (6th Cir. 1990), that
"the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine prevents a finding of
conspiracy between a hospital and its medical staff...."  Absent
a conspiracy, there was no violation of Section 1 of the Sherman
Act, said the panel.  As to the breach of contract claim, the
panel agreed with the district court that judicial review of
staffing decisions by private hospitals is precluded by Sarin v.
Samaritan Health Center, 440 N.W.2d 80 (MI App. 1989).

     The panel also rejected Muzquiz's argument that the district
court placed undue limitations on pretrial discovery, noting that
the district court's "dismissal of [Muzquiz's] claims was based
on legal determinations that could not have been altered by any
further discovery."  In any event, the panel noted that Muzquiz
had never filed a motion to compel discovery.

     Finally, the panel said, "we conclude that Dr. Muzquiz's
claims were not without foundation so as to entitle [Foote] to an
award of attorney fees and costs under HCQIA."  The panel opined
that "Dr. Muzquiz had a legitimate factual basis for alleging
that the extreme delay in his application processing was the
result of a bias...."  Furthermore, the panel said that "[t]he
fact that several of his claims either lacked sufficient evidence
to go forward, or were determined to be precluded by legal
precedent in this circuit or under Michigan law, does not mean
that those claims were completely without foundation."

9TH CIRCUIT FINDS
EMPLOYER EAVESDROPPING
UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE

     An employer who conducts private surveillance on employees
and eavesdrops on the conversations of those it suspects are
involved in union-related activities has violated the Labor
Management Relations Act's (LMRA) prohibition against unfair
labor practices, said the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on
Dec. 1.  National Labor Relations Board v. Unbelievable, Inc.,
No. 93-70236 (9th Cir.).

     The panel ordered enforcement of the NLRB order on a finding
that the employer had wrongfully ejected union representatives
based on what was overheard and also violated the LMRA when it
unilaterally established new disciplinary rules with respect to
suspected drug users and refused to make pension contributions.

     Employer Unbelievable, Inc. does business as Frontier Hotel
and Casino in Las Vegas.  In February 1990, collective bargaining
between Frontier and the several unions which represent the
culinary workers, bartenders and restaurant employees who work
for Frontier broke down.  After the collective bargaining
agreement (CBA) expired, Frontier began to eavesdrop on employee
conversations and to eject union representatives for "harassing"
other employees.  The administrative law judge found that, while
ejection of union representatives is proper under some
circumstances, the several incidents cited by the union were
"unremarkable" and not a proper basis for ejection.

     As to the promulgation of new disciplinary rules, Frontier
argued that five of the new rules did not involve changes which
were "material, substantial or significant."  The ALJ and the
appeals court panel disagreed, citing in particular a new rule
which required employees suspected of being under the influence
of drugs or alcohol to undergo a medical examination or be
terminated immediately.  The old rules said nothing about an
examination, noted the panel, and this change could hardly be
considered "insubstantial."

     As to the pension contributions, the panel noted that,
during the negotiations over a new agreement, the provisions for
pension fund contributions were never at issue.  The court
rejected Frontier's contention that under the LMRA there must be
a written agreement with the employer before contributions to an
employee trust fund can be made. An employer has a duty to
refrain from unilaterally changing the terms of employment
without first bargaining, said the court.

     Here, Frontier was legally obligated to continue its
contributions to the pension fund after the expiration of the
CBA, and was in violation of the law when it did not give the
union prior notice or opportunity to bargain, said the panel.
Frontier also failed to present any evidence that changes in the
pension plan were reasonably comprehended in its proposals before
negotiations reached an impasse.  There had been no waiver by the
union of its right to bargain over the proposed pension plan
change, it added.

     The panel imposed sanctions against Frontier in the form of
attorneys' fees and double costs, as the company's appeal was
"frivolous," concluded the court.

     The NLRB was represented by NLRB attorney Frederick Havard
in Washington, DC.  Counsel for the union was Barry Jellison and
Michael Anderson of Cowell & Bowe in San Francisco.  James Meyers
of Meyers, Schultz & Wolds in San Francisco and Michael Taylor of
Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart in Washington, DC,
represented Unbelievable.

FL CITY ARGUES THAT
TOBACCO-USE HIRING
POLICY IS REASONABLE

     The U.S. Constitution does not forbid governments, when
making employment decisions, from taking into account the real
and substantial additional costs of employing tobacco users, the
City of North Miami argued in a response brief filed Dec. 4 with
the U.S. Supreme Court.  Kurtz v. City of North Miami, No. 95-545
(U.S.); see Employment LR, Nov. 28, 1995.

     The argument was made in a brief in response to a petition
from Arlene Kurtz for a writ of certiorari to a Florida Supreme
Court ruling that a regulation requiring a job applicant not to
have used tobacco for at least one year before applying for work
with the City of North Miami is not an intrusion of privacy
rights.

     The Florida Supreme Court held that Kurtz had no reasonable
expectation of privacy when she applied for a position with the
city and that the city, saying that it enacted the requirement to
reduce costs and bolster productivity, had established a
compelling interest.

     The city said that the only issue before the Florida Supreme
Court was a state law certified question of whether the Florida
constitution barred the city's employment policy.  Because the
only issue presented to the Florida Supreme Court was the state
law issue decided and certified by the state district court, the
Supreme Court should deny Kurtz's petition for certiorari, the
city said.

     Further, the city said, the state Supreme Court did not
"decide," as Kurtz asserted, a question of federal constitutional
law, and no question of due process.  Therefore, the issue is not
one that warrants Supreme Court review.

     Also, Kurtz's portrayal of the factual and procedural
predicates of the case were "profoundly inaccurate," the city
said, adding that it proved through undisputed evidence that the
policy was legitimate and rational, "while Kurtz proved nothing
at all."

     The city's response was submitted by Thomas M. Pflaum of
Micanopy, FL, and by Pedro P. Echarte Jr. of Miami.

CA CT. GRANTS JUDGMENT
FOR DEFENSE IN OFFICE
EMF EXPOSURE CASE

     Holding that the plaintiffs would be unable to submit causal
evidence associating electromagnetic field exposure to the
development of cancer in humans, a California Superior Court
judge on Dec. 8 granted defendant Southern California Edison's
(SCE) motion for summary judgment in a suit by office workers who
say they developed cancer due to the location of an SCE
transformer beneath their office.  Johsz et al. v. Koll Co. et
al., No. 726765 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.); see Employment LR,
Sept. 27, 1994.

     Orange County Superior Court Judge H. Warren Siegel said he
agreed with SCE's assertion that plaintiffs' proffered testimony
would not meet the Kelly-Frye admissibility test.  Such
testimony, which was to have been given at trial beginning on
Jan. 8, he said, failed to conclusively say EMF caused
plaintiffs' cancers.  The testimony expected from plaintiffs
experts Samuel Milham, M.D., M.P.H., and David Michael Ozonoff,
M.D., suggested only that "there is a causal association; that
based on statistics it 'may' be a cause," the judge ruled.

     The judge added, "Statistics may lend credence to an opinion
that EMF caused plaintiff's cancers, but there is no expert
opinion that it did in these cases and Ozonoff and Milham are the
only causation experts proposed by the plaintiffs on the EMF
issue."

     Co-defendants Koll Co. and Grubb & Ellis joined in the
utility's summary judgment motion.

     Plaintiffs Michael and Jill Johsz, James and Christianne
Nichols, and Mary Ann Stewart voluntarily dismissed with
prejudice their causes of action for battery and fraudulent
concealment and their request for punitive damages after SCE
moved for summary judgment on Nov. 7.  Plaintiff attorney Annee
Della Donna, who plans to file a motion for a new trial by early
January, says the ruling does not affect companion cases Younkin
v. Southern California Edison, in which a March settlement
conference is slated, or Muir v. Southern California Edison,
which is scheduled for trial on May 20, 1996.

     The plaintiffs discounted SCE's summary judgment motion
claim that the Kelly-Frye test is inapplicable, arguing that it
applies only to admissibility of "new scientific methods, devices
or techniques" in criminal cases.  They instead said that their
conclusions and opinions should be judged, and are shown
reliable, under the 35-year-old "Hill Criteria," developed in
England.  The Hill Criteria, they argued, include strength,
consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient,
plausibility, coherence, experiment and analogy.

     "Plaintiffs argue that the Kelly-Frye rule is not applicable
to the scientific principle of whether EMF causes cancer, but
rather is limited to novel scientific techniques, methods or
tests," SCE responded.  "In support of this argument, plaintiffs
cite several California decisions which have held that the Kelly-
Frye rule is not applicable to medical opinion testimony based on
an examination of a particular physical or psychological injury."

     The utility continues, "[H]owever, the cases cited by
plaintiffs on this point are inapposite in that the issue with
respect to Edison's motion for summary judgment is not the
admissibility of medical opinion testimony that EMF caused
plaintiffs' specific cancers, but rather the admissibility of
scientific evidence on the threshold issue of whether EMF causes
cancer generally.  This distinction is highlighted by the fact
that the expert declarations submitted to plaintiffs in
opposition to Edison's motion for summary judgment do not
indicate that either of the declarants have ever examined any of
the plaintiffs in this action, but rather base their opinions
solely upon scientific literature and epidemiologic studies
regarding the health effects of EMF."

     Opposing SCE's motion, the plaintiffs challenged the
qualifications of defense experts Philip Cole, M.D., Chairman of
the University of Alabama School of Public Health's Department of
Epidemiology, and Jack D. Sahl, M.S., M.P.H., Ph.D, an SCE
research scientist since 1983.  Both men, the plaintiffs argued,
"are so tied to the utility companies that their testimony is not
credible."

     The plaintiffs added, "These 'utility experts' are too
closely identified with the utility view to access fairly and
impartially the nature and extent of any opposing scientific
views....  Before 1992, neither Sahl or Cole conducted any
epidemiological research themselves.  Sahl published a study on
behalf of his employer, SCE, and expectedly reached a negative
result.  Cole's only epidemiological study was conducted in the
past year, even though both have held themselves out to the
public as epidemiologists for years."

     SCE replied, "In contrast to the declaration of Dr. Cole
[that there is no causal relationship between human cancer
development and EMF exposure], the declarations submitted by
plaintiffs are devoid of any reference to general acceptance
within the scientific community of the principle that EMF causes
cancer.  Rather than addressing the consensus of the scientific
community, Dr. Milham simply states that there are a number of
biological mechanisms by which EMF 'may' cause cancer, that EMF
'may' effect and compromise the immune system, and that, in his
opinion, EMF exposure promotes a number of cancers."

               The plaintiffs are represented by Della Donna and Wylie A.
Aitken of the Law Offices of Wylie A. Aitken in Santa Ana, CA.
SCE is represented by Duncan Barr and Joel C. Lamp of O'Connor,
Cohn, Dillon & Barr in San Francisco; Frank C. Rothrock and

CHLORINE PLANT WORKER
FAILS TO SHOW CO-WORKERS
WILLFULLY ENDANGERED HER

     A provision of the Alabama Workers' Compensation Act allows
an employee to bring a tort action against other employees for
injuries caused by willful misconduct, but a plaintiff who
alleged that her co-workers poisoned her by removing certain
safety devices from an area where she was exposed to mercury
fumes was unable to prove the necessary element of willfulness,
the Alabama Supreme Court has ruled.  Namislo v. Akzo Chemical
Co., No. CV-92-1127 (AL Sup. Ct.).

     Mary Namislo was employed in a chlorine manufacturing plant
was that was owned in succession by Stauffer Chemical Co.,
Chesebrough-Ponds and Akzo Chemical Co.  In 1992, she and her
husband, Ricky, sued Akzo on behalf of themselves and their
daughter, Amber, alleging that both she and Amber had suffered
mercury poisoning and that Ricky had suffered loss of consortium.
The suit named Akzo, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. and
several of Mary Namislo's co-workers.

     The complaint alleged that Akzo and the co-workers had
negligently and wantonly caused the mercury poisoning and had
negligently failed to warn that mercury created a dangerous
condition at the plant.  The suit also alleged fraud, outrage and
willful conduct.

     When the trial court dismissed all of the claims against
Akzo and the co-workers, the Namislos appealed to the Supreme
Court, which reversed and remanded on the grounds that the
Workers' Compensation Act does not exclude Akzo's liability to
nonemployees such as Amber.  The court ruled further that the act
does not bar Amber's claims against the co-workers on fraud,
outrage and willfulness nor does it bar the Namislos' claims
against the co-workers for Amber's medical expenses and the loss
of her services.

     On remand, the trial court again granted summary judgment
dismissing claims against Stauffer and Chesebrough-Ponds for
negligence and wantonness, against the co-workers for willful
conduct and outrage, and against all the defendants for
intentional fraud and intentional suppression of material facts.
               On this second appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the trial
court's judgment on all claims.  Namislo contended that the trial
court erred in dismissing the willful conduct claims because it
had incorrectly held that those claims were barred by the
Workers' Compensation Act's exclusivity provisions.

      Under the provisions of Section 25-5-11(b), the
occupational disease provision, an action against third parties
or co-employees is not a claim for workmen's compensation but is
a tort action for damages that is removed from the exclusive
remedy provisions of the act, the appellate court ruled.  That
section specifies that "if personal injury or death of an
employee results from the willful conduct, ...of any...employee
of the same employer...the employee shall have a cause of action
against the person...."

     The issue here was whether Namislo had offered substantial
evidence of willful conduct, and the Supreme Court found that she
did not.  She contended that the willful conduct was the removal
of safety devices from machines that otherwise would have
protected her from exposure to mercury.

     She alleged that her co-workers failed to maintain exhaust
fans and a scrubber in the "cell house," a structure in the plant
where the chlorine gas is produced, which she was required to
clean.  She also claimed that her co-employees provided the wrong
filters for a respirator that she used while performing the
cleaning.

     The Supreme Court ruled that the scrubber and exhaust fans
were not safety devices within the meaning of the Workers'
Compensation Act because they are part of the system to produce
chlorine gas, not to provide safety to workers.  In addition, the
court said, while co-employees may be held liable for the removal
or omission of a manufacturer's safety device from a machine "
such as the respirator Namislo used " nothing was removed or
omitted from the respirator and, therefore, it does not fall
within the purview of the act.

     The appellate court also affirmed the trial court's judgment
with regard to the remaining claims, finding no evidence "that
the defendants' actions in handling [Namislo's] claim were 'so
outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond
all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious
and utterly intolerable in a civilized society.'"  It quoted
American Road Service Co. v. Inmon, 394, So.2d [361] at 365 (AL
1980), and Nabors v. St. Paul Insurance Co., 489 So.2d 573 (AL
1986).

     Namislo was represented by Christopher E. Peters of Cherry,
Givens, Peters, Lockett & Diaz in Mobile, AL.  Akzo was
represented by Carroll H. Sullivan of Clark, Scott & Sullivan,
also in Mobile.

EMPLOYEE CANNOT BRING
PRODUCT LIABILITY CASE
AGAINST IBM, SAYS ND IL

     Judge Blanche M. Manning of the Northern District of
Illinois recently dismissed a repetitive stress injury suit
against International Business Machines Corp. on the basis that
the plaintiff, a former IBM employee, was statutorily barred from
pursuing a product liability action against her former employer.
McCall v. IBM Corp., No. 95-581 (ND IL).

     In dismissing the suit, Judge Manning found controlling the
decision in Toth v. Westinghouse Elevator Co., 114 Ill.App.3d
905, 449 N.E.2d 1005 (1983).  "That case holds that an employer
in Illinois who is also the manufacturer of a product used in the
course of employment is not liable in damages to his own employee
in a products liability suit," said Judge Manning.

     Judge Manning also cited the Illinois Workers' Compensation
Act.  That statute says, at 820 ILCS 305/5(a):

     No common law or statutory right to recover damages from the
     employer...for injury or death sustained by any employee
     while engaged in the line of his duty as such employee,
     other than the compensation herein provided, is available to
     any employee....

     Judge Manning rejected the plaintiff's assertion that her
case fell within the "dual capacity" exception to the exclusive
remedy provision laid out in Sharp v. Gallagher Tractor Co., 85
Ill.2d 322, 227 N.E.2d 786 (1983), and others.  "That doctrine
does not apply unless the manufacturer is a separate legal entity
from the employer, said the judge.  "There is no evidence that
IBM, as manufacturer, has a separate legal identity from that as
plaintiff's employer," she added.

     Emma McCall brought an action against IBM on Dec. 30, 1994,
in Cook County Circuit Court, alleging that she suffered
repetitive stress injuries from using an IBM keyboard while in
IBM's employ from 1989 until early 1993.  The matter was removed
to federal district court on Jan. 30, 1995.

     IBM moved to dismiss McCall's complaint, citing the
exclusive remedy provision of the Illinois Workers' Compensation
Act.  IBM asserted that under the Act, McCall could not bring a
product liability suit against her employer.

     In defending her action from dismissal, McCall cited, in
addition to IBM's role as her employer, IBM's "entirely separate
and distinct second role as a designer, manufacturer and seller
of computer keyboards."

     "The duties, responsibilities, and obligations of IBM
imposed by the tenets of product liability law generate
obligations upon IBM wholly unrelated and distinct from its role
as an employer," added McCall.

ELECTRONIC SUPERVISION: A NEW TECHNOLOGY RESULTING
IN NEW JOB TENSIONS

The capabilities of new computer and communication
technologies for monitoring employees' activities in
the workplace are presented.  Although useful for
managers to control resources, plan workloads, and
reduce costs, this technology results in added
tension and stress for employees, and raises
questions about fairness, privacy, and quality of
work life.  It's all discussed in this (Office of
Technology Assessment) report.

MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 mandate the
establishment of an identifiable office to provide
technical and other non-financial assistance to
small manufacturers of medical devices, to assist
them in complying with the requirements of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  The Division
of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) was
established to meet these requirements and to
sponsor workshops and conferences to provide small
firms with firsthand working knowledge of device
requirements and compliance policies.

This (FDA) manual covers the range of basic
regulatory requirements that all manufacturers must
consider when they begin marketing a medical device.
The publication is useful as a reference for
establishment registration, device listing, labeling
requirements, classification, premarket notification
(510k), premarket approval, and other topics of
significance to device manufacturers.

SAFETY WITH INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS

Factors which may contribute to the dangerous
misjudgements people can make when they work near
industrial robots are examined (by the University of
West Virginia).  Entrapment may be possible, even by
slow-moving robots, particularly for individuals who
work on programming and troubleshooting.  In 27 of
36 robot-related injuries in Sweden, the injured
person was involved in adjustment, repair, or
programming tasks having moving object hazards.  In
another study of 170 accidents, the following
3 motion control problems accounted for 145 of the
cases:

 (1) Sudden unprogrammed startup.

 (2) Robot or associated machines had not been
     stopped.

 (3) Uncontrolled movement.

BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS

Electric and magnetic fields produced by electric
power systems have recently been added to the list
of environmental agents that are a potential threat
to public health.

This (Carnegie-Mellon University) report describes
exposures to fields from power systems and other
sources, reviews existing scientific evidence on the
biological effects of these fields, presents a
history of research support and regulatory
activities, and discusses problems and alternatives
to regulatory action.

If exposure to fields turns out to pose a health
risk, it is unlikely that high voltage transmission
lines will be the only sources of concern.
Power-frequency fields are also produced by distribution
lines, wall wiring, appliances, and lighting
fixtures.  These non-transmission sources are much
more common than transmission lines, and could play
a far greater role than transmission lines in any
public health problem.

EFFECTS OF TRANSMISSION LINE FIELDS ON CATTLE

A 3-year study (by Oregon State University) deals
with the possible effects of a 500 kV dc
transmission line on cattle.  Two herds totaling 100
beef cows and 6 bulls were confined in pens beneath
the dc line, and in control pens 2000 ft from the
power line.  Management facilities were the same in
both the test and control pens.

The report describes the results in terms of
differences and similarities in the measurements
of study parameters.

without being bothered by all of the complex details
and procedural requirements?  This manual (prepared
by EPA in cooperation with Booz-Allen and Hamilton)
is a highly simplified orientation, with most of the
complexities of the Act removed.  It is designed for
those needing to know only the meaning, purpose, and
operation of the Act rather than the total details
and procedures.

UNCERTAINTIES IN QUANTITATIVE CANCER RISK ASSESSMENT

There are three major sources of uncertainties in
quantitative cancer risk assessment:

 (1) Low-dose extrapolation.

 (2) Route-to-route extrapolation.

 (3) Species-to-species extrapolation.

Scientific information and procedures useful for
reducing these and other uncertainties are presented
and discussed (by EPA). Two examples, one relating
to genotoxic carcinogens and another to promoting
agents, are presented to demonstrate the importance
of incorporating biologic information into the risk
assessment.
